1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 An invisible city, populated by shape shifters.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:11,040
 And a story so weird, you're just gonna have to take my word for it. Today on Dead Rava Radio.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:22,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rava Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,320
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. I have a busy weekend coming up.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,360
 I hope your weekends are equally busy and fun. So I'm recording this episode a little bit early,

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,480
 but it'll be released in the normal schedule. It's cold. It's like 11 o'clock at night here.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,560
 My window's open. It's actually time for me to start running a heater. That's neither here nor

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,600
 there because I want to go ahead and get started with this episode because again, it's going to be

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,640
 a weird one. So I mentioned earlier that I had finished watching Twin Peaks Season 3 and that

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,240
 kind of ties into our first story. So let me go over that just super quickly. I'm going to recommend

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,760
 it for people who are a fan of anything 40 and or weird. Now the first two seasons are a bit different

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,360
 than the third season. The first two seasons is a long kind of drawn out soap opera that has these

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,760
 creepy elements and they first it starts off, you think it's a murder mystery and then it involves

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,160
 stuff like demons and UFOs and portals to other dimensions and it really started to kind of freak

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,680
 people out. As a kid, I was always afraid of Twin Peaks, but I was also obsessed with it. It's really

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,840
 the the forerunner of all the shows like X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Killing. A lot

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,920
 of these shows wouldn't exist without Twin Peaks. It broke a lot of ground. Now when Twin Peaks Season

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,280
 3 was coming out, there was always the question of was it going to be the small town slice of life

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,640
 with a little dash of dimensional stuff or was it going to be balls to the wall weirdness?

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,480
 And it was balls to the wall weirdness. And the show's genius, the last episode ends of the second

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,720
 season with Agent Dale Cooper, FBI Agent Dale Cooper being trapped in another dimension and being told

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:13,520
 in 25 years he can leave and Season 3, I believe, starts, was filmed 25 years later. I don't know

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,000
 how they planned that. It could have been 20 years later, but it was close enough. And Season 3 is

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,240
 all about other dimensions, doppelgangers, demons, an invasion force like this interdimensional alien

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,960
 coming down. I'm not spoiling any of it really because there's tons of more stuff, maybe a little

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,800
 bit of spoiling, but it was amazing. It was absolutely amazing. And it actually had one of

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,680
 the things that creeps me out the most. And that is, and David Lynch is really good at this,

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,480
 making the normal horrifying. So there's a scene where, so there's two special Agent Dale Coopers.

29
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,000
 One is a doppelganger who is being piloted by a demon knowing as, knowing as killer Bob. And the

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,040
 other one is actually special Agent Dale Cooper. And there's a scene where the evil version,

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,800
 Mr. C, is what he's known as. He goes to a gas station in the middle of nowhere. And he walks

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,280
 up the stairs of like, he walks up the stairs of the gas station to the roof and he flickers and

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,280
 he disappears. And he ends up in this pocket dimension that's like an old hotel, which is,

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,720
 that's creepy to me because you drive past these places constantly. And I'm always afraid of those

35
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
 portals, those like the man from Torah type of things, where you just kind of walk in the wrong

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,320
 spot and you disappear from our reality. I don't necessarily think it's super likely, but I think

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,640
 it's possible, definitely. And so the show is full of stuff like that. At one point, a couple other

38
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,080
 FBI agents go to an abandoned lot. And then a couple sheriffs go to this meadow in the middle

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,520
 of the forest. And there's just these vortexes of activity. If you go to the right place or wrong

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,800
 place at a certain time, you will get thrust into these horrifying events. And that really plays a

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,880
 huge part in season three. Then when he's leaving the gas station, when he comes back down the stairs

42
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,160
 and he flickers back into our reality, we learn the gas station doesn't even exist. It's just a

43
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,200
 grove of trees. So imagine you're a civilian in this situation. You're just driving down the road

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,280
 to get to your house. You're driving through the wilderness. And you're just passing grove of trees.

45
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,440
 And you don't know that in that grove of trees, sometimes if you're there the right time,

46
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,280
 there will be a gas station. And if you walk up the stairs to the roof of that gas station,

47
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
 you will be thrust into this pocket dimension. I find that absolutely terrifying because it is the

48
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,080
 mundane turned into the terrifying. And that is where we're going to start our episode. And again,

49
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,040
 if I haven't made it clear enough, watch it. It's a great show. It's incredibly well done.

50
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,080
 And especially season three, I've wondered if you could hop into season three without having

51
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,960
 seen the first two seasons. I definitely recommend all of them. But if you just wanted to get like

52
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,760
 the super weirdness, you might be able to jump right in episode three. I mean, season three,

53
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,360
 I watched all three seasons and there's still stuff that doesn't make sense to me. So,

54
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,000
 but anyway, so we're going to talk about, I'm going to probably mispronounce it, but

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,200
 Beringin City. So Beringin City is basically a real life little gas station. Now what I mean by

56
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:22,320
 real life is that people say it exists. This is a city in the Philippines. And it's just in this

57
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,520
 mass of wilderness. And if you go at night, if you're in the right mental state, or you're attractive,

58
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,240
 you'll see the city. Now fishermen will be out fishing out in the Philippines and they'll look

59
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,920
 over and they'll just see a huge towers with lights on. It's been compared to Hong Kong,

60
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,240
 but it's not modern skyscraper. There are these huge, huge spires, these huge ancient buildings

61
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,640
 that have been built up. And you look over and you're fishing at night and you see this lighted

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,160
 city. Bus drivers have been driving at night, driving through the area, and then they lose time.

63
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,160
 And the next thing we know, they're in the middle of the forest or jungle, right where the city should

64
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,520
 be. When people go missing, when people, they say visitors come to the Philippines, come to that

65
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,560
 area, they go missing, the locals go out. They went to Beringin City. They got them. Sometimes

66
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,440
 they'll find bodies of people who have gone missing. And what's interesting about that is the locals

67
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:29,360
 go, that's not a body. That's a tree stump disguised as a body. His soul is in Beringin. So what is

68
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:37,600
 Beringin City? It's populated, again, in legend, it's populated by the Ing Kanto. What the Ing Kanto

69
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,880
 are is they are a race of shapeshifters. Now they can take any form that they want, but oddly

70
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,200
 enough, when they take human form, they're missing that little groove underneath their nose. You know

71
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,680
 how people have fetal alcohol syndrome, just kind of have a flat lip, something akin to that.

72
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,640
 They dress in all black and all their food is black. Interesting little side note. And they're

73
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,560
 considered neutral to evil, depending on the situation. They're considered, a lot of times

74
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,120
 they're considered demons in the area, but it's been told that if you are picked to go to Beringin

75
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,560
 City, you will be taken care of. You will mate with them and you will live this life of luxury

76
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,960
 in this amazing rich city. So a lot of times poor kids go missing and again people go,

77
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,560
 the kid must have went to Beringin City because look where he's at now. He's in a slum and now

78
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,880
 he's off someplace better. It's fascinating to me and this legend's persisted for centuries,

79
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,640
 really, that there is this city that people swear exists and to the point where when they find

80
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,480
 something that contradicts it, like if they go, well that guy must have gone to Beringin City and

81
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,960
 then they find his body a few days later, died of exposure or animal attack or whatever, they go,

82
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,320
 no, that's not really his body, that's a tree stump. It's magically, I don't know how they explain

83
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,320
 the autopsy. They're doing an autopsy to a bunch of butterflies come out. There's like a snail on

84
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,000
 them, I don't know, but it's just interesting. That's how pervasive this legend is. They say that

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,320
 in the neighboring cities around where Beringin City should be, and again, excuse me, I apologize

86
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,080
 if I'm mispronouncing it, I probably am, but in the neighboring cities there's portals. There'll be

87
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,960
 like a branch or an odd shaped rock or a particular inlet to a river and they go, don't go over there.

88
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,640
 Why not? Well, that's a portal that'll take you right to the city. That terrifies me, you know,

89
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,040
 because it's one of those things, like when you hear about missing people in national parks or you

90
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,840
 just hear like people just straight up vanish, of course your first thing is, oh, they probably fell

91
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,920
 or an animal got him or the guy came after something like that, but there's always that 0.01%

92
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,920
 that they're like, this guy just literally vanished. He disappeared off the face of the earth,

93
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:48,160
 and I think, what if there are these portals out there? And when we look at old legends like

94
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,080
 the legends of the Fae, when we look at modern day UFO abductions too, there are just these places

95
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,840
 where you go and you're taken away. The Philippines is far, far removed obviously from Scotland and

96
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:07,920
 Ireland, but it has the same myth and that is you can get tricked into entering to their realm.

97
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,720
 And like I said, they're neutral to evil. You can join them. You very rarely get to leave. People

98
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
 have seen the city and gotten to the outskirts. I think a couple people have said that they

99
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,400
 went into the city. That's how we have more detailed events. But for the most part, once you're in,

100
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,360
 you're in, you're not getting out and they use you to make. They look for like strapping young men

101
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,040
 and gorgeous women. They take them in to mate with them. Imagine, put aside all of your

102
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,400
 reservations about this idea if you have any to begin with. Imagine the impact if that was ever

103
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:51,040
 proven. Like imagine if one day Google Earth is running a satellite over the Philippines,

104
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,520
 or one night, and it picks up a spattering of light. And we send, they send in a like a team

105
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,200
 of explorers and they actually come out and they say, yeah, this city actually exists. You can only

106
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
 see it at a certain point in time and we only got so far and we encountered these creatures.

107
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,960
 What that would be far more devastating to the human psyche than UFOs exist. Like if UFOs came

108
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,520
 down, people would go like, yeah, I kind of figured that. Like it's creepy knowing that we're no longer

109
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:25,120
 the most advanced species in the galaxy. But imagine if it became proven that on this planet

110
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:35,520
 there is, there are portals to other worlds full of magical creatures. Like that you, that would

111
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,960
 shake everything up. I mean, how it would shake everything up. It would shake up everything from

112
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:48,320
 like travel exploration. It would shake up police because then they'd be like, well, the guy could

113
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,240
 have been kidnapped or he could have fallen into a portal and went to Zha Zha land. Like it would

114
00:10:52,240 --> 00:11:00,160
 completely change, change the way we looked at our own planet. We would have, you'd have travel guides

115
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,080
 saying, don't go to this place at a certain time of night because you will never come back.

116
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,120
 And then people, people would just say, you know what, honey, I'm out of here. Wait, no, no, come

117
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,160
 back. We have five kids war goes into a portal. I mean, you know what I mean? Like, and to me,

118
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,600
 see again, that's, that's terrifying. Ghosts are scary, but it kind of a little comforting because

119
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,320
 you know there's life after death. Aliens, I think are exciting if they're like, like, you know,

120
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,480
 running bombing raids and we're like rising up as a single species to take them down.

121
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,000
 But what if it's like, yeah, don't go out of your house today. There's a roaming portal in your

122
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,200
 neighborhood. Please stay inside. If you start to see any of your silverware like get sucked into a

123
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,000
 vortex, immediately call authorities. There is a portal in your house. Like that's way more

124
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,680
 terrifying because it's primal. It's this phenomenon that's just kind of happening. And again, people

125
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,080
 would go missing and you'd be like, well, maybe maybe they're in the portal. Don't go near those

126
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,520
 rocks. Don't go near. Damn it. Lost another one. Time to have another kid. I think that's far more

127
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:16,560
 terrifying. It would be one thing that I definitely wouldn't go looking for. There's a scene again in

128
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,440
 Twin Peaks Season 3 where a guy stands on a rock and gets electrocuted for like two minutes and

129
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,680
 just blows up. I don't want to go to that rock. I don't want to accidentally be like, hey, honey,

130
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,280
 where do you want to have a picnic? Oh, how about that rock? Again, that's, that's scary to me.

131
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,240
 This city full of these shape shifting creatures, stories of like the fairies, like taking people

132
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,720
 away into their realm. They walk, like dance in a circle or like, you know, they always say,

133
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,600
 never eat anything a fairy gives you because you'll never, you'll be sucked into their realm.

134
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,480
 How do I know? It's not some hot chick at a rave wearing fairy wings. I don't know. Spooky.

135
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,440
 Barrage in city. You guys might be brave enough to check it out, but not me. It's, oh, it's the

136
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,680
 reverse of Dublin, Wisconsin or Ong's hat. It's not a city that disappeared. It's a city that appears.

137
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,320
 Cities disappearing and dying are normal, but cities appearing and disappearing, then appearing

138
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,560
 again and disappearing. That's the definition of paranormal, of supernatural. It's something that

139
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,360
 doesn't belong in our reality. This next story is weird. And I'm not able to find the resources

140
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,280
 that I had on it, but not because of any sort of cover up. I kind of knew that was going to be

141
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,120
 the case when I started looking forward again, because it was hard to find in the first place.

142
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,440
 Now I got to tell you a little bit about myself. I used to be 10 toes into the conspiracy world.

143
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:49,280
 I used to believe everything. You getting me now as a skeptic is a sharp turn from where I was

144
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,760
 10, 10 years ago, maybe even less than that, maybe like six, seven years ago. I used to believe all

145
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,840
 of it. I used to be a 9/11 truther. I used to believe in the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

146
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:01,840
 the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

147
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:31,840
 the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the

148
00:14:31,840 --> 00:15:01,840
 the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the

149
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:31,840
 the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the

150
00:15:31,840 --> 00:16:01,840
 the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the

151
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:09,200
 behind it. It was an inside job. I was 100% a 9/11 truther. Absolutely believed in things. I didn't

152
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,920
 believe in the laser beams blowing up the buildings or the hologram planes, but I did believe in the

153
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,560
 explosions inside. I believed mostly that the George Bush let it happen. He knew that the planes

154
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,000
 were coming and he didn't do anything. So he could enact his great Christian plan to purge the Middle

155
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,680
 East of everyone who's not Jewish or Christian. Absolutely. I turned away from that because I

156
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,800
 kept, I was investigating it on 9/12, like a lot of people. And I was a big fan of info wars back in

157
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,560
 the day. It was the first time I'd ever seen anything like that. You're getting this immediate

158
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,480
 information. Felt for a hook line and sinker. And I investigated for years and years and years,

159
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,200
 and always the linchpin was building seven, building seven. And then I started seeing videos from the

160
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,720
 other side of building seven, the building that had no structural damage whatsoever. There's videos

161
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,480
 that show the other side of building seven, huge gash, huge gash in it from falling debris from

162
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,920
 the towers. And then the video where they show building seven falling like a controlled demolition.

163
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,000
 You may not know this. That's an edited video. They always show you the same video where it just

164
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,440
 pancakes down. There's videos out there that show the whole sequence of events. There's a

165
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,840
 small structure on top of building seven. And that collapses first, and then it starts collapsing.

166
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:34,080
 So that structure on top fell down, and that just the structural, it was the building already had a

167
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,440
 huge gash in it. And once that structure fell down, that was the straw that broke the camel's back,

168
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,240
 it collapsed. Whenever you see 9/11 Truth or Videos, they cut out the scene where the first

169
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,120
 structure falls down. And I've talked about this on another episode. I know the government lies to

170
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,400
 me. That's just what governments do. It's how they function. It's not good or bad, but that's how

171
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,480
 they function. I didn't expect the conspiracy theorists to lie to me, but once I realized that

172
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,320
 they were cherry picking their facts as well, I was like, well, they're not believable either.

173
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,400
 If they were saying everything hinges on building seven, and that was fake, then I went back with a

174
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,200
 more critical eye and looked at all this other footage and started to look at, yes, jet fuel

175
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,760
 doesn't melt still beams, but it weakens it. And all of this, all of these other facts, you know,

176
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,440
 before that I was like popular science, they don't know what they're talking about. No building has

177
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:33,200
 ever been brought down by fire. I am far more skeptical now than I was then. I attribute that

178
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,400
 to a couple different things. One is just looking into the facts more, having a more critical eye

179
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,000
 when I look at anything. This is going to sound funny. And this is a huge plug. My favorite podcast

180
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,160
 of all time, Parapod is a podcast with two British comedians. One believes everything, the other one

181
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,000
 is a skeptic, and it was interesting to see stuff that I believed in being with a skeptic,

182
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,080
 kind of pissing it away in such a funny, entertaining way. It also made me go, maybe I'm

183
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,280
 mistaken on some of these beliefs that I have. I'm not a proponent of someone who says you can

184
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,600
 never change your mind because my mind has been changed by facts. My mind has been,

185
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,120
 I've moved back and forth on the political scale. I've moved back and forth on all sorts of issues

186
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,200
 because the facts change or I get a new set of facts, or I've just grown as a person and don't

187
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,640
 feel the same way. So I wanted to do that introduction because like I said, I was totally deep into

188
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,720
 conspiracy theories. When back in 2010, I used to spend all my time researching this stuff,

189
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,760
 back in 2010, I came across the website that was titled something to the point of the plan

190
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,560
 to take over America. It was from a Norwegian group, some sort of paramilitary group based out of

191
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,560
 Norway, and they had a map of the United States and you could click on each individual state and

192
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,880
 some states were broken up into zones and it would tell you what the plan was, how they were going

193
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,040
 to conquer these areas. And I lived in California at the time and California was like 30% nuked,

194
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,120
 rest of the survivors rounded up into camps. And then I'm checking like Nevada and I'm checking

195
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,640
 Utah and they're like Utah, massive exposure to radiation, no survivors. And it was a very detailed

196
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,200
 map. And I'm reading this and I'm like, holy shit, I just stumbled across this thing. I don't even

197
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,240
 remember where I found it. I just like I said, used to spend all my time doing this stuff.

198
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,320
 And I started to share it. I started to share it with people. I'll back then I spent a lot of time

199
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,440
 on the website, GodlikeProductions, GLP, GodlikeProductions.com. It's a conspiracy website. They're

200
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,520
 complete nuts. And it was so funny to watch the follow up part after 2012, because again,

201
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,120
 like I said, I was pulling out of that I went back there about the week two and the week after 2012

202
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,560
 just to watch everyone freak out. But I shared it with some people on there. And I tried checking

203
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,960
 my Godlike Productions history, but I had changed accounts and there was nothing there. See if I

204
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,360
 could find the original link. The reason why the story is interesting. I remember this stuff very

205
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:13,200
 clearly. Around 2010, there was a comet you may remember, Elenin. Elenin was a comet that at the

206
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,160
 time in the conspiracy community, people were like, this is going to hit the planet. This is going to

207
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,080
 cause massive destruction. And it's going to the New World Order is planning. I believed all that

208
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:32,960
 stuff. All that stuff. Anyways, I still believe that there are private groups that want to enforce,

209
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,480
 put their rule on people at large, but I don't believe in like a single group now.

210
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,440
 But anyway, so the New World Order was planning all this and they're going to outlive the destruction

211
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,680
 and then anyone who was alive, they're going to take their slaves. Elenin was coming in and I was

212
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,240
 freaking out. I thought, oh my God, this comet's going to hit. It's going to destroy everything.

213
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,400
 And what was interesting was the plan to take over America, that website, a key component of it was

214
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,920
 Comet Elenin. So it was even feeding more into my paranoia. You would click on states and it would say

215
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,920
 this state will be wiped out due to the tidal waves by Comet Elenin. This state will be devastated

216
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,960
 by shock waves when Comet Elenin hits. Like it was all built into that. And so what the website

217
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:24,400
 was putting forward was after the comet, Elenin, hit us, this private army was going to then,

218
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,720
 their first thing was they were going to attack and then invade America. They saw that as the

219
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,000
 biggest threat. They saw that that after the comet hits, we would either rebuild the old world order

220
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,680
 or we could take out America and rebuild the New World Order. And I checked, I was looking at all

221
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,600
 these states and I was like, oh my God, like where's safe to go? Like obviously I couldn't, I didn't

222
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,480
 have, I couldn't go anywhere. But I was freaking out. I was actually talking to friends about it. I

223
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,440
 was like, what state do you live in? I mean, it was ridiculous. Like I was that level of doom guy.

224
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:06,080
 The interesting thing about it was that in the early summer, maybe around May or June of 2011,

225
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,320
 a message popped up. And I know you're thinking Jason, how do you remember all these details,

226
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,480
 but you can't even find the site? And fair enough, I'm not, I'm not making it up, but you have to

227
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,400
 take my word for it. If you don't take my word for it, that's fine. If you think I'm just making

228
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,560
 it up, that's totally fine. I'm not, but I would understand if you said, ah, he's just riffin'.

229
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:32,160
 Fair enough. It was around May or June of 2011 and the site got updated. And it said,

230
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:39,360
 warning, warning, Comet Ellenan is breaking up. May have been taken out by alien spacecraft.

231
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:50,960
 We will revisit the new plan in July. I was like, what? It's weird. So it was like they had to,

232
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,480
 they still wanted to go on with the plan, but the Comet was now breaking up. They had

233
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,880
 realized there was a structural integrity issue and the Comet wasn't going to impact the way

234
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,680
 they wanted it to or the way they thought they were going to. So Comet Ellenan is breaking up

235
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,480
 possible extraterrestrial intervention. We will come back to this plan in July and figure out what

236
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:30,480
 we're going to do. I was like, I'm paranoid still. July rolls around and July 22nd in Norway was one

237
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,440
 of the worst mass shootings. I personally think it's one of the worst mass shootings ever.

238
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,560
 And that was when that scumbag, Anders Brevik,

239
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:48,880
 went to a summer camp and it was shot a bunch of kids. And I remember reading in the newspaper

240
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,760
 how kids were like, it was on an island. First he dropped it, he set off a couple bombs in the

241
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:02,720
 capital also. Then he went to this island and he was shooting up this summer camp and kids jumped

242
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,600
 into the water and were trying to swim away and he shot him. Scumbag. And do you know because of the

243
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,360
 prison system over there, he's sitting in an apartment better than mine?

244
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,200
 He's in there for life, but

245
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:30,960
 anyways, Andrew Brevik shot 77 people. And the site, like I said, was a Norwegian.

246
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:41,680
 It was based in Norway, but it was all in English. And the shooting was also in Norway. So

247
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,520
 maybe like a couple days after that happened, the site got updated. I checked it regularly.

248
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,800
 It was terrified. And the website got updated and it said, listen, this was all a troll.

249
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,400
 This was all a joke. We have nothing to do with the shooting that happened in Norway.

250
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:07,360
 Our hearts are broken over it. This was all just a joke. We are going to just shut it down.

251
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,600
 None of this was serious. Our hearts and prayers go out to the people involved.

252
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,000
 So I thought, that's interesting. Like, okay, well, I mean, I guess I'm not paranoid anymore.

253
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 It was all a troll. The plan to take over America and the fact that the comet was going to hit and

254
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,760
 the reason why they were going to, it was very, very detailed. But again, you know, trolls can do

255
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,480
 that. Trolls can be very detailed. And so eventually the website, I just kind of was like, oh, it's

256
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:44,240
 a troll. I kind of stopped going there. A couple months later, same year 2011, August, September,

257
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,560
 comet Ellen and broke up in deep space.

258
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:57,920
 It fragmented. It fell apart. Just like the website said.

259
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,280
 I've never been able to figure out how they guessed that.
