1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 A simple sentencing turns into a bizarre crime.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,120
 And then we take a look at something that I always just kind of took for granted, but

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,600
 apparently has some serious ramifications for the human race.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,000
 Should we open a message we receive from extraterrestrials today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,760
 It's funny, so I've been hanging out with this girl recently.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,440
 She got...

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,520
 She made me draw a map of my apartment, which I thought maybe she's getting ready to rob

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
 me, but no, she made me draw a map of my apartment.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,800
 She's like, "Where do you keep your jewels?"

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,920
 And she's really into feng shui.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,240
 You know what, I'm willing to try any sort of nonsense.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,680
 Like, I'm not just gonna poo poo it out of hand.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,800
 Like I've tried acupuncture, I've done a lot of stuff.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,680
 I've done a lot of those like weirdo things, healing crystals and just, you know, 'cause

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
 why not?

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,400
 It's just some of my time, maybe a little bit of money.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
 No cult stuff, but you know what I mean?

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,000
 Just, I'm not gonna poo poo it out of hand.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,240
 Stuff when I talk about like Ormus, which I know is just toxic to begin with, I'm not

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,240
 gonna drink that, I'm not an idiot, but someone says, "Hey, you know, if you design your house

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,360
 or if you know like rearrange your house in a certain way, it'll increase your feng shui,

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,760
 give it a shot."

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,560
 What's interesting, I live in basically a box.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,000
 I live in a square, a shape department.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,440
 And she was drawn it out.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,120
 And I almost feel like the person who designed the apartment built it to be feng shui.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:53,760
 But where my recording studio is at is actually right in the grid of wealth and fame.

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
 Very, very interesting.

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,400
 Of course, I just, this is where my chair was when I would sit and eat Denison's chili

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,280
 and watch television all day long.

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,360
 Then I go, "Oh, I'm gonna build a recording studio here."

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,520
 But it's right there.

36
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,080
 But I've just been kind of cleaning stuff up.

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,720
 I took all my weight lifting equipment and I put it in where the health center is.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,960
 And I totally cleaned up the wealth part of my apartment.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,200
 It is part of my studio, but it was a total mess.

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,280
 It was just a bunch of toys and it was just a table full of bills.

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,480
 I was like, "Let's clean that area out.

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,000
 Let's clean it out and leave it with nothing.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,480
 It's basically just an extension of the studio."

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,120
 So we'll see how this goes.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,920
 I mean, obviously it's not tomorrow.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,680
 Britney Spears isn't gonna hit me up and be like, "Here's a million dollars and now

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
 you're my boyfriend.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,980
 You're super famous."

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,920
 One can only dream.

50
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,760
 But right now, yeah, I was like, "What harm is it?"

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
 Plus, it did get me to clean up.

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,680
 So yeah, I'll let you guys know and we'll keep doing this Feng Shui experiment.

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
 It's kind of cool.

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,040
 And again, it's costing me nothing.

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,600
 I'm just kind of moving stuff around.

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,120
 But anyways, let's go ahead and get started with the episode here.

57
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,160
 Now, the first story we're gonna cover, I just read about, I just got two pieces of information

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
 today.

59
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,800
 The story we're about to talk about.

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,480
 And John Singleton is dead?

61
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,320
 I didn't know that.

62
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,160
 I stumbled across that information and I was like, "Are you good?"

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,160
 I guess he died on the 29th.

64
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,960
 Oh man, Boys in the Hood.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,280
 If you haven't seen Boys in the Hood, you gotta watch it, man.

66
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
 It's a really good movie.

67
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,720
 It's one of, honestly, a lot of people quote like Ace Ventura.

68
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,080
 A lot of people quote Zoolander or Anchorman.

69
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,960
 I quote Boys in the Hood all the time.

70
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,880
 I got enough money to buy 100 balls.

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,040
 I'm not from Africa.

72
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
 You're from Africa.

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
 You African booty scratcher.

74
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,840
 That's not a really good line to quote in the wrong company.

75
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,960
 But you can say it.

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
 I'm not from Africa.

77
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,400
 I'm from Crenshaw Mafia.

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,360
 Yeah, be careful who you quoted around.

79
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,440
 But you might get beat up.

80
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,120
 But great film.

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,360
 I've seen that movie so many times.

82
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
 Ricky.

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,920
 I love that movie.

84
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,240
 Anyway, so sorry to hear that.

85
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
 John Singleton passed away.

86
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,360
 It wasn't the only movie he made, but I love that movie.

87
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
 So that sucked.

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
 I guess he was in a coma for a while.

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,520
 Anyways, I found out that piece of information today as well.

90
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
 But let's go back.

91
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,840
 We're not going to cover that on the episode any more than I already did.

92
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,120
 But give me the goddamn gun.

93
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,920
 Such a good movie.

94
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,600
 Such a good movie.

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,880
 Ice cubes driving in the car.

96
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,120
 Oh, that drive vicing.

97
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
 Both of them.

98
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
 Such a good movie.

99
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,760
 Anyways, let's go ahead and get started in the times we get started with the episode.

100
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,240
 We're going to go ahead and take a trip.

101
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:41,640
 You and me, we're going to Merry Old England, the land of Protestants and disgusting food.

102
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,400
 And we're in England.

103
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,240
 I boiled down their entire history to those two things.

104
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,880
 We're in England and we're sitting in a court trial and you're sitting there and you're

105
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,200
 going, this is kind of a, there's not a murder trial.

106
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,560
 This is a trial for passing bad checks.

107
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
 Why are we here, Jason?

108
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
 I'm like, I don't know.

109
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,080
 So there's this guy named Mark Marshall.

110
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,200
 He's 54 years old.

111
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,400
 We're seeing him sitting there.

112
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,000
 He's awaiting sentencing and his crime was quite simple.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,240
 He was writing bad checks to photography companies, getting the equipment and then trying to sell

114
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,680
 it to something called cash converters, which is kind of like a, just like you're selling

115
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,880
 used goods, kind of like a pawn shop, but you don't get it back.

116
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,520
 He did this for 70,000 pounds worth.

117
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,560
 There's a lot of equipment to carry.

118
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,720
 And so he was in court and he's getting sent this for this.

119
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,360
 And you're like, this is kind of like a mild crime.

120
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,160
 You're really covering this on Dead Rabbit Radio.

121
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
 This is just like a theft crime.

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
 And I'm like, don't interrupt.

123
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,320
 Don't interrupt the judge.

124
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
 And the judge is sitting there.

125
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,560
 This just happened a couple of days ago.

126
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,560
 The judge is sitting there and she says, okay, here's what your sentence is going to be.

127
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
 And the guy starts to get agitated.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,440
 And you're like, uh-oh.

129
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,880
 And she goes, here's what your sentence is going to be.

130
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,960
 You're going to be sentenced to two years and four, and before she can finish it, you

131
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,400
 hear Mark begin wailing.

132
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,920
 And now people often cry during court, because you know, they're getting sent to it.

133
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,560
 It's not, a lot of people cry during court.

134
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,480
 It's not a good place to be.

135
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
 But you thank two years.

136
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,040
 Like the other day when I said I could do three years in prison standing on my head, I let

137
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
 me be more specific.

138
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,400
 I could do three years in an Oregon prison standing on my head.

139
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,160
 That's probably, I think you probably could as long as you stayed to yourself, didn't

140
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,920
 cause any trouble, didn't get involved in any gangs.

141
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
 It sucks.

142
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,160
 But if someone sentenced you to three years, you could be like, ugh.

143
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,560
 But anyway, so this guy, he's saying, the judge is saying you're going to get sentenced

144
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,520
 to two years and four, and before she can finish the sentence for this simple financial crime.

145
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,000
 He begins wailing and screaming.

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,160
 And that's when you notice that his entire face is gone white.

147
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,040
 And you're thinking, oh, he must really be fearful of prison.

148
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,760
 And then you start to see like little wafs of smoke lift off of his face.

149
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,840
 What had happened was before she was even done sentencing him, he had a metal, like water

150
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,760
 jug, a little metal water bottle, full of acid.

151
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,400
 And as she was saying what he was going to get, he poured acid all over his own face.

152
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,520
 And as he began melting.

153
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,680
 Someone sitting in trial said it looked like his face was covered in glue because it was

154
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,320
 just white because the skin was bubbling off.

155
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,120
 They think he drank some of it.

156
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,720
 They immediately began throwing water on him, which you're not supposed to actually put

157
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
 water.

158
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,560
 You can put it on some acids, but some acids it makes it worse.

159
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,800
 But you don't know what you're in shock.

160
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,640
 You just see a guy melting in front of you.

161
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,960
 What else are you going to do?

162
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,040
 Get a bucket?

163
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,760
 So they call the fire brigade.

164
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,240
 There was a woman standing next to him who was guarding him.

165
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,720
 She got a little bit of acid on her, but she's fine.

166
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,240
 He's in critical condition, obviously.

167
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
 So yeah, bizarre.

168
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
 Bizarre.

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,680
 That's it.

170
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,520
 That is what is known as an overreaction.

171
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
 That is an absolute overreaction.

172
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,920
 And then you think maybe he just really didn't like jail and didn't want to go to jail for

173
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,160
 two, two and a half years.

174
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,320
 It was two years and four months was his full sentence.

175
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,080
 When the cops arrested him in the first place, he stabbed himself in the neck.

176
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,560
 It's one of those things like if you're that petrified at prison, you probably shouldn't

177
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,000
 be committing crimes that are easily tracked back to you.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
 But, and I tried looking up.

179
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,920
 I was like, was he a felon?

180
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,960
 Like did he serve time before and have a really bad experience and then, you know, get out?

181
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
 What was it?

182
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
 Oh dude, I read this story the other day.

183
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,640
 This guy was reading about the New Mexico prison riots.

184
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,880
 This dude was, he was thrown in prison for like shoplifting.

185
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,080
 He got gang raped by seven dudes.

186
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,720
 Jason, this story took a dark turn from the face acid.

187
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,240
 He's reading about the New Mexico prison riot.

188
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,040
 This guy got arrested for shoplifting.

189
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,840
 He got gang raped by seven dudes.

190
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,160
 He reported them to the police.

191
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,600
 They put him in protective custody.

192
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,600
 So now he's in the protective custody ward.

193
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,960
 And then there was this huge prison riot and the first thing, this is like back in the

194
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
 70s.

195
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,840
 The first thing the prisoners did was go to the protective custody ward to get all the

196
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,640
 snitches.

197
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,440
 And they found him and they took him out of a cell, cut his generals off, stuffed him

198
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,880
 in his mouth and then like killed him.

199
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,400
 Because he shoplifted.

200
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,800
 So again, three years in prison, it really depends on the prison you're in and like just

201
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
 maybe blind luck.

202
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,020
 He shoplifted, got assaulted by these guys, turned them into the cops and then he had

203
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,320
 to eat his own balls.

204
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,520
 Horrible story.

205
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,120
 And only like five people or ten people got prosecuted during this huge giant riot.

206
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,000
 Another guy got a blood, never mind I'm not going to go into all the torture but horrible

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,240
 stuff, horrible stuff.

208
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,720
 Prison is not a fun place.

209
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
 Not a fun place.

210
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
 Okay.

211
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,400
 Now our next story we're going to talk about is actually a two-parter because I wanted

212
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,040
 to talk about that this is a little tiny piece of a story.

213
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
 Maybe like a minute or two but I want to talk about it.

214
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
 I find it absolutely fascinating.

215
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,200
 It ties into our second main story here.

216
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,240
 So these nerds were studying these rocks.

217
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,640
 They're studying meteorites to be specific.

218
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,080
 Not just any old rock.

219
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,880
 They're studying these meteorites and they notice something.

220
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,880
 In the meteorites they find a rare earth element known as monozyte.

221
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,760
 They're like, "Hmm, look at this fellow nerd."

222
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,760
 And they're like, "Oh, that is indubitably the best find we've ever found."

223
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,800
 Anyways, they're looking at the monozyte.

224
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,000
 To their credit, at least they can pronounce it correctly.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,280
 I can call them nerds all day long but at least they can say this word.

226
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,800
 And they're looking at it and they're like, "Okay, that's cool.

227
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
 It's a rare earth element.

228
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
 We have it in this meteorite."

229
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,240
 And they notice something else on the microscopic level.

230
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,800
 That there are traces of an unknown element in it.

231
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
 In this sample.

232
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,320
 And they found this in a couple different samples now.

233
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,960
 And this is what they've come to the conclusion of.

234
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,480
 They can tell the monozyte has been disturbed in some way on the microscopic level.

235
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,440
 It changed into another completely unknown element, unknown mineral, on earth.

236
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,800
 Never seen it before.

237
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
 And this is their hypothesis.

238
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,200
 They can say that word correctly too.

239
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,200
 Meteorite, when it impacted the earth, it impacted it with such force that on that microscopic

240
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,160
 chemical level, the mineral changed into something else for just a microsecond.

241
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,560
 A brand new thing no one's ever seen before.

242
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:34,280
 And then because our environment doesn't allow that mineral to exist, it went back to

243
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,400
 Monsonite with a little scar through it.

244
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,920
 And they said, "For a split second, something on this planet existed that shouldn't exist,

245
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,320
 that can't exist in our biome."

246
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,000
 And they go, "We don't, we can't name it because we can't, we can't see it.

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,560
 We just see that it used to be there."

248
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
 I find that fascinating.

249
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
 I find that absolutely fascinating.

250
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
 Thank you nerds.

251
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,120
 It's just interesting that they can look at this and say, "Here's something we've never,

252
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,920
 ever, ever seen before, have no idea what it is.

253
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,880
 It only lasted for a microsecond, just enough to leave this little ghost marker."

254
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
 It really is a ghost.

255
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,440
 And yeah, totally bizarre.

256
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,840
 But I didn't have a lot to cover on that.

257
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,080
 Anything more than that would have required me to read a scientific journal, but I still

258
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
 found that fascinating.

259
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,200
 It'll be in the show notes if you want to look it up more.

260
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,400
 But what I really want to talk about is, of course, you know, because that's more sexy

261
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,880
 aliens, sexy aliens.

262
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,120
 So let's talk about aliens.

263
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,440
 So I'm drinking this Diet A&W Root Beer.

264
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
 It is quite tasty.

265
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,520
 So you're sitting at a lab.

266
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
 This is all that comes down to you, really.

267
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,600
 This will be your decision.

268
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,240
 You're sitting at a laboratory.

269
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,560
 A laboratory specifically to decode messages coming from space, like SETI, to search for

270
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
 extraterrestrial intelligence.

271
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,240
 You're sitting there, drinking your Diet A&W Root Beer.

272
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,800
 Delicious.

273
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,440
 And you get a message.

274
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,120
 You're not just an email from your buddy.

275
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,320
 But the system begins reading a massive influx of data.

276
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,640
 You realize that this isn't just background radiation.

277
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,040
 This isn't like a pulsar.

278
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:17,160
 This is actually what your organization has been set up to do to detect and decode a transmission

279
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,360
 from outside the planet.

280
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,720
 You're watching the coded information appear onto your hard drive.

281
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,680
 You can just see it filling up with some sort of information.

282
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,360
 Now, obviously, at this point, you're like, Jason, you really don't know how technically

283
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
 any of this works.

284
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
 And I don't.

285
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,840
 But because the specifics don't matter to me.

286
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,640
 If I knew what they were, they'd probably matter more.

287
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,000
 But anyways, you're getting a message.

288
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,360
 Do you open that message?

289
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,840
 Now I always thought that was a no-brainer.

290
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,520
 Of course, you would open the message.

291
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,840
 I would open the message.

292
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,880
 I figured if I got an email from an alien, I would open it.

293
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,000
 I mean, again, that's not how it works.

294
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,240
 But so of course, organizations that are built to send out and search for these messages,

295
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,560
 of course, they would open it.

296
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,840
 I never even considered why you wouldn't open it.

297
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,360
 Recently, there was a paper called "Interstellar Communication.

298
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,000
 Message Decontamination is Impossible."

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,400
 Now here's the thing.

300
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,840
 This paper puts forth the idea that the message itself could be dangerous in various ways.

301
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,720
 So let's go back to you in the laboratory.

302
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
 You're drinking your diet.

303
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,400
 You just went and got another Diet A&W Root Beer.

304
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,480
 You're ready to open this up.

305
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,720
 And you see that there is a text file, what appears to be a text file, and then another

306
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,760
 program.

307
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,440
 You open up the text file and it reads this.

308
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,880
 There is no God.

309
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
 There is no life after death.

310
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,960
 All you have is a brief speck of time and then you are nothing.

311
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,200
 If another human says that to you, you can be like, you can either agree or disagree with

312
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
 it.

313
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,760
 If an extraterrestrial civilization, that is, if they're sending messages this concise

314
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,520
 far across these distances, you're going to assume they're smarter than us on a technical

315
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
 level.

316
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,160
 And if they spread a viral idea like that, people are more likely to take it seriously.

317
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,360
 And this was one of his, one of the person, and the person who wrote this paper, this

318
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,520
 was one of their concerns, was that you could have a message that destroys a society.

319
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,760
 You could have a statement whether it's true or false is irrelevant.

320
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,280
 It's coming from a race of people so much smarter than us that people are more likely

321
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
 to believe it.

322
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,360
 He used one, he said, you know, some people believe that the Bible helped speed along

323
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,520
 the destruction of Rome.

324
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,800
 I haven't really looked into that, but you can have these thoughts, these means, that

325
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,320
 really take hold in a society.

326
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,840
 If the message says, your son will go supernova within a year, everyone will freak out.

327
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:57,680
 And it will, everyone, and even if it's not true, it could cause some serious problems.

328
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,760
 It would cause a societal collapse because it's one thing if a meteorite hits the earth

329
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,080
 and you figure out we'll build these bunkers, or it's only going to hit this part of the

330
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,200
 planet and everyone else will be fine.

331
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,280
 See you later China, like, you know, there are certain things that we can do in those

332
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
 events.

333
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,600
 But in supernova there's nothing to do, in a year there's no way we're going to get

334
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,000
 far enough away from it.

335
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,520
 So they're saying that an alien civilization could send a malicious message that actually

336
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
 can destroy a society.

337
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:32,560
 If a supremely intelligent being said, this is it, when you die, you cease to exist, you

338
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,560
 disappear forever, everything you ever done just becomes someone else's memory and then

339
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,480
 they die and then everyone forgets about you, you're just a brief moment in time, you would

340
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,280
 have to be quite, quite devout to say, no I don't believe that, especially if they were

341
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,880
 able to say, we know this because we've traveled through dimensions or we have this advanced

342
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,280
 technology, this is just simply the facts.

343
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,240
 Here, here's math to prove that we are right.

344
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,160
 Whether or not it's true would be irrelevant.

345
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,320
 But that's only part of the problem with them, and I hadn't thought about that before, if

346
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,640
 the aliens could send us a message that would restructure our society.

347
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,720
 So that was something I hadn't considered because yes, I think messages can have effects

348
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
 on society.

349
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,880
 Imagine if you were told by someone that you really respected, you really trusted, they

350
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,640
 said you're significantly another is cheating on you.

351
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
 You'd be like, what?

352
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,880
 And they're like, yeah.

353
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,880
 Listen, I've been through this before, I know what the signs to look for are, they're cheating

354
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 on you.

355
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,320
 Nah, then no, they want to do that to me.

356
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,480
 No, this is like, look, these are the things that they're doing and these are the things

357
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
 I've experienced.

358
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,040
 I'm pretty sure they're cheating on you.

359
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,320
 That will affect your relationship with that person.

360
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,880
 That will affect your relationship.

361
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,520
 Now imagine six billion aliens are saying the exact same thing to you.

362
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,080
 You're going to have a hard time crawling into bed with them.

363
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,920
 So these things can actually damage people.

364
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,480
 But that wasn't the only thing that the author of this paper that I forgot to write down,

365
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,880
 the author of this paper said.

366
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,120
 Let's go back to our example.

367
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,280
 You get the alien signal.

368
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,000
 It says there is no God, there is no life after death.

369
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,160
 All you have is a brief speck of time and then you are nothing.

370
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,640
 You download and decrypt the following program.

371
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,880
 It has cures for every known disease that can impact a biological organism.

372
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,960
 It will help you achieve a longer life, totaling 500 to 1000 years.

373
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,840
 We want to help you explore the stars and meet us.

374
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,920
 Together we will live this relatively short life to the fullest.

375
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,680
 The paper put forth that the other problem isn't necessarily a statement which may destroy

376
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
 society.

377
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,080
 It's a straight up computer virus.

378
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,520
 It would be far easier to send a computer virus across the cosmos than it would be to

379
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,400
 send a fleet.

380
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,000
 And so if you have this program that's saying we can offer you these great things, just

381
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,360
 click on this and upload it to your computer.

382
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
 Just click past that Norton antivirus thing.

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,360
 It could just be a computer virus that just wipes everything out.

384
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,920
 Or the program itself, the message itself could be an artificial intelligence.

385
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,880
 And we talked about this before and he actually goes in, he goes listen, this is really, if

386
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,040
 we get an alien message, probably the safest thing to do would either be to decode it onto

387
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,480
 paper somehow or to build an AI in a box.

388
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,880
 To build a self-contained computer that isn't hooked up to any internet.

389
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,800
 I was writing an article on this as well and they were saying listen, if there's a hundred,

390
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,400
 let's say there's a 1% chance that it is a damaging message.

391
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,360
 And a 99% chance that it could cure cancer, what do you pick?

392
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,920
 Because the 1% is the devastation of all mankind.

393
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,120
 And so the author of the paper was saying what we could do is we could build a self-contained

394
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,040
 computer on the moon that's guarded by remote controlled fusion bombs.

395
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,800
 And that is the only place where you could interact with this program.

396
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,160
 If it was this AI, but again he goes listen, they've done studies on AI in a box and we

397
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,680
 covered that a couple episodes ago, that a human will most likely let it out.

398
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,680
 Especially if it's like I can cure cancer and your daughter has cancer, you're more

399
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,480
 likely to do this.

400
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:30,400
 So can you, if we got an alien message today, could you contain it?

401
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,800
 Could you say, listen nobody opened this until we get this structure set up because we don't

402
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,080
 know what it's going to do, we don't even know what it's going to say.

403
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,560
 It could be Cthulhu level horror.

404
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,960
 It could be any sorts of stuff.

405
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,120
 It could be a straight up stomach churning truth that we can't even put into words or

406
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,960
 imagine until it's given to us by an alien race.

407
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,360
 It could be something so mind-shattering that everyone who sees it goes mad.

408
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,720
 We won't know until we open it.

409
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,440
 It's Schrodinger's message.

410
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,660
 It could be good or bad.

411
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,880
 It could be good or reality destroying.

412
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,120
 So I guess every message is Schrodinger's message.

413
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,440
 But anyways, the paper goes on to say it's impossible to contain it because there's actually

414
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,720
 laws in place saying that if there is an alien message is received, it has to be shared

415
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,760
 with all these other groups so everyone can analyze it.

416
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,440
 So if one group got it, they really can't contain it.

417
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,160
 They have to share it with these other organizations.

418
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:36,680
 I don't know if that's a strict law, but it's a definite ruling of this board of aeronautics

419
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
 thing.

420
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,720
 I don't remember.

421
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,040
 But anyways, the point is that there are procedures in place that you have to share it.

422
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,680
 So you really wouldn't be able to contain it.

423
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,480
 So basically, if they send us a message, we will open it.

424
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,160
 Somebody will open it.

425
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,840
 Somebody will try to figure it out.

426
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,680
 The paper ended basically with them saying when we send messages, we should send them

427
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,040
 as simple as possible.

428
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,560
 Something that has no computer code whatsoever and can be just printed off.

429
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,640
 If you wanted to read it or look at it, you don't have to use the computer.

430
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,240
 You could basically just print it off on your alien Hewlett Packard and it would come out.

431
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,400
 A little dot matrix printer.

432
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,840
 But that doesn't solve the big problem.

433
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,800
 I don't care how we're sending messages.

434
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,120
 And I've kind of come to the conclusion that we probably shouldn't send out messages until

435
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,440
 we have a standing war fleet and the ability to shoot meteorites across the galaxy, which

436
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,120
 actually would probably be easier to do than to have a war fleet.

437
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,960
 But I don't think we should be sending out messages until we have a fleet of ships manned

438
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,000
 by the men and women of the mobile infantry.

439
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,760
 I think that it's really bizarre to be telling people where you're at and we really have

440
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,080
 no capability of defending ourselves.

441
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,280
 We have some nukes, but I saw this documentary called Independence Day and they did not work.

442
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,280
 So I think that we're really putting the cart before the horse with this.

443
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,240
 If we don't have the weaponry to stop an alien race or what we would assume they would be

444
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,480
 like, you know, they may have like quantum reality jumping missiles where they shoot

445
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,200
 us and if you get hit by it, you never existed and neither have your past 10 ancestors.

446
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 Like we don't know what type of technology they're going to have, but we'll assume they

447
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,800
 have like laser guns and stormtrooper armor and stuff like that.

448
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,000
 We can't like, you can daydream all you want about reality bending weapons, but you can't

449
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,400
 prepare for that.

450
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,000
 Or can we?

451
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,160
 But that's my thing.

452
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,640
 Like let's get the weapons in first.

453
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,600
 Let's get the weapons in place first guys.

454
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,320
 Let's really get like some sort of defensive barrier or at least a ship and enterprise

455
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,800
 in X something off the design table that's able to fly around and blow stuff up before

456
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,960
 we start telling people where we're at.

457
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,960
 But really that's the minor part of the problem because that's what the paper saying, oh, this

458
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
 is what we can do.

459
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,560
 We can make it easy.

460
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,720
 But they're not.

461
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,800
 If we don't know what they're doing, the paper basically comes to no conclusion.

462
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,960
 They're like, well, yeah, it'll suck if it happens, but this is what we can do differently.

463
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,800
 I always assumed that an alien message, and this is just me, I guess, being naive about

464
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,280
 intergalactic politics, I always assumed that alien message would be, hey guys, what's

465
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
 up?

466
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
 We're the Andromeda boys.

467
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
 We're hanging out.

468
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,440
 Yo, you should come kick it with us.

469
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
 We got some awesome brew.

470
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,640
 Like I thought it would be friendly.

471
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,160
 Maybe you would, because again, why would you send a message saying we're going to destroy

472
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
 you?

473
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,680
 We'll see you in 10,000 light years because that would only give us time to prepare.

474
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,240
 I figured a message would be beneficial, or at least like a hello, and invasion would

475
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
 just happen.

476
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,720
 I always walk down the street and I think, I wonder what would happen if an alien ship

477
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,440
 poured out of those clouds?

478
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,680
 Constantly.

479
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,560
 That is probably my second most thought while I'm walking, other than, what would I do

480
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,880
 zombie show-dove right now?

481
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,920
 So I always thought a hostile action would just be ships.

482
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,560
 You know, Spain didn't send letters to South America, say, and see you soon.

483
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,040
 They just kind of showed up one day.

484
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,800
 So maybe that was just me being naive, but the idea of getting a message in the middle

485
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:21,480
 of the night at a radio telescope lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and seeing those little data points

486
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,280
 appearing and you're like, oh my God, you're calling up your supervisors?

487
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
 This is it.

488
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,200
 This is what we've been waiting for and everyone comes over to your monitor and you're seeing

489
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,680
 that.

490
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,680
 You're watching this file, just the information grow, gigabytes and terabytes and you're like,

491
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,360
 what could this be?

492
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,740
 This could be, this is obviously not random.

493
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,720
 This could be proof, it is proof that we're being contacted from somebody other than Earth.

494
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,920
 You're watching this file grow and grow and grow and grow and then finally, and now you

495
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,040
 have the option to decode it.

496
00:25:53,040 --> 00:26:00,640
 A 99% chance that it is benevolent, but a 1% chance that it will be the same.

497
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,680
 The end of human civilization.

498
