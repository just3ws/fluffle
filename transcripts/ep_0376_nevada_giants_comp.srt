1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 Are you looking at a cursed photograph?

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,640
 Have I unleashed a horrible haunting on all of my listeners?

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,680
 Could you kill a robot?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,760
 And then we travel to Nevada to uncover an interesting Indian story about giant cannibalistic

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,600
 monster people.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,840
 However, when archeologists start digging up their remains, the story seems surprisingly

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
 true.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:43,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,680
 You know, it's funny I had a different intro set up for today, but I'm sure you guys are

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,440
 saying just explain this photo please.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,560
 Now again, I have two listenerships, people who listen to it on YouTube, who are now being

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,160
 confronted with this image.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,200
 And then there's the rest of us who listen to the show on podcasts at work and things

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,320
 like that.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,880
 This is just in your pocket.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,480
 You feel this little face pressed up against your skin, or maybe it's sitting in a corner

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,760
 of your office, your phone as this is being streamed via bluetooth.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,720
 So you guys don't have to look at the photo as much.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,560
 But I ask you now to take that phone out of your pocket to look at the podcast art for

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,600
 this episode because it's creepy.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
 It's super creepy.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,680
 So you guys are like, yes, yes, thanks for explaining that this photo is creepy.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,800
 And I know there's a couple of you out there being like, this is nothing.

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,440
 I go to rotten.com.

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
 That's not the point.

30
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,320
 It's not a gory photo.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,680
 It's an unsettling photo.

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
 A curse to photo, I believe.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,560
 Let's get into this.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,840
 The year is 1991.

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,880
 We're one year away from Terminator 2, rocking into the box office.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
 It's June 5th.

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,800
 That's nothing to do with this story.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,520
 Arnold Schwarzenegger is not in this photograph.

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,400
 It's June 5th, 1991.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,440
 There's a little Super 8 Motel in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,000
 Security guards walking along.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,680
 Hey, you got to open up your hotel room.

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
 Open up.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
 Security.

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,520
 No one's coming to the door.

46
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
 Tries to open it.

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
 Won't open.

48
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,960
 Security guard has to unlock a deadbolt and then unlock the door.

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,400
 Double bolted.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,200
 Opens up the hotel room.

51
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
 The security guard walks into the hotel room and sees like a suitcase laying there.

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,720
 You know stuff you would imagine in a hotel room.

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
 That's not suspicious.

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,240
 He's like, "Hazooka is in a hotel room.

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
 Time to call the police."

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
 Like, it's just stuff.

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,360
 There's a couple bottles of alcohol, some cigarettes, things like that.

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,400
 But there is a shape in the shower.

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,880
 Recognizable shape.

60
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,440
 It's body.

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,000
 And then the security guard's like, "Well, that's suspicious.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,960
 I mean, yes, this is a Super 8 Motel in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

63
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,080
 I've seen a couple of these, but I'm just going to leave and get the police in here."

64
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,920
 Police come in here and what they find is a woman is hung.

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
 She's dead.

66
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,360
 Hanging from the shower head.

67
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,240
 She was hung with a suitcase strap.

68
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,040
 At this point, it's interesting because they said that they believed she'd been dead for

69
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,480
 two days, but at this point she is so decomposed that she's unrecognizable.

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,600
 They can't look at her face.

71
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,680
 They can't tell anything about her.

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,560
 Now, I'm wondering if the water was running the whole time.

73
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,200
 Because in two days, I don't think that's enough time to really decompose the point

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
 that you're unrecognizable.

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,640
 I used to work in a mortuary.

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,560
 And a morgue would be more specific than a mortuary.

77
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,840
 But anyways, I mean, bodies can decompose pretty quickly, but to be unrecognizable.

78
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,720
 But anyways, so I'm wondering if the water was just running the whole time.

79
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,880
 That will wear you down very, very quickly.

80
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,240
 Point is that she's dead.

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,360
 They don't recognize her.

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,720
 They can't tell from her face.

83
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,480
 The only way that they can identify her in any sort of way is in this hotel room where

84
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,520
 there is this woman hanging, no name, nothing to identify her with.

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,600
 There is a photograph that she took at a-- you know those little parlor, those little

86
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
 like things.

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,800
 They have it in movie theaters or arcades or carnivals.

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,640
 You know where you get into the giant box and it takes like five photos of you and it

89
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,920
 comes out on that little strip.

90
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,720
 It's like instant photos and you make funny-- do they still even have those?

91
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,200
 Not everyone has a camera, but you'd crawl into this box with your friends or like whatever,

92
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,920
 your mom and then it would take pictures of you.

93
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
 You guys know what I'm talking about.

94
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,880
 So anyways, that was the only thing they had on the table with all of her other stuff.

95
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,280
 There was a little tiny photo of her making that face.

96
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,320
 And there's a man sitting behind her, like she's sitting on some guy's lap.

97
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,400
 They've never been able to identify the man.

98
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
 They've never been able to identify her.

99
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,320
 There's just that photo that they now circulate to see if anyone recognizes her.

100
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
 There is a scale.

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,040
 They found a digital scale in there that's at George Martinez.

102
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
 They don't know who that is.

103
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,520
 They don't know if that's the guy in the photo.

104
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,360
 But that is all just a sad circumstance.

105
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,520
 People do leave areas that they're in.

106
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,000
 Did I say she had heroin in her system?

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,720
 I don't think I said that yet.

108
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,960
 They did find heroin in her system as well.

109
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,320
 So it's possible that she was just doing heroin and goes, "This sucks," and then kills herself.

110
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,600
 They don't think she was murdered.

111
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,640
 I don't think most heroin users are like, "Dungeon of heroin.

112
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,640
 Time to kill myself."

113
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,080
 But the police don't think this was a murder.

114
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,960
 They think it was a suicide because the door was locked from the inside.

115
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,520
 But they've never been able to identify her.

116
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,280
 This photo is circulating, trying to say, "The photo is haunting."

117
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
 The photo is haunting.

118
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,360
 Now, the photo could have been taken weeks or months before her death.

119
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,920
 It could have been taken the day before her death.

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,880
 But there's something about the look and face.

121
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,440
 So what happened was I was on Reddit earlier yesterday and I was reading this thread and

122
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,760
 it was like, "Most disturbing media you've come across regarding true crime."

123
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,360
 Because I follow a lot of true crime reddits.

124
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,960
 And someone says, "Oh, the Albuquerque Jane Doe photo."

125
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,360
 And I was like, "Yeah, whatever.

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,640
 I've seen it all."

127
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:22,840
 And I clicked on it and I felt this face floating.

128
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,200
 So my apartment, I've talked about it being haunted, right?

129
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,480
 And this is what happened yesterday.

130
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,960
 I had to get up to go to work.

131
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,880
 So it's dark outside.

132
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
 It's all spooky.

133
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,880
 I looked at the photo and again, you guys are like, "Jason, you're a big baby.

134
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,960
 I'm sitting.

135
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,120
 This photo is not creepy at all.

136
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,440
 I'm watching it on YouTube and I'm like in the dark.

137
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,760
 I have all my lights shut off.

138
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
 It's not creepy at all."

139
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
 I don't think it's just me.

140
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
 I bet you anything.

141
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
 You're getting-- Look at it.

142
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,560
 Look at the photo and tell me that's not a haunting photo.

143
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,680
 What happened was I woke up before 30 yesterday morning.

144
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,560
 I'm on my phone and I'm reading this stuff on Reddit and it's like, "Oh, this is spooky."

145
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,240
 And a lot of these pictures I had seen before and they weren't gory.

146
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,440
 They were just disturbing.

147
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,680
 I'm going through my phone and I click on it and I was like, "Oh, that was creepy.

148
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,200
 Creepy Albuquerque Jane Doe woman."

149
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,040
 And then I remember being-- I usually shut off all my lights like a big boy, like an

150
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
 adult.

151
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,800
 I shut off all my lights and then I usually have to walk through a dark apartment because

152
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,240
 the light switch to like by my door doesn't work.

153
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
 It works.

154
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,680
 I haven't replaced the light bulbs.

155
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,280
 So generally, I have to shut the lights off on one side of my apartment and then walk.

156
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
 What is it?

157
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,320
 Like 10, 15 feet to the front door and then I open-- Now again, I do live in a haunted

158
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,280
 apartment in a haunted apartment complex.

159
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,000
 So it is spooky in general.

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,520
 But then I walk to my front door.

161
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,880
 I turn my back to my apartment as I undo my three locks.

162
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,160
 I'm glad I'm giving all this information out to my stalkers.

163
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,800
 And then I walk out of my apartment complex.

164
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,840
 What I did this morning after looking at that photo.

165
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,360
 And I looked at it and I go, "Oh, that's creepy."

166
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
 Just something about it.

167
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
 It's so terrifying.

168
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,360
 I then, whenever my back was turned to-- I'm going to have a hard time recording this

169
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,200
 episode whenever because I keep looking over my shoulder.

170
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,760
 I've been doing that ever since I started recording.

171
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,920
 And again, you guys can be like, "I'm not feeling it."

172
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,200
 But just roll with me on this.

173
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,440
 If you don't think it's creepy, just pretend it is.

174
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
 Just pretend.

175
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,560
 Just pretend for me.

176
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,120
 Don't give me comments being like, "That's not creepy."

177
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,000
 Be like, "That's really creepy, Jason.

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Super spooky."

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And I'll be like, "Yay.

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
 They agree with me."

181
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,440
 I look at the photo.

182
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
 It totally creeps me out.

183
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
 I can't stop looking at the photos.

184
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,360
 And now I'm sharing that horror with you.

185
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
 Then it's time for me to leave.

186
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,880
 And I'm all suited up because I got all these lights and lanterns on my backpack so people

187
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
 can see me while I'm walking on the road.

188
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,600
 And I shut off my light.

189
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,080
 It has these three light bulbs.

190
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,360
 You're riveting, "Block, cast, you jayson, don't care."

191
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,760
 I'm shutting off the light.

192
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,840
 I have these three light bulb lamp thing.

193
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,600
 I shut off the first two and then I can't shut off the last one.

194
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:55,560
 I can't be in a dark room by myself because I know that face is right behind me.

195
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,880
 And I remember not even wanting to turn my back on my bedroom, which is where I get a

196
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,600
 lot of the haunting vibes.

197
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,840
 I didn't want to turn my back on my bedroom.

198
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,880
 So I kind of did this weird shuffle.

199
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,480
 I did this side crab walk where I was walking sideways.

200
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,000
 I had to walk towards the door, but I didn't want to turn my back completely to my bedroom.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,200
 So I'm doing this weird kind of shuffle.

202
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,920
 And then I just want to, I have this feeling I need to get out of my apartment.

203
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,440
 The face is right behind me.

204
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,160
 So I get out of my apartment and I start walking and then I realize I left my walking stick

205
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,240
 because it's snowing.

206
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,720
 So I'm standing at the end of the hallway, my spooky, spooky apartment convalesce.

207
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,720
 And I go, Jason, there may or may not be the face of a deceased woman in your apartment,

208
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,160
 but you do need your walking stick.

209
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,020
 So you're just going to have to face the problem head on.

210
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:56,120
 And so I chuckle to myself as I made that pun and I turn and I walk in and I was just

211
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
 panicked.

212
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
 I was like, I'm doing the door and then I grabbed my walking stick and I ran out.

213
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
 Not literally.

214
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,920
 I bounced out.

215
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,760
 You're like, Jason, you've heard me post a podcast about ghosts.

216
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,200
 You seem to be awfully scared by a photograph, but I swear there's something to this photograph.

217
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,360
 I really do.

218
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,480
 I think that this is, a lot of times you'll see people talk about cursed photographs or

219
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
 things like that.

220
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,560
 I think this might actually be a cursed photograph.

221
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,880
 It's not a gory photograph.

222
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,640
 It's not a depressing photograph.

223
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,120
 It's not a grisly photograph or anything like that.

224
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,920
 It's not a photograph of someone's last moments or someone getting ripped apart by lions or

225
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,760
 and it's a photo of a moment of fun.

226
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,680
 A woman getting her photo taken at an InstaMax photo booth somewhere in 1991.

227
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,760
 But it's the only image that we know of, of this human existing.

228
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,400
 That alone makes it bizarre, but that's not the, I've seen photos like that before.

229
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,360
 This photo, there's something about it that I believe is haunted, cursed maybe.

230
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:07,280
 By gazing upon this photo, you are now inviting this horrifying image into your mind.

231
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,720
 So you're welcome for putting it on the podcast.

232
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,760
 I don't know the ramifications because I only just saw it, what, 24 hours ago, so it's possible

233
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,720
 that seven days after viewing this photo, you actually see the face and you may be thinking,

234
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,320
 Jason, that's pretty disrespectful because you're talking about like this woman who's

235
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,400
 committed suicide and you're turning her story into a ghost story.

236
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 Well, that's probably true.

237
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,560
 However, I will defend it like this as well.

238
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,200
 If you recognize this person, you can follow the show notes and you'll see links to contact

239
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
 someone.

240
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,360
 So maybe some good will come out of it.

241
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,920
 Maybe someone will go, that was my aunt.

242
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,320
 I remember her.

243
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,920
 So there's that too.

244
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,200
 That's another reason why I'm putting the photo, not, I'm not just putting the photo

245
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,800
 up to curse my listeners.

246
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,680
 Maybe you recognize her, but I'm also putting it up because I think it's a creepy photo

247
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,880
 and it's possibly cursed and I'm sorry.

248
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,560
 And speaking of sorry, I should have said this earlier, but I've got tied up in that.

249
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,520
 We have a new Patreon supporter and I'm sorry that this Patreon supporter is getting mentioned

250
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,160
 in this episode.

251
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,200
 Tressa, thank you very much for supporting the Patreon.

252
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,840
 Really, really means a lot.

253
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:24,760
 Tressa's like, yeah, next time don't mention my name after the horrifying photo segment.

254
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,800
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

255
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,480
 We have a merch store and if you can't do that, just get the word out about the show.

256
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,340
 It really, really helps a lot.

257
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
 Helps the show grow.

258
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,120
 Reviewing the show wherever you listen to podcasts really, really helps a lot.

259
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,680
 I appreciate anything.

260
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,240
 Now I told you I was going to do the story about killing robots.

261
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
 Could you kill a robot?

262
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,000
 We're going to save that till tomorrow because I want to get into this next story here.

263
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,920
 We'll save the killing robots for later.

264
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,320
 People are like, I love killing robots.

265
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
 You're all disappointed.

266
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,200
 Like, oh yeah, to talk about that horrifying photo.

267
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 And get back to me.

268
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,000
 Am I wrong that I just spent 15 minutes talking about a photo that only I and the Redditor

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,480
 person finds horrifying?

270
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,800
 I think there's something about the photo.

271
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,280
 I think anyone who mocks the photo is only going to get more of the photo coming at you.

272
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,680
 But anyways, anyways, we're done with the photo.

273
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,920
 It's still going to appear though.

274
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,760
 I'm not changing the podcast art so it's stuck there for the rest of the episode as

275
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,000
 we go to this next one.

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,920
 We're leaving behind Albuquerque, New Mexico.

277
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:30,440
 We will let Tressa fly the carpenter copter and take us all the way to Love Lock, Nevada.

278
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,600
 Flying away.

279
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
 And we're sitting in the back.

280
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
 We're discussing the story.

281
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
 Tressa's flying the helicopter and I look and there's a little photograph.

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,560
 You know how in those war movies they put little photographs on the dashboard of their

283
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,960
 vehicle.

284
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,160
 We look and we see Tressa put a little photograph on the dashboard of the carpenter copter and

285
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
 we're like, "What is that?

286
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
 What is that?"

287
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,160
 It's the photo of the girl.

288
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,360
 I don't know why he can't stop.

289
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,400
 This podcast is now, this entire episode is just a photo.

290
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,360
 And anyways, so make a long story short.

291
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,120
 We're like, "Tressa, Tressa," and she turns around and she has the face of the girl.

292
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,240
 We're like, "Ah, okay, that's the end of that segment."

293
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,680
 That's the end of that segment.

294
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
 Tressa became the girl.

295
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
 She became, "Sorry."

296
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,920
 Again, people are like, "I don't want to support your Patreon.

297
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,800
 I'm going to get possessed by a photograph of a dead woman."

298
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
 Sorry, Tressa.

299
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,880
 Anyways, we land.

300
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,400
 We regain control of the carpenter copter and we're like, "Tressa, Tressa, we have to

301
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
 perform an exorcism."

302
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,520
 We end up landing the helicopter in modern-day Love Lock Nevada.

303
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,120
 Now back when we're going back in time to look at the story, it wasn't called Love

304
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,960
 Lock back then, but if you're in the area, this place exists.

305
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,080
 This is a really, really fascinating story.

306
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
 Really interesting one.

307
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,400
 It's 1913.

308
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,480
 These dudes are hanging out in Nevada and they're like, "Ah, you know what we should do?

309
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,000
 We should find, like, we should go in this cave."

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,920
 And then everyone, all those buddies are super suspicious.

311
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,960
 "Bill, every time we hang out with you, you just want to go in caves.

312
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,240
 Like, what is your thing with caves?

313
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,640
 I really like caves, man.

314
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,000
 I just find them really neat and warm."

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,040
 So anyways, they do what Bill says because they're global.

316
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,640
 They walk in and it's a tiny little cave opening.

317
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,200
 Usually like humans can't fit in that, but these guys, they go in there and they're like

318
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,680
 ca-ching their eyes or like brrrrrrga, brrrrga.

319
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,880
 Because they're in a cave full of bat guano.

320
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,680
 Now I know you probably thought it was gold or diamonds, but these guys, they're like,

321
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,360
 "Mmm, give me that sweet, sweet guano."

322
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,360
 Guano is extremely valuable.

323
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,440
 Extremely valuable.

324
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
 You use it for a fertilizer.

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 You use it for gunpowder.

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,120
 I don't know if they still use it for gunpowder.

327
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
 It's 1913 though.

328
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
 They're like, "Yes!"

329
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,200
 They're like, "I got that guano money, baby."

330
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,360
 They're like going to the club.

331
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
 They're just throwing it.

332
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
 It's all white and sticky.

333
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,640
 But anyways, they start mining the cave.

334
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,120
 And they have to make the opening bigger.

335
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,040
 What happened was the opening was so small that only bats could really get in and out

336
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
 of it.

337
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,600
 So bats, it was totally peaceful for them.

338
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,000
 They'd go in there, poop everywhere, and you had like centuries of bat poop.

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,160
 They're mining this stuff.

340
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
 They start mining.

341
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,680
 They're a couple feet deep in this stuff, because it's all hard and sterilized.

342
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
 It's not like dog poop.

343
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,880
 It's not like you step in and they're like, "Oh!"

344
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,960
 They're like to their knees and dog poop.

345
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
 It's like fossilized.

346
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,880
 So you're like, it's like a mineral.

347
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 So they dig down.

348
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,640
 Over the years, they're digging, they're digging.

349
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,120
 By 1924, they're starting to chop open with pickaxes.

350
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,440
 They're starting to mine into these guano walls.

351
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
 They're finding artifacts.

352
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,000
 They're like, "That's weird.

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Clay pot.

354
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 That's bizarre."

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Hand?

356
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Huh?

357
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 They find like skeleton bones and stuff like that.

358
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,840
 They're like, "That's weird.

359
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,520
 Who would have been in this cave if it was so small?"

360
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,080
 But they just keep digging.

361
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,120
 It's just too valuable to really get into it.

362
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,800
 But archaeologists start to hear about all these artifacts they're finding in this mine.

363
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,680
 The archaeologists show up and they're like, "Okay guys, the mining thing is good and all,

364
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,080
 but let us try to dig around in here and see what we can find.

365
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,840
 Some lost civilization maybe?"

366
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,280
 Now when the archaeologists show up and they're digging around, it's not just that they're

367
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,160
 finding pots and stuff like that.

368
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,360
 That is interesting enough.

369
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,040
 But these, and this is where I came across the story, these skeletons are referred to

370
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,200
 as giants.

371
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,880
 So now you're into this whole thing of giants being dug up and then the Smithsonian showing

372
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,600
 up and smashing the bones and all this stuff.

373
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,720
 We've done an episode on that before, but the idea is this is that there was a giant

374
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 race that preceded humanity and it's proof that the Bible's real and the Smithsonian

375
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,360
 doesn't want people to believe in the Bible.

376
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,600
 This is a legit conspiracy.

377
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 I'm no game.

378
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,360
 It's not legit in the sense that I believe it, but there's a huge amount.

379
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,880
 Whenever I talk about this on any episode, I get a lot of feedback about, "You're wrong.

380
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,840
 Smithsonian actually does this."

381
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:55,560
 But for new listeners or people who are sane, the idea is this.

382
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,480
 Before humanity, there was a race of giants.

383
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,560
 That possibly.

384
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,880
 I'm not arguing that.

385
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,360
 I don't know necessarily that they lived alongside humans, but anyways, the point is this.

386
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,960
 There was a race of giants preceding humans, possible.

387
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,880
 And their bones are everywhere.

388
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,600
 If you look back at old-timey newspapers from the 1920s, 1930s, you would see all these

389
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,800
 articles about giants being dug up and the Smithsonian would appear at the end of each

390
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
 article.

391
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,080
 Like all of these articles end and the bones are shipped into the Smithsonian and then

392
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,360
 there's never any follow-up on these stories.

393
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,000
 So they're basically this mustache-twerling villain and the reason why this Smithsonian...

394
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,240
 So God...

395
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,800
 And I gotta do...

396
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,600
 So this is the reason why Christianity comes into this, is that in the book of Enoch, the

397
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,160
 book of Genesis really, but the book of Enoch goes into detail and I did an episode on that

398
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,960
 as well, angels came down and started banging human women and their babies were giants.

399
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,800
 And then God created the flood to wipe out the half-human half-demons.

400
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:00,480
 So the idea is this, is that you have these giants that pre-existed humanity or were alongside

401
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,600
 humanity and they're proof that humans and demons had sex and created this race of giants.

402
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,200
 The Smithsonian wants no proof of Christianity.

403
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,080
 It hates Christianity.

404
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,200
 So it is going around destroying these giants, otherwise it'll prove that Christianity is

405
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
 real.

406
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
 That's absolutely insane.

407
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,000
 I have heard the conspiracy theory, which is a little more rational, that the Smithsonian

408
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,480
 was headed up by a guy and I covered this in an earlier episode too.

409
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,320
 Maybe I'll put this on one of my repeats, maybe I'll do this episode.

410
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,200
 But anyways, there was a guy who was running the Smithsonian in the early days and he said,

411
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,720
 "There is no race greater than humanity in any..."

412
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,840
 I'm totally paraphrasing here.

413
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,280
 No one was more advanced than where we're at right now, so any proof, any...

414
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,880
 I shouldn't say any proof, any theories leading to that conclusion are obviously wrong because

415
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,480
 we're the most advanced species.

416
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,960
 So some people have taken that to mean we have proof they're a more advanced species,

417
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,720
 go out and smash their bones.

418
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,880
 And other people go, "No, he was just very..."

419
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,760
 Not ethnocentric, but like civilization-centric.

420
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,320
 He believed that this was the most highest form of civilization.

421
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,160
 So any scientist who says Atlantis, Lemuria, advanced giant races, they're wrong and we

422
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,440
 should prove them wrong.

423
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,480
 So anyways, that is a more viable story that the Smithsonian goes, "No, we don't think

424
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,280
 anyone was more advanced than us.

425
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
 Let's secretly smash these giants."

426
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,720
 That one, again I don't think it's true, but that one's more feasible than the Smithsonian

427
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,000
 going like, "We hate God!

428
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,080
 We hate God!"

429
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,920
 Like it's a Marilyn Manson concert and just smashing bones.

430
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,160
 That's completely ridiculous.

431
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,600
 And I should say this too, the reason why, and every so often someone will address this,

432
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,200
 the reason why there were a bunch of stories in the 1920s and the 1930s about giants is

433
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
 because people were making them up.

434
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,680
 It was yellow journalism, it was newspaper- I'm not saying they were all fake, but a lot

435
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
 of them were.

436
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,480
 So anyways, let's go on with this story.

437
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,000
 These people said, "We found these giant skeletons."

438
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,560
 Now the website Anomalien, which is actually a really good website, I'm not knocking them

439
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,320
 for this, but you know people are going to get their information, weirdly from time to

440
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
 time.

441
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,640
 Anomalien.com is a really good website.

442
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,160
 They say that the skeletons were 8.5 to 10 feet tall, which would definitely put them

443
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,920
 almost outside the range of humanity.

444
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,880
 I think that if there were giants, of course there's giants.

445
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,680
 We know Andre, but I think it was, if you found Andre the Giant Skeleton, I don't think

446
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,560
 you could then go, "There was tens of thousands of these people.

447
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,240
 I think they're genetic anomalies."

448
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,320
 But anyways, this race of giants, the reason why I want to address that, because these

449
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,760
 guys are known as the Nevada Giants.

450
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,040
 I'm not going to be demunking at all, because this actually gets really, really interesting.

451
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,080
 I'm just kind of going over all this base stuff, because I want to get this out of the

452
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
 way now.

453
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,400
 When we looked back at the original literature where they found these bones, they did say

454
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,440
 they were giant.

455
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,240
 They were giant as in, they were 6 feet, 6 inches.

456
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,640
 So language is really, really important.

457
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,400
 Language is really, really important.

458
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,240
 Because back in the 1920s, where you don't have basketball players, like massive basketball

459
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,480
 players, someone who's 6 foot, you'd be, if I saw someone who's 6 foot 6 and someone goes,

460
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,680
 "Hey, how would you describe him?"

461
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,440
 I'd be like, "Oh, great personality.

462
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
 Really nice dude.

463
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
 He paid for my dinner.

464
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
 He's actually kind of cool."

465
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
 No, no, no, no, no, no, physically.

466
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
 I was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
 He was a giant dude.

468
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,920
 He was like 6 foot 6.

469
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,160
 He was huge."

470
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,800
 And then 100 years later, you would have the article, "Podcastos meets giants."

471
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:34,640
 So they wrote in their book, the archaeologists would be like, "The skeletons we found were

472
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,800
 that of a giant."

473
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,280
 But then you go two sentences down and they go, "Yeah, he was 6 foot 6."

474
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,040
 So that type of stuff gets distorted over time.

475
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,280
 And they said, it appeared bigger because it was next to, I think, two or three female

476
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,720
 skeletons that they found, which were much shorter.

477
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,200
 So that's where these stories come from.

478
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
 Here we go though.

479
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,400
 Let's move past the giant stuff because I want to get to where is any of this true?

480
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,560
 And it is.

481
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,360
 We know who's in that cave.

482
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,040
 And who's in that cave?

483
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,600
 Giants, actually.

484
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,600
 It was a very, very tall tribe.

485
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,120
 So we're going back in time to Native American days.

486
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,880
 We're going way back in this same region.

487
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,840
 There was a tribe called C.T.

488
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
 Ka.

489
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
 C.T.

490
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
 Ka.

491
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
 C.T.

492
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
 Ka.

493
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
 C.T.

494
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
 Ka.

495
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
 C.T.

496
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
 Ka.

497
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
 C.T.

498
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
 Ka.

499
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
 C.T.

500
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
 Ka.

501
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
 C.T.

502
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
 Ka.

503
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
 C.T.

504
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
 Ka.

505
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
