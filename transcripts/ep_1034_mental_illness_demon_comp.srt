1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
 Was an Australian school shut down because wolves began to roam the hallways?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,760
 And then we meet a 15 year old boy and his family who move into their new home.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,640
 Little does he realize that this home will drive him mad.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,080
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
 I'm your host Jason Barbiner.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,360
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,480
 We got a bunch of stuff to cover so first off walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,720
 our legacy Patreon supporters.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,720
 Get on your feet and give it up for Sergio.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
 Woohoo!

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
 Yeah!

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
 Come on in Sergio.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,360
 Walk on in buddy.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,720
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,240
 Sergio you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon I totally understand.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I really do.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,080
 I really mean that.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,440
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,840
 That helps out so much.

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
 Now Sergio I'm going to throw a big arm around you.

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,720
 It's not my arm.

26
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,960
 It's an arm I found in the hallway.

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,320
 And I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,920
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:34,520
 Let's fly all the way out to Australia mate.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,200
 A nice leisurely journey all the way across the world to Australia.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,280
 Specifically we're headed to Melbourne, Australia.

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,320
 And this story takes place around 2018.

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,640
 The person who posted this story online, they didn't give it a real name.

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
 We're going to call him Tony.

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,280
 But Tony said I'm pretty sure that's the year.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,120
 When I remember it, pretty sure it's 2018.

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,360
 He goes it's possible that you know it's 2017.

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,720
 But I'm pretty sure it's 2018.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,720
 Tony says I'm pretty sure that was the year.

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,320
 Things have kind of blurred.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,440
 The story itself is kind of odd.

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,280
 But he goes I'm pretty sure that's the year.

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,320
 It's possible that maybe I'm off by a year.

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
 But I don't think so.

45
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,320
 So we're going to place the story around 2018.

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
 And Tony said this is how it all played out.

47
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,600
 One day I was at school.

48
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
 I'm assuming high school.

49
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,080
 He didn't specify that.

50
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,240
 But anyways, let's just assume high school.

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,080
 We don't have a ton of details about this story.

52
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,160
 But I find it very interesting.

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 And Tony does too.

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,320
 This is a mystery he's been trying to solve for the past four years.

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
 Five years at this point.

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,280
 Tony said one day I was at school.

57
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,840
 And all of a sudden the teacher said, OK everyone, we got to get out of this classroom.

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,960
 Go to this main area.

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,120
 So apparently their school was set up with buildings.

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,440
 And each building had kind of a common area in it.

61
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,880
 The way he explained this.

62
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,880
 The teacher goes, everyone get up.

63
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,040
 Let's go to that common area.

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
 Chop chop let's go.

65
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
 Let's go.

66
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
 Let's go.

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
 And everyone's like what?

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,160
 Tony's like, huh?

69
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,280
 But they do it, right?

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,320
 Because you're a student and the teacher's telling you to do something.

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,800
 I'm sure there's some cool kid in the back smoking a cigarette.

72
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,240
 He's like, whatever, teach.

73
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,600
 I'm going to do my own thing.

74
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:28,960
 But the reason why people weren't really rebelling is because this seemed like an active shooter

75
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,880
 drill.

76
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,960
 But not forget the drill part.

77
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,800
 Forget the part where it's fake, where it's a practice run.

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:42,600
 Tony goes, generally when a drill was going to happen, an announcement came over the

79
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 loudspeaker.

80
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,120
 And it was just so it doesn't freak everyone out.

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,520
 They said, we're going to have an active shooter drill.

82
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,560
 You don't have to have that last word.

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,960
 And they were like, ah, I didn't know you scheduled these things in advance.

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,320
 We're going to have an active shooter drill right now.

85
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
 What do they say?

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,240
 It's like ABC.

87
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
 There's an acronym.

88
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,800
 It's like stop, hide, defend yourself or something.

89
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,320
 I might want to be up on this, the amount of active shootings in the world these days.

90
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,960
 I don't want to be sitting there going, what was the last one?

91
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,160
 What was the last one as I'm getting riddled with bullets in safe way?

92
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,360
 Anyways, normally they announce that there's a drill going on.

93
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,240
 So they're like, who's going to sit around there like, what's the acronym again?

94
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,760
 They, that's normally what happens.

95
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,040
 So when the teacher all of a sudden is like, everyone get up or going on this common area,

96
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,120
 people are a little concerned by this.

97
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,880
 And then they all get into this common area and Tony notices there's other classrooms

98
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,200
 from their building also showing up in this common area.

99
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,320
 And if that's not alarming enough, right, because at this point you think that it's

100
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 a real shooting going on, all of a sudden the teacher say, okay, everyone start closing

101
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:58,600
 the blinds so no one can see into this room and lock the doors.

102
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,040
 Those are good things to do, right?

103
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,320
 And again, at this point you'd be thinking it's a drill.

104
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,600
 Maybe they just forgot to announce it.

105
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,400
 Well, when the teachers then instruct the students to move the lockers, to move the

106
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:20,240
 lockers to block the doors from opening up into this common area, people are going to

107
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
 go concerned.

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,280
 People are getting a little concerned.

109
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,000
 This was definitely not something they practiced during any drill.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,480
 Okay, everyone, let's redecorate the entire school.

111
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 But it's just a drill.

112
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,200
 No, they were now moving lockers to barricade the doors.

113
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,800
 No announcement, remember, just all of a sudden in the middle of class, your teacher says

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,840
 everyone go in this room and let's barricade ourselves into it.

115
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,560
 Now the teachers were telling the students, don't worry, it's just a drill.

116
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,800
 They're sweating profusely.

117
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,360
 It's just a drill, kids.

118
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
 Don't worry about it.

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
 Even though this is none of the protocol that we've ever had for any drill ever, this is

120
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,720
 just a drill.

121
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,360
 And so the students are starting to get a little relaxed, probably except for the ones

122
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,040
 that are carding lockers around and sending them down.

123
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
 Hey, boss, where do you want me to put this one?

124
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,320
 I'm assuming that's where the football team came in clutch, picking up all those lockers.

125
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:26,120
 The teacher said it's just a drill, students are starting to relax a bit.

126
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,200
 But kids, they're relaxed, they start kind of talking at conversational level.

127
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,200
 Some girls laughing at some joke and the guys over there having a tickle contest or whatever.

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,160
 And the teachers go, "Shh!"

129
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,720
 It's just a drill.

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
 But nobody can know we're in here.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:56,880
 And kids are getting nervous again, because this is not part of the drill procedure.

132
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,960
 They're getting shushed.

133
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,200
 So now they're thinking, "Okay, this isn't a drill.

134
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,400
 The teachers were just lying to us."

135
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,880
 Something real bad is going on.

136
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,600
 Something so bad is going on in our high school that simply talking at a conversational level

137
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,320
 may bring that bad thing here.

138
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:24,280
 In the absence of information, information will be created.

139
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,760
 That's something just part of the human condition.

140
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
 So there's murmur.

141
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:37,320
 This very quiet murmur begins to go through the crowd of kids.

142
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,240
 Tony doesn't know how the story originated.

143
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:47,840
 He has no idea where this came from, but apparently the kids started saying that there was a wolf

144
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
 in the school.

145
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,760
 Now I'm not from Australia.

146
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,360
 Tony obviously is, and he goes, "There's no wolves around here.

147
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
 It's none.

148
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,880
 We're an hour from the closest zoo."

149
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,840
 So couldn't be, which actually, listen, man, if you're going to have to do an active shooter

150
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,680
 drill in your school, and you hope it's never an active shooter, obviously, but if you ever

151
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,480
 have to go through this routine, that would be kind of dope.

152
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,680
 If it was just a bunch of animals rampaging through your school, bunch of zoo animals,

153
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,560
 the chimpanzees are taking over the cafeteria, and elephant has demolished the gymnasium.

154
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,120
 I'd be down with that.

155
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
 That'd be kind of cool.

156
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,920
 He goes, "It's not a wolf from the local zoo.

157
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,440
 There's no wolves around here.

158
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,320
 So how in the world could a wolf have gotten into the school?"

159
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,920
 So Tony asks the teacher.

160
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,000
 He goes, "Hey, I'm hearing that there's a wolf or wolves, really.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,160
 Could be more than one, but I'm hearing that there's wolves in the school.

162
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,000
 Is that true?"

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,480
 And the teacher's like, "Yeah, sure.

164
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 Just be quiet.

165
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
 Just be quiet.

166
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
 Wolves are whatever."

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 Is that what they're saying?

168
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 Wolves?

169
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 Okay, yeah.

170
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
 Just go sit down.

171
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 Be quiet.

172
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,200
 Tony said the teacher was super dismissive, but again, like in the absence of information,

173
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,360
 you're not hearing what you're afraid to hear, right?

174
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
 You're not hearing gunshots.

175
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:20,120
 On the other hand, you're not hearing growls, and it's probably more likely, unfortunately,

176
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:27,360
 that it's a guy with a gun than it is that a wolf somehow escaped the zoo, walked an

177
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,880
 hour, was probably quicker for a wolf, right?

178
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
 Because they got four legs.

179
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,800
 So a half hour, and then come to your school.

180
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,760
 He said that we stayed barricaded in this area until the end of school, which maybe

181
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,320
 they only had a half hour left, and it wasn't that big of a deal.

182
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,640
 Other than the unending terror in their hearts, it wasn't that big of a deal.

183
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,800
 It's possible that this was like right before lunch, and they're like, "Oh, I'm so hungry.

184
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 I'm so hungry.

185
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,880
 I get to eat a wolf."

186
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,560
 He says we stayed in that area until the end of school, and then when school was out, we

187
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,360
 moved the lockers.

188
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,920
 So we unbarricaded the place.

189
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,680
 We moved the lockers back to their original position, and their teachers are like, "Good

190
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
 luck.

191
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,400
 Good luck trying to get home."

192
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,920
 There's wolves, maybe?

193
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,200
 Out there, kids, you no longer are responsibility.

194
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,520
 Head home.

195
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
 The day is over.

196
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,520
 Would you have to imagine?

197
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,320
 They'd be very nervous to walk home, right?

198
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
 You're like, "Hey, wait a second.

199
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,680
 Is there pushing you out of the school?

200
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,280
 Did you see there are wolves in here?

201
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
 Or now they're out there?

202
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,160
 If they're not in the school anymore, now they're just prowling the neighborhood."

203
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,440
 Anyways, they're all sent home.

204
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:49,080
 Now this story makes so little sense that even Tony was like, "That must have been a

205
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
 dream.

206
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,400
 It must have been a dream.

207
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,720
 It just doesn't make any sense.

208
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,320
 It was, there was no announcement at all.

209
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,320
 All of a sudden, the teacher just somehow knew to put us all in this common area.

210
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,800
 It wasn't like there was an announcement and then wolves?

211
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 Like that's so weird.

212
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,120
 There's no wolves around here.

213
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,520
 Maybe Montana might have a problem with wolves in their school, but that's the team.

214
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,320
 They're the timber wolves.

215
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,040
 So as time went on, he just kind of chalked it up to a weird dream.

216
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,120
 Nobody talked about it at school apparently, or maybe they did.

217
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,400
 And Tony's not cool enough to be in the in-crowdy and no friends.

218
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,600
 He's like, "Oh, that was the closest I was to the rest of the students."

219
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,440
 When we were all crammed into that room waiting to die.

220
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,720
 Tony doesn't really reveal if they talked about it the next day.

221
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,120
 I mean, how couldn't they?

222
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,520
 But anyways, he goes, "It doesn't make sense, right?

223
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,640
 None of this story makes sense.

224
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,240
 I must have been dreaming it."

225
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,800
 And he kind of chalked it up to just a super realistic dream.

226
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,920
 Well, years later, he was hanging out with a friend of his.

227
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,680
 They're talking, talking about the good old times.

228
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,880
 And his friend goes, "Hey, you know, speaking of the good old times, wasn't that weird that

229
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,480
 one day we all got put in that common area?"

230
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,280
 Because those wolves showed up and they were like walking around the school.

231
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,440
 And Tony's like, "Okay, really?

232
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,920
 I thought that was just my dream.

233
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
 I didn't know that was real.

234
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,080
 I don't know if he actually said that out loud."

235
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,800
 And then the friend's like, "Am I just a dream as well?

236
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,840
 Are we all nothing but a dream?"

237
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,880
 He goes, "When my friend brought it up, I was like, 'Oh, okay, so it was real.

238
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,040
 I didn't just imagine it.

239
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,280
 It wasn't just a dream.

240
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,200
 We did get locked in that room."

241
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,080
 And he said, as he's come back, and again after his friend talked about it, as he has come

242
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:41,800
 back to visit home when he's in the Melbourne area, one day he ran into a few teachers.

243
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,960
 I must have been a school function because who else wants to hang out with teachers?

244
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,160
 He talked to a couple of teachers and he was like, "Hey, yeah, remember me, Tony?

245
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,720
 I was that guy who didn't have any friends and I didn't talk to anyone that much.

246
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,400
 Um, what was up with that whole thing?

247
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,800
 Remember when you guys made us all go into that big area and we moved the lockers in front

248
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
 of the doors?"

249
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,080
 Because the wolves showed up?

250
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,080
 That can't be true, right?"

251
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,640
 And he said he talked to a couple of different teachers about this and all of them were like,

252
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,760
 "That never happened.

253
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
 That never happened."

254
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,640
 He's like, "Well, yeah, I didn't think so either.

255
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,520
 I thought I was just dreaming it."

256
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,520
 But one of my friends said that he remembered the wolves as well.

257
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
 So what was that?

258
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,720
 And the teachers would first deny it.

259
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,720
 They'd be like, "It didn't happen."

260
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,280
 And then they would say, "Quit asking me.

261
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,680
 Quit asking me questions about.

262
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,520
 Quit asking me questions about that time we locked you into that room for hours on end."

263
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,320
 It was nothing.

264
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,920
 Don't ask about it and it never happened.

265
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,440
 Which has made Tony, of course, on the beginning of us even more suspicious.

266
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,120
 And Tony started to think, "Listen, the most logical thing is that there was some madman

267
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,360
 in there with a gun."

268
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,720
 But he goes, "I tried looking up news articles to see if there was any reporting of like

269
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,240
 a crazy criminal with a gun or something happening and there's nothing.

270
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,240
 I couldn't find anything that mentioned my school and wolves or my school and an armed

271
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
 intruder."

272
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,400
 Both of those would make the news.

273
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,560
 Both of those would make the news.

274
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,440
 If wolves invaded your school, especially wolves weren't native to your country, it'd be, you

275
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,720
 know, that you start the news program like that.

276
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,800
 Because it's scary and journalists love scaring you.

277
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
 News people love scaring you.

278
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,680
 But anyways, yeah, he could never find anything about this.

279
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,760
 He knows that it happened because there are two people.

280
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,920
 He remembered it and then thought it was a dream and then someone else mentioned it

281
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,160
 and then other people that were in the know, you know, teachers, they are like, "It never

282
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,720
 happened and quit asking me about it."

283
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,640
 It's interesting because he posted this online.

284
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,000
 Somebody posted this under the name Will ZY.

285
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,640
 And a couple other people brought up, this is kind of the most common theory, because

286
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,360
 basically he's like, "What could this have been?"

287
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
 And this is the only, I shouldn't say the only possible one.

288
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,940
 This is the most probable one.

289
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:11,680
 And that is there was an estranged parent who came in to get their kid.

290
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,120
 And the reason why that makes sense is because you wouldn't reveal that.

291
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,920
 You wouldn't reveal that to the student body.

292
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,320
 You probably wouldn't reveal that to the parents as well.

293
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,560
 Because here's the thing, like let's say if they're like, "Hey guys, you have to be

294
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,520
 quiet and hide in this room because Judy's dad is an alcoholic nutcase and he's coming

295
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,000
 to take Judy no matter what."

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,960
 Now you've just revealed all of Judy's dirty laundry.

297
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,120
 Everyone's going to be talking about how Judy has a dad who can't stop drinking and

298
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
 it's a nutcase.

299
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
 They actually use that term.

300
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,640
 He's a nutcase kids.

301
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
 You know what I mean?

302
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,960
 Like you wouldn't want to gossip like that.

303
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,280
 So it's possible.

304
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,400
 But here's the thing with that.

305
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,720
 The school may have not revealed that information to the students.

306
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,800
 They may have had a dangerous individual in the sense that they were dangerous to the people

307
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,320
 they were looking for and anyone trying to stop them.

308
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,800
 So walking around looking for his daughter and you happen to be the custodian, you're

309
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,640
 listening to your headphones.

310
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,480
 You don't hear a guy walking around and he's like, "Go Judy!

311
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,200
 Judy, it's your paw!

312
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
 Come on out!

313
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,320
 Apparently, apparently I'm a hillbilly.

314
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,480
 I have a hillbilly voice."

315
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,520
 And the custodian doesn't hear that and then he bumps into Judy's dad and Judy's dad

316
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,320
 strangles him.

317
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,600
 "Sorry Judy, sorry to out your nutcase homicidal dad."

318
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,040
 Then I mean I guess if it wasn't any match for the wolves as well.

319
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,320
 He's walking around with his headphones on.

320
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,040
 The point is, you would not reveal that to the kids but you would have to reveal that

321
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,760
 to the other parents.

322
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,400
 Those kids would go home and parents would go, "How was school today?"

323
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,560
 And they're like, "Uh, it was absolutely terrifying.

324
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,880
 A bunch of wolves showed up and we were locked in a common area."

325
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,040
 Obviously, the parents are going to call the school.

326
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,440
 They're not going to be like, "Oh, that's interesting."

327
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,440
 Well at work, we were beset upon by a flock of peacocks.

328
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,600
 No, the parents are going to be like, "Wait, what'd you say?"

329
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,320
 And then they're going to call the school and be like, "Why is my son telling me that

330
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,240
 he got locked in a room because wolves were after him?"

331
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,560
 And the school can't just be like, "Oh, I don't want to talk about it and quit asking

332
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
 questions."

333
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,800
 The parents are going to be like, "No, tell us."

334
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:38,080
 And the school would say, "Well, we had a situation with a girl's father walking around."

335
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,040
 The custodian was strangled to death but don't worry, everyone else was safe.

336
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,320
 That's what Tony should ask honestly.

337
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,480
 That's what I would do if I was Tony.

338
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,240
 I would ask my parents and be like, "Hey, remember that time when I told you when I came home

339
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,520
 directly from school and told you I was locked in a room because of wolves?"

340
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,000
 What was that?

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
 You guys remember that?

342
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,960
 And here's a grief of our...

343
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
 Imagine if his parents go, "No, we don't remember that."

344
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
 And he's like, "No, I'm pretty sure I told you."

345
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,680
 And they go, "Shhh."

346
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,880
 Quit asking questions.

347
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
 It never happened.

348
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,480
 That would be absolutely terrifying.

349
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,360
 That's going to be the official ending to my Goosebumps novel, Wolves in the School.

350
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 Question mark?

351
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
 By J.C. Stein.

352
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
 Don't steal it.

353
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,360
 Don't steal that mediocre idea.

354
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,360
 Sergio, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbenter compter.

355
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,960
 We are leaving behind Melbourne, Australia.

356
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:39,160
 Why is it all the way out to a house in the suburbs?

357
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:49,720
 The year is 2015 and a family is hopping out of a car in front of a house.

358
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 Maybe it's beautiful.

359
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,680
 They did not describe it, but imagine it.

360
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
 It's a nice looking house.

361
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,400
 It's not a rundown beater.

362
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,880
 There's no wolves anywhere nearby.

363
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,880
 It's a nice house.

364
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:10,040
 And this young woman, we're going to call her Amanda, is breathing a sigh after a long

365
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,000
 trip going, "Finally, we're home."

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 She didn't say that.

367
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,320
 She didn't say it was a long trip.

368
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,640
 She didn't say she sighed heavily either.

369
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,880
 But you know, creative license.

370
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,400
 She gets out of the car and she's like, "Ah, yes, home.

371
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,000
 The place that I've wondered about for so long."

372
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,800
 She goes on this 10 minute monologue in deep description of the home.

373
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,280
 Amanda's just moving into this home with her family.

374
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,680
 She has a mom and a dad and then a...

375
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,780
 Amanda's not her real name.

376
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,400
 She goes online by the name KindlyDirt5752.

377
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,200
 We're going to call her Amanda.

378
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
 She has a brother.

379
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
 She doesn't name him.

380
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,080
 We're going to call him Brian.

381
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,040
 Her 15 year old brother, Brian, gets out of the car as well.

382
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,760
 And he takes in a deep breath of fresh air.

383
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
 "Ah, yes.

384
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
 Oxygen.

385
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,040
 My favorite treat in the morning.

386
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,960
 A little bit of oxygen straight into the lungs."

387
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,600
 They're moving into this house.

388
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,200
 Amanda says previously, so they're moving into 2015.

389
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,160
 Previously, this house was owned by a pastor and his family.

390
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,400
 So you know, you figure.

391
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,720
 It's probably pretty nice kept up place, right?

392
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,520
 Men of the cloth are not known to have cockroach infestations or leave feces in holes in the

393
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
 wall.

394
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,320
 You know, an upstanding guy, generally speaking.

395
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,400
 And so they walk into this house and everything's going to be okay.

396
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,520
 And she said, "Brian, he's a good guy.

397
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,920
 Really good student.

398
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,120
 Just kind of, you know, like a normal dude.

399
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,440
 Even crazy about him at all.

400
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,280
 And no history of mental illness."

401
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,680
 And Amanda says they've lived there for eight years in this home.

402
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:05,640
 And each year, Brian got a little more mentally ill.

403
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,480
 Now you may not notice it the first year, right?

404
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,120
 When Brian comes home from school and they're like, "He's all hallucinating wolves."

405
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,240
 He's like, "I'm being attacked by wolves.

406
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
 Lock the school down.

407
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
 Lock the school down."

408
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
 And they're like, "What?"

409
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,520
 He's not that mentally ill right off the bat.

410
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,440
 He's actually really not that mentally ill by the end.

411
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,280
 But anyways, so at first, he was just a little mentally ill.

412
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,840
 And you would think, "Oh, you know, growing pains.

413
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
 Growing pains.

414
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,880
 All teenage boys go through that thing where they think they're being attacked by bats

415
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,120
 in the bath."

416
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,320
 I really shouldn't have be laughing at this.

417
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,920
 For eight, let me just keep making jokes.

418
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,600
 Let's just skip ahead a bit.

419
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,800
 Each year, for eight years, he got worse and worse and worse.

420
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,320
 I'm not going to go into detail because he started to, this is what he was actually doing.

421
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,480
 He wasn't having full on hallucinations.

422
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,960
 But anyways, first, he would just stay in his room all the time, which was out of character

423
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
 for Brian.

424
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,840
 I stay isolated from people for long periods of time.

425
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
 I like to be alone.

426
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,240
 But it was out of character for Brian.

427
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,240
 And he also liked to sit in the dark with no lights on, which was also out of character

428
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,120
 for Brian and really most people.

429
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,320
 And before you go, "Oh, I like sitting in the dark.

430
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,240
 I like to just watch movies."

431
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,000
 He wasn't watching movies.

432
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,880
 He wasn't playing his Switch.

433
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,560
 He wasn't on his laptop.

434
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,200
 He would sit in a pitch black room for hours on end.

435
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,680
 I wouldn't, that doesn't necessarily make you mentally ill.

436
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,840
 But if it's not what you normally do, it is weird.

437
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,000
 I mean, if that's something you're like, "I love sitting in the pitch dark.

438
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
 Refreshes my eyeballs cold sleep.

439
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
 Do it eight hours a day.

440
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
 Am I mentally ill?"

441
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,280
 You're all like going on a WebMD to check your symptoms.

442
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,920
 No, you're fine.

443
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,000
 But again, if it's out of character for you, that's when you start to look at some sort

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,240
 of mental illness.

445
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,520
 He got rid of his phone and his television set.

446
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,560
 He's like, "Give these out of here.

447
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,800
 I'm just going to sit in the dark."

448
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,680
 And he sits in the dark again.

449
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,160
 I don't have a television.

450
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
 No more.

451
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
 It's actually right here on the floor.

452
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
 I'm touching it with my foot.

453
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,760
 I just keep it here just in case I want to watch something.

454
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,960
 And I never do.

455
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,040
 So just sitting on my floor in the middle of the living room.

456
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,840
 You're like, "Jason, I think you can easily be classified as mentally insane for a numerous

457
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,280
 amount of reasons."

458
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,440
 Anyways, now, if all of a sudden your boy starts sitting in the dark all the time, he's a teenager,

459
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,280
 you think maybe he's going through a goth phase.

460
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,280
 He doesn't know how to do it right.

461
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,160
 You're like, "Hey, Brian, you're supposed to dress in all black, not exist in all black."

462
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,400
 That's whatever.

463
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,120
 Someone wants to be alone in a pitch black room, whatever.

464
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,240
 He also then starts to hear voices and see shadows.

465
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,120
 It's going to be hard in a pitch black room.

466
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,200
 I'm telling you, this is not supposed to be a funny story.

467
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,560
 I did not plan on this me laughing so much.

468
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,560
 I don't know why I'm finding it so amusing.

469
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
 But it's true.

470
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:28,480
 It would be kind of hard to see shadow people in a pitch black room, but I digress.

471
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,880
 He's hearing voices.

472
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,960
 He's seeing shadow people.

473
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,760
 At this point now, you're thinking, "Now he's hallucinating.

474
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,840
 It's not just about being in the dark.

475
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,480
 Now he has an active psychological problem."

476
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,040
 He would also have these quick changes in personality.

477
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:53,200
 One example that Amanda gave was that within one minute, he would switch topics.

478
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,680
 Amanda said one day he was talking to Mom and he was telling Mom how he had sold his

479
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,120
 soul to the devil.

480
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,920
 Within a minute, he switches to talking Bible quotes.

481
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,840
 He's quoting the Bible.

482
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,760
 So it's just kind of jarring.

483
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,120
 Also, if you're just sitting there and your son comes downstairs and says, "I sold my

484
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:23,320
 soul to Lucifer," that in and of itself is pretty alarming.

485
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,760
 He also talked about being abducted by aliens.

486
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:33,720
 Now, I know that all of this stuff I talk about on this show, I understand that.

487
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,120
 I've talked about all of these subjects on the show, but this was alarming.

488
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,480
 Again, I've been talking about this stuff since I was a kid.

489
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,600
 We did that recent episode about that possible spy ring in Canada and what was alarming to

490
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 the family.

491
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,480
 I'll put it in the show notes, but what was alarming to the non-spies of the family was

492
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,200
 everything was totally fine for five years.

493
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,360
 This woman had married this guy and then last Christmas he's like, "I hate Christmas and

494
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,520
 I don't want to celebrate Christmas anymore and I'm going to make it miserable for everyone.

495
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,000
 Also I don't work on Saturdays."

496
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,040
 That all happened within a week.

497
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,280
 He'd been one person for five years and all of a sudden he's like, "Nope, not working

498
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,240
 at all on Saturdays and I hate Christmas."

499
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,680
 So that's alarming.

500
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,280
 If over time he'd been like, "You know what?

501
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,760
 Saturdays are too nice to work on."

502
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,920
 And then a year later he's like, "Man, I really miss having Saturdays."

503
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,160
 And then by year five he's like, "I'm not working on Saturdays anymore."

504
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
 That's fine.

505
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,160
 That's totally like a legit slow morphine.

506
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,760
 I'm not saying that you're only doing one thing a year.

507
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,520
 You're like, "Oh man, I really wanted to start this hobby, but Jason said I have to just

508
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,400
 do a little bit each year.

509
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,280
 You want to build a model train set.

510
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,840
 You just have one wheel."

511
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,280
 You're like, "Oh, see you next year model train."

512
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,480
 You know what I mean?

513
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,040
 And then to hate Christmas.

514
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,280
 People will slowly just be like, "I'm over it.

515
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,840
 I'm tired of all the consumerism.

516
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,280
 I'm just not going to do Christmas this year."

517
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,480
 My Christmas trees got smaller and smaller.

518
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,760
 They just disappeared.

519
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
 They did.

520
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,800
 I used to buy a little Christmas tree and then it would just get smaller and smaller.

521
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,680
 And then I was like, "Whatever, I'm just done."

522
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
 Not done with Christmas.

523
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,160
 I love Christmas, but what do I need a tiny Christmas tree for?

524
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,840
 The point is, is that he talked about all this stuff.

525
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,280
 It all really kind of came out of the blue.

526
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,720
 As opposed to someone who talks about this stuff for years.

527
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,200
 It's less insane.

528
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,120
 It's less insane if you talk about selling your soul to the devil.

529
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,320
 I've never sold my soul to the devil.

530
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,440
 I'm not saying that, but I'm talking about these topics.

531
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
 I've talked about them for years.

532
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,840
 That's far less insane than just blurting them out in the middle of the night.

533
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:50,800
 Anyways, eventually he is either forced to seek treatment or get a diagnosis or he willingly

534
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,320
 went, but he ended up getting diagnosed with schizophrenia, psychosis, and bipolar disorder,

535
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,280
 among others, Amanda says.

536
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
 That wasn't it.

537
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:09,200
 He got diagnosed with all of this stuff and then he got arrested.

538
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,040
 Amanda doesn't say what charge he was arrested on.

539
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,640
 Pick your poison, right?

540
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,320
 But she said he got arrested generally when people don't say why it's the bad ones.

541
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,800
 If you robbed a bank, tax evasion or something like that stole a car, we would tell people

542
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 that.

543
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,600
 We would be like, "Yeah, my buddy got caught robbing a bank."

544
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,800
 I think even murdered too.

545
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,520
 As long as it wasn't somebody you knew.

546
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,640
 You'd be like, "Yeah, my buddy, he's doing time for murder."

547
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,480
 It's when you go, "I don't want to talk about it.

548
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
 I don't want to talk about it."

549
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
 It was wolf related.

550
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
 It was wolf related.

551
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,000
 I don't want to talk about it.

552
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 "Hey, what happened to your buddy?

553
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 I don't want to talk about it.

554
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 You got arrested."

555
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 That's the end of it.

556
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 That's when you think the worst.

557
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Right?

558
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,880
 That's when you think, "Oh my God, what did this guy do?"

559
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,720
 Anyways, he gets arrested and Amanda says, "Listen, he was going to be gone for a while."

560
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,040
 The family decided that since he wouldn't be coming home for a while, we're going to

561
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
 clean his room.

562
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,840
 We're going to go in and get it all organized.

563
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,400
 Do you imagine it would be a big mess?

564
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,560
 There's no lights on.

565
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,240
 There could be soda cans everywhere in pizza boxes crawling with cockroaches.

566
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
 You wouldn't know.

567
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,960
 It wouldn't really bug you because you couldn't see them.

568
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:31,120
 They also started leaving his door open and the light on.

569
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,600
 It's interesting.

570
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
 She doesn't specifically...

571
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,240
 I don't think it's a passive-aggressive thing.

572
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,600
 I feel like it's almost...

573
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,320
 The family decided that it was like a cleansing.

574
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,280
 She doesn't specifically say that either, but it could be subconsciously trying to cleanse

575
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,760
 the room in some way by exposing it to light.

576
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
 But they leave the door open.

577
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
 They leave the light on.

578
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,080
 They're cleaning the room.

579
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:04,600
 What the family starts to realize is it is possible that Brian was not alone in that room.

580
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,880
 She says that they begin noticing scratches in the carpet.

581
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,120
 Which is interesting.

582
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,040
 I don't really know how that works, how you scratch a carpet.

583
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,360
 But I mean, I guess if you scratched it hard enough, you could.

584
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,800
 And she said they were inhuman scratches.

585
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,120
 So it's not like someone was walking around and they didn't clip their toenails for a

586
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
 bit.

587
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,040
 They're cleaning up his room on their hands and knees and they're scratching the carpet

588
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
 up.

589
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:40,440
 So they were inhuman scratches and they would see him on the carpet and they would fix them.

590
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,080
 Maybe it's like a thick carpet and you could kind of tell.

591
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,080
 I don't know.

592
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,920
 Anyway, she's saying that there's inhuman scratches on the carpet and they would like

593
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
 fix them.

594
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
 They're re-sewing.

595
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
 They're re-sewing the carpet.

596
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,400
 How do you make a carpet actually?

597
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,800
 Now that I think about it.

598
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,360
 Anyway, she says there's inhuman scratches on the carpet.

599
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,960
 They repair them.

600
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,920
 They fix it.

601
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,080
 And then a new set of scratch marks would appear.

602
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:15,440
 And she said as late as February 4th, 2023, Brown stains began to appear on the walls

603
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,640
 of the room.

604
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,040
 We've talked about this a lot on this show because it's one of the most terrifying things

605
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,080
 for me and I'm not going to talk for too long about it.

606
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,680
 But listen, I know mental illness is a real thing.

607
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,280
 I know mental illness is a real thing and millions of people struggle with it every

608
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
 single day.

609
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,480
 And some people struggle with it for the rest of their lives or for their entire lives.

610
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
 It's awful.

611
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,000
 A lot of people are able to live good lives even though they have it.

612
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,400
 But I do believe mental illnesses are real.

613
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,520
 I'm not trying to imply anything by what I'm about to say.

614
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:04,760
 What I'm going to say is I do think that supernatural events can, yes, be a symptom of mental illness.

615
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,320
 There's obviously people who are mentally ill who think they are seeing things that aren't

616
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,960
 there and they aren't seeing ghosts or shadow people or aliens or anything like that.

617
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,120
 They're hallucinating.

618
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,240
 They're having delusions, gangstalking.

619
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,280
 It's a perfect example of that.

620
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,080
 But I also believe that supernatural events can, I think they can, I don't want to say

621
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,800
 cause mental illness because I think that that's different.

622
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 That's implying something different.

623
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,200
 I think they can induce mental illness.

624
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,040
 You're like Jason, come on, that's a wiggle word.

625
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:46,240
 I think that if you have somebody who is either prone to being mentally ill, you know, the

626
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,800
 sad thing is, is that he is right in that age group.

627
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,600
 He was 15 when they moved in.

628
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,760
 It's eight years later, so he would be, you know, about 23 now.

629
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,360
 That's the age group where schizophrenia begins to show up in young men.

630
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,040
 So he's right in that danger zone for that.

631
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,920
 But I mean, I don't think that every mentally ill person is possessed by a demon.

632
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,840
 I don't think every case of mental illness is caused by a demon, but I do think that

633
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:26,360
 dealing with these types of entities can, it can induce mental illness in people.

634
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,480
 Whether they are prone to it and this type of entity is speeding it along or they were

635
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,760
 never going to suffer from any of these mental illnesses because there's no history of this

636
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
 in the family.

637
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,560
 There technically doesn't have to be, but it's obviously, if you're predisposed to

638
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,600
 it, the chances of you having a severe mental illness is higher.

639
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,480
 I do think you could take somebody, controversial statement probably, but I'm not on YouTube,

640
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,880
 so it doesn't matter.

641
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,000
 I think you can take somebody who has no history of mental illness and would not be mentally

642
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
 ill in the future.

643
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,680
 How do they not cross a supernatural entity?

644
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,720
 I do believe that demons and other supernatural entities can cause mental illness.

645
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:14,640
 At the very least, interacting with these type of entities looks a lot like mental illness.

646
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,800
 I remember when I first started seeing Shadow People, we talked about it on the show, I

647
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,640
 thought I was going crazy because I was seeing stuff that shouldn't exist.

648
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:28,200
 I legit thought I was losing my mind and I was so worried about it.

649
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,920
 Same thing when I started seeing ghosts, there's two separate times because there are really

650
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,240
 two separate types of entities.

651
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,960
 I thought I'm losing my mind.

652
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
 These things don't exist.

653
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,240
 I never saw these things until I'm 17, which was when I first started seeing ghosts and

654
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,520
 hearing ghosts and I knew I was right in that age group for when schizophrenia starts to

655
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,200
 show up and I thought I was losing my mind.

656
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:00,480
 The fact that just by interacting with these things simulates psychosis, I do believe that

657
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,000
 they can induce it as well.

658
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,680
 Do we know if that's the case here?

659
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,440
 That's kind of what Amanda seemed to be getting at.

660
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,560
 He did get diagnosed with all those mental illnesses, but there was something else in

661
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,800
 that room that was with him.

662
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,320
 How much of those actions were Brian individually making, shutting off the lights, cutting himself

663
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,680
 off from society, not having a phone or a television?

664
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,040
 How much of that was him?

665
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,040
 Because it's super out of character for him and how much of it was this entity in that

666
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
 room.

667
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,240
 I think it's super interesting.

668
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,880
 I was kind of being playful about it in the beginning that a man of the cloth, a pastor

669
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,440
 in his family, wouldn't have any poop in the walls or any sort.

670
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,040
 They would treat the house nice and things like that.

671
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,560
 That may be true.

672
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,000
 But remember, pastors, men of the cloth of any religion, they're on the front line.

673
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:11,480
 They're the ones that if a spirit, if a demon can corrupt the person of the pulpit, they

674
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,760
 can corrupt an entire congregation.

675
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,960
 So while the house may look nice because the pastor and his family have to keep up appearances,

676
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,080
 there could have been extremely dark forces in that house living along with them.

677
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:33,680
 Maybe they even invited it in with them.

678
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,880
 But when they left that spirit, that creature, that demon stayed behind, knowing it would

679
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:48,600
 have a fresh victim to feed off of.

680
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:55,360
 Brian was a young man with a bright future ahead of him.

681
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:03,400
 And hopefully he will be able to regain that future and take control of his life.

682
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:14,880
 The question is, will he regain reality through medical professionals and medication, therapy

683
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,720
 and treatment?

684
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:26,360
 Or will all those things fail because a dark entity has attached itself to his soul?

685
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,240
 It doesn't show up on an x-ray.

686
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,200
 It doesn't show up in a blood test.

687
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,520
 But it's there.

688
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:45,040
 It's possible that Brian not only needs to heal his mind, but also needs to save his

689
00:37:45,040 --> 00:38:06,160
 own soul.

690
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,160
 Thank you.

691
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:35,440
 Thank you.

692
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,020
 (upbeat music)

693
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:48,020
