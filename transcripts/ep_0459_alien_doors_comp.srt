00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 Hey guys, huge news just came up. So as I'm getting ready to record

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,920
 The episode today Wednesday's episode really I get a Facebook message from Beatrice Leiva Beatrice Leiva

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,200
 I think that's how you pronounce it. I'm not for sure and I'm sorry if I mispronounce it like I mispronounce everything

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,240
 But I get this message this huge news

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:27,680
 Beatrice, thank you so much forest fins treasure has been found forest fins treasure has been found now

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,760
 Today's episode and tomorrow's episode they were pre-recorded a lot of times I do that over the weekend

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,240
 Just save myself some time and some headache

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,860
 So in an upcoming episode we are fully going to look into the fact that I was wrong. I was wrong

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,800
 I will always admit I was wrong. I said forest fin didn't have a treasure. I said the whole thing

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:53,000
 Apparently forest fins treasure has been found. So this is a little update to that. We'll get into it later in the week

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,960
 Thank you so much Beatrice for bringing this to my attention. We'll get into this

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,040
 Listen to today's episode, but we'll talk about this on Wednesday episode

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,240
 We're gonna talk about forest fins treasure being found enjoy today's episode and thanks Beatrice

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:15,960
 Is it possible that you are the only person on the internet and then we take a look at a truly terrifying

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,200
 alien encounter

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,480
 What happened on the ride home today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,480
 *Music*

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:36,120
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,080
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna hop right into it first off

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,480
 I want to give a shout out to our newest at your own supporter Paul Martinez

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,000
 Paul Martinez you are going to be our pilot our

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,320
 Shofur you're gonna be our bodyguard for this episode. We really really appreciate it that you're supporting the show

24
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,360
 If you can't support the show via patreon, that's okay too. Just help get the word out about the show that helps a ton

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,800
 Also, we have a merch store. I always neglect to talk about the merch store

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,080
 So if you can't support the patreon, but you do have some extra money you want some cool Dead Rabbit swag

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,480
 Check out the merch store in the links below. I never mentioned it. It's been around for a while

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,200
 Let's go ahead and get started here

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 Paul we are gonna start off

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,280
 Let's hop in we're gonna get into Jason Jalopy, but it's digitized

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 It's like that Tron machine

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,960
 shoots it and makes it we should have been in the car while I was doing this we have to run we jump into the beam

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,960
 We get digitized now Paul we're driving through the cyber freeways at the time

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,100
 This is what's they called information super highway. Was that the old term? What?

35
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,000
 cyberspace you guys are like how old are you Jason?

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,440
 Yeah, I know there's like surfing the web, but wasn't there an old term like I think it was information super highway

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,400
 You're like shaking your head. You're like no, it's not anyways. We're driving our car. It's total like lawnmower man graphics

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,820
 Everything's all blocky. I will control you

39
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,600
 Or I'm your god. Whatever he says. I don't even know the reference

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,200
 Paul's driving our digitized Jason Jalopy through this 3d 1990s level computer graphic landscape

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,400
 So Paul keep going down the super information highway see that super information off ramp

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 You we stop at a super information Denny's and eat some digitized food, but we notice something we notice something

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,920
 There's not a lot of people in this digitized Denny's maybe because they have better taste in food

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,840
 But no that can't be it Denny's is delicious as we're drinking a car off of digitized wine

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,600
 It's just ones and zeros, but it looks so good. There's a conspiracy theory going around this is straight from the conspiracy theory iceberg

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,600
 It's no one as empty internet

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,440
 And the conspiracy theory is what it sounds like basically there's far less people on the internet

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,000
 Than you would believe it doesn't sound super compelling at first glance

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,600
 But something about it makes you a little suspicious, right?

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:08,640
 Something about it makes you a little suspicious because the thing with the internet is it gives you the illusion of communicating with other people

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,960
 But you can never really prove anyone else is there

52
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,160
 You have the sneaking suspicion now when we're back in the real world when we're not digitized

53
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,680
 And we're on the bus or walking downtown or at school. We see everyone on their phone

54
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,520
 So you go they must be on the internet the internet must be full of people everyone uses the internet

55
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,000
 I use the internet. I go to the internet. It seems populated, but in the back of your mind you think

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,400
 Maybe that's not the case

57
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,040
 Now I could go over a ton of statistics now when saying that that means that I did research

58
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
 And I have a ton of statistics how many people actually use the internet

59
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,640
 And how many people upload videos to youtube every hour stuff like that those those are pretty common statistics

60
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
 I'm not gonna bore you with those

61
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,960
 But there's two

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,080
 Items that we really want to look at here two items that may make the empty internet conspiracy theory

63
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,480
 Actually true paul pay pay my digitized bill, but you have to pay with real money. We're leaving denies now

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,640
 We're gonna take a look at this conspiracy known as the empty internet. Also. I want to give a shout out real quick

65
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,200
 There was a twitter user known as some weirdo on twitter aka jack

66
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,600
 Jack actually listened to all the episodes of the show and went through the conspiracy theory iceberg

67
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,840
 Created an excel spreadsheet of all of the topics i've covered so far

68
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,960
 All the topics you have to be covered that was a huge amount of work. I really really appreciated it

69
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,480
 something that I have wanted to do or have done

70
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,800
 by someone else

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,840
 And he took it upon himself and asked him to do it. That's absolutely amazing. I wanted to thank you so much for that

72
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,480
 I know it took a ton of work if you look in the show notes from now on it'll say archivist

73
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,560
 Some weirdo on twitter aka jack because I really appreciate it. I know that took a lot of work

74
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,160
 So I appreciate that

75
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
 As our official archivist there's a little digitized jack waving at us also

76
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,920
 Oddly enough a year ago a different listener named jack actually wanted me to cover empty internet theory

77
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,960
 And the reason why I waited so long is because it's one of those things like I said

78
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,560
 It kind of you kind of feel that it's true, but it's kind of a feeling

79
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,880
 There's recently come to my attention some evidence that may make this theory a little more than just another

80
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
 series of words on the conspiracy theory iceberg

81
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,480
 Something that I noticed recently and I found this very fascinating is that

82
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,880
 twitter gets 145 million visitors daily

83
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,520
 This is where we get our statistics out. So sorry guys, but this is important

84
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,880
 According to the pew research center 10 percent of twitter users make 80 percent of the posts and I remember when that came out

85
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,040
 and twitter is

86
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,440
 Super oh, they really it's oversized importance in today's society if something goes trending

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,400
 Companies will cut sponsorship deals

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,720
 Something goes trending

89
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,040
 policies can change in the government

90
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,240
 But 10 percent of the users on twitter create 80 percent of the tweets. There's 145 million visitors daily on twitter

91
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,360
 So let's break that down 10 percent. That's 14 million people and every day. There's 500 million tweets

92
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,840
 That means those 14 million people. They're tweeting 35 tweets a day simply that number

93
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,640
 14 million people putting out 35 tweets a day can reshape

94
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,280
 business and government

95
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,080
 14 million people a day that that would be an incredibly small country. That would be a large

96
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,560
 massive city

97
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,920
 But a small country is able to affect the policies

98
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,240
 Of the government and of corporations. So right there

99
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
 You have this site you think of twitter as being

100
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,880
 The marketplace of ideas you have it where people go and just kind of say what's on their mind

101
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,960
 That was kind of how it was set up

102
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,920
 But that's not how it is now 10 of the people 14 million people

103
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,560
 Can affect massive change and again sometimes it's just a company going

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,600
 We we don't we don't want to be involved in this controversy. We're out

105
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,120
 So that in a sense creates this idea of an empty internet

106
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,240
 It seems like it's this bustling thing when you look at it

107
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
 But most of those are coming from 14 million people

108
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,360
 So it's not at twitter is not as massive as we think it is a lot of people start twitter accounts

109
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,040
 Never use them. They never read them. They may check it because they get a message sometimes. I had a twitter account for years

110
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,920
 Never used it at all. I didn't start using it until I started doing this show

111
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
 So it's empty

112
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,640
 It's a bunch of people talking to each other and then talking to one person all of a sudden they go from having

113
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,560
 No interaction to 10 interactions and they go whoa, whoa, I better do I better change something

114
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,240
 Because if these 10 people hit me up when the rest of them are coming

115
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,280
 So that kind of gives you a sense of how we see the empty but that's not really what we mean by empty internet. Is it

116
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,920
 empty internet is more of a

117
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
 idea that

118
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,360
 There's no one else not even 14 million people

119
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,240
 Putting stuff out on twitter. It's just you. It's just you. You're the only person

120
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,280
 The truth lies somewhere in between just you you're the only person using the internet and then a small group of people

121
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,800
 Controlling one of the biggest mouthpieces on the internet the empty internet

122
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,320
 Kind of floats somewhere in the middle there because I know I'm on the internet. I know other people on the internet

123
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,840
 You can't just say there's one person but is there something in the middle there?

124
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,520
 Is there something is the truth closer to the middle? Let's take a look at this

125
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,800
 There's a subreddit. No one is shills and this is their mission statement

126
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,480
 Exposing corporate and government shills on social media. So they're basically going out and looking for

127
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,280
 things being socially

128
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,560
 blown up

129
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,520
 by

130
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
 astroturf campaigns

131
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,400
 shoe company wants to make a statement they create

132
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,880
 Fake accounts to make it look like their new shoe is going to be totally awesome. That's what this group does. That's what the subreddit goes

133
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,840
 There's a username for friend dongles for friend dongles

134
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,720
 And for friend dongles did a little investigation into this

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,200
 So he created a reddit post and it was called what I've learned fishing for shill ip's and this was written two years ago

136
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
 He wanted to track down

137
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,480
 Some shills he wanted to track them back to their corporate overlords to just expose them see

138
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,400
 You know, it's basically a thought exercise. Maybe maybe he could expose some stuff

139
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,080
 He said that what happens is these guys tend to have this thing the service called amazon aws

140
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,960
 It's like a server farm as he described it

141
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,360
 So even if you can track it back to there it allows someone to use one mobile device to access tons of accounts

142
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,320
 So you can track it to the server farm, but you're never going to find out the actual ip of who owns it

143
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,640
 That's fairly normal. That's fairly normal. And what he did was he created a post

144
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,120
 That said this is your face

145
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,600
 I had a little link to just a random youtube video

146
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,080
 So you'd click on it now when you click the link it'll allow him to track your ip

147
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,240
 Take you to a certain website to allow you to track your ip

148
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,280
 But he figured it's just going to go to amazon aws. I just want to see if there are any patterns

149
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,920
 So let's take a look at one of these statements he made quote

150
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,680
 So I noticed that when I was wrong and contacted a real person as opposed to a show as opposed to a show

151
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,120
 So I noticed that when I was wrong and had contacted a real person

152
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,080
 It took them a humanish amount of time to click the link

153
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,080
 Maybe five ten minutes when you send the link to a shill though the response is immediate

154
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,720
 I'm talking like in the time it takes you to hit send on the bait message and click over to refresh the ip logger page

155
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
 They had already clicked that happens every single time

156
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,640
 Think about what that means for a bit. So he says that he thought it was weird. He's sending it to these people and sometimes

157
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,720
 They would sit in their inbox

158
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,000
 Sometimes it'd be immediate. He'd go to the refresh page. See that they clicked it

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,920
 He goes maybe it's a glitch with

160
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,000
 How I have this set up so he started sending them to his friends and says hey, I'm doing this ip logger thing

161
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,240
 He sent some to his own dummy accounts

162
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,240
 And sure enough it would take the the buddy to go open up the document click the link

163
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,800
 Show up in his ip logger when he'd do it. He would go over to his account click the link

164
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,920
 Check there would be a period of time where he had to log out of one thing go to the other thing

165
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,600
 Click the link, but there were accounts he would send it to and it would immediately get clicked

166
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,280
 So it made you start to think who's clicking these so quickly

167
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,560
 It's not a web crawler

168
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,160
 Someone is clicking this link on a heartbeat and he realizes

169
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:33,920
 That his idea that you had companies hiring these shills hiring these people to hype their products or to downplay other stuff

170
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,680
 He wasn't finding shills. He was finding an ai

171
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,360
 So you go okay links are automatically getting clicked, but that's not all that was going on take a look at this

172
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:54,960
 Here's another quote to test it. I sent a few shills messages that said the link in the body of this message will give me your ip

173
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,600
 On the assumption that a piece of their code is check links for context or something

174
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
 They still clicked with the same speed

175
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,800
 And

176
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,280
 Responded differently each time with things like you don't have my ip you little bitch or nice try shill

177
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,880
 Things like that seemingly baiting me into an organic seeming conversation

178
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,600
 You would not believe how often this happens

179
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:28,080
 We're talking major threads the top three posters each of them shills or at least the people who will click on a fishing link

180
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,040
 When you tell them to entire mod teams

181
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,520
 All of whom responded but one individual who said what the f?

182
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,760
 And that was it

183
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,600
 I cannot come up with a theory that takes into account all of those factors

184
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,480
 Other than to say that I think a good portion of shills are not real people

185
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,960
 And that you find shills at the top of many many of the threads that make it to the front page of reddit

186
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,400
 He's talking about

187
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,520
 Maybe they have real people that take over when a conversation can't be completed by script. I don't know

188
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,280
 But the fact remains you can tell a shill that a link will collect their ip and they will still click it

189
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,880
 After making this post

190
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,120
 His account was banned

191
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
 This is what we are talking about when we're talking about empty internet

192
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,280
 Did for friend dongles actually uncover this because it's not just that these links are getting clicked these are people

193
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:29,920
 Who he was having interactions with the top three posters of threads that were some of the biggest threads on reddit

194
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,520
 Is there an ai that has been developed by a company or multiple companies?

195
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,480
 That simulates human conversation

196
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,160
 Shills to promote a product to de-ongrade another product to push an agenda to hold back another agenda

197
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,200
 All of these competing ai's fighting for space

198
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,160
 And we're just going on checking our bank account laughing at memes

199
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,520
 Reading the news and all around us the internet seems like it's bustling with activity when in fact

200
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,920
 It's fake

201
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
 like a movie set

202
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,200
 It looks real, but when you get close and you dig into it, it's artificial sounds paranoid

203
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,040
 Sounds crazy, but you never really know who you're talking to

204
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,840
 But you always do assume you're talking to a human. Can you be sure?

205
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,600
 Let's go ahead and let's go ahead and leave this digitized world. You see digitized tumbleweed

206
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,880
 Starting to glitch out paul get the jason jalabi going. He's cranking it super hard

207
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,200
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

208
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:43,360
 We get in it the world starts to de-digitize faster faster

209
00:15:43,360 --> 00:16:03,360
 Show notes

210
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,080
 You can probably dig more into that. He actually says this is the program I use. Here's the links I use try it for yourself. It's super super spooky

211
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,240
 But you can do it. So

212
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,200
 Thank you jack for creating that conspiracy theory excel document

213
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,560
 Thank you other jack for recommending the story and paul

214
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,840
 Let's go ahead and hop in that carbonar copter. We are headed out to new york

215
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,640
 We're flying over the night sky rig. We're specifically going to

216
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,680
 Mow Hall Poc that's in puttnam county in new york. It's august 15th

217
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,840
 1984

218
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,800
 Helicopters flying through the dark night sky. It's 2 a.m. Helicopters flying through the dark morning sky

219
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,360
 I got this off a think about it dox.com one of my favorite websites for this type of stuff

220
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,840
 And it was reported by an author named phil

221
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,080
 in brogno

222
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,440
 So thank you phil for doing the ground research and thank you again think about it dox.com is such a great website

223
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 carbonar copters flying low

224
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,640
 Do is like landing on the propellers and it's like flying away and stuff like that

225
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,120
 There's a nameless couple driving out of the road. So let's give them names. We're going to call them pete and karen

226
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,440
 Yeah

227
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:23,360
 Cars driving down the dark road at night. Damnit dark road in the morning and they see a brush fire

228
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,000
 Out in the field. What was the guy's name again? Peter Peter?

229
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,160
 Jason okay, so peter if that's if that's your real name peter's driving the car karen's in the passenger seat

230
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,640
 Yeah, they see the fire

231
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,600
 Burning and peter wants to pull over and take a look at the fire now karen's like no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

232
00:17:39,600 --> 00:18:09,600

233
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,120
 And they take a little turn off and they're driving towards the fire and at that point

234
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,280
 Parks the car and it just does seem to be a little brush fires. Peter gets out of the car

235
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,200
 He's walking towards it. It's cold august morning and he sees lights coming up the road behind him

236
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,240
 He goes oh somebody must have contacted the authorities. This will be great. Maybe I'll just stop and talk to him go

237
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,960
 Hey, yeah, make sure they don't think that I actually started the fire

238
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,920
 And he sees the lights get close and they kind of come to a stop and he sees two officers get out of the car

239
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,600
 And he's like, oh, okay

240
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,880
 Yeah, all's well that ends well. I'm gonna take my girlfriend home and then he goes those aren't cops

241
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,200
 Those are kids

242
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,600
 Because this he get closer and he's starting to see the silhouettes get a little more defined

243
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,200
 He notices they're under five feet tall

244
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,480
 Children

245
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,200
 And the two figures are starting to walk slowly towards him and panic sets in because at that point peter realizes

246
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,640
 They're not children. They are what we expect because we're listening to dead rabbit radio two gray aliens

247
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,600
 They do have a bit of a different feature. He said the eyeball they have the big large head

248
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
 long skinny arms

249
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
 giant black eyes, but he said the eyes were

250
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,800
 Wrapping around the side of the head like an insects eyeballs

251
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,560
 So a little more of a sleek design than your average gray alien

252
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,200
 He doesn't have time to take in the craftsmanship

253
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,640
 Of these aliens the aerodynamic nature of their head

254
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,160
 He runs back to the car. He wasn't far to begin with but

255
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,800
 Any any distance from your car is a mile when there's two gray aliens approaching you at 2 a.m

256
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,280
 In the middle of nowhere

257
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,920
 He he realizes in his soul that all they want is his girlfriend

258
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,760
 It's all they want

259
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
 He realizes that all they want is his girlfriend

260
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,000
 So he tells karen get in the back seat lay on the ground

261
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,280
 Throw that blanket over you and don't move

262
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,960
 She doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't take the time to explain

263
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,240
 He's not like they're kind of like gray aliens, but different eyes. He just go get in the back seat

264
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,680
 They're coming for you

265
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,200
 She crawls into the back seat and throws a blanket over her and now he's sitting

266
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,920
 In the car his girlfriend

267
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,920
 Hiding and there's an alien on each side of the car now

268
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,640
 He turns his head and he's looking out the window

269
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
 little fire

270
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,680
 Illuminating

271
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,280
 the landscape

272
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,400
 He said the aliens looked like they didn't know how to get in the car

273
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,640
 They they were trying to figure out how to get in the car and he knows

274
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,600
 That he's really not in danger. They are there

275
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,920
 For his girlfriend. He said the aliens were doing this motion like they were waving their hand over the window

276
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,640
 expecting it to just go

277
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,800
 They're going to be able to get in

278
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,680
 He goes the aliens were standing there and they were like waving their hand

279
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,920
 And they were doing it again and they were waiting for the window to simply roll down or recede or disappear

280
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,560
 That's not how that works at least here on earth

281
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,200
 And then he hears a voice in his head

282
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,280
 Open the door

283
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,920
 And of course, that's the last thing he wants to do. He knows they don't know how to get into the car

284
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,600
 Open the door

285
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 He's not going to

286
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
 He knows the danger

287
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,400
 And he's just sitting there and the aliens are waiting outside in the darkness

288
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,920
 He then gets a second message in his head

289
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,960
 And an image as well at the same time

290
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,000
 He gets an image of his door locks

291
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,960
 And they're open

292
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
 And he hears a voice in his head go

293
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,440
 The door is unlocked

294
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
 Hit the switch

295
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
 Lock it

296
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
 You will be safe

297
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,600
 He looks over at the doors. They're locked

298
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,840
 The doors are unlocked. You are in danger

299
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,960
 Hit the switch and lock them. Hit the switch and lock them now before they get inside

300
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,280
 And he sees in his mind the switch popped up

301
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,240
 But when he looks at the door the switch is locked

302
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,520
 You're in danger

303
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
 The car is on fire

304
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,040
 Peter

305
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,960
 The car is on fire and he needs to get out right now

306
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,320
 And in his head

307
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
 He sees a flame

308
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
 Begin to creep through the car

309
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,320
 Peter the car is on fire. You need to get out right now

310
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
 The car is burning

311
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
 He has an image in his head

312
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,120
 A flames consuming the car

313
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,320
 Peter get out. The car is on fire

314
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,560
 Peter starts to get lightheaded

315
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,240
 The next thing he knows he's standing outside of his car

316
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,000
 His girlfriend is gone

317
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,000
 He is all alone in a field illuminated only by a small fire. The next thing he knows

318
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,040
 The sun is up. He's driving home

319
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,800
 His girlfriend is in the backseat

320
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:16,240
 That might be one of the most terrifying alien stories that we've talked about on this show

321
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,320
 We've talked about a lot of good ones, but this one shows the true scope

322
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
 Of a gray alien's power

323
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,800
 The true mental might of one of these creatures

324
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,000
 I talk a lot of trash about how you can wreck these things physically. You can just totally annihilate them

325
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:45,200
 But this is truly alien, right? This is this has nothing to do with physical strength

326
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,560
 Total manipulation of really reality at that point, right?

327
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:59,680
 First just giving him a simple order to open the door. We've seen UFO abductees simply do what the aliens say

328
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,400
 When that doesn't work

329
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,320
 Trying to trick him

330
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,000
 The door is already unlocked. You have to hit the button. You have to lock it and he fought that

331
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,360
 And then the fear of fire. It's one of the few innate fears that humans have

332
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,320
 And then the two time jumps is also very terrifying

333
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,080
 The one time jump where he's out of the car and his girlfriend is gone and then a second time jump where he's driving down the road

334
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,560
 Now as far as I know the story has never been followed up. We this story obviously could be fake

335
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,840
 But the story's never been followed up. We don't know if any of the

336
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,600
 This is a case if this was me. I would 100 go to a hypnotherapist to try to get some

337
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
 Try to get some clarity on this

338
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,680
 Maybe maybe right it's quite terrifying, but it shows that level of power that these beings can have

339
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,000
 I don't think I've ever come across that story where

340
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,840
 We have that sort of mental combat between a human and an alien and really the alien winning

341
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,680
 Absolutely terrifying story

342
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,720
 To be honest, it's such a

343
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,760
 Mind-bending story

344
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,000
 I'm at a loss of words

345
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
 How do you fight something that powerful?

346
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,920
 Maybe you can't

347
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,520
 I think your only hope is that they wipe all your memories

348
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,320
 They're obviously capable of deleting

349
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,920
 Certain pieces of memories. So why would they allow peter to remember the event at all?

350
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,920
 Maybe they wanted him to remember the sheer panic

351
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,880
 As he saw the figures walk up to his car

352
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,120
 Maybe they wanted him to remember the fear

353
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,440
 That enveloped him as he stood out in that dark field

354
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,240
 The car empty

355
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
 His girlfriend gone

356
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,080
 Maybe they wanted him to be filled with terror

357
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,520
 So he would tell the message of their power

358
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,200
 So that all humans would know no matter what we do no matter what we think

359
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,920
 They

360
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,920
 Can make us

361
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,480
