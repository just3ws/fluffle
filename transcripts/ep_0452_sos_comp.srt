1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 What happens when a heavy metal musician meets Satan?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,760
 We take a look at a man who will do whatever it takes to save his fellow Americans.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,440
 And then we travel to Japan to take a look at a bizarre story that happened in the 80s.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,060
 Two hikers get lost in the mountains.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,700
 But three hikers are found today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:35,380
 [Music]

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,380
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,460
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,160
 So we're gonna slide right into this. At second base, we're running dust like flying everywhere.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,060
 It's all dirty and stuff. And we're just sliding into...

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,320
 Our first story is on second base for some bizarre reason. You can't slide into first, right?

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,040
 I don't know. I don't play sports. First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon, Petite Bourgeois.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,240
 Petite Bourgeois. I believe that's how you pronounce it.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,220
 Thank you so much for supporting this show. You are going to be our navigator, our pilot for this episode.

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,760
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just hope to get the word out about the show really really helps out a lot.

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,600
 I want to take this time to highlight some people who have been doing that. Jim Jam, Flim Flam. Yep.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,240
 I saw your comment. I was actually investigating something on that website and I saw that you left that.

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,080
 I really really appreciated it. It's one in a million that I would stumble across it.

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,080
 But I wanted to appreciate that. Also, I want to give a heads up to some people who have left reviews recently on the show.

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,160
 Kate Imkate really really loved your review. G4 75 75 75. Thank you so much.

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,880
 TESU 8 and H Sucker. Thank you so much for leaving the review. Someone else left a review,

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,760
 but it was just their name was Gibberish, but the review was very nice. So thank you so much.

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,520
 That's another way you guys can support the show. Really really appreciate that. But Petite Bourgeois,

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,120
 let's give you those keys to that carpenter copter. You are going to take us up in the air.

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,840
 We are flying above everything else. We are flying out to this dude's hospital.

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,440
 We're just gonna land on this hospital roof. Other medical helicopters are flying around.

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,120
 They're like clear the airspace get out of her way. We're like, no, we got a story to look at.

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,880
 Now we're walking through the hospital and we see a dude laying on a bed all.

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,480
 And we go up to the door. We're wearing like doctor clothes.

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,000
 They wear normal clothes, but we also now we're wearing lab coats and stuff.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,920
 And we're walking around. We got stethoscopes and we're like nurse.

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,960
 What's wrong with this dude? And the nurse looks at his chart and she's like,

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,920
 he's he has COVID-19. He's dying. He's actually in really, really bad shape.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,920
 So this guy we're looking at his name is Will Carroll.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,720
 He's 46 years old. He's a drummer.

37
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,560
 For the band Death Angel. It's a thrash metal band.

38
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,800
 I guess they were started in the 80s. They're still pretty big in the scene now.

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,080
 They were just on a tour in Europe. And as they're touring Europe,

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
 like airports are gonna shut down, they're like, come on, Will, hurry up, run, run.

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,280
 He's like running. He has to do a roll underneath the gate.

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,280
 They get on their plane. They leave their on tour with two other bands.

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,080
 But some of the members of the bands got the illness.

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,360
 Now, Will Carroll was overweight, probably was into the best health to begin with.

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,000
 It knocks him out. Like literally he goes into a coma.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,080
 He's on a respirator. Things are not looking good for Will Carroll.

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,520
 But after 12 day coma, he wakes up. He wakes up.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,920
 And so after he wakes up from his coma, he has this story to tell. He goes, I died.

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,000
 I died, guys. This is what happened to me. I'm laying in my bed and I'm just like,

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,680
 and then his soul left his body.

51
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,280
 His soul is kind of floating around, floating around a bit and then starts to

52
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,440
 get pulled into the earth. So his soul is being dragged down into the earth.

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,120
 No. And then he meets Satan, who, and first off, the big shocking thing,

54
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,800
 he's now he's in hell, right? That's that shocking thing. Number one.

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,560
 Oh no, hell exists. And I'm in it. So that's surprising thing. Number one,

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,840
 surprising thing. Number two, Satan is a woman.

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,760
 So that may not surprise some of you. It would surprise me. It would surprise me.

58
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,120
 I would assume Satan was like a dude. I would assume Satan. It's funny.

59
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,920
 I wonder, I would assume Satan is a skinny dude.

60
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,400
 And I would assume God was an old man, but he's kind of built.

61
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,880
 Like he's wearing those robes and stuff like that.

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,600
 But you imagine he's like, has the body of like Logan. Like he looks old,

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
 but then if God took off his robes, he'd be hella yoked, right?

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,080
 And then Jesus is probably like a wild, I imagine Jesus is kind of like a Brad Pitt

65
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,400
 type of body, Fight Club Brad Pitt, where he's like kind of wiry and stuff like that.

66
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,200
 But you know, he could throw down. I'll be honest, I edited out like three minutes of me

67
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,560
 and describing Jesus's workout plan. Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

68
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,400
 The point is, is that it's surprising that Satan's a woman. I, it's surprising to me at least.

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,120
 And then surprising thing number three, Satan punishes Will Carroll by turning him into a

70
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,400
 quote, job of the hut like creature. Because he was being punished for his sin of sloth.

71
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,400
 Wasn't like 600 pound life overweight, but he was like 350 pound life overweight.

72
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,320
 He's a drummer. He just sits there all day long.

73
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,800
 I'm sure he had really good upper body strength, but anything below the pecs was just like,

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,080
 bull. So he turns into Satan, turns him into a job of the hut like creature for copyright reasons.

75
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 Satan can't actually turn him into job of the hut because Satan can still get sued.

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,000
 Turns him into a job of the hut like creature and Will just sat there in this monstrous form

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 and began puking, just begin puking up volumes and volumes of blood.

78
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:08,560
 Until he died again in hell and then woke up in a hospital bed back on earth.

79
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,080
 Now that's awesome. Not awesome that he went to hell and got turned into a monster.

80
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,400
 A non-copyrighted monster. It's awesome he survived. He actually celebrated his 47th

81
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,560
 birthday on May 13th. And I love this quote. Quote, "I'm still going to listen to Satanic

82
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,640
 Metal and I still love decide in bands like that." I'm assuming decide is like a Satanic or like a

83
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,920
 dark band. Quote, "I'm still going to listen to Satanic Metal and I still love deciding bands

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,160
 like that. As far as my personal life and my experiences of what I went through, I don't

85
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,080
 I love this quote. I don't think Satan's quite as cool as I used to. So before I'd be sitting

86
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,760
 there smoking a doobie with his friends back in the 80s, dude I bet you Satan's a cool dude.

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,840
 And when we go to hell he'll be like, "Hey man, you guys rock. You guys are way cooler than these

88
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,760
 demons that have been here for 10 million years. No, you humans are way cooler here.

89
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,400
 Smoke some of the devil's hash." And then get blazed with the dark lord. Instead he went down,

90
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,400
 Satan's a woman, turned him into a monster, threw his blood and died in hell. So I love that quote.

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,760
 I don't think Satan's as cool as I used to. But interesting story, the man survived.

92
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,800
 Possible near-death experience, possible just coma-driven nightmare. Either way it's terrifying.

93
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,640
 Either way it's terrifying. But luckily he's back alive and Satan's still down there and she's like,

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,840
 "Drats!" Kind of P.O. to this one got away. I would, I love the idea though that Satan will not

95
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,720
 violate copyright. That Satan's eventually when Satan does try to destroy Earth, she's,

96
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,320
 because now it's a woman, she's assembling her arming. We're like, "Hey, that kind of looks like,

97
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,600
 that guy kind of looks like Darth Vader." She's like, "No, no, no, it's not Darth Vader.

98
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,120
 It's a Darth Vader-esque armor." And we're like, "Wait a second. That armor over there kind of looks

99
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,480
 like Doom's day from Superman comics." No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That is Day of Doom. That's an

100
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,560
 original character. They're all, all of the demons are recolors of existing demons in pop culture.

101
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,840
 Satan we know now is unimaginative and is very, very cautious of being sued.

102
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,960
 Petite bourgeois. Let's hop into Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind the hospital.

103
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,920
 We're saying goodbye to Will Carroll again. Very, very glad that you made that out alive.

104
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,880
 We are headed out to Michigan, Bay City, Michigan to be exact. It's May 17th, 2020.

105
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,600
 So this story just took place what, a week ago? Two weeks ago? So we're driving through Bay City,

106
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,960
 Michigan, here, our car drives by a house. Inside is a 70-year-old man named Jesse Theodore McFadden.

107
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,320
 He is a man with a plan. Step one, steal an attack helicopter, steal an attack helicopter

108
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,280
 from the local Coast Guard station. Now I'm going to say this. That's an ambitious step one, right?

109
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:09,440
 Step one isn't, that might be the most ambitious step one I've ever seen. Like, step one isn't

110
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,120
 break into the facility. Step one isn't even go on map quests and find out where the facility is.

111
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,120
 Step one, take a helicopter, steal a helicopter from a Coast Guard station. I have no idea whether

112
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
 or not this guy can actually fly, said copter, but he definitely believes he can. I'm sure he played

113
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,960
 a lot of Microsoft Flight Simulator in 1998. He's ready to go. Step two, fly. Does the Coast Guard

114
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,640
 even have attack helicopters? I mean, I know they have more than, like, whirly birds, but I don't

115
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,960
 think they have, like, black hawks. He's going to steal an attack helicopter from a Coast Guard

116
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,040
 station. Step two, fly to the local police station, which again, that's awesome, right?

117
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,040
 This guy's plan is in results kind of nutty, but right there. He's stealing an attack helicopter,

118
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,000
 and then it's not like Layla over two weeks. He's immediately taking off from the Coast Guard

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,840
 station, flying over to the police station, attacking it with an attack helicopter. And the cops,

120
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,480
 that's a scenario where the cops would be completely defenseless. Do you guys remember,

121
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,880
 there was two big stories back in the 90s. We had Killdozer in South Park, Colorado, where the guy

122
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,640
 had, over the course of months, taken a bulldozer and grafted armor onto it and started driving

123
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,240
 through town and knocking houses over. And the cops finally had to, like, run up and, like, shoot

124
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,120
 into the armor. Like, the bullets were bouncing off. He had, like, little, like, little eye slits,

125
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,520
 and they finally had to take him out like that. And then back in the 90s, too, some dude stole a

126
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:40,480
 tank from a National Guard, National Guard brigade or barracks or whatever. He's driving the tank

127
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,000
 through LA, and it was the same thing. Like, he didn't shoot at anyone. He was just like,

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,480
 crushing cars. All of this footage is available online. I don't know if the Killdozer is, but the

129
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,120
 tank definitely was. They had to run up into the tank, open it up, and, like, they were thinking,

130
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,520
 "Do we just throw grenades into it?" The guy, a cop finally got on the tank, opened up the top,

131
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,360
 and shot into it and killed him. But the police is much armor as they have nowadays.

132
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,480
 They don't have an anti-aircraft weaponry. And their helicopters definitely aren't armed. So if

133
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,520
 an attack helicopter came flying over a police station, that's not good, right? It's just going

134
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:24,720
 to lay into it. Totally awesome explosions. As long as nobody dies, the explosions are awesome.

135
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,880
 Helicopter will then leave behind the burning wreckage of the police department. There'll be

136
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,120
 one cop, like, crawling out of the burning wreckage, and he pulls up his radio and he's like...

137
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,160
 And then he dies. I couldn't come up with anything cool for him to say. He just dies. So anyways,

138
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,840
 the helicopter now flies away from the burning police station. Now it's going to fly to the

139
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,200
 local hospital. This is step three. This is really the final step. Helicopter flies to the hospital.

140
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:01,200
 But this time the attacks are precision. You see, one of those missiles is going to go

141
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,840
 open the door because the doors have like the little sensor on them.

142
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:12,800
 Flies to the hospital. Flies through the hallway. Passes an eternity ward, stops, looks at the

143
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:20,560
 key little babies. Continues to fly. The hospital crashes right into the power supply.

144
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,880
 Of said hospital. Sparks are shooting out and everything. People are running in slow motion

145
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,720
 from the sparks. So all the power leaves the hospital. Then helicopter's going to land.

146
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,600
 And again, this man is 70 years old. This is a very eventful... This is an eventful,

147
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,000
 like, two month long thing for people of good health. This guy's going to do it in the morning.

148
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,360
 10 a.m. to be precise. We're going to get to that. His plan is to do all this stuff, hop out of the

149
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,560
 helicopter, walk into the hospital. There's going to be, like, because all the power's out now. So

150
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,520
 he's just going to be able to go and he's going to be able to open all of the doors and all of the

151
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:08,000
 COVID-19 people who've been locked up. No, I want to see my family. I want to see my families again.

152
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,440
 Let me out. I'm still healthy. He's going to go. His plan was... His plan... All of that stuff.

153
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,040
 All of that stuff was because he believed that the hospitals were imprisoning people with coronavirus.

154
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,960
 He wanted to let them go. He's like, "Run free, my friends! Run free! Return home! Go back to your

155
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,160
 job at the retirement center!" And people are like, "Ugh!" And they're coughing through the

156
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,240
 streets of Michigan. That was his plan. That was his plan. Now, I don't know if he thought that COVID-19

157
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,120
 was a hoax, or if he thought people were, "What? You're sick with an illness and they're keeping

158
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,600
 you prisoner for 14 days because you went to the hospital and you want to be treated?

159
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,360
 Hogwash!" People are like, "No, no, I really need this. Will Carroll is on a ventilator." And

160
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,320
 this guy, Jesse, comes in. He's like, "You're free!" Pulls the ventilator out. And then Will Carroll

161
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:08,560
 is permanently a copyright free monster in hell. He's like, "No." His plan was to "free" all the

162
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,680
 people currently being treated for COVID-19. So you're going, "Jason, okay, some crazy old man

163
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,720
 made a police. What did he do? Did he post it online? And the cops are involved?" And it was like,

164
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,480
 5150? No. No, no. If this was just a manifesto, it'd be funny, right? At 10 a.m. in the morning,

165
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,720
 he calls up Jesse McFadden, calls up 911. I don't understand why this was part of his plan.

166
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,040
 But he calls up 911 and says, "Step 1." And he tells them what he's about to do. He goes,

167
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,200
 "I'm going to go steal a helicopter. I'm going to kill all the cops. I'm going to fly to the

168
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,880
 hospital. Missile's going to fly around the hallways. Shuts off the power." I don't know why

169
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,720
 he did that, but he definitely put himself on the radar. So you're thinking, "Maybe he just

170
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,520
 wanted to commit suicide by cop. Maybe..." No. Let me finish. He then drives to the Coast Guard station

171
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:08,720
 and tries to hack into the control panel. It sounds like a Skrillex song, but it's not.

172
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,720
 It's him trying to try multiple keypad codes. And you can imagine the Coast Guard guards standing

173
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,560
 there just a couple feet away being like, "Why is this super old man trying to hack our system?

174
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,480
 Old man has a skateboard. His hat's on backwards." He's like, "Solve this in a movie.

175
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,720
 So, this is a documentary called Hackers. Why isn't this working?" And so then Jesse turns to the

176
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,840
 Coast Guard guy who's obviously incredibly puzzled by what he's seeing. And Jesse goes,

177
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,480
 "Open the gate." The guard's like, "No, I'm going to open the gate." You just pulled up in your car.

178
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,880
 You try to hack your way into our system. I'm not letting you in. And then Jesse goes,

179
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,160
 "If you don't let me in, I'm going to ram my car through your gate." And at that point,

180
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,320
 the Coast Guard guy must have looked at the car, looked at the gate, and laughed and said,

181
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,440
 "Go ahead. This gate is designed to stop Iraqi tanks from coming through. I am sure your Ford

182
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,760
 Taurus will knock this down." He does leave though. He ends up leaving the gate. He doesn't decide to

183
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,600
 run it down. Cops track him down. Catch him at a gas station. He was inside getting snacks. He was

184
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,960
 in the car after trying to steal an attack helicopter. He's like, "Ah, you know what I really want?

185
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,880
 I want some Hostess Zingers." So while he's inside getting Hostess Zingers, the cops pull up because

186
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,200
 now they know what his car looks like. They'd gotten the 911 call earlier and he had a previous

187
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,200
 to rest for fleeing and eluding the police back in 2011. So they knew what he looked like, but now

188
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,800
 like they can figure out like what car he was in, what area he was in. He's inside the gas station

189
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,440
 buying snacks. There's nothing that makes you hungrier than trying to destroy a police station

190
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,640
 and a hospital at the same time. He comes outside the cops, finds a Mossberg shotgun,

191
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,920
 which is the coolest of all shotguns, in his car and there's a bit of a scuffle. With a 70-year-old

192
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,200
 man again, the cops finally do subdue this ancient mumra-like character and he is fine. Really, his

193
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,160
 what he was charged with was possession, felon possession of a firearm. Because you can pull

194
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,160
 up to a Coast Guard gate and go, "Let me in!" and you can punch buttons on their control panel.

195
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,360
 To be fair, if I did that, I might be facing different charges, but when you're 70 years old,

196
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,560
 they're probably like, "Oh, you rascally old coot." But anyway, so that was Jesse McFadden's plan.

197
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,200
 He could get 45 days in jail and it might be a life sentence for him. Hopefully not.

198
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,920
 Hopefully he ends up doing whatever, actually it's probably longer than 45 days, felon possession

199
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,000
 of a firearm. He might get charged with terrorist threats, but so far it's just been the firearm

200
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,080
 charges. Hopefully maybe this will be, he'll come out of jail and he'll be like, "Whoa,

201
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,040
 those 45 days in jail, it's sure gonna be stopped being an insane old man!" Now I'm gonna go on and

202
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,000
 become like, I don't know, just a normal dude who does normal dude stuff and then he'll start

203
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,120
 going to Michaels and buying like, batched buckets to resell on eBay or some nonsense like that.

204
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,880
 We can, we can, that is lame of a life as that is, that's far better than a man trying to

205
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,480
 destroy a, destroy a hospital to release everyone COVID-19. In Petit Boujewal, let's take the

206
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,360
 Dead Rabbit-Durgeable. We're gonna take a long slow trip from Michigan to Japan. We are headed out

207
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,080
 to take a look at a truly bizarre story. Found a store on Reddit, so I want to give credit to the

208
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,440
 person who researched all this stuff, got all these notes together for me. It was a user named

209
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,200
 Apis Serena. Apis Serena? I don't know, but thank you so much for doing all the legwork on this.

210
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,920
 Petit Boujewal, we're bringing our blimp, we're bringing our Dead Rabbit-Durgeable nice and low.

211
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,600
 We're flying over Hokkaido, Japan. It's July 24th, 1989. We're specifically going to a place known as

212
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:54,240
 Asahideki Mountain, July 24th, 1989. So apparently this area is immensely beautiful. It's basically a

213
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,520
 collection of biomes on one hiking trail. There's like active volcanoes and there's lush forests,

214
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,880
 beautiful hiking, but it's also, the weather can change very quickly. It's easy to get lost. There's

215
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,560
 a place where there's two boulders. Well, there's two places with two boulders, right? And if you

216
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:20,240
 turn left at the wrong place, the wrong boulder, you're basically doomed. So there's like landmarks,

217
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
 but it's not really a landmark. If there's two different landmarks, they look the same. So

218
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,440
 you could go up the mountain, find, and I guess there's some like really like steep drop-offs and

219
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,120
 everything like that. You can go up the mountain just fine, but if you're coming down and the

220
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,320
 weather's a little misty, it's a little foggy, and you see one of the boulders, you may turn left there,

221
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,880
 where the real boulder you're supposed to turn at is, you know, farther away and you end up

222
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,280
 in a totally different location. So people, they recommend people doing this hike on the buddy system.

223
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,960
 It's very, very easy to get lost, which I mean, I guess then just both of you get lost, which is

224
00:19:52,960 --> 00:20:00,320
 what happened here. July 24th, 1989, two mountaineers go missing, and the local search and rescue is

225
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,880
 like, we got to find these guys, right? That is our job. People are like, no, can we just like

226
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,440
 not find people today? They're like, we're searching rescue dude. Like you knew what you signed up for

227
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,120
 literally, that's the name of the job. Fine, what? This job sucks. So as everyone gets in their rescue

228
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,240
 helicopters, they're flying around, they're looking for these mountaineers. They come over like a flat

229
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:31,760
 area, and they're in the sea, in their helicopter, giant letters. S-O-S. They're letters that mean

230
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:40,880
 things. They're not just C-Q-Y. They see S-O-S. It's 16 feet long and 10 feet wide, this saying here.

231
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,680
 Three logs high. I mean, it's massive undertaking to create this, but it allows, because you know,

232
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,440
 there's fog and mist, you want to make this sign. Helicopter sees the S-O-S sign and they're like,

233
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,560
 okay, this is perfect. So they radio it in, ground crews come, helicopters still looking,

234
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,000
 about two to three kilometers, which what, four to five miles from the S-O-S sign, they find the two

235
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,640
 hikers. They've been missing for like a couple days. Helicopter lands, ground crew comes, take care of

236
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,000
 them, make sure they don't have any injuries, take them home. And they're like, you guys are so lucky,

237
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,320
 because we're looking all over the area, we're about to give up. Our captain does really like to

238
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,120
 search and rescues. And these captains are on the background, he's like, I hate him. And he's just

239
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,440
 shaking his head. But you're lucky that we found that S-O-S sign. And the two Mountaineers looked at

240
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:38,560
 each other and they go, we didn't make an S-O-S sign. What? No, no, that wasn't us. Like, we were lost,

241
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,280
 and we're glad that you guys came, don't drop us back off on the mountain. But we never made the S-O-S

242
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,840
 sign. So when the search and rescue drops the dudes back off at home, not at their individual homes,

243
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
 they're like, where do you live? Oh, I live a couple blocks away, helicopters like flying through

244
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,080
 the streets. After they drop them off at like a ranger station or whatever, they sit and have a

245
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,920
 little meeting and they go, okay, so we all saw the S-O-S sign, right? There wasn't some weird miracle.

246
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,920
 We should go back up there, because there might be someone else there. But the thing was this,

247
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,600
 if two people didn't make the S-O-S sign, one person definitely didn't make it. And there's also

248
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,480
 no one else missing. I mean, it would have been a huge undertaking. These were birch logs. And if

249
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,960
 you play Minecraft, just punching a birch tree just to get a one block of it, it takes a while.

250
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:32,960
 So whoever was up there was able to cut down all of these trees, arrange them in the war to S-O-S.

251
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,600
 It would have been quite the undertaking for two people. And there's no one else missing.

252
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,880
 So who would have made this? But let's just not assume, even though our captain hates his job,

253
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,320
 let's not assume that, oh, trees must have just fallen randomly. So they go back up there,

254
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,960
 they start doing a ground search around the actual sign that says S-O-S. There's a skeleton.

255
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:05,040
 Just laying there. Now it's so funny whenever I see stuff about people finding skeletons,

256
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,400
 not that I'm amused at the fact that people dying to K. But I always imagine it's like

257
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,120
 a skeleton from like House on Haunted Hill, where it's like the finger bones,

258
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,360
 like the whole skeleton's there, right? Just laying there in the dirt. And I don't think that's

259
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,880
 the case. I wonder what the cutoff is for a skeleton. Like if you find the skull, they'll say

260
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,880
 they found the skull. If you found the skull and an arm bone, at what point does it become we found

261
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,600
 a skeleton? Like does it have to be like 60% of the bone? I don't think the rescue team really

262
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,960
 cares about the distinction. They're not like, hmm, we just found three human skulls, but no

263
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,280
 skeletons. But I'm wondering if from some sort of, I wonder how they make the designation of

264
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,680
 whether or not they report it as a skeleton is found there. Is it like half the body? Is it like

265
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,360
 one third of the body? But anyways, that's an equiviling weird comment. They find a skeleton.

266
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,520
 He's apparently he was mid xylophone playing with his ribs when they found him. Now that's bizarre,

267
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:10,000
 because they definitely don't have anyone missing at all. No one left the hiking. No

268
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,480
 skeletons are like, see you later. I'm gonna go hiking. So now they go, wait a second, we have

269
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,560
 someone who's not recently missing, but this is a skeleton. So whoever it was probably died a while

270
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,120
 ago, they could tell like some of it had been eaten. Some of the bones had been like, gnawed on by

271
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,120
 animals. They find a tape recorder and I can play you some of it for you. I mean, it's in Japanese,

272
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,080
 so you won't really know what it is, but I'm gonna play a bit of this audio recording here,

273
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:45,680
 and then I'll tell you what it says.

274
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,920
 So what it's saying is, I can't move from a top this cliff. There's different translations of this,

275
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,040
 obviously. I've seen a couple different translations, but this is the one we're gonna go with.

276
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:19,920
 I can't move from a top this cliff. SOS, please help. I am near where the helicopter was originally,

277
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:26,480
 and I can't move further due to the bamboo brush being in the way. Please get me out of here.

278
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,840
 And eventually a journalist looking into this, the rescue team didn't even find this. They found

279
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:41,200
 a driver's license of a Kinji Aiyawamura, a 22-year-old man. So this is who the authorities now

280
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:50,000
 believe this skeleton belongs to, is Kinji. Kinji went missing July 10th. So the first people they

281
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:02,400
 went missing on July 24th, 1989. Kinji went missing on July 10th, 1984. So he had been missing for five

282
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:09,280
 years, and no one had ever found him. Now there's a lot of really creepy elements to this, which makes

283
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,280
 it possibly less of a missing person in the mountain scenario, and something a little darker.

284
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,960
 But let's take a look at some of the stuff. The theory is that he recorded his voice on tape,

285
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,480
 and was playing it in a loop. The tape itself, he's talking very loudly, and it's actually not

286
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,160
 a bad survival technique, because you can only yell so much, right? But if you record yourself

287
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,560
 yelling, you can play it over and over again. Hopefully someone hiking by or walking by will

288
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,320
 hear you yelling. You could yell all night long. So they think that's what was going on. He's yelling

289
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,920
 into the tape, and then playing the tape backwards. And then he's playing the tape loudly.

290
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:57,200
 But let's look at some of these bizarre things going on here. One, I am near where the helicopter

291
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,600
 was originally. What helicopter is he referring to? Because obviously not the helicopter from 1989,

292
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,560
 right? So a helicopter must have been searching for him back in the day. He had gone missing. It's

293
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,160
 not to say that no one ever goes missing on this mountain. People do go missing, and sometimes

294
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,880
 you never find them. But he must have seen a helicopter back in 1984. And he was trying to

295
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,880
 signal, come back to that area where you saw the helicopter. But look at these questions.

296
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:32,320
 How did nobody see this sign in five years? This giant SOS sign, not a single helicopter

297
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:41,600
 or hiker passed by this area? How long was he lost for? I don't think he was lost for five years. He's

298
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,720
 like, "What? My mom said if I get lost, just sit in one location and they'll find me." And then

299
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,880
 four and a half years later, he's like, "I better build a sign." But no one saw this sign at all

300
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,920
 for that period of time. There's suspicion about his legs being broken, that they found breaks in

301
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,280
 the bones of his legs. But the question is, did they get broken before he died? That's kind of

302
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,520
 the going theory that his legs were broken before he died, and that's why he was stuck there.

303
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,680
 But how do you build a giant SOS sign with two broken legs? Did he break his legs building the

304
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:21,680
 sign? Was he like, "Ah, hope it lasts. Now balance on these logs." Or as he's putting up the last

305
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,400
 log, he's like, "Uh-oh, this one's extra slippery. Ah!" Or did they get broken after he died? Was there

306
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:35,280
 a crazy bear who was just like snapping stuff? They spent, back in July 10th, 1984, they spent a

307
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,520
 whole week looking for him, and did not see this giant sign. What's weird is this is one of those

308
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,200
 stories that I... it feels like there's a paranormal answer for it, but I can't even put it into word,

309
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,720
 like alternate reality, because he definitely existed in our reality. But how do you search for

310
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,600
 a guy for a week, don't see a giant sign? How is it for five years, the sign is never seen?

311
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,920
 Is it possible that he's from our reality? He shifted into reality, where he builds the sign.

312
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,640
 And then the him and the whole sign has shifted back into our reality? Years later?

313
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:23,360
 None of it really makes sense. Did he break his legs before, during, or after he made the sign?

314
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:30,160
 Like, it's an area you can get lost in, but it's not, again, a lary you can get lost in for five years.

315
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:37,040
 And you figure if he has the tools to chop down birch trees, and build this sign, but he doesn't

316
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,400
 have any tools to catch animals? And if you're saying, "Well, he broke his legs, he can't get out

317
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,320
 of the valley, he can't catch the animals," then how did he build the sign? So as weird as the answer

318
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,560
 is, is of him going to an alternate reality, when we look for him for a week, we don't find him at

319
00:29:52,560 --> 00:30:00,560
 all. But then when he returns to our reality, he could have honestly returned to our reality back in

320
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,520
 1989, shortly before the other two hikers went missing.

321
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,320
 Maybe, actually, now that I think about it, maybe he didn't build the sign.

322
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,640
 Maybe he died, because in the recording, he doesn't mention the sign, right?

323
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:26,080
 Maybe he died, and a ghost built the sign. I don't know, I don't, I don't, that sounds even more far

324
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,680
 fetched, bunch of ghosts, like, cutting down trees. It's just the, it's one of those weird,

325
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,200
 mysterious stories, and it's super obscure. I hear over and over and over again about the lead mask

326
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,360
 case of the two dudes who went up on the hill, and they put on the lead masks, and they took the pill.

327
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,680
 They're supposed to wait there for the UFO, and they died. You hear about that case all the time,

328
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,320
 and there's probably some weird explanation for that, and there's probably, I always thought it was

329
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,200
 a cult thing, I always thought it was some weird cult activity, but that's all well and good.

330
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,120
 This story is so obscure, and it doesn't have any reasonable answer at all,

331
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,880
 which makes it even more creepy. Because if we can go, oh, he was walking through the woods,

332
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,080
 he got lost, he got attacked by a jaguar, that sucks. It's not a good ending to the story.

333
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,160
 But when people just disappear, and then reappear, next to giant monuments,

334
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:27,200
 made of wood and desperation, that's chilling. Because while this is a world away on a misty

335
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,640
 mountain in the middle of Japan, that doesn't mean it can't happen to anyone of us walking down the

336
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:41,840
 street. People disappear all the time, but when they reappear in bizarre ways, it's even creepier.

337
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,240
 Because to me, it means that things can go back and forth. And if a human can disappear into a

338
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,760
 bizarre reality, what's to stop something from that bizarre reality? I'm coming here.
