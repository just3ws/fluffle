1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Is it possible to crowdfund an assassination on the internet?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,880
 And are the Transformer movies really the story about a group of intergalactic terrorists

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,000
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,080
 I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,600
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 I was talking into the back of the microphone.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,600
 I know I talked about the fact that I had some audio issues and it turns out that a microphone

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,040
 has a front and a back.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,680
 I'm sure the people out there who use microphones a lot are shaking their fists at me.

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,640
 But the side with the logo is the side you're supposed to talk to.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
 So the story behind this mic, so I've said it a couple of times that I used to be a musician.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,280
 I used to be, yeah I used to be, it's the right term.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
 I used to be a musician.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,400
 I used to be a rapper actually.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,200
 So my car got stolen and I used the insurance money not to buy another car but to build

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
 a home studio.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,760
 And the crowning jewel of that home studio was a TLM103 Neumann microphone.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,760
 It's a $1100 microphone.

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,880
 It's actually probably the most valuable thing I own money-wise.

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
 And that is what allows me to do this podcast.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
 If you know what I've thought about it, if something happens to this microphone, I use

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,440
 the backup mic to do the golf rumors episode.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,480
 I used the backup mic and the quality was pretty good.

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,080
 I wasn't, it was different but I wasn't like, "Oh I'm going to give up if I ever lose this

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
 microphone."

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,600
 But I really do like a condenser mic.

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,920
 So that was the problem.

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,560
 That's what happens when you buy equipment and you don't fully know how to use it.

31
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,720
 Is you end up talking to a microphone backwards.

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,560
 So I wanted to take this moment to go over something real quickly with you guys.

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,800
 We're actually going to start a sister project to Dead Rabbit Radio.

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,520
 We're still going to do the podcast.

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,240
 It's still going to be the daily podcast.

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
 Everything's going to change.

37
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
 The podcast comes first.

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,400
 I have a lot of fun doing this.

39
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,320
 I'm getting so much great feedback from you guys.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
 That's awesome.

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,120
 What we're going to do though is we're going on the end of the podcast episodes and they

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,840
 will be their own separate YouTube videos.

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,000
 We're going to have three to five minute short horror stories.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,200
 And the reason why we're doing this is because I've always toyed around with the idea.

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,840
 The original concept of Dead Rabbit Radio was actually short stories.

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
 We weren't going to do what we're doing now.

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,520
 If you listen to the first five episodes, the podcast is called 14th Family.

48
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,040
 And the concept was this.

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,440
 There was going to be no podcast.

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,080
 What you would hear was only the last five minutes of the podcast.

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,400
 And then I would get to listener mail and I was getting these short horrors, these letters

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,880
 written to me.

53
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
 And they were short.

54
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,000
 They were stories saying, you know, please help me.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,100
 This horrible thing's happening to me.

56
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,560
 And they're all going to be paranormal or conspiracy based.

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,640
 And it was going to be about unraveling the mystery that was going on with the 14th Family.

58
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,000
 Now after about five episodes, I was really having so much fun doing the podcast as is

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,200
 that I ditched that idea.

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,400
 That idea also would have taken a lot of work and it would have been a weekly episode.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,920
 And knowing me, I would have got five, six episodes in and then the workload would have

62
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,080
 been too much.

63
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,600
 And I was having so much fun doing the podcast that you hear now that I put that to the side.

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,580
 So again, the podcast will not go away.

65
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,800
 But I want to bring that idea back with the short horror stories.

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,280
 So with a little bit of a twist, we're going to have it aimed at a preteen teenage audience.

67
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,320
 Now I know you guys are groaning, but I think that this works because it helps us build

68
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,360
 up our listenership.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,160
 I'm looking at this long term now.

70
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,320
 When I started this podcast out, I was telling people, we'll do 50 episodes, we'll do 100

71
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,840
 episodes, we'll reevaluate.

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,020
 We're at 61 episodes now and it's going great.

73
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,520
 So now I'm thinking long term.

74
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,040
 Now I'm thinking two years, five years, how we're going to do this.

75
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,640
 My goal is we're going to put these little clips at the end of the podcast are for you,

76
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,040
 the average podcast listener.

77
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,800
 My nephew listened to the show.

78
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,320
 He's nine or eight or something like that.

79
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,120
 He said it was boring, fair enough.

80
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
 It's not for kids.

81
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,480
 But we're going to take these short little horror stories.

82
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,880
 We're going to put them on YouTube and we get these people to start listening to Dead

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,640
 Rabbit, the short horror stories when they're young.

84
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:17,600
 And as they get older, now they're 16, 17, 18, 19, they switch over to Dead Rabbit Radio.

85
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,280
 So now we're looking at long term growth.

86
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,520
 It's going to give us more hits on YouTube, definitely because they're going to be right.

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,880
 We're going to release them in October when everyone's googling spooky stories.

88
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,360
 And we're going to have it on a separate playlist, but it's going to be on the same channel.

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,600
 It's going to increase our views.

90
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,040
 It'll allow us to monetize YouTube earlier.

91
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,640
 It'll allow us to monetize in full quicker.

92
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,700
 When we can get people to start searching for creepy spooky horror stories, I don't want

93
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,520
 to dumb down the podcast to bring in a new audience.

94
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,960
 I want to give them a separate product.

95
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,160
 So I'm just letting you guys know.

96
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,560
 I hope you guys enjoy it.

97
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,480
 If you guys don't like it, that's fair too.

98
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
 That's totally fair too.

99
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,120
 I would hope that you enjoy it.

100
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,560
 I enjoy making them, but it's just, it's not going to take away from the podcast, but

101
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
 you may see some other things.

102
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,680
 I'll announce it and again, the podcast will end and then the story will begin.

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,520
 And then on the YouTube video, it will be a separate YouTube video as well.

104
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,000
 It'll be branded differently.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
 So it's going to be the same concept.

106
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,600
 It's going to be people writing in and asking for help and they're telling me scary stories.

107
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,400
 And it gives it that sense of believability for somebody who's younger.

108
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,880
 When I was talking to my nephew, I told him the idea.

109
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,280
 I said, you know, I'm thinking about doing short horror videos for kids.

110
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,240
 And when I say kids, again, I'm talking like preteen teen and he goes, but they have to

111
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
 be true.

112
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,880
 And I go, well, can I make them up but say that they're true?

113
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,400
 And it's funny because as a little kid, they don't want to hear a fake horror story.

114
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,560
 They want to hear a horror story that is real.

115
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,440
 They want to hear a horror story that's believable.

116
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,560
 When you tell a kid a horror story, their first question out of their mouth is, is that

117
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
 true?

118
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,680
 Because that's what makes it spooky.

119
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,440
 So we're going to start doing that.

120
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,600
 It's not going to take away from the podcast.

121
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
 I hope you guys are all on board.

122
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,920
 And they're going to not have any violent, like super violence or sexual themes, no

123
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,160
 cussing or anything like that.

124
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,760
 They're going to be scary.

125
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,520
 It's not going to be like, oh, it's guts hang out.

126
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,200
 And then like a sexy woman shows up and eff this and eff that, but we're not going to

127
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
 have any of that in there.

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,080
 Like it's going to be for the audience, but it's going to be scary.

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,040
 And we are going to go ahead and you'll all announce that before October comes around.

130
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,720
 And again, I'll do another announcement and we'll release those.

131
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,680
 So the first story I wanted to talk about was an interesting one.

132
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,160
 It is Internet assassinations.

133
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
 Now these things have actually been around for a long time.

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,400
 They've been predicted for a very long time back in the 90s.

135
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,400
 There were futurists and science fiction authors and cyberpunks and stuff like that, saying

136
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,440
 that there was going to be a future of Internet assassinations.

137
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,640
 And what it is, is that the way that it formed was with the evolution of the convergence

138
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,960
 of the Bitcoin and Tor.

139
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,440
 So the big one right now is assassination market where you donate as many bitcoins or

140
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,480
 half a Bitcoin or whatever to a pot.

141
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,760
 And this one specifically targets politicians.

142
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,640
 Now I put in half a Bitcoin, you put in a Bitcoin, you put in a Bitcoin.

143
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,840
 Once it gets up to an amount that a hit man wants to take that job, he writes down the

144
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,440
 date and the target and he puts a Bitcoin in as well.

145
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
 And it's an encrypted file.

146
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,920
 And then if the target dies on that day, the person who sent that file to the assassination

147
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,680
 market gets the bounty.

148
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,440
 They're talking about, the article seemed a little dated, but they were talking about

149
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,200
 Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke.

150
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,440
 He's the head of the Federal Reserve, not a very popular person, especially not in the

151
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,920
 Bitcoin community or really anywhere.

152
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,400
 But so that was the idea.

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,680
 Now here's the thing.

154
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,760
 Currently you can use the internet to facilitate assassinations.

155
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,640
 That's completely believable.

156
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,800
 People use Craigslist to find hit men for crying out loud.

157
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,640
 The thing is, is that when you're a hit man, that is your business.

158
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,520
 And when you take a big target like that, you pretty much know that you are going to

159
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,800
 be out of business for the rest of your life.

160
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,920
 You kill a high profile target, you will be on the run for the rest of your life.

161
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,080
 The higher the profile target, the quicker they are going to find you or the more resources

162
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,520
 at least they're going to put into looking for you.

163
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,240
 In the market, their rule is we only allow targets that have committed bodily harm against

164
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
 other humans.

165
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,560
 And they have an overall goal.

166
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,920
 Their goal is to strike fear into the heart of politicians, not the people, into politicians

167
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,800
 so people stop wanting to be politicians and it will create this anarchist utopia.

168
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,880
 I'm not a huge fan of anarchism.

169
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,760
 I've lived in bad neighborhoods.

170
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,320
 Most people I know who are anarchists are either college educated people or criminals.

171
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,560
 I've met maybe one or two who are like a kind of a socialist anarchist, which is kind of

172
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,160
 weird to like just provide us with money and then leave us alone in every other aspect of

173
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
 our lives.

174
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,160
 But for the most part, it's a criminal outlier and then it's college educated people.

175
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,320
 I'm not talking down about both of those people.

176
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,240
 I'm just saying that that's the problem.

177
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,280
 I have a friend who's actually very like down on society in general.

178
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,720
 And my argument has always been if society collapse, if the government completely collapse

179
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,760
 and we move to anarchy, you may live in your shack in the wilderness on a mesa in New Mexico,

180
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,880
 but the gangs from LA will eventually spill out and they are not trying to live in this

181
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,080
 utopic world.

182
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,840
 Is that a word utopic?

183
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,000
 Maybe I just made it up.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Maybe it's real.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 But you know what I mean?

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,040
 Like you can have that fall of the government and you know, preppers are kind of like in

187
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,920
 between they want to live on the ranch and raise their cows, but they're completely prepared

188
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,280
 to blow people's brains out as well.

189
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,840
 But the idea of if the government fell, then it would be utopia that I would if the government

190
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,640
 fell four days and I'm a scavenger, I'm a raider, let's just let's just you know, call

191
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
 it what it is.

192
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,280
 Like after a couple days when I'm like, there's no cops around.

193
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,160
 Dude, I mean like, I'm not Negan or anything.

194
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,000
 But I'm also I mean like, yeah, that's not good.

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,520
 You know, there needs to be some checks and balances for for certain people.

196
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:14,480
 But yeah, it's so anyways, but that aside, the utopian idea aside, again, taking on a

197
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,360
 big target like that is hard.

198
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,620
 You can have interna assassinations against smaller people like really anyone outside

199
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,480
 of politics through the law enforcement judges stuff like that, you know, wouldn't be worth

200
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
 it.

201
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,120
 But if you wanted to like take care of your postman and stuff like that, you could probably

202
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
 find somebody on tour.

203
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,240
 You know, the thing people a lot of people don't know about tour, it wasn't invented

204
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
 by the government.

205
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,780
 They've kind of lost control of the beast to a certain point, but they can still track

206
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,200
 you coming in and out of out of the dark web.

207
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,360
 They can't really see what you do in the meantime.

208
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,160
 But if they notice someone keeps going in and out, and it's a crap shoot, it's not like

209
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,940
 they'll always know that you're going in and out, but you may get they may be putting a

210
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,460
 sting on somebody else and then they see you, Johnny, no luck, go into the dark web and

211
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,900
 come out and now you're on their radar.

212
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,940
 But they don't really know what you're doing on there.

213
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,700
 But it's not it's secure in that sense.

214
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
 But again, it's not completely foolproof.

215
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,980
 They did invent it.

216
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,540
 It was invented as a covert tool.

217
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,380
 You could be a CIA operative in Istanbul and you have it on you have the tour browser in

218
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,380
 your flash drive.

219
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,860
 You go to an internet cafe, you plug it in, you access tour, it's untraceable to anyone

220
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,700
 standing around you.

221
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,300
 It's untraceable by most governments.

222
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,780
 And then you pull it out and you leave and you've communicated all the information and

223
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
 stuff like that.

224
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,160
 That's what it was built for.

225
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,180
 And then it basically became open.

226
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,580
 I've always been surprised.

227
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,820
 I've talked about this before.

228
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,820
 Maybe I didn't.

229
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,820
 Maybe I edited it out.

230
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:49,040
 But I think it's weird that people in 2018 still meet young girls online.

231
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,540
 And I think it's even more baffling that people hire hitmen online.

232
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,900
 I saw this news report.

233
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,260
 This woman was trying to find a hitman.

234
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,620
 I don't know if that's the right word, but a kidnapped man to kidnap her husband and

235
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,620
 then sell him into sexual slavery in the Middle East.

236
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,620
 Terrifying.

237
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,100
 That would be the white hitman.

238
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
 No.

239
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
 No.

240
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
 Bad hitman.

241
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,780
 Like why don't you just shoot me at the Olive Garden?

242
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,780
 Don't.

243
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
 No.

244
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,280
 Don't put me in a box and send me to the Middle East to be raped forever.

245
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,160
 That's horrible.

246
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,160
 Now luckily the person who she was talking to, the kidnap man, was a cop and she was

247
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,640
 arrested.

248
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
 But that's all.

249
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,420
 You can go on YouTube and see tons of videos of people talking to undercover hitmen.

250
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,360
 Why are people still doing this?

251
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,200
 I just don't get it.

252
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,760
 I get at a certain point being so desperate you want the situation to end.

253
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,060
 But going on the internet to find a hitman, sometimes I've read stories where people

254
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,260
 go to bars to find hitmen.

255
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,220
 Who do they think hitmen are that they just hang out?

256
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,940
 Listen dude, if you're a mafia don, you have one on the payroll or you know one.

257
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,340
 And it's just a professional thing and you go take care of it.

258
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,700
 Or if you're a member of a cartel or something like that.

259
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,700
 Or even a street gang would have a gunman.

260
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,300
 Someone who just handles the wetworks and stuff like that.

261
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,060
 But if you're a suburban housewife, SOL dude, you're not going to be able to find a legit

262
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,060
 hitman.

263
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,560
 And I'll say this.

264
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,480
 Whether or not you find a hitman online or in real life, if I'm the hitman, I'm taking

265
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
 you out too.

266
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,640
 For one reason.

267
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,320
 I know how to kill people and to live with it.

268
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,240
 But Sally Housewife doesn't.

269
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,680
 And eight years later, I know she's going to be at her daughter's birthday party and

270
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,080
 she's going to start regretting that she took part in the taking of another human's life.

271
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,320
 That's just human nature.

272
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,480
 So I'm going to take your money and I'm going to take you out too.

273
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,220
 If anything, these people are lucky.

274
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,140
 These average citizens, these upstanding people are lucky they're getting arrested because

275
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,660
 it could turn out a lot worse.

276
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,940
 But yeah, so I mean, they're out there.

277
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
 It's funny.

278
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,340
 You may think that, you know, oh, you know, it's one of those things.

279
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,540
 Internet assassinations.

280
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,100
 It's on the conspiracy iceberg.

281
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,780
 And it's one I looked at and go, well, yeah, of course.

282
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,140
 I think the reason why it's on the conspiracy iceberg because most of them or this new one,

283
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,400
 the assassination market knew.

284
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,960
 But you know, it's an older article, but I think the fact that they're targeting like

285
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,740
 high ranking people is why it's on there.

286
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,840
 But again, like if somebody came to me and was like, Jason, Jason, guess what?

287
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,200
 I'm like, yeah, what?

288
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,840
 There's assassins who work on the Internet.

289
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,280
 I'd be like, okay, yeah, what else do you want?

290
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,400
 I mean, like, like that's obvious.

291
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,560
 It's actually the perfect place for assassins to meet people.

292
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,120
 Legit assassins meeting legit customers, not your local minister who's like, oh, I really

293
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
 hate the deacon.

294
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,500
 So I'm gonna, yeah, don't, if things are that dire with you and you feel like you have to

295
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,020
 hire an Internet hitman, it's just, I mean, guys, if you've come to that point in your

296
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,620
 life where you're, you know, trolling the Internet for a hitman or going to bars looking

297
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,220
 for a hitman, you got to reevaluate stuff because trust me, it's not going to end well.

298
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,060
 It's not going to end well at all.

299
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,060
 Don't do it.

300
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,380
 I'm sure you guys knew that already.

301
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,240
 A lot of time these Internet assassination websites get taken down because again, TOR is not

302
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,800
 invulnerable to this stuff.

303
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 Look at Silk Road.

304
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
 Oh, speaking of that, let me say this real quick.

305
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,800
 There is another podcast called Case Files.

306
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,280
 They have a three-part episode on Silk Road.

307
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,880
 It's the best nonfiction podcast I have ever heard.

308
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,080
 Those three episodes, at least.

309
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,880
 I was getting anxiety attacks listening to them.

310
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,300
 It is the story of the Silk Road.

311
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,300
 It is the website that allowed people to buy drugs anonymously.

312
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,420
 And then eventually they tried selling guns and it talks about, it's the story of the

313
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,460
 Dread Pirate Roberts.

314
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,060
 That is an amazing podcast.

315
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,340
 I recommend it wholeheartedly, like I said.

316
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,500
 My heart was pounding towards the end.

317
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
 Great story.

318
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,580
 I highly recommend it.

319
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,940
 I can't say enough about it.

320
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,380
 Hey, cool.

321
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,380
 Ann guys.

322
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,200
 Do you like to get spooky and stay spooky?

323
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,400
 Then check out our podcast, The Golden Goals.

325
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800

 Goodbye.

328
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,720
 We're going to go ahead and move on to our next story, a story I'm very excited to talk

329
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,040
 about because I love the Transformers movies.

330
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,620
 Now that sound I just heard was 1000 people clicking off this podcast.

331
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
 So here's the thing.

332
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
 Transformers 5 was terrible.

333
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,020
 It was the worst movie I've ever seen in the theater.

334
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,780
 I've walked out of movies better than Transformers 5.

335
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,940
 Total garbage.

336
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,580
 Transformers 2 was really bad, but it was made during the writer strike.

337
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,580
 They kind of made it as they went along.

338
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,060
 The ending action scene is great.

339
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,220
 It had sound wave, it had ravage, all the school stuff in it.

340
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
 Transformers 4 was just boring.

341
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,960
 It wasn't offensively bad, but it was just nothing happened.

342
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,660
 Transformers 1 is actually a good movie.

343
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,200
 Not like a good movie in the sense like on a Schindler's list or something, but it's

344
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,920
 very well done.

345
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,680
 And the beginning of Transformers 1 where the helicopter lands in the military base and

346
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,720
 the army soldiers surround it and then it transforms.

347
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,120
 I've watched that clip, that army-based clip so many times on YouTube.

348
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,920
 I love that scene and I remember sitting in the theater and going, "This is what I want

349
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,180
 out of a Transformers movie.

350
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,220
 I want to see humans and Autobots side by side fighting the Decepticons."

351
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,780
 I never was interested in just robots punching each other.

352
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,500
 I like the army stuff.

353
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:44,460
 Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon is not only the best movie of the series.

354
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:52,980
 It's not only, honestly, in my top 10 favorite films, but Transformers 3 is the best alien

355
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,360
 invasion movie since at least the last 20 years.

356
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
 Hands down.

357
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,280
 I will argue that any day.

358
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,400
 It has elements and it's great.

359
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
 It's weird.

360
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,040
 It has the Illuminati in it.

361
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,240
 It has the NASA cover-ups in it.

362
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,080
 It has one of the best alien invasion scenes.

363
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,960
 And the last hour of the movie is them fighting block by block through Chicago.

364
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,800
 And it does an interesting thing in that movie where the action is linear.

365
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,660
 So you will follow one character and then they'll cut to another scene.

366
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,100
 And when we rejoin that first character, they will be in a different location fighting

367
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,220
 a different enemy.

368
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,940
 So it's not like this cut and everything's happening at the same time.

369
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,260
 When you're watching Bumblebee and then they cut to Optimus Prime and you go back to Bumblebee

370
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,260
 later, he has progressed in his mission.

371
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,020
 It's very rare in action movies when you think about it.

372
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,260
 You'll see a guy shooting here and then you'll cut to another guy shooting or punching some

373
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
 guy you cut back.

374
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,800
 And the first guy still shooting in the same location he was before.

375
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,160
 Transformers 3 plays out like a war.

376
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,480
 Characters are moving throughout the battlefields expertly done.

377
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:10,320
 But there's a 490 page essay called "I Actually Kind of Appreciate the Transformers" and it

378
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,800
 gave me a whole new look on the movies.

379
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,480
 And this is the theory that this author puts forward.

380
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,260
 This was written by Terry Van Felde.

381
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,260
 I'll have the link below.

382
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,620
 I recommend you reading it.

383
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,220
 If you're a fan of Transformers or not, if you're a fan of film theory, it's mind blowing.

384
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,060
 What the theory he puts forward is that Optimus Prime is the bad guy.

385
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,820
 Unapologetically the bad guy.

386
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,940
 And this is important because the movies are put forward.

387
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,340
 That Optimus Prime is America.

388
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,380
 The whole movies, the humans are draped in the American flag.

389
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,460
 Michael Bay is known for his visual imagery.

390
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,000
 He's a real military personnel to make the movies.

391
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,040
 A lot of times the minor roles are played by active duty military.

392
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:02,040
 Optimus Prime is a raging psychopath and a murderer on a global scale in these movies.

393
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,400
 And what's interesting is that he is positioned as the good guy.

394
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,520
 We knew him as a good guy from the cartoon, from the comic books, from the toys, all that

395
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
 stuff.

396
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,680
 In the movies, this is basically the plot of each movie.

397
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,620
 Megatron wants to get something to save his race.

398
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,260
 And Optimus Prime blows it up.

399
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,780
 The first movie was the All Spark.

400
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,620
 It has the souls of every Transformer ever yet to be born.

401
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,860
 It's like the guff.

402
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,500
 It's their tree of life.

403
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,420
 Optimus Prime first throws it into a wormhole, which is how it gets to Earth.

404
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,100
 And then he pushes it into Megatron's chest, destroying both the Spark and the All Spark

405
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
 and Megatron.

406
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,200
 The second movie, because they don't have the All Spark, they have to have this machine

407
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,800
 that destroys our sun to again revitalize their species.

408
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,880
 In the second movie, the bad guy is in a Decepticon baby infirmary and they're watching

409
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,040
 these babies die.

410
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,560
 And it's very clear that's what's going on.

411
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,640
 For the future of the race of the Transformers, they need this energon.

412
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
 What does Optimus Prime do?

413
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
 He blows it up.

414
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,800
 Oh, it should be said too.

415
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,840
 And this is what the paper goes into all of this as well.

416
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,840
 There was a civil war on the planet of Cybertron, the Transformers home planet.

417
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,540
 The Decepticons won.

418
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,620
 It was never this, the war raged for a million years and no one side.

419
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,180
 No, the Decepticons killed everyone who just wasn't on their side.

420
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,900
 And the Autobots are like 20 people.

421
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
 Now here's the thing.

422
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,020
 At a certain point, you go from being the resistance to being terrorists.

423
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,940
 When there's only 20 of you left and everyone else on the planet is on board, you're Isis.

424
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,940
 You're Al-Qaeda.

425
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,900
 You're the bad guy because everyone else is on board.

426
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:43,200
 But so Megatron wants to create more Transformers and Optimus Prime is constantly stopping him

427
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,640
 from continuing the race.

428
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,480
 In Transformers 3, since Megatron's like, "Well, listen, we don't have the Allspark

429
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,160
 and we don't have this machine that can make energy on out of the sun, the only other plan

430
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,840
 is Plan Z that we planned for."

431
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,680
 And just in case Optimus Prime went nuts, we're going to bring Cybertron to Earth and

432
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,760
 enslave the humans to rebuild our planet.

433
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,840
 Optimus Prime destroys Cybertron.

434
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
 Just blows it up.

435
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,860
 It's like coming halfway through a wormhole.

436
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,740
 And Optimus Prime blows it up so it's half in a wormhole, half not.

437
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,940
 They just show the lights going out on the planet.

438
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,780
 He then executes two Transformers, Sentinel Prime and Megatron, as they beg for their lives.

439
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
 Shoot them in the head.

440
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,180
 Blows their brains out.

441
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,860
 In the novelization for Dark of the Moon, Megatron says, "Please don't kill me, Optimus

442
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,860
 and Optimus Prime."

443
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,860
 He goes, "Okay."

444
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,020
 And Megatron leaves not to get revenge, but to rebuild Cybertron.

445
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,680
 Transformers 4, there's this thing, of course, to make more Transformers.

446
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,760
 Megatron wants it, Optimus Prime, I believe, blows it up, but he doesn't.

447
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,440
 Megatron doesn't get away with it.

448
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,680
 And in the fifth one, surprise, surprise, Cybertron comes back to Earth and Optimus

449
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:57,000
 Prime not only blows it up, but kills the Transformers god that's living in the center

450
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,240
 of Cybertron.

451
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,080
 So he has decimated their race.

452
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,860
 And that's what's interesting about this essay.

453
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,980
 The essay goes up to Transformers 3, and so when I went to go see the next two, I thought,

454
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,020
 is Optimus Prime still going to...

455
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,020
 Yep.

456
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,700
 Yep, Optimus Prime is still actively destroying his entire race.

457
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,540
 He's so cold-blooded.

458
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,060
 Optimus Prime, childhood hero, personal child hero, is mine.

459
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,020
 I always looked up to Optimus Prime.

460
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:29,020
 He's so cold-blooded, he shoots Kelsey Grammer with a laser cannon that was built to punch

461
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,060
 holes through starships.

462
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:37,240
 He's like a low-level government employee who's punching Shia LaBeouf, and Optimus

463
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,400
 Prime just obliterates him.

464
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,920
 This cannon he's used to blow off Megatron's head multiple times.

465
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,320
 This thing that was built to basically wage interstellar war.

466
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,120
 He shoots a government flunky with it.

467
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,320
 He's insane in these movies.

468
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,960
 And what's interesting is I don't think Michael Bay's an idiot.

469
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,760
 You can say what you want about his filmmaking.

470
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,860
 I actually think he's...

471
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,180
 I think he's not like the best filmmaker, but I think he's great at what he does, which

472
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,380
 is action movies, but he's not an idiot.

473
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,380
 And it says something that his movies are so pro-American, and we're the good guys,

474
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,900
 they're the bad guys, the bad guys are named the Decepticons, you know?

475
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,580
 And this is just like, there's black and white, Optimus Prime's always giving these speeches

476
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,520
 almost to the camera about how life and freedom and humans and personal responsibility and

477
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
 all this stuff.

478
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,840
 And then when you step back out of the realm of, you know, watching the cartoon and knowing

479
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,480
 this guy is a hero based on other forms of media, he comes across as a total lunatic

480
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,240
 who then like executes people, full bore executes helpless people multiple times, and then he

481
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,760
 turns to the camera and goes, "Freedom is the right of all beings."

482
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,380
 And you're like, "What the hell is going on?"

483
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,540
 And I think the shame is, is a lot of people, I think the reason, because these films are

484
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,300
 considered just for kids and things like that, that film theorists and people who analyze

485
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,140
 film, film critics and just in general, just dismiss them.

486
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,060
 And I think they are really rich, they have these weird themes.

487
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:17,180
 This particularly, I've seen Transformers 3, I don't know how many times, and I will

488
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,700
 watch just clips of it online.

489
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,860
 I was just watching clips of it online last night.

490
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,520
 That movie, I love that movie, but I never thought of it critically in that way until

491
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,360
 I read this essay, and it totally rings true.

492
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,160
 Optimus Prime is nothing more than a terrorist who kills his own people time and time again

493
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,240
 and makes sure that they're going to never be any more Transformers.

494
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,940
 He destroyed all their souls.

495
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,600
 And there's never a reason why, just that the Megatron's evil.

496
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,940
 And I do think Michael Bay is smart enough to make that message that America does all

497
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,980
 these crazy things that are so morally ambiguous.

498
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,220
 And they may say, "Freedom is the right of all sentient beings," but then they just

499
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,860
 drop bombs everywhere.

500
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,420
 I think that it really is supposed to be more subversive than people have caught on, like

501
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,500
 Starship Troopers.

502
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,040
 I think as more time passes, people may get a closer look at Transformers and see it

503
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,960
 as that, but this essay definitely does that.

504
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,920
 And I really wish more people would look at Transformers with a critical eye rather than

505
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,120
 being like, "Oh, you can't tell the Transformers apart, Michael Bay's a hack.

506
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,240
 It's all a bunch of shots of women looking up their skirts and blah, blah, blah."

507
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,760
 And it's really dismissive.

508
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
 There's more there.

509
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,360
 I've read a dozen thought pieces on Infinity War, which I really enjoyed that movie as well.

510
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,020
 I personally think Transformers 3 is better than Infinity War, honestly, just pound for

511
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,020
 pound.

512
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,340
 But if you haven't watched those movies, I recommend one in three.

513
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,500
 And I definitely recommend reading the essay because I haven't even scraped the surface.

514
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:57,220
 There's all sorts of other elements and proof that Optimus Prime is really the bad guy of

515
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
 those movies.

516
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,220
 It's fascinating.

517
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,300
 And again, if Optimus Prime is the bad guy of those movies and Optimus Prime is draped

518
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,920
 in the American flag, what is Michael Bay really saying about the American culture?

519
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
 Fascinating stuff.

520
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
 Fascinating.

521
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,880
