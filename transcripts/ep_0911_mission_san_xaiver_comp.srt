00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 New information involving yesterday's story.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,040
 We're gonna go more into detail about a young girl's ghost being spotted at

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,080
 Nettleton High School. Then we travel to LA to take a look at another specter that

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,520
 seems to be trying to interfere with the lives of the living. And then we take a

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,640
 trip all the way out to Arizona. Is there any truth to the story that there is a

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,880
 building in Arizona that's unique architecture actually reveals when the

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,640

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,240
 country. Getting a good workout in there Kree Master. Bottling your own sweaty

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,760
 scent. Yesterday's episode we talked about Neddleton High School. The

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,640
 Ghost of Raider Gym. And it's so funny. I really really loved that story when I

32
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,760
 was editing it. I was like oh this is really cool. Like this is going to be a

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,640
 nice spooky one. And like I had said in that episode if you haven't heard it

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,360
 basically a ghost story in a gym. Sightings of a phantom girl. You could

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,920
 hear people screaming in the darkness sometimes. And then one of the most

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,000
 unique features was there was a tree. Well there wasn't a tree. Because then this

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,280
 wouldn't be unique. These students were there late at night. They were hearing

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,080
 screaming in the gym. And when they went into the gymnasium they saw leaves

39
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,840
 falling to the ground. And I go you know it's super rare as far as paranormal

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,080
 phenomenon goes. To have living organic matter just manifest. We've had coins

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,720
 manifest. We've had things disappear and reappear in houses. But living matter. No

42
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,640
 I said that's rare. I couldn't think of another time that that happened. And I

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,280
 also said on that episode that I was in touch with. Nettleton television. It's

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,200
 the student run. Program at Nettleton where they produce two documentaries.

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,160
 About Raider Jim. About the ghost of Raider Jim. So I was talking to Nettleton

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,800
 television about it. And then when I finished the episode. And it's so funny.

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,800
 I don't usually do this. I don't usually do this. I usually just let people find

48
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,840
 the episode on their own. But Nettleton television was so good with giving me

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,160
 information. I thought they might want to know how this turned out. So I sent them

50
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,280
 the finished episode. And we got some additional news. And this is weird. Okay so

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,640
 I send this over and I talked to the teacher advisor Craig. Craig Miller.

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,800
 Thank you again for your help. And after everything was said and done he goes oh

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,760
 you know it was a really cool episode. And it was kind of spooky. But some of the

54
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:21,160
 stuff has been confirmed fake. It's very very interesting. They're very interesting.

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,680
 So let's take a look at this. According to Craig Miller. He said and this is

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,360
 super and I want to be very clear with you guys because this is just part and

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,640
 partial of doing paranormal research right. You're going generally when you're

58
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,000
 a scientist and you're researching atoms and stuff like that you're like oh I

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,920
 just read this great paper on how molecules fly around atoms and then you

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,000
 do all this extra research and then you find out that that scientific paper was

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,040
 fake. It doesn't happen. No one's like putting fake bones in the ground waiting

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,400
 for you to dig them up and then you know you're like oh man I thought I made a

63
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,960
 new dinosaur. No it doesn't happen but in paranormal research it does happen a lot.

64
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,240
 He goes I only kind of know what I've heard but apparently this is so funny

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
 because I said how rare it was to have a tree with leaves. Apparently that's fake.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,440
 He goes talking to a former choir teacher. He had heard that some of the

67
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,320
 students had made up the leaves detail. Now that didn't happen. He goes I want to

68
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,120
 confirm that. He's actually going to do a little more digging but I wanted to be

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,200
 honest and fair. I just found out this information last night. He said I know

70
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,920
 one of the students who initially came up with this story about the leaves

71
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,160
 falling and then they said I'll reach out to him to confirm whether or not it was

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,840
 a joke on their part. So we'll see what comes of that but it's so interesting.

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,600
 Remember I'm saying this is super rare. I've never seen anything like this before

74
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,840
 and it's possibly fake. Probably fake really. I think we can move it out of

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,080
 the possible. So the probably and then we have the story that the country music

76
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,360
 star Moose. What was it? I don't remember his foot. It was Jim Moose. He talked about

77
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,400
 that he had seen the ghost. He didn't know it was a ghost at the time. He had seen a

78
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,440
 young girl walking through the hallways of Raider Jim. They broke in late at

79
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:24,240
 night and he's watching this girl walk. Apparently apparently that was fake too.

80
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,200
 But what's interesting about this is that what happened was they made this

81
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,400
 documentary the original one that goes to Raider Jim and then this country

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,960
 musician. I'll look up his name real quick here. Hold on I got to go into

83
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,640
 yesterday's notes but this country musician was watching that original

84
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,800
 documentary and then contacted the school and said oh that's so weird. I didn't

85
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,560
 know that the place had a reputation of being haunted. I saw a ghost as well. I

86
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,240
 saw a ghost back in 1980-1981. His name was Jim Brown. Jim Moose Brown. So

87
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,200
 anyways Craig Miller said Moose saw the original documentary then Moose

88
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,000
 contacted us. We shot a new update to the documentary and once that documentary

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,400
 came out someone said oh that was a prank. We pulled on Moose. He was not a part

90
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,320
 of it. Years ago we wanted to scare Moose and his friends who broke into the

91
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,560
 gym so they dressed someone up as a girl or was a girl. I don't know what the

92
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,260
 thing was but it was a fake. They had a friend disguised as a ghost and to walk

93
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:36,640
 around all creepy. Now apparently Moose then heard that story that it was fake

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:43,600
 and absolutely denied it. Said no that's not what it was. That's 100% not what it

95
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,440
 was. I didn't see a friend. I didn't see someone dressed up as a girl ghost. What I

96
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,440
 saw was paranormal. What I find so odd about all this stuff right is that it

97
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,540
 may be fake. It may be fake. Right some of the stuff may be fake. All of it may be

98
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,620
 fake but I found this in different parts of the internet. And if you were going

99
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:11,340
 to if your objective was to scare Moose and his friends if you listen to that

100
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,220
 ghost story all the all the girl did was kind of walk slowly around the gym and

101
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,020
 the two other friends never saw it. Just Moose. Now that's more of like a

102
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,780
 psychological terror. That's a long con. Right because apparently he never really

103
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,920
 told the story to anyone. He might he told his friends hey I just saw someone in

104
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,500
 here we're gonna get caught. He didn't even think it was a ghost. He just saw a

105
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,840
 girl walking and thought that another student had gotten in there. So what

106
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,780
 that's kind of a lame scare. It's weird. So I'm questioning because again I am a

107
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:47,920
 conspiracy theorist. Was what Moose saw fake? That's theory one. Or Moose saw a

108
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,560
 real ghost. That's theory two. Or Moose saw a real ghost and there is an active

109
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,300
 thing going on in Edelton High to actually suppress the ghost story. So then

110
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,660
 they made up the debunking. Here's the thing I'm a conspiracy theorist and by

111
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,900
 nature. And so I have to ask myself was the ghost a fake right? Was it a joke? It

112
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,660
 wasn't a very good joke right? Because they didn't get super scared. The other

113
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,100
 two guys didn't even see it. It's more of like a psychological terror just kind of

114
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,700
 walking through the darkness. Not like she chased them away or yelled boo or

115
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,080
 anyone jumped out to scare them as well. So you have that. You had a student

116
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,480
 prank or Moose saw a real ghost. Now Craig goes listen that at first

117
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,520
 documentary those people they were telling those stories. Like he's like I

118
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,960
 don't have an explanation for everything. I'm putting words in his mouth. He

119
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,800
 didn't exactly say that but he goes you know I don't know what to think as far

120
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,280
 as those stories go. Let me pull up his exact quote here. He goes as for the

121
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,000
 stories in our original documentary I just don't know. It's like Charlie Daniel

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,860
 said there's some things in this world you just can't explain. So I don't know

123
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,900
 and this is just part and parcel of working in the paranormal research

124
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,700
 community. I'm not mad right? I'm not mad. I like that story and I wanted to

125
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,240
 update it for you and this kind of makes sense when I go this is I've never

126
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,800
 seen anything like this before. That makes me think that now that it was

127
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,640
 fake the leaves coming down because it doesn't match paranormal lore. But did

128
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,880
 Moose really see a ghost? Is this a cover-up? Are they now kind of backtracking

129
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,960
 Craig's? Like come on Meg what are you talking about? My high school? There's no big conspiracy theory going on here. It's so funny Craig was so good at

130
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,040
 responding to me even like late at night. There's a big time difference between

131
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,160
 Oregon and Arkansas. He was so good at responding to me the back of my head I

132
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,880
 thought he might be a ghost. He might be a ghost honing a lab at Nettleton High

133
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,440
 School because I was like dang this guy's on top of things and I'm like emailing

134
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,120
 stuff at like 10 p.m. West Coast time. So I'm not saying you're a ghost officially

135
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,520
 but anyways I wanted to give you guys an update. I do think this story is really

136
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,440
 fascinating now that we know parts of it are fake or maybe fake. It's actually a

137
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,680
 little more interesting because very rarely do we get confirmation that

138
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,720
 stuff's fake and then it kind of lets us go. That's why we never see that in any

139
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,160
 other paranormal stories because it was made up. So but we'll see he's gonna get

140
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,640
 in contact with a student who talked about the leaves. See if we get more

141
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,800
 information on that. Moose is adamant that he saw a ghost. Craig says I believe

142
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,880
 his friend who said that it was all a joke. Super super interesting story

143
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,280
 nonetheless. We talked about that for a little bit longer than I thought we would

144
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,000
 so cream master cycle let's go ahead get you off that bike. We're gonna tushy the

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,480
 keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're leaving behind Arkansas and Nettleton High School.

146
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
 We're headed all the way out too. You know what we had enough ghosts. Let's

147
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,640
 let's say that ghost story for tomorrow. Go ahead and take that Jason Jalopy all

148
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:57,800
 the way out to New Mexico. Cream master cycle is driving us on. We got the

149
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,440
 air conditioner at full blast and we're headed back to the year 1974.

150
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,960
 Specifically at September 1974 and we're headed towards a little town no one is

151
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:14,000
 Hobbes. So near Hobbes, New Mexico there's a farm and at this farm you have

152
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,960
 this little farmhouse and a couple chickens. You know how the song goes

153
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,120
 right. Cluck cluck here to cluck cluck there cows probably I guess there's

154
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,280
 different types of farms. Like if you have like a bunch of okra or if you're

155
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:31,040
 growing like wheat it doesn't necessarily Jason come on what are you three? Not

156
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,360
 every farm has a cow like there's dairy farms and if you're a dairy farm it's not

157
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,200
 like you're like oh it's time to go pull them grapes off the vine. No it's

158
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,880
 different types of farms you're like yes Jason I'm aware of how businesses work.

159
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,560
 So anyways I don't know I don't know if this guy had a

160
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,600
 cluck cluck here and a cluck cluck there it's a farm. We're back in the year

161
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,000
 1974 and this farmer is driving his pickup truck home on the road again.

162
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,320
 No copyright violation if I make the tune wrong. He's driving this pickup

163
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:11,560
 truck down this dusty path back home and as he's getting closer to his house he

164
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,560
 sees a site he's not used to. He's like what I don't have any cows where is that

165
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,760
 Moo Moo here and a Moo Moo there coming from. He looks up in the sky

166
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:32,480
 this massive UFO is in the sky just this huge disc is flying overhead.

167
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,680
 Jason you really don't learn your lesson you just found out that you did a whole

168
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,060
 second on a story that was fake and that just involves someone walking through a

169
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:46,080
 gym now you're having a giant UFO in the middle of the day.

170
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:55,040
 Flying overhead and it's so big that not only has his attention his wife and his

171
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,640
 daughter because he's almost home. His wife his daughter and apparently a

172
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,120
 neighbor was visiting at the time they came running out of the house and they

173
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,360
 looked up and they saw the disc flying overhead as well. Now he's driving his

174
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,800
 pickup truck and he's like literally on the path down his driveway

175
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,880
 headed home and he's like driving and he has his head like craned out the window

176
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,720
 he's kind of looking up at it because at this point it's right over him and then

177
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,680
 all of a sudden the bottom of the UFO opens up and this farmer and his entire

178
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,440
 pickup truck or beam the board it starts to float off the ground oh no the brakes

179
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,680
 don't work steering wheel doesn't work and he starts to ascend into the belly

180
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,360
 of this UFO. The wife the daughter and the neighbor are all watching this all

181
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,480
 watching this entire vehicle get abducted by a UFO and once the pickup

182
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:59,360
 truck is completely inside the UFO takes off. Apparently the wife called the

183
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,760
 police that would be what you would do right you want to be like oh maybe

184
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,880
 he'll come back later. She called the police the police investigated this and

185
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,120
 according to the story this event was covered up by local authorities this you

186
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,600
 if you want to check this one if you want to find out the farmer's name or the

187
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,360
 exact date or anything like that you can't the story was covered up by the

188
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,720
 local authorities. Now this story I have a sneak and suspicion I talked about the

189
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,040
 story before it sounds vaguely familiar but I also read stories a long time ago

190
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,240
 and have them in my notes I'm kind of waiting for the right time to talk about

191
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,280
 them so I might have covered it before if I did I apologize but I'm iffy on that

192
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,680
 and it's fascinating enough that I wanted to talk about it again I got this

193
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,240
 story from thinkaboutadocs.com they got it from a book called Situation Red the

194
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,080
 UFO siege by Leonard H Stringfield what's interesting is in the world of

195
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:09,280
 UFOology there are a few different factions and this faction the UFO siege is

196
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:17,480
 I really feel under underserved in the sense that the aliens are here to do us

197
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,120
 harm the aliens are not here for good purposes you had a big buildup in the

198
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,960
 70s and the 80s where the aliens were connected to new agee so I really go

199
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,160
 back to 60s 70s 80s the aliens were connected to new agee they're gonna

200
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,160
 cure all of our diseases they're going to help mankind ascend to a cosmic

201
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,960
 brotherhood you'd see that in books like childhoods end by no one pedophile

202
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,400
 Arthur C. Clark all but that episode of the show notes I guess I should I guess

203
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,640
 I shouldn't say no an alleged pedophile Arthur C. Clark so as a state doesn't

204
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,240
 sue me a childhoods end was about the cosmic brotherhood you see a lot of

205
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,000
 that stuff nowadays it's kind of a mishmash where you have the reptilians

206
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,080
 trying to take over the world or you know the gray aliens doing cattle

207
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,080
 mutilations or abducting humans but you still have a good contingent of the

208
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,640
 Gaia calm new age belief that aliens are here to help us and books like the UFO

209
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,720
 siege is saying that's not the case that's actually not the case you have

210
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,440
 aliens that are trying to do us harm continuously do us harm and I like

211
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,760
 showing stories where we are more defenseless against these things right

212
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,320
 you would think if you were in a pickup truck you could outrun this thing but

213
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,360
 I mean they can abduct the whole pickup truck in front of witnesses in the

214
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,320
 middle of the day you always hear the stories the big thing people go of

215
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,520
 aliens are real how come they always visit some drunk farmer in Missouri at

216
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,920
 3 a.m. there's hundreds of not thousands of stories that aren't that but

217
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,280
 that's kind of the easy way to dismiss it it's an easy way to dismiss it and we

218
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,720
 have this big push towards UFOs UAPs let's get the military to tell us what

219
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,240
 they finally are and when you look at reports like this sue me this report

220
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,440
 this reports to you but whether or not a tic-tac UFO was flying around the Nimitz

221
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,920
 battle group back in 2017 yeah that's cool right but it didn't

222
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,960
 abduct anybody right it didn't abduct anybody it didn't change and I'm not

223
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,360
 saying for it to be real they have to abduct people but a lot of there's a

224
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,120
 new push there's a new push towards a very dry clinical look at aliens used to

225
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,320
 me that there are our space brothers because we were locked into this cold

226
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,720
 war and it seemed like we were gonna kill each other and it was up to the

227
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,480
 aliens to save us and then as we get into the 90s as the cold war starts to end

228
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,920
 basically people stop looking outside their borders and within their borders

229
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,440
 for the enemy the enemy within and we became very conspiracy focused and

230
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,320
 obviously things like 9/11 even made that even worse so now the aliens are a lot

231
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,920
 of them are reptilians they're part of this new world order they're trying to

232
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,520
 take over the planet and things like that but you still have the big new agee

233
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,280
 movement now you have aliens as the oppressors taking over and then you

234
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,360
 have aliens in a very dry clinical way like if a tic-tac was flying around the

235
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,360
 Nimitz battle group was it a gray was it a reptilian like it's so interesting

236
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,240
 like now when journalists talk about it now it's just so kind of dry the same

237
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,240
 way you would talk about oh we're testing a new laser cannon on a plane it

238
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,080
 doesn't really go into any of the sociological issues of alien life but

239
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,400
 I wanted I wanted to talk about that because again it shows that raw power

240
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,640
 of alien life if it is out there and you'll never hear you'll never read

241
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,080
 that article on MSNBC.com or Fox News anything like that it's too wacky it's

242
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,080
 too goofy it's almost like they're trying to take the sci-fi sheen off of the UFO

243
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,840
 phenomenon and they're like here's something we don't understand here's a

244
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,480
 tic-tac you know okay who's driving it like what type of alien do you think is

245
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,600
 driving it do you think it's C3PO like let's talk because you can't talk about UFOs

246
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,200
 without talking about the sociological part of it as well so very very

247
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,040
 fascinating this is a really interesting time to be into UFOs to be in the

248
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,400
 paranormal because you're seeing more people talking about it but they're

249
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,920
 talking about it in a different way than we're used to so very very interesting

250
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,240
 story if it's true and if it's not if it's not or if I covered it already I

251
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,520
 apologize but Cream Master Cycle we're gonna go ahead and leave behind Hobbes New

252
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,600
 Mexico they're like will you help us find my husband we're like nah we got

253
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,640
 something else to talk about Cream Master Cycle fire up the carbonic

254
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:51,080
 helicopter we're headed all the way out to Arizona this is a story that just

255
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,440
 like the nettleton high school story I started off by finding it on shadowlands.net

256
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,840
 and the more I dug into it the better it got that's generally how these things

257
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,280
 work right the more you dig into it and if you're able to find more information

258
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,640
 about it this story is absolutely insane started with the local urban legend but

259
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,480
 by the end of the story you might believe in the legend yourself we're headed

260
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,040
 out to Tucson Arizona well near there where you're like oh I have family there

261
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,000
 I'm gonna stop and say hi nope say in the carbonic helicopter we're actually headed

262
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,840
 out to the area of the Santa Cruz River we're looking for mission San Xavier

263
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,360
 del Boc and this mission was built between 1783 and 1797

264
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,880
 it was like how did it take so long to build a building it's 14 years people

265
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,840
 are just praying in there there's no roof they're like totally getting rained on

266
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,240
 it took them 14 years to build this building and today it's a big tourist

267
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,800
 attraction like religious tourist attraction I don't think people are

268
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,160
 going out there and like taking photos of themselves maybe they're praying and

269
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,080
 stuff like that I don't know why a non-religious person would go here I'm

270
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,720
 not saying you have to worship Mickey Mouse and go to Disneyland but apparently

271
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,920
 people visit it but I don't think it's just random people walking around but

272
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,720
 they should actually everyone should stop by this mission everyone should

273
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,040
 stop by mission San Xavier del Boc because it may give you a clue of what

274
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,920
 the future holds this mission is reportedly haunted by a monk the ghost

275
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,360
 of a monk he's like always floating around and stuff like that it's like oh

276
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,160
 no one build a roof and it got rainy in here and I got pneumonia and died and

277
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,560
 there his his ghost is kind of floating around and then also it's like a mission

278
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,680
 building remember in school we had to build those little Adobe missions I

279
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,560
 don't know I was in California but we had to build missions for a school

280
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,600
 project we had to like make the little Adobe brook not life-size missions

281
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,240
 really Jason that was a pretty brutal school you're like making I was like oh

282
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,480
 kind of please learn math today they're like no you have 50 more Adobe bricks to

283
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,320
 make we'd make little dioramas I remember doing that a lot as a kid this

284
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,720
 mission had like different buildings kind of like a mission complex so you

285
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,880
 had the main church itself and you have these other outlying buildings in the

286
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,720
 same area apparently one of these buildings in the past caught on fire and

287
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,160
 a none and five school kids were burned alive at the schoolhouse they tried to

288
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,600
 get out they didn't and finish their dioramas the fires come when she's like

289
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,840
 nope no one's leaving till your homework stem they're like ah anyways you there's

290
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,120
 reports that you can see her ghost leading five children away from that

291
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,080
 area it's no longer there the structure is burnt down but the main reason you

292
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,480
 know there's other ghost stories as well hearing voices stuff like that but the

293
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,560
 main reason I wanted to cover this story this is so cool this is so interesting

294
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:50,200
 is outside of the mission there's this giant facade on the front of the mission

295
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:57,080
 right it's this giant kind of ornate designed a piece of work it's above the

296
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,440
 main door and it's it's quite huge it appears to be really big in the

297
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,960
 photographs I'd say it's a couple feet by a couple feet I'd say it's probably

298
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,760
 bigger than me right and it's all like this ornate work and all like these

299
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,480
 little curly thingies and little leaves and stuff like that and then on each

300
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,560
 side all they'll be photos in the show notes if that's not enough of an image

301
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,800
 in your mind there'll be photos in the show notes on each side because you know

302
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,640
 it's like supposed to look beautiful so it's very symmetrical on each side at the

303
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:32,040
 very edge of the left and the right part of this facade is this curly little woo

304
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:40,240
 and inside that is a mouse and then standing outside the woo is a cat and

305
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,600
 people it's weird like people have talked about this historically like I didn't

306
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,360
 just find this on ghost websites I was looking up the history of mission San

307
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,600
 Xavier Dale Bach as well they said we don't really know why the cat and the

308
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,360
 mouse artwork is there because it doesn't have any religious significance the

309
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,680
 other thing like the main image in the facade outside of all of the little

310
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,080
 intricate things is there's a picture of Jesus crucified which is what you would

311
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,200
 expect on a church right but the cat and the mouse doesn't really have any

312
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,280
 biblical significance the cat is the only domesticated animal that is never

313
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,560
 mentioned in the Bible cats were very common in the area because you know like

314
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,480
 Egyptians are constantly like had cats around according to Prince of Egypt by

315
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,920
 Dreamworks you'd have cats they knew what cats were cats are not named in the

316
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,240
 Bible at all so there's no religious significance to a cat and a mouse I

317
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,040
 think mice are in the Bible but they're the ones who sewed Jacobs code of many

318
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,080
 colors the cat and the mouse has no religious significance why is it there

319
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:50,760
 and this legend popped up basically according to reports the monk the monk

320
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,160
 that it kind of has an ominous presence his ghost that wanders the estate he

321
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:04,440
 tells this story the cat and the mouse are symbols of the end of the world if

322
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:13,000
 the cat ever catches the mouse the world is about to end like what like I mean

323
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,840
 it's frozen in time it's actually carved into stone and the monks like are you

324
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,680
 doubting me I'm literally a spirit I'm floating around in front of you you can

325
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,000
 see through me are you doubting me but you can look at these and I was thinking

326
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,920
 like oh that would be cool actually move do you see a little ceramic mouse running

327
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,160
 around you're trying to feed it ceramic cheese they're frozen in time it's a

328
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,600
 sculpture but apparently according to this legend if the cat ever catches the

329
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,400
 mouse then the world's about to end which is good news for us because it

330
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,600
 would actually take forever for an inanimate object to catch another

331
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,720
 inanimate object but I'm assuming as we're coming closer to the actual end of

332
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,840
 all human reality the death of the universe due to paranormal means that

333
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,980
 cement can move as the demons are pouring out of hell and the angels are

334
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,240
 pouring out of heaven there's a massive battle across all time and space I'm

335
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,640
 pretty sure that pretty sure that a facade at a mission in Arizona could do

336
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,800
 something a little wacky but that's the idea if the cat catches the mouse in the

337
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,440
 world's about to end I saw that I really liked it I took a bunch of notes on it I

338
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,840
 started to research it I go what a cool urban legend but again as I dug more

339
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:27,880
 into this place this is absolutely insane this is absolutely insane you guys

340
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,640
 may be wondering why I have the cover art that I do for this episode it's

341
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,800
 the picture of Jesus crucified on the cross right and you're like yeah I can

342
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,760
 kind of see that if you guys you guys are driving the car right now that's

343
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,640
 what it is but he's in such a weird position if you look at this facade

344
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,880
 you'll see that Jesus is crucified but he's not like crucified up on the cross

345
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,760
 his hands are spread out and he is them nailed to the cross and then he's in

346
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,160
 this weird sitting position like you can actually see him kind of slouched down

347
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,520
 and sitting and even that looks kind of uncomfortable because it's like the cross

348
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,000
 is in front of him so it's this weird thing so his hands are crucified and

349
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,720
 then he's sitting down and his waist goes behind the cross I've never seen

350
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,120
 crucifixion like this before I've been to a lot of them I'm actually a 3000 year

351
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,280
 old vampire I've never seen crucifixion or crucifixion art like this before so

352
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,400
 his arms and his torso are in front of the cross as you would expect but he's

353
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,920
 slouching down and then his waist and his legs are like wrapped around the

354
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,920
 bottom of the cross very very weird and honestly though when I first saw it

355
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,400
 didn't think anything of it I didn't even really notice that that was part of

356
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,040
 the motif I was looking at trying to see if the cat caught the mouse as I started

357
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,360
 looking into just trivia about the mission I found this website Tucson.com

358
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,960
 did an article mission san Xavier del Boc 11 things to know and it was quoting

359
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:09,280
 all these different facts about the mission inside the mission there is a

360
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:15,640
 sculpture a statue of st. Francis Xavier should make sense he's the founder of

361
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,000
 the mission and he's sitting in a glass case now what's interesting it used to

362
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,640
 be a rumor that it was a mummy usually be a rumor that it was a mummy you have

363
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,880
 it definitely get me to go to a mission any religion that has mummies I'm down

364
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:36,000
 you have a certain I'm a worshiper of set you have this statue of st. Francis

365
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Xavier in this glass case and it's just it's weird looking so people thought it

366
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,760
 was a walk around with his arms out brains brains are like ah this it was not

367
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,600
 originally a statue of st. Francis Xavier originally it was a statue of

368
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,600
 Jesus crucified on the cross and what happened was about 50 miles north you

369
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:07,400
 had of the Tuma Kokori mission that was set up in Arizona way back in time but

370
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:14,920
 by 1849 that settlement was constantly getting attacked by Apache raiders so

371
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:21,520
 they had to start moving stuff in their monk hat they're like dude we got to go

372
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,800
 so as they were moving all their stuff from 50 miles north way back in the

373
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:33,920
 1800s they had this giant statue of Jesus crucified it broke it broke they're

374
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,480
 trying to move it down to mission san Xavier del Bach which had already been

375
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,200
 established it was built back in 1797 so now we're 50 years in the future and 50

376
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,960
 miles away they're bringing down this statue of Christ crucified and on the

377
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:56,040
 journey his legs break off and they go you're gonna need those you're gonna need

378
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:03,080
 those on a statue of Jesus so what they do is they took that statue and made it

379
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,440
 up and like kind of like decorated it and changed it a bit and turned it into a

380
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,640
 statue of st. Francis Xavier sitting down so that's the statue that's in there

381
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:22,220
 now so my question to you is this facade that's sitting on mission san

382
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:30,200
 Xavier del Bach this mission that was built in 1797 how in the world did they

383
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:38,840
 design it to show a picture of Jesus with his legs broken off if you look at

384
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,120
 that picture the way that he's sitting there's like the crosses blocking his

385
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,900
 waist and first off why is Jesus sitting on the cross right that's just that's

386
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,640
 just number one why is he even sitting down on the ground but that facade as

387
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,720
 far as I can tell that that facade is as old as the mission they have been doing

388
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,560
 restorations and things like that but I would be surprised if when they were

389
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,280
 restoring this mission they go you know what we should do we should change the

390
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,320
 facade to show the fact that Jesus got his legs broken off on this 50 mile

391
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,720
 journey

392
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,520
 it's possible right it's possible that he wanted to be truthful in their

393
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,800
 advertising that our Jesus doesn't have legs you come to mission san Xavier del

394
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,000
 Bach but again tonight with Jesus with no legs in the church they turned it into

395
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,800
 a statue of st. Francis Xavier sitting down in this weird position because it's

396
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,920
 kind of hard to sit down when you have no legs so did the facade tell the future

397
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,300
 because the image is clear it's a picture of Jesus on the cross but his

398
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,280
 legs are separated from his body there's no other way to read that picture

399
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,720
 and I can't think of another picture of Jesus crucified on the cross where he's

400
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,320
 sitting like that was it restored over the years to show that it would be weird

401
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:03,800
 to show statues break all the time right if you had a big drawing of Venus the

402
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,800
 Milo and then her arms broke off you wouldn't be like great then you would

403
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,880
 erase the arms that the art would remain the same did the facade tell the future

404
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:21,000
 about the statue of Jesus being crucified breaking at that same point and if

405
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,080
 the facade told that relatively minor fact that something that was gonna

406
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,680
 happen 50 years in the future if the facade could detail that could it then

407
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:40,240
 not tell us when the universe is going to end so forget your doomsday clocks and

408
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,840
 your green button forget the soothsayers on the internet constantly

409
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,800
 talking about two more weeks and the world will end the real gauge to tell

410
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:56,960
 whether or not the end is nigh may actually be sitting in Arizona an image

411
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:06,320
 of a cat trying to get at an image of a mouse frozen in stone it does not

412
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,400
 quickly move depending on political leaders it does not quickly move depending

413
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,720
 on the geopolitics of the world or the emotions of the person making the

414
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,360
 prediction the only thing that can move these items the only thing that can get

415
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:31,600
 the cat close to the mouse would be God himself the only person who can warn us

416
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:39,420
 about the destruction of the universe is the only person who can destroy the

417
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,920
 universe
