1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 When witchcraft is suspected at a polling station, police will do everything to stop it.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 And then we go back to the conspiracy theory iceberg to take a look at a seemingly harmless conspiracy theory that might actually be the end of us all.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Number stations post-Trump. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 It's 2020 and this is the only podcast that's being put out right now that is not talking about politics and trust me, that will not be broken today.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I'm 100% don't talk about politics on this show. I know some of you may have seen the title and been like, "Oh no, is he talking politics? I don't talk about politics."

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 What are you talking about? I am going to talk about magic at a polling station, but rest assured people, this is the only podcast in existence right now that is not talking politics.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Malum Arcana. Malum, thank you so much for supporting the show.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Really, really helps out a lot. You're going to be our captain, our pilot, whatever vehicle we take, you're in charge.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 If you get supported by the Patreon, totally get that. Just help get the word out about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So Malum, let's go ahead and hop in the Dead Rabbit Durageable. We're taking a little trip. We're headed out to the Maldives.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 [Malum noise] Malum's shaking his head. He's like, "Doesn't know how you pronounce that either."

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I'm like, "I don't know. I can't even find out on the map. [Malum noise]

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 You just keep making this noise and it will distract you from all the pronunciation errors. This information I got from an article in The Guardian by Jason Burke, so I wanted to give him credit for this story.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 We're going to land on Guriduhu Island. Malum is just like, "How am I supposed to find this thing? I don't know where to land. You're just making noises."

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I'm like, "Dude, anyways, we just land at Guriduhu. We land on an island. We take a taxi cab to Guriduhu Island. It's September 3rd, 2013. They're getting ready to have a presidential election and everything's on the line.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Because you have like a president who was like, "Run out of the country. He's trying to regain power and you have this other guy, this coup. He's trying to maintain power and all this stuff going on and the people are ready to vote."

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 But there's this polling station, right? It's a school that's being used as a polling station and then one day, all these cop cars are pulling up to the school.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 They're running and they're like, "Get down, get down, get down. Go, go, go." The cops are pulling their guns out and they're like, "Don't move!"

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And we look over and we see they're pointing their guns at a little coconut. A little coconut just sitting next to the school. And we're like, "What? Is that like a transformer? Is it going to turn into a robot? Is it a critter rolled up?"

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Nope. They have giant coconut handcuffs. They put it around the coconut. They're like, "No one's getting your milk, not today."

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 They're like, "Maybe in the evidence room we might." And they take it and they throw it in the back of the cop car and it's like, "You can't stop me. Cop car is trying to wiggle out. It really is a critter."

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 They take it downtown. And here's why. So in the Maldives, the most of the population is Sunni Muslim.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 But in the rural areas, especially, really believe in superstition, really believe in magic.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 That always seems to be a constant thing. You have like the urban centers that are like, "What? You believe in witchcraft and magic? Oh, you guys are so foolish. That's what my astrology chart said today.

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Let me take this homeopathic vitamin that I found out on Goop."

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Those yokels, they believe in fairies. You always see that type of stuff, right? So in Maldives, it's the same thing.

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 People go, "Oh, they still believe in magic and witchcraft out there. This stuff doesn't exist."

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 In this area on Guridahu Island, they still believe in the magic.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Turns out in this area, coconuts are often used to cast spells. Delicious spells, I might add.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Coconuts are used to cast spells. You'll write spells on coconut and throw it.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 You're like, "I curse your window to be broken."

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 People are like, "Oh, no, the curse came true. I curse you'd have ants in your house. There's coconut milk everywhere."

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 No! That's why they believe in curses, because they always work.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Your right spells on coconuts, they use coconuts for their magic, and then they just kind of roll them around.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 It's kind of easy to tell who the wizard was. He's always carrying a sack full of coconuts.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 He's always on keto. He's always drinking bulletproof coffee.

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Like, "Hey, dude, you look like you've lost a lot of weight. Are you a wizard?" He's like, "Huh? No. I just really like coconuts."

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 He's wearing a coconut fur jacket. Anyways, this school had said, "We don't want to be part of the presidential election,

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 because we don't want any black magic around our school." People were like, "What are you talking about?"

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And they said, "Listen, this is a super intense presidential election, and we know a bunch of wizards are going to be showing up throwing coconuts around,

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 so we don't want any of that." So the school actually didn't want to be involved in the presidential election.

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And people were like, "You kind of have to." Like, that's stupid. You can't not be part of democracy,

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 because you're afraid of magical coconuts. And the school was like, "Yeah, we can."

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 But they lost. They had to-- A polling station was set up.

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Now, this coconut, eventually, like some groundskeeper or teacher was walking around, and they saw a coconut out of their school,

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 and they flipped out, because this is exactly what they thought was going to happen.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 The magic coconut would show up and curse them.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 This coconut, though, was pretty interesting, because it had written on it, "choronic verses."

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And what the coconut was saying was, "Don't you dare cast magical spells here."

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 So it was basically like a preemptive strike against any wizard that would try throwing coconuts there.

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 This place has been warded. This place is protected by Allah.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Not only was Allah protecting the place, it was also being protected by the National Election Commission.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 They actually had to come out and guarantee the school. If anyone got sick, they would be responsible for it.

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 National Election Commission goes, "This was one of their quotes. They would be responsible if, quote,

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 "If anyone falls under a spell or comes down ill." Unquote.

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Now, you're sure they were probably like, "Oh, great. Those yokels out there still believe in magic."

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And at the same time, they probably think, "Oh, no one-- I hope I'm right."

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 The article ends with this statement, quote, "A magician summoned by police established that the coconut was innocent."

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Local officials have said no arrests have been made, unquote.

62
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So basically, yes, it was an innocent coconut. It was unjustly arrested.

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 The police had to release it later that day. They buried it under some sand on a desert island.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And they're like, "Live free, coconut. Live free."

65
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And the coconut sprung up a great mighty tree, and then there was other coconuts hanging off of it.

66
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And then one of the coconuts turns around and has yellow eyes. It's all super spooky.

67
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 There. That's the end of that story. I think it's an interesting story, but I really don't have any other way to end it,

68
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 other than to a sending spooky yellow eyes on a coconut in the middle of a desert island.

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Malam, Arcana, let's go ahead and fire up that carbonicopter.

70
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 We are going to head on out to Russia.

71
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 [Russian accent]

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 We're flying over the ocean. We're cutting lines over the big blue beast.

73
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 That's what they call the ocean, right? That's what at least one person calls the ocean.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 [Russian accent]

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 We're headed out to Russia.

76
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 This was a request in a kind of roundabout way by a YouTube user known as Igor Lukyan.

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 He requested me to look up a couple of Soviet conspiracy theories, and he gave me some.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 We'll actually be covering a couple of them, but this one was an interesting one.

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 It took me down a bizarre rabbit hole.

80
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 So Malam, Arcana, and we're flying in that carbonicopter. We're headed out to Russia.

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 We're specifically headed out to a lonely radio transmitter in the middle of nowhere.

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 There's a lot of myth surrounding this station. Some people say it started in 1973.

83
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Some people say it started in 1982.

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 But one thing's for certain, it's an odd thing.

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It's known as a number station, and let me go over some brief terms here real quick.

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Number stations are radio stations that are basically constantly playing a series of tones.

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Sometimes someone will be reading, I mean, it's like 24 hours of a tone or a sound or an echo or whatever.

88
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 You guys know how sound works? Something.

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And then every show opt-in, it'll either be broken up by someone reading numbers.

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Sometimes it'll be broken up by words being said in multiple languages.

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Sometimes it'll be broken up by just sounds different than the tone.

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And what these are generally used for is they're used for military communications or spy communications.

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Let's say you're a CIA operative in Istanbul.

94
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 You know that if you tune to the number station on this date at this time, that message, whatever it is,

95
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 pertains exactly to page seven of your book.

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 So on that date, at that time, you turn to page seven at that book, you look at that code, you match it to that book.

97
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It tells you that the target is moving. You destroy that page of your book.

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 You can go find that target.

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 It's spycraft at its best.

100
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 The radio station will be tracked where it's coming from.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Obviously, if it's a radio station in Russia, it's giving out signals for Russian agents or Russian military.

102
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 You can track where an email comes from, but you can't track where it goes.

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 When you send an email or a text message or something like that, you can follow it to the destination.

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 But a radio station is playing 24 hours a day.

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 You don't know who's listening to it, who that is intended for.

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And of course, this was crafted, this spycraft was created long before the internet was invented,

107
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 before it was even thought about. This is old tech.

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 In Russia, they have this thing called the buzzer.

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 It's changed its broadcast name or it's changed its code.

110
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Sometimes it's known as UVB-76. Sometimes it's ZHUOZ.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 But it's generally known among number stations of fishionados as the buzzer.

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Some people have come forward and say, "We don't know what it is. We have no idea what it is. It could be all sorts of different things."

113
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 There are people who are ex-Russian military. They go, "Oh, no, we're totally familiar with that."

114
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 That actually gives us commands about training drills.

115
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And when the real thing happens, i.e. nuclear war, it will let us know where to go.

116
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 They said sometimes we would be sitting there and it would give this signal and our commanding officer would come in and be like,

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 "Okay, everyone, put on your ABC suits, which is atomic biological chemical suits."

118
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 You put on the suit and you'd get ready to go and then they're like, "It's just a drill."

119
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 You have Russian military coming forward and saying, "We're totally familiar with that."

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 It's a normal thing.

121
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Other people have said, Western intelligence agencies said, "They think it's part of the Dead Hand program."

122
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 This is what Igor recommended me looking at. It's a quite terrifying thing called Dead Hand.

123
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 So, this makes...when I start saying it, it's going to sound really scary, but it makes sense.

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 What happens is, if a nuclear exchange was to take place between Russia and America, or previously Soviet Union,

125
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 this was invented during Soviet Union, Soviet Union and America,

126
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 America always stated they had a "Don't shoot first" policy that was on the record, "We will not shoot first."

127
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 But, but when you look at a lot of our, where our missiles were aimed at, they were aimed at Soviet Union missile silos.

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 So, people go, "Well, obviously they're going to shoot first, because why would you shoot at places where there were no missiles?"

129
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 If they were the noble opponents that they stated they were, and they would never shoot first,

130
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 then they saw that remastered edition of Star Wars and they go, "Ugh!"

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Soviet Union came up with a plan. It's actually, it makes sense.

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 They said, "We're going to build an automated firing system."

133
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 So, if there's nobody left to push the button in Moscow,

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 we can still get our missiles launched, we can still do a retaliatory strike.

135
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Now, before, when they were looking at this map, they figured,

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 "We have 30 minutes from the time that a missile is launched from America,"

137
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Ford starts hitting targets in the Warsaw Block Eastern Europe.

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 "We have 30 minutes."

139
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Once America got their sub game to a perfect point, they could accurately shoot nuclear missiles out of nuclear subs.

140
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 The Russians were like, "Dude, we have three minutes to respond."

141
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 If one of these subs is in the Baltic Sea, we have three minutes to make a decision do we launch.

142
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So, that's why they invented Deadman. It's also known as perimeter.

143
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 If Soviet leadership is decapitated, the missiles can still be fired,

144
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 and you're thinking, "That's awful. Like, you've lost the war. You obviously got taken out."

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 "We didn't shoot first! We didn't shoot first! It's just a couple missiles just haven't hit you. What?"

146
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 "We're still, we didn't mean to."

147
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And now you just want petty revenge? That's messed up. It actually was the opposite.

148
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 It gave commanders time to think.

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Because this is the way the Soviet Union put this forward. They go,

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 "If you had three minutes to make a decision, you are going to default to firing."

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 But if you knew, if you knew for a fact, listen, I think a missile's coming at me.

152
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I'm not 100% sure. Could be a glitch.

153
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 If I'm wrong, and that's a real missile, then we still get to attack America.

154
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But if I'm right that it's a glitch, then it's just a glitch.

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So, they built this system as basically a saying,

156
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 "It's okay to wait four minutes instead of two."

157
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 So, that makes sense. And the way that this works, it's fascinating stuff.

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 So, again, Igor, thank you for letting me spend the afternoon reading about this.

159
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 There's missiles in the Soviet Union that have radio transmitters on them.

160
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And in a state of peace, dead man is shut off.

161
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 But if things start to heighten, high-ranking general goes over there, flicks a switch,

162
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 doot, doot, doot, and dead hand begins to take seismic readings,

163
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 it begins to check the air for radiation fallout,

164
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 and it constantly is sending a signal back and forth to the Kremlin.

165
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And if it sends the signal out to the Kremlin,

166
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 and it doesn't get a response back in an amount of time, say 20 minutes,

167
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 let's say it sends a signal out and picks up that something's there,

168
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 sends a signal out, picks up something there,

169
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 sends the signal out, it's not getting a response in 20 minutes past.

170
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 These missiles launch with these radio transmitters on them.

171
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 These radio transmitters are then able to go up and begin broadcasting a signal,

172
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 launching other missiles with radio transmitters.

173
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 So now you've basically created, because all radio communication would be destroyed at that time.

174
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 But you're now sending radio signals across the Soviet Union.

175
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 At that point, one of two things happens.

176
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Soviet Union says what it does is that it then gives the launch authorization to basically the janitor at the base.

177
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Like, you could be like a low level dude sitting there,

178
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 and then when you get that communication, it's saying Moscow's gone, launch.

179
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So it basically opens it up to any one, maybe not the janitor's base,

180
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 but basically a low ranking official can launch a nuke.

181
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 The other thing that has been said is that when dead hand is fired,

182
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 and those radio antenna missiles go up, all missiles launch.

183
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 There is no human interaction.

184
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 At that point, it's nuclear war.

185
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 They're not going to wait for a guy to be like, "He's cleaning the toilet in Warsaw."

186
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And he's like, "Oh wait, I'm supposed to go check the dead man switch."

187
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Missiles are launching.

188
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 That's the other theory.

189
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 They've said if the system's down, they're not even giving it to normal people.

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 It's an automated system.

191
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Once those radio missiles go up, they send a signal.

192
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Every last piece of nuclear technology is being launched out of the Soviet Union towards its targets.

193
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 They say that dead man is not on all the time.

194
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 It's only turned on in times of emergency.

195
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Again, it's not something you'd want to have on all the time,

196
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 because it would be a catastrophic accident if it went down.

197
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 America says that they have one too, but they shut it off quite a long time ago.

198
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 They don't use it.

199
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Their Wikipedia article was quite short, honestly, compared to the Soviet Union one.

200
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I'm sure we have one.

201
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I'm sure it's incredibly similar to that.

202
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And I'm sure both of them at any time, I think George H.W. Bush was the one who ordered just shut it down,

203
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 because things have been calming down, but I'm sure both of those switches could be reactivated in very short order.

204
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 So what does this have to do with the iceberg conspiracy theory?

205
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Number stations post-Trump.

206
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 But as I was researching this story, because I was originally looking into Dead Hand,

207
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 and because that was Igor's suggestion, I was looking at Dead Man, I started looking into these number stations,

208
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I was reminded of a topic on the conspiracy theory iceberg,

209
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 and it was listed as Number Stations Post-Trump.

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And it was one of those ones that I kind of looked at, and it's so vague.

211
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 I knew what Number Stations were.

212
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I know obviously what post-Trump is, anytime after Trump.

213
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And I thought, well, the conspiracy theory I can think of right off the top of my head is that

214
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 the number stations are being used, utilized in some way differently now than they were before Trump's election.

215
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Shadow governments, deep state agents are using the number stations to talk to each other.

216
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 That's the way they're spreading their message around.

217
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 The deep state or the shadow government.

218
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 The shadow government was the old version, that was the version I knew of the deep state.

219
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Back in the 80s, deep state was referred to as shadow government.

220
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 But now it's deep state, it's quicker, you know, it's punchier, and then shadow government, it just takes longer to say.

221
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 But anyway, so it's basically the same thing though.

222
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 So you have, with the conspiracy theory that Trump is fighting deep state,

223
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 people within the government trying to take Trump down using the mechanisms of the government,

224
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 then that conspiracy theory falls into that, right?

225
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 That they are, that those people are using this cold war technology that was never turned off, these number stations,

226
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 to communicate messages to each other.

227
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Instead of giving operatives information about operations they're running,

228
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 visa v. foreign countries or domestic terrorists or whatever,

229
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 they're talking, they're using the number stations to coordinate actions against Trump.

230
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 But I don't think that's what number stations post-Trump actually means.

231
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 I think that's one thing it can mean, obviously, right?

232
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 But that's not the dead rabbit radio way.

233
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 I want to always dig a little bit deeper.

234
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I want to see if I can find another way to make this conspiracy theory work.

235
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 This is super bizarre.

236
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And bordering on, bordering on psycho.

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 September 2016, before Trump was elected president,

238
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 a man in New Jersey picked up a radio station.

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 It's actually what's called extended AM.

240
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 You have to have a special radio to pick up extended AM.

241
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 On 16.30 AM, picks up a message on the emergency channel that's meant for the Chester Township in New Jersey.

242
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 It says, "Trump will go 26th."

243
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 There was a YouTube video of the recording.

244
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 It's gone. Been made private.

245
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And on the article that I read, which will be in the show notes, it said,

246
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 "Click more info down here."

247
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Nothing. There's nothing there.

248
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Fluke? Why was Chester Township broadcasting this message?

249
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Who knows? Fluke, intercepted message, could be all sorts of weird stuff.

250
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 What does post-Trump actually mean?

251
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I think the context I was going with, and a lot of you guys probably were going with,

252
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 was post-him becoming president.

253
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But Trump was a national figure long before that.

254
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Long, long before that.

255
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Because Trump, you have to go back to, before he became a national figure.

256
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 You go back to before he was born, but that's a little too far back.

257
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Malamarkana, let's go ahead and fire up the carbon or copper one more time.

258
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 We're headed out to New York City, crime capital of the world,

259
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 because now we're in the year 1973, where New York City was just 24 hours of taxi driver and main streets.

260
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 We're flying around those beautiful buildings downtown New York City.

261
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 1973 was the very first time Donald Trump appeared on the front page of the New York Times.

262
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Now, he was well known in the city, but for the first time he was on a national stage.

263
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Donald Trump in 1973 was involved in a court battle with the federal government.

264
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 1973 is the same year the buzzer went into operation.

265
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 What's interesting is that the BBC says that the buzzer started in 1982,

266
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and the reason why you have different dates for this is because they would change the signal.

267
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Some people go, "No, it's from 1973 that same thing was broadcasting that tower."

268
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 BBC dates it a little bit later, because sometimes they would change like the call signs of it.

269
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 So BBC states that the buzzer, as we know it today, was started in 1982.

270
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 The signal changed enough that we're going to say the buzzer started in 1982.

271
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 1982 was the very first year Forbes magazine printed the 400 richest Americans.

272
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 They had never done that before.

273
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Forbes magazine publishes that issue. Donald Trump, number 286, again propelled into national acclaim

274
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 as being one of the richest men in America.

275
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 So, Jason, right?

276
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 You can go and you can find Freddie Wedge any day and compare it against something else.

277
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And you're right, that's what I was saying. It was kind of psycho.

278
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 In 1973, a bunch of stuff happened in 1973, bro, right? A bunch of stuff happened in 1973.

279
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Now, the signal will change. The buzzer will change from time to time.

280
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And lately, there's been some weird things about it.

281
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 You had like a boat picking up an odd signal that seemed to be layered on top of it.

282
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 But for the most part, the buzzer is always there, and then you have like the words being said by the Russian lady and things like that.

283
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 On August 16th, 2020, so earlier this month, the weirdest thing that's ever happened with the buzzer happened.

284
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You had the tone, and then it would pause, and music would start playing.

285
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And then it would make the tone again. It would pause, and music would start playing.

286
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 So that means that the music is actually part of the broadcast.

287
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 But then, later that same day, you would have the buzz, and on top of that frequency, it would not interrupt the buzz.

288
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 On top of that frequency was something else.

289
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 It was a different transmission, but it was no accident.

290
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 People really, really dig into these number stations, and people were listening to it, and they took that audio, that very, very bizarre audio that was coming out on August 16th, 2020.

291
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 They ran it through a spectrograph, which is a way to hide images inside of audio.

292
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I think Radiohead's done it. I think, I'm not sure they have.

293
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 They ran it through a spectrograph, because it just, they didn't make sense. The audio didn't make any sense. They ran it through a spectrograph.

294
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 They saw Latin and Krillik lettering, and phrases appear in front of the screen on them.

295
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 The sound actually had pictures in it.

296
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 But then it also had pictures of Pokemon, of animals, of SpongeBob SquarePants characters.

297
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And on top of a military transmission that might possibly also be part of Dead Hand, someone had layered images on top of it.

298
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 And then the images stop, but the buzz continues unabated.

299
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 August 16th, 2020, Donald Trump's brother, Robert Trump, died.

300
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Where am I going with this?

301
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second. Let's wrap it up like this.

302
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 This is my conspiracy theory.

303
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 We go back to Donald Trump being a time traveler.

304
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 If you haven't heard that episode, the theory was that Donald Trump went into the future on a time machine, saw all this great stuff, got all this information, came back in time, made millions of dollars, but, see, 9/11 happened.

305
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 That didn't happen in the original timeline.

306
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 So he's like, "Uh-oh. It's not all about me. I got to do stuff to change things."

307
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 So the future, everyone looks like Mike Pence.

308
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 It's an actual conspiracy theory. You should listen to what episode on it. I really like that conspiracy theory.

309
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Everyone looks like Mike Pence.

310
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And Hillary Clinton's vice presidential candidate, what was his name? Tim? I don't remember his name.

311
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Anyways, it doesn't matter. His wife was a Mike Pence. That's what matters. His wife was a clone of Mike Pence from the future.

312
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 So, Tim Hayes? I don't remember. But anyways, what was his name? It doesn't matter.

313
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 That's that in a conspiracy theory in a nutshell. So this is this conspiracy theory.

314
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Donald Trump did go into the future that will believe all that stuff because it's funny. Because it's a funny conspiracy theory.

315
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Then this one. The number stations are actually set up for one of two reasons.

316
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 One, it's because another time traveler followed Trump back.

317
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 He didn't know who he was looking for. He knew someone came into the future. He knew someone gained knowledge.

318
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 But when he was reading the newspaper that 1973 New York Times and saw that photo, he needed to send a message to the future and let him know what was going on.

319
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 So he uses a number station. Why a number station? This is actually quite brilliant. I can't believe I came up with this myself.

320
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I honestly didn't. Quite impressed by myself.

321
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 If you wanted to send a message to the future, you would write it somewhere that would still exist in the future.

322
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 So you could write it on a cave. You know the future. You know that cave was discovered in the year 2050.

323
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 So that message you write in that cave will be to your handlers who are after the year 2050.

324
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And they would know that that cave would be discovered because you'd be like, hey, I'm going to go back in time.

325
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 You know that cave that's going to get discovered in 2050 in Milwaukee? In the middle of Milwaukee? That giant cave?

326
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I'm going to write a message in there and the handlers are like, okay. And then they turn around and they open up their history books and there's your message.

327
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 People love these number station stuff. There's huge blogs and websites and everything.

328
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 There's a photo book dedicated to these things, of radio stations. So people are cataloging all this stuff.

329
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I'm broadcasting stuff on this super obscure spooky radio station.

330
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Thousands of people around the world are taking notes of everything that's said, when it's said, how it's said.

331
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And my handlers in the future, they just have to go to your blog that you had in the year 2020.

332
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 That's a list of every transmission and they just read through it and they go, oh, this is what Trump's doing.

333
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Trump just got on the Forbes list. I guess we could have looked at Forbes. I guess we could have just looked at that magazine.

334
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 But we know what Trump's up to because these stations are being broadcast. They're being catalogued and that information exists in the future.

335
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 They would read it almost instantaneously. They would know everything instantaneously.

336
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 So you had some, that's brilliant, right? I'm afraid a bunch of time travelers are going to kidnap me and not let this episode get put out

337
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 because that has to be the way you would communicate with the future. It'd be the most energy efficient way of communicating with the future.

338
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Instead of pulling out a little radio like Quantum Leap, you just leave notes everywhere and they would know where to look for the notes.

339
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Time travelers, eeewww.

340
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Or you have that. You have the guy come back and he's trying to stop Trump because they don't want the future to be changed.

341
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 He's a disruptive force. Or the number stations are part of Trump's plan. See, Trump goes into the future, learned all this stuff, came back, used it for personal gain,

342
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 then 9/11 happens and he's like, "Oh, great." But he's obviously still able to get pincers, multiple Mike Pincers from the future.

343
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 So the way that they communicate with the future is by using these number stations. It's the same theory, but now he's actually talking to people in the future being like,

344
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 and the futures allied with him. They don't want him to fail.

345
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 That would also make sense why that number station started in 1973. That's when he first gets on the national stage and the first message would have been along the lines of,

346
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 "Hey guys, I got the ball rolling. Not in the best light with this news article here, but I'm on the national stage. People know who I am."

347
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Number stations post Trump. It's interesting. It's four little words on the conspiracy theory iceberg. I scrolled over it multiple times.

348
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 It was basically two things I knew about. I knew about number stations and I know what "post-Trump" means.

349
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 But combined, I think it leads to an interesting conspiracy theory. It is how we would communicate with the future.

350
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 So the next time you come across a mysterious broadcast, whether you are intentionally looking for them via a number station,

351
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 or just sitting there and your radio begins to play an odd tune, or begins to utter a phrase that you don't really understand,

352
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 think a little less about where the transmission is coming from and think about when the transmission is coming from.

353
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Because even though these signals can be picked up by anyone, some of these signals are made for a small group of people, or maybe even just one person.

354
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 So for a spy who's trying to hunt down a terror cell, or to a colonel sitting in a nuclear silo, or to a member of the time council a thousand years from now,

355
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 these aren't just random phrases and noises. These are incredibly important messages.

356
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And these people, they can never relax. They can just listen to that signal and hope that it never changes.

357
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Because if it does, it's not just a random collection of words and noises. It is the signal that may herald the end of the world.
