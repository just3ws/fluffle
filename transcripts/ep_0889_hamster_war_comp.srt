1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
 Scientists, in their never-ending quest to turn horror movies into real life, have created

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,680
 a race of bloodthirsty hamsters.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,960
 And then we travel to Ukraine to take a look at an alien abduction story that seems to

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,960
 redefine what we know of the reptilian alien species.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,560
 Are they truly a bloodthirsty enemy of humanity?

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,080
 Or have they brought to Earth one of our most beautiful treasures?

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,840
 [music]

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,440
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun and doing whatever you're doing.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,320
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,520
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command, flying their own personalized UFO.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,520
 I would give it up for today's newest Patreon supporter, Emmy.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
 Wooo!

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
 Yeah!

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
 Come on, fly that UFO and land it.

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,320
 Land it over there so I can take it apart.

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,640
 And reverse engineer it for my own purposes.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,520
 The reason why Emmy has their own UFO as Emmy is actually the author and artist of their

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,720
 own webcomic called "Trying Human."

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,840
 It's a really cool comic.

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,800
 I'm about two issues in, and I'll put the link in the show notes so you guys can check

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
 it out yourselves.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,680
 I don't really know what it's about.

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,320
 I'm two issues in.

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,400
 It's either a girl falling in love with an alien, an alien falling in love with a girl.

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
 Maybe the girl's an alien?

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
 I don't know.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,280
 Like I said, I'm only two issues in.

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,600
 The mystery is still unfolding, but I'm having a lot of fun reading it.

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,720
 Emmy, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,800
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,520
 Just helps read the word about this show that really, really helps out a lot.

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,200
 Now Emmy, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dirgeable.

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,080
 We're gonna leave behind dead rabbit command.

39
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,600
 We're gonna fly all the way out to Northwestern University.

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,400
 Evanston, Illinois is where we're headed.

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,680
 This is the site of Northwestern University.

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,040
 They've currently made the news.

43
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,160
 They're making the news rounds right now because of some bizarre experiments they've been doing

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
 on hamsters.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,080
 Now, long time listeners at Dead Rabbit Radio know that I am a hamster aficionado.

46
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
 Not in the way that Richard Gere was.

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
 Not like that sicko.

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,080
 That was actually an urban legend.

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
 That never happened.

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,680
 But I used to have a pet hamster.

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,240
 My very first pet was a little hamster named Stitchface.

52
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,440
 He was awesome.

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
 He was so smart.

54
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,520
 One time he broke out of his cage and crawled into bed with me again.

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,320
 Not like Richard Gere, but he crawled all the way through house and underneath my door

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,360
 and got in bed with me.

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,000
 Once again, whenever I say that phrase, I have to add not like Richard Gere.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,680
 Little Stitchface you will live on in Dead Rabbit Radio history.

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
 Stitchface, I mean not Stitchface.

60
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,480
 These real hamsters, I hope Stitchface isn't part of this.

61
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,720
 So you guys always say, "Why are you talking about hamsters?"

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,520
 And he messes up with this college.

63
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,520
 Okay, Northwestern University's currently been in the news because they have turned

64
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,720
 the once adorable hamster into bloodthirsty maniacs.

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
 What have they done?

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
 This is so bizarre.

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,080
 And I have to wonder, what were you thinking of doing?

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,720
 They were taking hamsters, specifically Syrian hamsters, which have a very similar social

69
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
 structure to humans.

70
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,680
 And they said, "What if we could shut off a certain receptor?"

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,480
 It's called AVPR1A.

72
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,680
 And this receptor receives the hormone vasopressin.

73
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:47,160
 And what this receptor does, AVPR1A, is it regulates teamwork and friendship in a social

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,480
 group.

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,920
 And they're thinking, "Well, we believe that this little receptor is almost like a limiter

76
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,280
 to how friendly something can be.

77
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,920
 Animals don't want to be too friendly, otherwise they'll just get gobbled up.

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,360
 No more Richard Gere will catch them more easily."

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,040
 So what if we shut that off?

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,200
 What if we shut off the regulator?

81
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,960
 They would have a limitless friendliness.

82
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,040
 It would be like the Smurfs.

83
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,400
 There's kind of chillin' everywhere.

84
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,080
 Now they've done this.

85
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,600
 You have to do it in the embryo.

86
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,280
 You can't take a regular hamster and stick a needle in his brain and go, "You're cured."

87
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,520
 They have to do this in the embryo using CRISPR technology.

88
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,240
 But they said, "This thing acts as a limiter to how friendly a creature will be.

89
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,840
 If we shut it off, they'll be super friendly."

90
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,340
 And then they won't be angry.

91
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
 They'll never be angry.

92
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,400
 They'll have very, very low aggression, which would suck if you were in the wild, 'cause

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
 you gotta fight over barley.

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,320
 Two hamsters seeing the same pile of garbage that they're eating at.

95
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 Templeton's there.

96
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,000
 He's like, "No, these apple cores are mine.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Go away."

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,120
 They have to be able to fight off.

99
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,780
 Templeton, they have to be able to fight off a fictional character for these rotten

100
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,620
 banana peels.

101
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
 Let's shut it off.

102
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,620
 Let's shut it off in the laboratory.

103
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,620
 Let's see what happens.

104
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,620
 They had previously done this.

105
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,760
 I don't know if Northwestern University did this, but scientists had previously shut

106
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,720
 it off in mice.

107
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,080
 They were able to go in and completely remove the hormone vasopressin from mice, and the

108
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,320
 mice are just chilling.

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,480
 It seemed to work.

110
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,600
 They go, "Whoa, mice are more friendly.

111
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
 Look at it.

112
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,400
 I can have them all so I can have them sew my clothes and dance while I dream about marrying

113
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
 a prince."

114
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,280
 But they go, "Mice, even though their brains are similar to humans, they don't have the

115
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,660
 same social structure.

116
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,260
 Since this is such a profound effect on how they interact with others of their kind, let's

117
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,260
 see what happens if we take a creature that has a similar social structure to humans,"

118
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,100
 which I didn't know this, is a Sarian hamster.

119
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,500
 Now, maybe I thought we had more in common with monkeys.

120
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,180
 I thought monkeys are like our social structures were the same, but that could be true.

121
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,860
 We're very, very lucky.

122
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,340
 They didn't try this on monkeys.

123
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,320
 They're like, "Let's bring in the gorillas and see what happens if we shut off part of

124
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,480
 their brain."

125
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,520
 Because when they did this in Sarian hamsters, it did not turn out like the mice.

126
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,880
 There were no clothes to be sewn.

127
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,400
 No songs were sung this day.

128
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:22,440
 When you took a hamster embryo and basically took out or shut off the receptor AVPR1A, they

129
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,360
 look like normal little hamsters, right?

130
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,240
 Little hamster is born from its mommy, and the mom's like, "Okay, I'm gonna eat you three

131
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,860
 and you four get to live," and these little hamsters just kind of going about their day.

132
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,860
 But what the scientists realized was that when you shut off, I mean, what a shock this

133
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,060
 was, when you shut off part of an animal's brain that regulates friendliness, it messes

134
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,060
 them up.

135
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,820
 Now, it didn't turn them ultra-friendly.

136
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,580
 It didn't make them calm or anything.

137
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,140
 It was the exact opposite.

138
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,700
 It made them extremely violent.

139
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,440
 The way that this war, and the scientists were shocked by what happened, this was not

140
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,500
 in any of their hypotheses.

141
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,720
 If you took a hamster that had this receptor shut off, it became violent towards other

142
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,360
 hamsters.

143
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,800
 It didn't matter if the other hamster also had the receptor shut off or not, because

144
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,840
 they had hamsters that they just caught in the wild.

145
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,560
 They're like flying helicopters over Syria, the great hamster herds, and they're like

146
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,080
 throwing ropes down and rounded them up.

147
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,540
 And then it seemed that they had some that were also born in laboratories.

148
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,660
 So they had wild hamsters, hamsters born in laboratories, and then these freaks of nature

149
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,300
 that they were toying with.

150
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,520
 If the receptor was shut off, these hamsters would attack another hamster.

151
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
 They would bite them.

152
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,540
 I mean, I gotta admit, it would be the most adorable attack ever.

153
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,540
 They're like biting, rolling around on the ground.

154
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,780
 Not so adorable if you're the other hamster, because it's furry and cute to us, but to

155
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,840
 them it's like, oh no, it's my equal in strength.

156
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:06,440
 The mutant hamster, we'll call them, the mutant hamster would violently attack any other hamster

157
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,600
 if they were the same sex.

158
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,800
 So the male hamsters were not attacking the female hamster.

159
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,760
 Whether or not the female hamster had the receptor shut off or was one of the wild hamsters

160
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,920
 or the lab-born hamsters, there's no violence to be had.

161
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,680
 But if you took a male hamster and then a male mutant hamster or two male mutant hamsters

162
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,120
 or whatever, as long as there was one of these freaks in the cage, it was on.

163
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,060
 You know, the scientists started betting at a certain point, there's like a little hamster

164
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,080
 with like a spiked collar on and they're like, will these two mutant hamsters try to attack

165
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
 the spiked collar hamster?

166
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,760
 And then there's just like a free-for-all and people are like throwing money on the

167
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
 ground.

168
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,320
 The elite scientist has just one eye.

169
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,280
 He has these little hamster claws across his face, then he has his patch made out of a

170
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
 pin protector.

171
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,740
 And he's like, guys, guys, keep betting.

172
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,520
 Let's make science finally pay off.

173
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,000
 So yeah, it's super weird.

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,960
 And they realize that the female hamsters were the most aggressive out of all of them.

175
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,320
 The male hamsters apparently, the mutant male hamsters, when you put them in a cage, they

176
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,080
 would kind of like suss stuff out.

177
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,440
 They'd be like, hmm, am I going to attack them now?

178
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,560
 Or will I wait till he's asleep?

179
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,040
 The female hamsters, the second you put them in the cage, it was on.

180
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,400
 But they would only attack other females.

181
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
 It's a fascinating story.

182
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,440
 At this point, they're like, this isn't what we expected.

183
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,340
 I'm sure they're going to keep steady in it because they want to know why this happened.

184
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,140
 But my question is, why were they working on this in the first place?

185
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:39,140
 I imagine the end result was to be to try to prevent humans from getting angry, which

186
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,340
 here's the thing.

187
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,420
 If you could invent a pill or an injection, say there's someone who's always prone to

188
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
 anger.

189
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,460
 They're like, we really like your work ethic here, Dr. Banner.

190
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,680
 But every so often, you just hulk out and destroy the lab.

191
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
 We're going to give you this pill.

192
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,960
 We're going to give you this pill that's actually going to suppress vasopressin in

193
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
 your system.

194
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:04,360
 I can understand an adult who's a rageaholic, constantly wanting to control his anger, but

195
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,640
 this is something you have to do at the genetic level.

196
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,240
 Could you imagine being born a baby and never being able to get angry?

197
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,640
 Like that, because that was their end result.

198
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,600
 They were hoping to reduce aggression in these creatures and make them more sociable.

199
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,340
 It made them more violent and less sociable because no one wants to be around a psychopathic

200
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,500
 hamster.

201
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,060
 But could you imagine being a baby?

202
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,460
 Your human soul is in a body inside a baby that can't get angry.

203
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,540
 It just isn't possible to get angry or upset.

204
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,380
 That sounds torturous.

205
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,380
 That sounds awful.

206
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,780
 I know there might be like, if you have a brain injury or something like that, that

207
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,580
 you can't get angry.

208
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,900
 But if they were going into human babies and reducing their anger, making it so they can

209
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,140
 never get angry.

210
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,600
 That's creepy.

211
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
 You're actually removing part of what being a human is.

212
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,160
 Part of the human experience is not getting what you want and being upset and angry and

213
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
 things like that.

214
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,800
 It's also interesting because they knew or they thought it was going to reduce anger.

215
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,960
 They also believed that it was going to reduce social communication.

216
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,920
 And they were totally fine with that.

217
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,000
 So apparently their hypothesis was it would make the Syrian hamsters more friendly, but

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,900
 it would make them less talkative to each other.

219
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,900
 That's creepy too.

220
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,820
 Imagine if you could go in and not only change a baby at the genetic code to not be angry,

221
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,900
 but also just to kind of keep to themselves.

222
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,780
 But that would be horrible.

223
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,780
 That would be horrible.

224
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,940
 It's almost like you're trying to build some sort of living robot.

225
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,940
 Which is a big conspiracy theory, right?

226
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,980
 That the ruling class wants to turn the herds of humanity, the unwashed masses into just

227
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
 these bioslaves.

228
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,320
 Which I guess is just a normal slave budget like these biowobots.

229
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,520
 These mindless drones working for them.

230
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,760
 So I don't know what these freaks at Northwestern University were up to.

231
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,920
 Maybe they were trying to create the perfect slave.

232
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,100
 And what's scary about this is this got released and not to the wild.

233
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,380
 The hamsters are not currently roaming through your neighborhood.

234
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,960
 But the medical documents, the research documents have all been published about this.

235
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,580
 And I'm sure there are other governments, maybe even the United States government, who

236
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,980
 read this and said, "Let's just start doing this to humans."

237
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,980
 Because apparently the world governments are secretly run by Cobra.

238
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,580
 I'm sure there is a government or a unscrupulous scientific laboratory who's like, "We can

239
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,360
 build the perfect weapon.

240
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,660
 We can take a baby.

241
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,540
 The whole perfect weapons begin with a baby.

242
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,740
 We can genetically engineer a baby, take out this receptor, and he'll be super mad all

243
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,120
 the time because who doesn't want an angry baby?"

244
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,120
 This is one of those things that I think is a good idea until I actually start saying

245
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
 it.

246
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,200
 Because then you would have an angry baby who would attack everybody, but you still have

247
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,160
 to raise it for 18 years before you could release it into the world as a super soldier.

248
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
 So you would have to be constantly afraid to check its temperature.

249
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,040
 You're like, "Oh no, he has diarrhea again.

250
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,240
 I don't want to change his diaper.

251
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,800
 He's flinging it at you."

252
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,840
 And then he's just constantly, every day, getting angry or angry, and he has no communication

253
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
 skills.

254
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,940
 He's constantly beating up the crib.

255
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,140
 Every time you give him a stuffed animal, he's ripping the head off and eating the

256
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,140
 stuffing.

257
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,540
 At that point, the baby's just dead.

258
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,260
 You're like, "Oh well, he's eating stuffing.

259
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,340
 He's probably going to choke."

260
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,340
 But imagine he doesn't.

261
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,060
 Imagine that you have this baby and he's super angry and you raise him.

262
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,180
 He's boxing at the age of three.

263
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,180
 By five, he's doing Mu Tai stuff.

264
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,540
 He keeps sneaking you in the face.

265
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,940
 You're like, "Oh, it's kind of adorable."

266
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,340
 He still has those soft baby knees.

267
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,440
 And then by age 16, he's like a master at martial arts, of all the martial arts that

268
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,240
 the scientists at Northwestern University know.

269
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
 There's like two of them.

270
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
 And they're not martial arts.

271
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,040
 It's like badminton and rowing.

272
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,440
 You train this kid and he's so angry and he has no communication skills.

273
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,840
 I think I just described a bunch of people that aren't genetically modified that are

274
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,680
 just living among us.

275
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:09,040
 Is someone currently taking Syrian hamster-level technology and going to use it on humans?

276
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,740
 I hope we never have to find out.

277
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,340
 But again, I don't think we'll make a bunch of different.

278
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,940
 I already think there's a lot of violent people out there who unfortunately have a hard time

279
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,540
 connecting with others.

280
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,540
 So maybe you don't need CRISPR technology or Syrian hamsters to do that.

281
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,340
 Maybe you just need modern society.

282
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,060
 Emmy, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbon helicopter.

283
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,100
 We're leaving behind Northwestern University.

284
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,500
 I hope no one has hamsters in their pockets.

285
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
 Turn around.

286
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,740
 Turn around, Richard Gere is slowly pulling out of much hamsters out of his pocket.

287
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,320
 I feel really bad.

288
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,760
 That's such a go-to joke.

289
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,640
 But he didn't do that.

290
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,440
 I think I read something that Emmy, go ahead and warm up the carbon helicopter while I

291
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
 go up on this thing.

292
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,940
 I'll see if I can find it for the show notes.

293
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:59,000
 From what I understand, Sylvester Stallone and Richard Gere hated each other's guts

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,640
 because they did a movie together or they were working on something together.

295
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,860
 I don't know if it was ever finished.

296
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,680
 And from what I understand, Sylvester Stallone went around Hollywood and told people that

297
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,540
 if you haven't heard this, you're like, "What is he making these Richard Gere jokes?"

298
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,220
 I'm sure everyone's heard of this.

299
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,180
 Back when I was a kid, there was an old urban legend that Richard Gere stuck a hamster up

300
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,460
 his butt because this was a thing where you put a hamster up your butt.

301
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
 Go ahead.

302
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,100
 If your kids are still in the room, go ahead and usher them out.

303
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,700
 You stick a hamster up your butt and you're like wrapping in a condom.

304
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,020
 You stick a hamster up your butt and then as it's dying and trying to get out and it's

305
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,240
 death throws, it's pleasurable.

306
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,080
 Apparently, Sylvester Stallone, I don't know.

307
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
 But that was the urban...

308
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,360
 I remember hearing that like back in the 80s.

309
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,600
 Richard Gere put a hamster up his butt and he went to the doctor.

310
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,240
 The reason why we know about it, allegedly, was that he went to the hospital and the

311
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,360
 doctors had to remove it.

312
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,120
 And the story went that this isn't rare.

313
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,360
 There are people who put hamsters up their butts because it's very pleasurable.

314
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,200
 It's very pleasurable to have a clawed creature that's far bigger than the human rectum is

315
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,700
 designed for to be shoved out there.

316
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,420
 I've heard the story that Sylvester Stallone hated Richard Gere so much.

317
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,100
 He started that rumor and it never went away.

318
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,340
 I don't think Sylvester Stallone had any idea the impact that that urban legend would have.

319
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
 Or maybe he did.

320
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,820
 Maybe he hated Richard Gere that much.

321
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,380
 That urban legend's been going on for 30 years.

322
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,060
 That's brutal.

323
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,700
 That's a little bit of behind the scenes trivia that I vaguely remember.

324
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,420
 I'll see if I can find it in the show notes.

325
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,280
 That's what I had heard so far.

326
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,720
 And we go ahead and fire up that carbon helicopter.

327
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,200
 We are leaving behind Northwestern University.

328
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:49,080
 We are headed all the way out to the Ukraine.

329
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,560
 The year is 1995 and we're in Sudak.

330
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,080
 That's in the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine.

331
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,160
 It's 10 in the morning.

332
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,400
 And there's a young man.

333
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,840
 His name is Georgie.

334
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,180
 He's a local resident of the area and he walks out of his house.

335
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,420
 What a beautiful day.

336
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
 What a beautiful day.

337
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,700
 I'm sure nothing disturbing will happen today.

338
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,540
 Nothing that will shatter my view of the world.

339
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,460
 And he's walking around.

340
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,420
 He's drinking a beer on this beautiful morning.

341
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,180
 And his house is near the Black Sea.

342
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,900
 So he's kind of like walking down this embankment.

343
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,220
 He's just going to sit on the beach and drink this beer and think about how normal life has

344
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,380
 been up to this point.

345
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,320
 It's just a clear sunny day and he's looking out over the sea.

346
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:46,320
 And then someone sneaks up behind him and puts a mask over his face.

347
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
 And it all happens so rapidly.

348
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,040
 Like he doesn't hear the person coming up behind him.

349
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,840
 He just is standing there with his drink.

350
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,280
 And the next thing you know, he's wearing a rubber mask and he's struggling to take

351
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
 it off.

352
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,500
 He's really form fitting on his head.

353
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,580
 And he's struggling to take it off and he finally gets a good grip in underneath the

354
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,180
 chin and pulls the mask off.

355
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:17,460
 And he's standing in this massive hallway.

356
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,940
 Georgie looks from side to side and as far as the eye can see down this hallway, he just

357
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,860
 sees these massive screens.

358
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,160
 These huge monitors lining both sides of the hall.

359
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,360
 As far as he can tell he's alone in here.

360
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
 But where's here?

361
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:44,760
 He was just standing out on the beach underneath the sunny sky and now he's in this huge structure.

362
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,880
 Every so often underneath the monitors he sees control panels and chairs there.

363
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,360
 And then his attention is drawn to what's in his hand.

364
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
 His beer's gone.

365
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,340
 He's a little just one and that.

366
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:05,220
 But in his other hand is the mask that was pulled down over his face.

367
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,340
 Now when this initially happened he thought someone was pulling a prank.

368
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,940
 But you know normally on the Jackass crew they don't teleport you throughout space and

369
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,340
 time so he figured it probably wasn't a prank.

370
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,740
 He looks down at what he's holding.

371
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,020
 He's holding this mask.

372
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:26,680
 It is a rubber mask of a reptilian monster.

373
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,920
 He's looking at it and it clearly has the facial features of a reptilian.

374
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,480
 It's blue and it's covered in warts.

375
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,560
 But it's all rubbery.

376
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,040
 It's not like real warts.

377
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,840
 He's not afraid but he's looking at this mask covered in these rubber warts and he's

378
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
 looking at it and it's this reptilian face.

379
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,280
 He's like what in the world is going on?

380
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:55,540
 And then a door opens in the wall.

381
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:03,660
 And Georgie turns to look and out of this door steps three reptilians.

382
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,060
 He said that they looked exactly like the mask.

383
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,860
 Except not rubbery, not fake.

384
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:15,260
 These were real life blue reptilian humanoids walking out of this doorway.

385
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:24,200
 He described them as all blue, completely covered in warts, they were naked and he used the

386
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,760
 term awful.

387
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,140
 He thought they were disgusting looking.

388
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,840
 One of these guys walks over to him and he describes their hands.

389
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,220
 They have three fingers and each finger had a long claw.

390
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,140
 One of these reptilians walks over to Georgie and puts its hand on his shoulder and opens

391
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,260
 up a mouth full of sharp yellow teeth.

392
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,500
 And it says "Homo sapien."

393
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,260
 Georgie is in no mood for a biology lesson.

394
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,340
 He knows his species.

395
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
 He's out of there.

396
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,420
 He doesn't care what else this guy has to say.

397
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,180
 He breaks free from this creature's grasp.

398
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,180
 I didn't really grasp it.

399
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
 I just kind of put a gentle hand on his shoulder.

400
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,740
 But it wouldn't matter if it was just like giving you a little high five.

401
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
 Still disgusting.

402
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,580
 Georgie takes off running through this wherever he's at.

403
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,020
 Starship, structure, he has no idea.

404
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,620
 Is it an underground base?

405
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,740
 Is it on the edge of the solar system?

406
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,740
 Who knows.

407
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
 He's running.

408
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,740
 He's running as fast as he can.

409
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,220
 He sees a little corridor breaking off from the main hallway.

410
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,860
 He's running down that.

411
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,580
 He sees a doorway.

412
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,540
 He ducks into that.

413
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,700
 And he runs in a reptilian.

414
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
 Right?

415
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,260
 Which you kind of have to guess.

416
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,900
 No matter where he is running, this place is populated by these creatures.

417
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,660
 So he runs into this little room and he did say throughout his journey running through

418
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,020
 the structure, he just kept seeing monitors and control panels.

419
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,940
 He runs into this room and he runs into another one of these creatures.

420
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,740
 And the creature very plainly says, "Where are you running to?"

421
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,660
 I think Georgie realized that he didn't even know the answer to that question.

422
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,100
 He just kind of stands there.

423
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
 He's also probably out of breath.

424
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,740
 The alien presses a button on the wall and almost answers his own question.

425
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,740
 Right?

426
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,900
 So the reptilian says, "Where are you running to?"

427
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,860
 Because he's running through these corridors.

428
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,380
 He's running through these rooms.

429
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,500
 And to really show the futility of trying to escape, the reptilian hits the button on

430
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:32,100
 the wall and the wall's just completely turn transparent.

431
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
 Or they disappear.

432
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,460
 I wouldn't even say transparent because then you would just see the adjoining room.

433
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,180
 Georgie says he's standing in this room and all the walls vanished.

434
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:49,020
 And he saw in every direction simply endless space.

435
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,460
 The floor's gone, the ceiling's gone, the wall's gone.

436
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:57,860
 All he can see is he is standing in the middle of deep space.

437
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,060
 He said, "I saw the beauty of the universe."

438
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
 You see stars.

439
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,500
 You see twirling galaxies.

440
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,180
 You see little comet.

441
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,660
 So now he does know where he's at.

442
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
 He's in space.

443
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,660
 And there's no escape.

444
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,820
 There's no way he's getting off of the ship.

445
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:20,020
 I mean, you can run all you want, but unless you know how to fly an X-9 reptilian starfighter,

446
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,940
 you're boned.

447
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:28,620
 Another reptilian walks into the room and takes Georgie by the hand and tells him, "Do not

448
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,020
 be afraid."

449
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,700
 And then begins to lead Georgie out of that room into another room.

450
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,500
 In this room stood hundreds of reptilians.

451
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,540
 I believe all these guys are in a kid too.

452
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,860
 Hundreds of reptilians standing shoulder to shoulder in formation.

453
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,980
 And they're all staring at Georgie.

454
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:03,300
 It's funny because in reptilian lore, they are the most brutal, warlike, bloodthirsty

455
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,140
 alien species out there.

456
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,940
 Dead rabbit radio listeners know that the conformers are actually the most dangerous

457
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,300
 alien species out there.

458
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,220
 But in general UFO lore, it's the reptilians.

459
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,340
 The reptilians are kidnapping people.

460
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,220
 Reptilians are kidnapping people for food.

461
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,860
 Reptilians are kidnapping people for sex slaves.

462
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,540
 They're constantly going to war with the grays.

463
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,420
 They're trying to take over the planet.

464
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,220
 The Queen of England is a reptilian.

465
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:34,140
 So when you're standing there facing down hundreds of reptilians standing in military

466
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,700
 formation, there can't be any pleasant thoughts going through Georgie's head.

467
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,100
 Plus there's just a general unease between mammals and reptilians.

468
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,500
 I think that's why reptilians hold that place in UFO lore as being the most vicious, most

469
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:55,220
 warlike, is because our ancestral memory is to hate reptiles.

470
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,580
 They were eating us until a comet changed the game and then the mammals rose over the

471
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,580
 reptiles.

472
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
 Take that alligator.

473
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,180
 Stay on that swamp all day.

474
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,340
 So you have that.

475
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,940
 You have the evolution memory of despising reptiles and then you have all the UFO lore,

476
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,540
 reptilian lore in the UFO community and stuff like that.

477
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,380
 It can't be a good thing when you see this many reptilians in military formation.

478
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,220
 And also if they are naked, it is even more troubling.

479
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,740
 But as Georgie's standing there and all of these reptilians are staring at him, suddenly

480
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,180
 they move.

481
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:35,340
 They actually like, the formation is broken and they part almost like the Red Sea as

482
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,100
 Moses was walking through it.

483
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:45,380
 They part and now Georgie can look straight down and see in this ocean of naked reptilian

484
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,380
 soldiers.

485
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,260
 There's a couch.

486
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:57,420
 And on the couch lies a beautiful, blonde, naked woman.

487
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,140
 She's asleep.

488
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,300
 Her eyes closed.

489
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:08,340
 The alien fluorescent lights glimmering off of her pale, new bile flesh.

490
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:13,540
 Georgie stares at this beautiful nude figure laying there.

491
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,220
 And then the reptilians reform.

492
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,260
 Like the reptilians then block off his view.

493
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,260
 They notice he's getting a little too excited.

494
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,740
 They're like, "Ahh."

495
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,220
 Even though you're not naked, we could tell that you like that a little too much.

496
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,180
 The reptilian who led him into the room then leads him towards this large screen on the

497
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,180
 wall.

498
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,180
 And he's like, "Oh am I going to see more of this nude lady on the screen?"

499
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,660
 The reptilian's like, "No."

500
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:42,520
 The reptilian presses a button and a sea of stars appears on the screen.

501
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,140
 And the reptilian points to one star in particular and says, "Earth."

502
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,500
 And then he turns to Georgie and gives him a hug.

503
00:26:52,500 --> 00:27:00,820
 Gives him a big hug, pulls him close to his naked, wart-covered body and says, "Stay with

504
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,460
 us.

505
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,580
 We have no time and death."

506
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,500
 Now I don't know if the reptilians are really good on human grammar.

507
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,180
 I think he means...

508
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,420
 There's two ways you can take that.

509
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,720
 You can take it as we have no time for you to decide.

510
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
 We have death.

511
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,000
 I don't think that's what he means.

512
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,080
 I think what he means is we have no time and we have no death.

513
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,200
 If you are here, it'll be an immortal moment.

514
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,520
 You will never pass away.

515
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,440
 And Georgie though, throughout this whole story, other than when the hot naked chick showed

516
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,600
 up, he's terrified.

517
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,400
 At no point does he feel at ease around these things, which is funny because sometimes we

518
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,420
 cover a lot of UFO stories, or the aliens are eventually able to calm down the human

519
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,180
 and they're like, "Everything will be okay.

520
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,180
 Don't be afraid.

521
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,180
 Don't be afraid."

522
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,780
 This is not working on Georgie.

523
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,300
 Georgie is terrified this whole time.

524
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,460
 He doesn't want to stay here.

525
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,840
 He says, "I can't."

526
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,060
 And the only thing he can think of, like the first thing that he thinks of, because he's

527
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,260
 trying to look for excuses, it's the same thing when your friend's like, "Hey, can you

528
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,500
 come hang out with us Friday night?"

529
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,260
 And you're like, "Uh, uh, no, I can't."

530
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,660
 And then you've got to come up with a reason real quick.

531
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,400
 He goes, "My mom will miss me if I don't come home."

532
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,120
 Now that's probably a valid excuse when I'm saying his mom would have missed him, but

533
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,360
 he just, he's like, "My mom will miss me."

534
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,200
 And the aliens seem to be a little disappointed.

535
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,200
 They were hoping for this guy to hang out with them, but they're like, "Okay, we'll take

536
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,480
 you back home."

537
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:34,480
 And then the reptilian said, "Before you go, is there anything you want to know about?"

538
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,280
 And Georgie says, it was the first thing that popped in my head.

539
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,060
 I didn't really, I wasn't really thinking.

540
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,740
 This alien species is asking if I want to know anything.

541
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,780
 And he goes, "Because I had just mentioned to my mom, the only thing that popped in my

542
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,460
 head was, 'How long will my mother live?'"

543
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,940
 And this reptilian, again, I don't know if he has a problem with grammar or what, or

544
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,140
 he just wanted to be a jerk and leave it up to interpretation.

545
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,860
 The reptilian turns to him and says, "As much?"

546
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,060
 This is that exact quote.

547
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,460
 I've pretty much used all exact quotes.

548
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:12,280
 Whenever I do the creepy voice, he goes, "In relation to how long will my mother live?"

549
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,360
 The alien, the reptilian says, "As much as your age now."

550
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,840
 As much as your age now.

551
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
 What does that even mean?

552
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,720
 Like, I was thinking, so if this guy was 30, does that mean his mom will live an extra

553
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,800
 30 years?

554
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,720
 Does that mean that his mom's dead right now?

555
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
 And she's not.

556
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
 I mean, spoiler alert.

557
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,500
 Obviously, we know about this story.

558
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,700
 Georgie does come back home.

559
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,340
 He doesn't come home to a dead mom.

560
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,380
 What kind of a jerk way to say, "Hey, do you have any questions?"

561
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,020
 Then you ask a question like that, and that's such a...

562
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,820
 Yeah, it's dumb.

563
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,460
 Basically, criticizing the reptilians on this one.

564
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,140
 They should have just said, "She'll live another 30 years."

565
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,100
 Why does that have to be so cryptic?

566
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:01,700
 Anyways, the star on the screen then appears to grow and get closer and closer and closer

567
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,980
 to the screen.

568
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,440
 And Georgie is transfixed on this, and then he starts to recognize past the star, a little

569
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,920
 planet, and he goes, "Oh, that's Earth.

570
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
 I recognize that from all those science documentaries."

571
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,720
 And he gets closer and closer and closer, and then the screen is filled up with clouds.

572
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,760
 And then Georgie is back on Earth.

573
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,520
 Five hours later, so at this point it would be three in the afternoon, he's standing right

574
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:36,060
 outside his house, and he's facing the opposite direction from where he left.

575
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,660
 So I'm assuming if he left the front door, which is how most humans leave their houses,

576
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,380
 he was now in the backyard.

577
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,580
 He was in the opposite direction of where he had left.

578
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:53,140
 And one more weird quirk of this whole story, as he's getting situated, he realizes that

579
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,860
 he had some coins in his pocket this whole time.

580
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,720
 Because usually when you get abducted, you know you have stuff on your wallet, nowadays

581
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
 your phone.

582
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,840
 He had some coins in his pocket, and when he took them out they had a yellowish glow.

583
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
 They were glowing.

584
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:13,600
 And he said by the next morning, the coins had returned to normal, the glow was gone.

585
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,880
 It's a fascinating alien story because it really defies a lot of the stuff we know about

586
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
 reptilians.

587
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,640
 Like I was saying earlier, we assume the reptilians are the most bloodthirsty of the species,

588
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,420
 but here they're quite kind.

589
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,300
 They would be nice if they put on some pants.

590
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,300
 Just for modesty's sake, but they weren't killing them.

591
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,100
 They're giving them hugs and holding them by the hand, and they let him choose whether

592
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,060
 or not he wanted to come home.

593
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,660
 They were kind of jerks when he asked if his mom was going to be okay, or how long she was

594
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,660
 going to live.

595
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,940
 They could have given him a more straight answer.

596
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,620
 I also love the way he was abducted.

597
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,500
 Like out of all the ways people waking up on a ship, people trying to outrun a ship in

598
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,600
 their car or bright light being shined in their face.

599
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,640
 So who, what was with that beginning?

600
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,440
 Someone walking up behind them, and I don't know if he ever found out who did that.

601
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,360
 I don't know if he walked around town with a baseball bat, and he's like, who put that

602
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,120
 reptilian mask on my head?

603
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,640
 People are like, "George, what in the world are you talking about?"

604
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,400
 That's an odd way to be abducted.

605
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,360
 I've never heard anything like that before.

606
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,720
 Ever heard anything like that before.

607
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,840
 You get a mask put on you, and then when you take it off, you're in another world.

608
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,020
 It almost sounds ritualistic.

609
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,180
 Like the mask of a shaman, and you put it on and you become the creature.

610
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,340
 It kind of sounds like that.

611
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,580
 Who put the mask on him, or what put the mask on him?

612
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,580
 Why?

613
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,420
 It almost felt like the aliens didn't expect him to be human.

614
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,180
 That's why they called him Homo sapien.

615
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,940
 I, who, or maybe that was just the way they greet you when reptilian sees you.

616
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,540
 They call out your scientific name for your species.

617
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,540
 The whole story is weird.

618
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
 I love it.

619
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,880
 And then, when I was reading about this, and I read about that beautiful blonde woman on

620
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:04,040
 the couch, I thought, "Hmm, I immediately went to Google and googled, 'What year was

621
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,200
 Anya Taylor Joy born?'"

622
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,160
 You know who Anya Taylor Joy is?

623
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,040
 I have to be honest.

624
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,360
 I have to refrain from talking about her on the podcast all the time.

625
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,520
 I think she is hands down those beautiful woman who I've ever walked on the face of

626
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
 the earth.

627
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
 I've watched a bunch of listeners.

628
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,660
 They're like, "Oh, Jason, seriously?

629
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,940
 She's gorgeous.

630
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,300
 She's gorgeous.

631
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,420
 She's too gorgeous to be human."

632
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,100
 So when I was reading this story, I said, "I wonder when Anya Taylor Joy was born.

633
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:43,500
 I wonder if the beautiful sleeping naked woman on the couch in the spaceship was Anya Taylor

634
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,100
 Joy."

635
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,340
 So guess what I found out.

636
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,720
 Guess what I found out.

637
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,620
 This story took place in the year 1995.

638
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,340
 Anya Taylor Joy was born in 1996.

639
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,840
 Now you go, "Jason, wait a second.

640
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,020
 It's only over a year.

641
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,540
 That was an adult woman on a bed.

642
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,180
 A beautiful adult woman naked, a beautiful adult woman, blonde hair."

643
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,420
 Anya Taylor Joy was born a year later in a pressure.

644
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,500
 Pretty sure she wasn't born as a full grown adult.

645
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,020
 I'm sure she was a child, like most people.

646
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,240
 And she grew into the beauty that we all know and love.

647
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,880
 Sure, but hear me out.

648
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,640
 If you already shut off the podcast, you already know you're like, "No, I'm done."

649
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,720
 Aliens, the reptilians have no time, right?

650
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,200
 So maybe Anya Taylor Joy was born on a spaceship.

651
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,560
 Because a lot of people do say she looks like an alien.

652
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:44,400
 I don't think she looks like an alien personally, but I guess by saying she was born on a spaceship,

653
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
 she's beautiful.

654
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
 I love her.

655
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,620
 I watch everything she's in, except for Emma and the Queen's Gambit.

656
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,340
 I only watch stuff that she's in that I like, that I think is cool.

657
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,700
 Where people get chopped up, like New Mutants or the Northman.

658
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,100
 But anyways, where was I going with this?

659
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,860
 Oh yeah, beautiful naked woman on a couch.

660
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,900
 Year is 1995.

661
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:10,700
 Anya Taylor Joy is a little baby, little baby zygote floating around in her mom's womb

662
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,940
 around somewhere around 1995.

663
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,520
 Anya Taylor Joy is born April 16th, 1996.

664
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,520
 So that means that at the same time this guy was on the spaceship, she was inside her

665
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,960
 mom's womb on Earth.

666
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,040
 What I'm saying, here's my conspiracy theory that Anya Taylor Joy, she's on this spaceship

667
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,920
 in the year 1995.

668
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,160
 Her birthday is in April of 1996.

669
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,440
 So it would be at the same time she was in her mom's womb, the adult version of Anya

670
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,700
 Taylor Joy that we would all come to worship is on the alien starship.

671
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,100
 And then, then at some point she flies.

672
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,580
 I don't know how to make this work.

673
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,940
 But I'm wondering who that lady was and who else could it be but Anya Taylor Joy.

674
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:03,900
 Who else fits the description of a beautiful blonde woman in the world?

675
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,740
 Is it anyone but Anya Taylor Joy?

676
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,740
 Who knows?

677
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,740
 This is a fascinating thing.

678
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,400
 Even though it kind of went sideways in the end.

679
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,800
 It's a fascinating tale of abduction.

680
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,920
 It's a really cool look at the reptilians.

681
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,640
 We've never had, I cannot think of another time the reptilians have been this chill.

682
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,920
 They normally are kidnapping people from Kansas and taking them to Antarctica to turn them

683
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,800
 into sex slaves or to move boxes for them on the moon.

684
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,600
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

685
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,840
 And I also, before I wrap this up, I want to give a shout out.

686
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,640
 I got this from thinkabout@docs.com.

687
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,500
 They got it from Anton Anfalov, who's a big UFO researcher.

688
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:44,700
 We've covered his work a lot of times and he was quoting a work or book called The Secret

689
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,260
 Doctrine, number nine, published in 2002.

690
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,820
 Gotta give a shout out to those guys.

691
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,580
 Fascinating story of alien abduction.

692
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,860
 One of the weirdest ways I've ever heard of someone being taken by aliens.

693
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,340
 It's so folklorish.

694
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,380
 It's so shamanic.

695
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,460
 And yet the journey he went on wasn't a spirit quest but it took them to the deepest parts

696
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:11,640
 of space to meet an alien race that is normally openly hostile towards humans.

697
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,000
 But this time they just wanted this guy to chill out with them.

698
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:26,600
 And maybe, just maybe, meet the one and only, Anya Taylor Joy.

699
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,240
