1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
 A first-hand account from a stalker's point of view makes us wonder, "Maybe I should never

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,760
 leave my house.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,440
 Maybe I should be hiding here forever."

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:19,240
 And then we travel to Florida to take a look at a little girl out playing at the playground

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,000
 of her school.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,160
 She was hoping to just jump on the monkey bars, maybe swing on a swing.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:35,560
 Then she came face-to-face with the race of alien flowers today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:46,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,800
 I'm your host, Chase The Garbenter, and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,680
 There's some reason I decided to eat a cup, like a literal measuring cup of almonds, and

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,960
 then I go, "I'm gonna record a podcast and now my mouth is all dry.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,600
 It's all salty, little bits of almond everywhere."

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,880
 But someone who's always willing to clean my teeth, walking into Dead Rabbit Command

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,000
 right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Everyone give it up for Gutter.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Woohoo!

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Yeah!

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Come on in.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Ooze on it.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,440
 I don't think he's an actual Gutter, although that would be really cool.

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,680
 A Gutter came to life and became sentient.

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,680
 The first thing it does is join my Patreon.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,320
 Gutter, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's totally fine.

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
 It's so hard concentrating with all this almond in my mouth.

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,640
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,920
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,440
 That helps out so much.

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,160
 Gutter, let's go ahead and toss you a steam shovel and a little engineer cap, a little

31
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
 wooden whistle.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,600
 Everyone hop on board the Carbinder Caboose.

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,200
 We're gonna chew, chew, chew all the way out of Dead Rabbit Command to a local grocery

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
 store.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,720
 Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga.

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 Woohoo!

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
 Woooo!

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
 Woooo!

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,960
 Gutter is leading us down the tracks.

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,120
 And actually as we're headed there, I wanted to say this.

41
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,880
 I talk about this website all the time on the show.

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,440
 It's called Phantoms and Monsters.

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
 It's a great website.

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,400
 They put out maybe five or six articles a day.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,600
 Well, the mastermind behind Phantoms and Monsters, Lon Strickler.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,400
 A lot of you guys are aware of Lon Strickler as well.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
 He's written a ton of stuff.

48
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,080
 He's one of the biggest and I feel most underrated paranormal researcher out there.

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,440
 He is going into surgery.

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,160
 He's having lung surgery.

51
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,960
 So thoughts and prayers and healing energy to Lon Strickler.

52
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,440
 If you're a fan of Dead Rabbit Radio, trust me, you're a fan of Lon Strickler.

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,880
 Great, great repository of paranormal stuff.

54
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,600
 So yeah, just I'm wishing him the best.

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,640
 He's going to be out of commission for a while.

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,960
 He's going to be out of commission for a while.

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,880
 But hoping for a speedy recovery, Lon, seriously.

58
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,380
 What a great resource.

59
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,440
 And you know what sucks?

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,080
 So I'm doing a pretty good job at it, but I'm trying to death-proof the podcast because

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
 here's the way that...

62
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
 I know that's kind of a sad segue.

63
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
 Lon's like, "Wait, what?

64
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,240
 I'm not going to die, bro."

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,240
 I personally have seen entire paranormal repositories just disappear.

66
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,680
 The Shadowlands apparently was down for a while.

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,680
 The Shadowlands.net, which is, I mean, at this point, almost 15, 20 years of ghost stories,

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,960
 user-submitted ghost stories, that was down for a while.

69
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,520
 That was brought back to life.

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,400
 There were podcasts that I listened to that had 100 or so episodes of paranormal content

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,160
 and then the people just quit and they stopped paying their hosting fee and it's all gone.

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
 So that sucks.

73
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,640
 So YouTube, the video, stay up until YouTube deletes the channel or someone else deletes

74
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
 the channel.

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,720
 But when a podcast, once the bills stop getting paid, it gets shut down.

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,080
 Like they remove everything.

77
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,960
 So I'm currently in the process of death-proofing the podcast, right?

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,640
 So getting all of my stuff up onto the Internet Archive, way back machine, all of these things

79
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,200
 because that would suck, right?

80
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,560
 To have all of this stuff just go away.

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,760
 I obviously have backups of it, but it's a real phenomenon and it would suck if you

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,400
 lose somebody like a lawn striker and wish you knew the best, wish you knew the best,

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,980
 quit saying I'm gonna die.

84
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,400
 How long would years and years and years of all those stories stay up online before eventually

85
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,720
 the hosting service cancels it or...

86
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
 It's crazy.

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,400
 It's crazy to think about because this is real research.

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,560
 This shows goofy, but the articles that I source are real research, real work done.

89
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,720
 There have been times I've gone back to check something out and the website that I cited

90
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
 is gone.

91
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,080
 Not like conformers, aliens, the government is trying to suppress the information.

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,120
 They just didn't pay their hosting bill.

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,080
 And so there are websites that I've personally backed up just in case.

94
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
 Think about it.

95
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,760
 Docs.com, I have an entire mirror of that site on my computer just in case because that

96
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,880
 is, again, decades of research.

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
 Think about it.

98
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,280
 Docs.com, theshadowlands.net, I have a backup of that.

99
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,720
 We really want these researchers, we really want these websites to stick around.

100
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,480
 So DeadRab radio or Deafproofing it.

101
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,560
 So if something happened to me, the show will still be there.

102
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,320
 I know this was supposed to be wishing Long the best than we do, but I do want it.

103
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,920
 We have to appreciate the paranormal.

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,680
 And again, I'm talking less about the show.

105
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,440
 We're going to be fine, but all these other paranormal resources.

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,600
 There's a really cool, open in the show notes.

107
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,000
 I don't refer to it that much because it's so vast, just like Phantomas and Monsters.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,200
 I've visited the website for years, but only recently I've been including a bunch of stories

109
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,640
 because they put out so much stuff.

110
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,520
 There's a website called The Encyclopedia of Cryptids that's been around for years,

111
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,560
 and then the guy said, "Hey, I'm having some problems.

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,880
 I'm going to take a break," and he's never returned.

113
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,560
 And you think, "What happens when this website goes down?"

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,280
 I'm not sure if this is super depressing.

115
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
 Okay, okay.

116
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
 Anyways, I have a backup of that as well, but I'll put the link in the show notes.

117
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
 We really love these repositories.

118
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,200
 We really love the work you do, Lawn, and all the other paranormal researchers out there.

119
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,520
 Hope you live a long life.

120
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:30,240
 Gutter, let's go ahead and stop this train right outside of this grocery store.

121
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,240
 And we all jump out.

122
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
 We're all walking around.

123
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,520
 Why am I putting, I'm just about to put more almonds in my mouth.

124
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
 We jump out of the train.

125
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
 We're walking around.

126
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,720
 And in this store, we'll just say it's a Safeway.

127
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,000
 I don't know for whatever reason, I picture it as a Safeway.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,760
 We are going to meet a guy named Mikey.

129
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,080
 Mikey tells this story. This happened back on January 22nd, 2023.

130
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,120
 Mikey walks into this grocery store.

131
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,520
 He's a 19-year-old young man.

132
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,080
 He's just in there to pick up a couple things, almonds probably.

133
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,400
 When all of a sudden, he sees someone wearing a white lab coat.

134
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,160
 Well, to be specific, at first he just says a white coat.

135
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,880
 So I don't know, this could have been like a big white windbreaker.

136
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,240
 It could have been a white puffy coat.

137
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
 I don't know.

138
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,200
 But he goes, he goes about this guy walked by.

139
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,000
 I think it's implied that he's walking by in a white lab coat.

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,720
 Because once Mikey sees this guy walk by in the white lab coat, he has this thought,

141
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,440
 that's what I want to do.

142
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,080
 That's what I've always wanted to do.

143
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,360
 So I'm going to start following.

144
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,200
 It's so funny when people post online.

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
 It's so funny.

146
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,560
 I've said my share of crazy stuff.

147
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
 I get it.

148
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,560
 I sound like a lunatic when I talk about my personal stories.

149
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,840
 I sound like a lunatic when I talk about anything.

150
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,760
 But definitely the stuff I've been through.

151
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,360
 Shadow men and seeing demonic clowns and all that.

152
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,320
 I'll put those episodes in the show notes, but it was what people post online.

153
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,560
 He said, he started following this guy wearing this lab coat in the middle of this grocery

154
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
 store.

155
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
 And you're wondering why.

156
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,880
 You're wondering why he would do this.

157
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:26,200
 He said, quote, I casually kept following this person around because my goal in life

158
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,280
 is to be either a doctor or a scientist.

159
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:39,840
 And to be fair, I think the only thing that connects those two is the white coat.

160
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,440
 I don't think there's anything else that connects a doctor or a scientist.

161
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,840
 I guess medicine is science, sure.

162
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,840
 But anyways, anyways, that's not the craziest part about this.

163
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,960
 He said, quote, I casually kept following this person around because my goal in life

164
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,000
 is to be either a doctor or a scientist.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,440
 Not specific of biologists.

166
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,480
 I don't know.

167
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,040
 Social scientists don't wear lab coats.

168
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,720
 Okay, I'll stop getting hung up on that.

169
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 Okay.

170
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,360
 The goal in life is to be either a doctor or a scientist.

171
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,040
 So seeing someone in a white coat caught my attention.

172
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,480
 And you could go, okay, this guy's 19 years old.

173
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,280
 He's probably in college or going to, hopefully, if he wants to be a scientist.

174
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,520
 He's like, nah, I'm just going to try to figure it out on my own.

175
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,840
 I got a test tube set from the hobby shop.

176
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,960
 I'm a scientist.

177
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,480
 He starts following this guy around.

178
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,840
 So maybe I've walked up to a news reporter one day.

179
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
 She was having yogurt.

180
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,840
 And I was like, hey, I want to do news.

181
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
 I want to do news.

182
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
 I'm walking up to her.

183
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
 I'm like, I want to do news.

184
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
 Tell me the news.

185
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
 I want to do news.

186
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,160
 I said, hey, I've seen you on television.

187
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
 You do a lot of good work.

188
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,840
 I like to get into-- I was a journalism student at the time.

189
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
 And I told her that.

190
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,520
 And I said, she's like, yeah, swing on down anytime.

191
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,360
 You don't hook you up in an internship.

192
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
 I never went.

193
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
 I never went.

194
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,360
 I was too busy out punching people in the face and smoking weed to actually do anything

195
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
 back then.

196
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,200
 But I mean, I could see that.

197
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,040
 I could see people living that life, like wanting to be a scientist or a doctor, and

198
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,800
 then seeing a doctor and be like, hey, how did you become a doctor?

199
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,480
 They sit you down.

200
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,280
 They go through five or six years of everything they've learned.

201
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,760
 You're like, oh, I just came in here to buy some almonds.

202
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,800
 But now my brain is overwhelmed at everything about doctoring.

203
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
 You can figure that.

204
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,280
 Maybe he's going to walk and be like, hey, what laboratory do you work at?

205
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,000
 What laboratory and/or hospital do you work at?

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,240
 He's like, what?

207
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,120
 He sees this guy walk by in a white lab coat.

208
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,480
 He's always wanted to be a doctor or a scientist.

209
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,000
 So then he starts following him.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,640
 And you think maybe to ask him, how did you get into that?

211
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,600
 But this goes on for a while.

212
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,640
 And here's the thing.

213
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
 He's following.

214
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,200
 And Mikey's following this guy through the store.

215
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:16,120
 And at one point, the guy turns and Mikey realizes that it's his doppelganger.

216
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,880
 Mikey now sees an exact copy of himself in a white lab coat shopping in front of him.

217
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,600
 Well, technically, he's been stalking him.

218
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,040
 So he'll always be in front of him.

219
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,560
 But he catches a glimpse of his face and he goes, listen, we have the same skin tone,

220
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:41,960
 the same height, same glasses, same face as well.

221
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,000
 I probably would have started with that one if I was describing it.

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,280
 I go, yeah, I saw my exact double.

223
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
 We had the same skin tone.

224
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
 They're like, what?

225
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
 A lot of people have your skin tone on.

226
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
 Don't let me.

227
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
 Don't interrupt me.

228
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,760
 We also have the same glasses.

229
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
 They're like, what?

230
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,880
 Those glasses look terrible on you, Mikey.

231
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,120
 There's the worst fashion choice you've ever made.

232
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,040
 You would say, I saw a doppelganger out of the store.

233
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,400
 He had my exact same face.

234
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,880
 That's how you would start it off.

235
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,360
 You wouldn't start being like, we had the same watch.

236
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,680
 It was a swatch watch.

237
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,000
 And you didn't look alike.

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,200
 You have the same face.

239
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,400
 And he goes, we were exact duplicates except weights.

240
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
 He was a little bit chubbier than I was.

241
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,400
 Apparently, Mikey's kind of a thinner guy.

242
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,680
 So when he got a look at this guy's face and realized it was exactly him, he decided,

243
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,400
 Mikey goes, I got to follow this guy around even more.

244
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,240
 Now remember this kind of lab coat just walked into buy some stuff.

245
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,360
 You buy some science stuff.

246
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,080
 He went to the test tube section.

247
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,680
 He's buying baking soda and vinegar.

248
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,440
 He's like, oh, all my science shopping done for this week.

249
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,720
 He now realizes that not only is this a guy in one of two of his dream jobs, right?

250
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,080
 He's employed as either a doctor or a scientist, but also it looks just like him.

251
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:05,400
 So now Mikey goes, I want to follow him around even more, which is kind of hard because there's

252
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,760
 already stalking the guy.

253
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,560
 I didn't know I could want to stalk someone even more.

254
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,760
 If you think that the mystery has been solved, if you think that this story has already had

255
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,520
 too many twists and turns for you, and you're like, Jason, seriously, if there's one more,

256
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,480
 I'm going to have to shut off the podcast.

257
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,960
 Mikey realizes that this doctor slash scientist shopping looks exactly like him, same skin

258
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,560
 tone and everything.

259
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,280
 Then this would be a little trippy.

260
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:42,240
 I guess I'm kind of, this would be weird because Mikey goes as I'm watching him put

261
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,280
 stuff into his, at this point, Mikey's not even shopping anymore.

262
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,080
 He's just like walking around, stalking this guy.

263
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:59,240
 He goes, as I see my doppelganger putting stuff into his shopping cart, he is buying,

264
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,160
 he's buying some Coke Zero.

265
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,480
 And Mikey goes, that's my drink.

266
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,920
 He says it right in his ear.

267
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,840
 He pops up from behind a display.

268
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,080
 He's like, that's my drink.

269
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,640
 Mikey goes, I drink Coke Zero too.

270
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,320
 He thinks that he doesn't say it.

271
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
 I wish he had.

272
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,560
 That would be so funny.

273
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,560
 If you're a guy in a lab coat, you're walking around, you don't realize you're being stalked.

274
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,400
 You go to grab some Coke Zero and all of a sudden a guy jumps up and goes, that's my drink.

275
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:34,280
 And imagine the shock as a doctor scientist to turn and see your doppelganger.

276
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,800
 You see a skinnier version of you with no white lab coat, jumps out from behind a display

277
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,560
 and goes, that's my drink.

278
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,160
 I wish that's how the story ended.

279
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,920
 Unfortunately it doesn't.

280
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,000
 You would think, oh my god, my cloning experiments worked.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,480
 Mikey goes, that's my drink.

282
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
 And he realizes this has to be my doppelganger.

283
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,560
 I would say that's pretty good evidence too because nobody drinks Coke Zero.

284
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
 That stuff's disgusting.

285
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,720
 I'll drink a warm Diet Coke before I'll drink a Coke Zero.

286
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,040
 And I've tried drinking a lot of Coke Zero.

287
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
 It's gross.

288
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,560
 I know this episode's sponsored by Pepsi, but anyways Coke Zero's disgusting.

289
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,920
 No, I'll die on that hill.

290
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
 It's gross.

291
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,040
 Anyways, Mikey's like, this has to be me.

292
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,360
 Who else would possibly drink this sludge?

293
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:31,320
 So now the white lab coat dude is getting into line to buy his groceries and Mikey is

294
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,600
 getting in line too.

295
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
 The tension.

296
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,920
 You can feel the tension building.

297
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:44,480
 And what happened was by the time they started ringing up Mikey's items, the lab coat man

298
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,160
 had already got all of his stuff rang up.

299
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
 And Mikey's like, totally sweaty.

300
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,160
 He's like, oh come on man, hurry up.

301
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
 Hurry up, cashier, hurry up.

302
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
 Don't you see that guy looks just like me.

303
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
 Cashier's like, what are you talking about?

304
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,000
 He's being extra slow.

305
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 He's part of the conspiracy.

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,840
 He's like, oh, you can't know that that cloning facility exists.

307
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,120
 Price check on this 98 cent peanut butter please.

308
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:13,040
 He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

309
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,920
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

310
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,480
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

311
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,480
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

312
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

313
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

314
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,400
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

315
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,280
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

316
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,400
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

317
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

318
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

319
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

320
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

321
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

322
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

323
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

324
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

325
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

327
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

329
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

330
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

333
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

334
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

335
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

336
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,680
 he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like,

337
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,680
 he was spitting game or what, but I mean, technically there are two girls, there's one

338
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,680
 for each of us, you don't have to be selfish, we look alike. And yeah, so anyway, I've done

339
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,680
 that, I that, but see, that wasn't creepy, that was just me sitting down next to a total

340
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,680
 stranger. Keep saying, look at us, look at us, like it's a Rick and Morty sketch, but

341
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,680
 this took place back in like 2002. So yeah, you could say something, don't, don't be

342
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,680
 creepy about it. You could say, Hey, isn't that weird? We look alike. Also, nice jacket,

343
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,680
 what do you do for a living? You don't have to be creepy about it. You don't have to rub

344
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,680
 your body up on them. But the other people were saying, just don't be creepy, just don't

345
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,680
 follow people around at a grocery store. But this raises an interesting question. Because

346
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:25,680
 what if this was, I mean, the most likely explanation was this just guy that looked like him, right?

347
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,680
 Not a doppelganger, not a clone or a time slip or something. But what if it was, what if

348
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,680
 this guy, the reason why he was wearing his lab coat, because he was a time travel scientist

349
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,680
 that he finally, I've always wanted to go back in time and see what Safeway was like in the

350
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,680
 year 2023. So he goes back in time and he's walking around or maybe not even that dramatic.

351
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,680
 Maybe he just maybe he doesn't know he's in an alternate reality. Maybe he leaves the

352
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,680
 laboratories like turns on the device and he's like, I need to go buy some go zero. It's all

353
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,680
 warping realities like, ah, and then he doesn't realize anything's different. And then he comes

354
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:11,680
 to our reality. And everything's exactly the same as his reality, except there's two of

355
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,680
 him here, or one of him already here. And it's interesting that the one in the lab coat was

356
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:26,680
 heavier, because that would show like different lifestyle choices. Like one in an alternate

357
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,680
 reality, our reality, the guy just consumed nothing but Coke zero. He's like, literally,

358
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,680
 that's my drink. That's all I drink. But then you have a guy coming from an alternate reality

359
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:43,680
 is a little heavier set. And maybe he came here and he goes, wow, what's this Coke zero?

360
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,680
 In my world, everything's exactly the same, but we don't have Coke zero. I'll try this out.

361
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,680
 I'm going to take this back to universe 1197. And he does. That's why he disappeared.

362
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,680
 Technically, he didn't say he disappeared at the end. He might be just going to find him.

363
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,680
 I'm sure he just got his car and drove away. I don't think it was paranormal. But it is

364
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:11,680
 interesting. You could look at it. Here's the thing. This was a crazy guy stalking a doctor

365
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,680
 slash scientist through a story. That's the most likely explanation. But in the world of

366
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,680
 the paranormal, you do have to open it up. And in that situation, had he said, hey, dude,

367
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:30,680
 we look like that could have cued in that lab coat guy to turn and go, we do. We do.

368
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,680
 And also, I've been experimenting with alternate dimensions, which at that point, you would

369
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,680
 think that's the crazy guy. The stalker's like, oh, okay, see you later, buddy.

370
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,680
 There's a interesting story in the lab for one of two reasons. One, proof of alternate realities

371
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,680
 or time travel or to prove that you're not safe anywhere. Wherever you go, there's a chance

372
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,680
 that someone's stalking you. Even in a restaurant, even at a Chili's restaurant, you might be

373
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,680
 enjoying a delicious meal with two beautiful women all of a sudden a dude rubbing his face

374
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,680
 against yours going, don't we look alike? Don't we look alike? I wasn't drunk either.

375
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:12,680
 I was totally sober. I was just sitting in a Chili's with my friends. Don't we look like?

376
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,680
 Gutter, let's go and attach you to the keys to the carbonar copter. We're leaving behind

377
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,680
 this Safeway. I wonder if he'll run back into them because if it's like a neighborhood grocery

378
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:28,680
 store, that's definitely possible. Maybe we'll get a part two. All the stories we cover on

379
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,680
 this show, that's the one we get follow up to. Gutter, I'm going to attach you to the keys

380
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,680
 to the carbonar copter. We're leaving behind Safeway or whatever grocery store this was.

381
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:45,680
 Flias all the way out to good old Florida. [imitates car engine]

382
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,680
 Specifically, this takes place in Dade City, Florida. The year is 1924. We're about to meet

383
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:58,680
 this little girl named Evelyn Wint. She's seven and she's a student at the Holy Name Convent

384
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,680
 School. I'm assuming that's like a private religious school. I don't think in any way shape

385
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:12,680
 or form that's a public institution. But what's interesting about this school is apparently

386
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:20,680
 there is a science building on the campus. So think about that for a second. I went to a

387
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,680
 private Catholic school for a couple years and there's like a science classroom. Sure,

388
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:32,680
 this place had a science building. That's not the main point of the story. It's not,

389
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,680
 isn't that weird? Have a nice day. But there's a science building on campus. So they must

390
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:42,680
 have been doing some pretty advanced stuff. Like, I don't know if it's K through master's

391
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,680
 degree. I don't know if they just had the middle school students or the elementary school students

392
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,680
 or whatever doing some advanced science. But there is a science building on campus.

393
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,680
 But Evelyn's not worried about that. Evelyn's playing in the playground. She doesn't care

394
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,680
 about all those beakers and stuff hanging out in there. She wants to have some fun. So she's

395
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:14,680
 out on the playground and all of a sudden she gets blinded by a bright light and as her

396
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:22,680
 vision slowly returning she sees a strange egg shaped object sitting on the grass in

397
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:29,680
 front of her. I wonder if this was a Saturday because there's no other witnesses to this.

398
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,680
 I don't know if she was just playing in this playground all to herself. But she does see

399
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:44,680
 this egg, this egg shaped object and it opens up and emerging out of this egg is a bunch

400
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:50,680
 of...this story's weird. Like, I'm just kidding. Trying to put it in a word so I can tell it to you.

401
00:24:50,680 --> 00:25:02,680
 It's so weird. Little girl all alone blinding white light, egg, it opens up and outpour dozens

402
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:10,680
 upon dozens of aliens. She says there's so many she can't even keep count. They keep moving

403
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:17,680
 around as well. They're walking around, they're bumbling around. And if that wasn't weird enough,

404
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,680
 which I think that definitely would classify as weird enough. Hey, today I was at school

405
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,680
 on a Saturday of all things and an egg showed up and these aliens popped out. The way these

406
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:34,680
 aliens looked, this was in 1924 too. So people, I mean you are aware of science fiction, Jules

407
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:40,680
 Verne and H.G. Wells, stuff like that. But it definitely wasn't a mainstay of pop culture.

408
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:52,680
 Out of this egg hop, not just regular old aliens, but robotic flowers. She said, and this is the

409
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,680
 only way that a kid could really put this in words, they look like cartoons. She goes,

410
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,680
 they look like cartoons. She goes, their bodies were mechanical the way that their joints fit,

411
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,680
 the way that they were kind of walking around. They weren't like 10 soldiers, but she could

412
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,680
 look at them and tell that their bodies were artificial, artificially constructed. Their

413
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,680
 heads were like a flower, like a sunflower, right? Daffodil or something like that. Where

414
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,680
 the center, the bud of the flower is where there were two eyes and a mouth. And then you

415
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,680
 had the big yellow petals of the flower all around its head like a lion's mane. Like something

416
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,680
 like that. She's seen a cartoon. She sees these robotic flowers jump out of this egg. There's

417
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,680
 so many of them and they're moving around so rapidly she can't keep track of them. And

418
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,680
 she says, to put things in perspective, probably should have explained this earlier, it's not

419
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,680
 the size of an egg. The ship is in size of an egg and all these little guys popped out.

420
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:03,680
 But the robots, she is taller than these robots. She's taller than the flower robotic aliens.

421
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,680
 But not by much. She's not towering over them, but she's definitely taller than them. So

422
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,680
 we'll say maybe a foot taller. So if she's probably seven years old, I don't know, three

423
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,680
 feet, these things are maybe about two feet tall. And there's a bunch of them. Your picture

424
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:27,680
 like, "Wait, I was picturing an egg this whole time. He kept saying an egg showed up. I was

425
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:34,680
 picturing it all small. They're two feet tall, bro. You've got to describe this stuff." So

426
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:40,680
 I can picture it. You're like, "Vanity, you have to pause the podcast." You're like, "Wait,

427
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:47,680
 what? What's going on?" He's just casually talking about, "The robots and ghosts, oh yeah,

428
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,680
 they hop out of an egg, but they're two feet tall." You're like, "Ah, anyways, two feet

429
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:00,680
 tall. Big egg." It was an egg-shaped object. I only called it an egg once or twice. I only

430
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:07,680
 explicitly said it was an egg. It was an egg-shaped object. It was big. I hope you pictured a big

431
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,680
 one because otherwise you're super confused right now and you have an egg. Anyways, these

432
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,680
 two feet tall, I don't know if they're exactly two feet tall, but they're a little bit shorter

433
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,680
 than a human girl, a seven-year-old girl. They're walking around. You're all paused and you're

434
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,680
 all looking it up. You're like, "Just read the article at this point, bro. I'll see you

435
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:34,680
 tomorrow." These robots get out and they're walking around and they're carrying something

436
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:43,680
 that Evelyn, she used two words to describe it. She would say the word "device," but she

437
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:53,680
 also felt that it was a weapon. She felt like it was some sort of cannon. Now, a child in

438
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,680
 1924 would be aware of that. Obviously, at seven, she probably would have been alive at

439
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:05,680
 the tail in the World War I. I think she probably would know what a cannon was. If she was seven

440
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:14,680
 in 1924, she would have been two when the armistice was signed. She's like, "I'm getting breastfed

441
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,680
 and I'm watching the news." I actually know it would have been like a newsreel. But anyways,

442
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,680
 she knows what a cannon is. She's seen some Betty Boop cartoons, at the very least. It doesn't

443
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,680
 explicitly look like an old-timey cannon, but she just gets the feeling that this is a

444
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:36,680
 weapon. One, because it kind of looks like a cannon. And two, because the aliens, these

445
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:46,680
 robot alien flowers, tell her that they're on a mission. They are here to destroy the

446
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:54,680
 science building. It's interesting to note that before they telepathically told her this,

447
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:01,680
 probably should have mentioned this earlier. Probably should have mentioned, I don't know

448
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:07,680
 why. All those almonds go into my brain, all those carbs. Before they told her that, she

449
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,680
 saw them moving this cannon around. And she realized, "Hey, they're smaller than me and

450
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,680
 that thing's pretty big. I'll help them. I'm going to help them move that." And she

451
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,680
 walked over to pick it up, and it was super heavy. It was too heavy for her to lift. Even

452
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,680
 though these robots were smaller than her, they were able to carry this cannon around.

453
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:35,680
 And then she gets a telepathic message, and they tell her, "We're going to destroy the

454
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,680
 science building." She's like, "What?" They said that there was work going on in that building

455
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:51,680
 that they were specifically sent here to prevent or just destroy. The aliens go, "Yes, we are

456
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,680
 going to destroy that building. We're going to stop the work that's being done in there.

457
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,680
 It cannot be allowed to continue. We need to put it into it, so we're going to destroy

458
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,680
 the building." Now, we don't want to destroy the building. If the work stops in there, we'll

459
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:13,680
 let it stand, but we have this cannon just in case. They didn't use the word cannon, but

460
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,680
 if you point a device at a building and say, "We're going to stop what's going on in there,"

461
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,680
 even if we have to destroy the building, it's a cannon. And then they ask Evelyn, "Hey,

462
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:30,680
 will you help us? If you'll help us stop it, that'd be grand." And she, you know,

463
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,680
 earth first, right? She says, "No, I'm not going to do it." And it's such a weird story.

464
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:42,680
 This is such a bizarre story. It started off weird. It ends weird. They go, "Will you help

465
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,680
 us destroy the building?" And she said, "No." They've just unloaded this laser cannon or

466
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:54,680
 whatever it is from their egg-shaped ship. There's a bunch of women there. They're all

467
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,680
 two feet tall. They just unloaded this cannon. They say, "Hey, will you help us to stop the

468
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:07,680
 work or destroy the building?" She says, "No." They then go, "Ah, just screw it." The

469
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,680
 aliens are like, "Ah, whatever. We were sent here on this mission to stop the work going

470
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:19,680
 on in that building, but whatever." They pack the cannon back up into the egg-shaped ship.

471
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:26,680
 They all climb back on board, and one of them says, "Evelin, we're going to come back in

472
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:37,680
 35 years, and we're coming back for you." Now, I don't know if it was like sinister

473
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,680
 like that. I would take that as a threat. Or the flower robot, like the last one everyone

474
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:49,680
 was on the ship, goes, "In 35 years, we're going to come back for you, Evelyn." You're

475
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,680
 still kind of creepy, right? But I don't know if it was a threat or if they wanted to visit

476
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:00,680
 her again. I don't know. But all the aliens, she doesn't know. Now, the reason why, like

477
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,680
 we don't know what the tenor of that conversation was at the end, or really any of it, right,

478
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:12,680
 is that the story took place in 1924, but Evelyn did not start telling this story until 1974.

479
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:19,680
 So, 50 years had passed. Now, definitely enough time had passed that the aliens said we'd

480
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:26,680
 be back in 35 years for Evelyn. She never encountered these things again. Ever.

481
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,680
 Which is an interesting note. We'll put a little pin in that for right now, but the aliens say

482
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,680
 we'll be back in 35 years. She never saw him again. Now, it's 1974, and she begins telling

483
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,680
 the story. I think it gets originally reported like a local newspaper or a UFO author picks

484
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,680
 it up. And you'll find this story, it's not super well known. It's not a super well known

485
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:59,680
 story. It's known as the Dade City Flowers. And you'll see it on obscure UFO websites.

486
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:07,680
 And when I'm reading it, I go, "It's an interesting story. It doesn't make a lot of sense." Because

487
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:13,680
 the aliens didn't do what they came here to do. They lied. They said, "We'll come back

488
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:21,680
 in 35 years. They didn't show back up." There's not a lot of primary sources on this story.

489
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:33,680
 Like, I'm reading just random websites. I'm reading obscureinlegend.fandom.com and ufology.patrickgross.org.

490
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:38,680
 I'm not saying those are bad websites, but they're definitely not mainstays in the paranormal

491
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,680
 community. I mean, those sites are good enough that I found this story on there, but I go,

492
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:49,680
 "Is this story real?" Yes, generally, when you find a story on fandom.com, I don't know if it's

493
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,680
 some D&D character, which has happened before. I was redoing an episode on demons once, and

494
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,680
 I was like, "Oh, dude, this is totally awesome. And what? This guy can get killed in the level

495
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,680
 18 sword? I can't wait to talk about this." And I did all this research and I realized it

496
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,680
 wasn't dudes homebrew campaign. This is a true story. I didn't end up doing the episode,

497
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,680
 but I found all these really cool demons, and I was like, "Oh, this is going to be awesome."

498
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:19,680
 And it was just like, made up. Totally made up. What's interesting about this story? Again,

499
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,680
 we never know how much of this stuff is true. I wasn't able to find the original news article.

500
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,680
 I just find people talking about an interview that Evelyn Went gave. So I tried doing a little

501
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,680
 more digging. And interestingly enough, this isn't proof that this story happened, but it's

502
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:44,680
 more proof than we get for a lot of these things. I found Evelyn Went's, or A. Evelyn Went's,

503
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:54,680
 obituary in Florida, born July 14th, 1918, so that would put her around six years old,

504
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,680
 depending on when the story took place. We just have the year 1924. That's around the

505
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:07,680
 right age, right? She died. She lived to be 100 years old. She died June 25th, 2019. I

506
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:14,680
 think she probably did give an interview at some time telling this story. So I think that

507
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,680
 she existed, and I think she really had this encounter. I don't think this is something

508
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,680
 completely made possible. We've been fooled before on this show, but I do believe that

509
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,680
 she had this encounter. I do believe she gave an interview with the local newspaper, and

510
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,680
 I do believe that it's out there. It's one of those stories that's so weird it doesn't

511
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,680
 gain traction in the UFO community. It's so bizarre. It's an interesting thing. They said

512
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,680
 they'd be back in 35 years. She never saw them again. And it's interesting too, because

513
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:48,680
 she said the science building never blew up. The science building stayed there. I'm

514
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,680
 wondering too, like again, there's so many details we're missing. I couldn't find the

515
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,680
 initial news report, but they could have been aiming it off campus. But, like, "Jayson,

516
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,680
 are you making me picture this school differently? Come on, just wrap it up." The science building

517
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,680
 may have been a couple of blocks away, for all I know, but she goes, "The science building

518
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,680
 never blew up." She goes, "It did eventually fall into disrepair and then just kind of

519
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,680
 crumble away." You guys know, like, a house or a property that's not being kept up. She

520
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,680
 goes, "Eventually, I guess they just stopped doing science. It was the science of keeping

521
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,680
 a building in one piece." And they shut down. She goes, "It just fell into disuse over the

522
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:35,680
 years and just kind of, you know, it wasn't anything dramatic." Which again is an interesting

523
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,680
 thing. These aliens traveled from somewhere, whether it's as simple as crossing dimensions

524
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,680
 or crossing the stars to stop the science going on in that building, and then they're just

525
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,680
 like, "No, never mind." I mean, the story is just so interesting. They just leave.

526
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:58,680
 Fascinating story. And again, it's too weird. That's why I love to highlight this stuff,

527
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,680
 because we always talk about the grays and these huge conspiracies with reptilians and

528
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,680
 these galactic federations and all this stuff. And while that stuff is fun and it's part

529
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,680
 of UFOology, we can't forget the weird ones either. You just can't. I mean, if you're going

530
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,680
 to look at this as a phenomenon, you've got to look at the weird stuff too. You've got

531
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,680
 to look at stories about robotic flowers walking around on an intergalactic quest to destroy

532
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,680
 a building, and then they just forget it. "No, never mind. We're just going to leave."

533
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,680
 Because that's part of the phenomenon as well. It's a fascinating story and we can't ignore

534
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:42,680
 it. As weird as it is, it is part of the phenomenon. It's just a reminder of how weird the world

535
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,680
 can actually be and its stories like this that just remind me of all the unknown stuff

536
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:56,680
 still out there. All the obscure stories out there so we can continue to discover the world

537
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,680
 of the weird. And let's do it together. Lawn, wishing you the best. Everyone out there.

538
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,680
