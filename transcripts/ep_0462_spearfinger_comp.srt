1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 It's a race against time!

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,800
 Can the FBI stop a madman before he strikes again?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,800
 And then we travel to Tennessee and go way back in time to when the Cherokee Nation ruled the land.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:22,800
 Everything was going quite well until a creature came down the mountain today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,400
 [Music]

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,040
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Hey guys, big news.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,160
 You know, the Patreon supporters, you guys have been awesome. You guys have been supporting me

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,720
 for a long time and I really haven't had any awards or rewards, I guess would be the right

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,120
 term for that. That changes Tuesday. That changes next Tuesday. I got stickers for you guys. Now,

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,880
 I took an entire month of my Patreon donations and turned it into stickers. I need your guys's

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,280
 addresses. I need Patreon supporters. I need your addresses. Now, I'm not going to reveal what these

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,920
 stickers look like. These stickers though are really, really cool. They're really, really cool. I want

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,560
 people to just get them in the mail. A little handwritten note by me. There you go. Thank you for

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,120
 your support. Now, right before I put in the order and put the announcement on Patreon about the

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,040
 stickers, I did have a Patreon supporter. Leave the show. Leave the Patreon. You know who you are.

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
 I'm not going to put you on blast. You still get a sticker. You totally still get a sticker.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,520
 I sent you a message. You know how to get ahold of me. Email me. Give you your address. You

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,680
 missed it by a day. I'm not, you've been supporting the show for a long time, so I'm not going to

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,080
 keep the sticker from you. I'm not hyping these stickers up, dude. These stickers are dope and

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,560
 they're an exclusive. You're not going to sell these in the store. These are an exclusive sticker.

22
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
 So, if you're interested in joining the Patreon, now's a good time. Actually, if I get a bunch of

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
 people joining, I'll have more to send out and I'll probably have to buy more. But I just wanted to

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,120
 give a show of gratitude for the people who have been supporting the show and kind of transitioning

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:12,000
 into that. I want to thank today's supporter of the show, Smashers25. Smashers25. Smashers actually

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
 does some of the artwork for the show. Does the Dead Rabbit expose logo. So,

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,480
 Smashers, we're going to make sure that we take care of you. She's been doing stuff on the back

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,200
 end of the show as well, so it's very, very helpful. And Smashers, right now we're going to give you

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,840
 the keys to the carpenter copter. We're going to drop them in your hand. Smashers, a.k.a. Ashley,

30
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,080
 it's actually, you see, you can call you Ashley, Resty, what's up. As the keys are falling into

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,560
 her hand, her name changes. Ding! Let's hop in that carpenter copter. We are headed out to

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,760
 Richland, Virginia. So, we got Ashley flying the carpenter copter. Flying over. It's June 3rd, 2020.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,640
 So, incredibly recent story. This just happened. You guys know how calendars work a couple days ago.

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,800
 We're flying. We see the Clinch Valley Medical Center. The helicopter is landing on the roof of

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,280
 the hospital. We're walking through the hospital and there's this dude who just walked in as well.

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,280
 His name is Cole Carini. He's 23 years old and he's like, "Ahh! I'm having a terrible day, guys!"

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,520
 And the doctor's like, "Well, that's kind of a weird way to introduce yourself." And then

38
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,760
 Cole holds up his arms. One hand is completely gone and the other hand's missing a bunch of fingers

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,880
 and he has shrapnel all up in his neck. And he's like, "Ahh! I can guarantee my day is worse than

40
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,480
 anyone else is at this hospital right now." And the doctor's like, "I'm not taking that, but..."

41
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,680
 Now, a couple hours later, "Bring, bring, bring, bring!" Federal Bureau of Investigation,

42
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,880
 Virginia office dude, and they're like, "Hello, Virginia office. Send out your best agent. Send him

43
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,200
 to the Clinch Valley Medical Center." And the guy goes, "Okay, that's what we do. Click." And then

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,240
 goes, "You're our best agent." And he points to Special Agent Neil Schmeich. Schmic? Neil Schmic.

45
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,800
 I don't really want to make fun of this guy or get his name wrong. He is a special agent of the FBI.

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,680
 This guy, when you look at his pedigree, he's fought drug cartels in Laredo, Texas. Then he went to

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
 Orange County and specialized in investigating crimes against children, homegrown terrorist,

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,160
 extremist groups. He also has this little quote in his affidavit that he fills out later on,

49
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
 "I have been deployed overseas for the FBI to investigate international terrorism in both

50
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,720
 the Philippines and Jordan." This guy has a pretty good record, right? Now, to be fair,

51
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,160
 I don't know if he solved any of that stuff. He may have just went over there and been like,

52
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,960
 "Yeah, I'm sure there's terrorists somewhere. He's drinking amitite. They're like, 'Neil!

53
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,400
 You're supposed to investigate this stuff. You're not supposed to go over and just tell us that.

54
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,720
 Oh, yeah, I'm sure there's drugs in Laredo, Texas. Neil, we know that." I'm going to assume

55
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,040
 he solved these cases because he seems to be pretty savvy. He goes out to the Clinch Valley

56
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,160
 Medical Center and he walks in and Cole Carini is sitting there. He's like, "Oh, my hands

57
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,600
 totally suck, bro. They're all messed up." Special Agent Neil sits down and he's like,

58
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,720
 "So what happened? What happened here?" Cole goes, "Makes a little flashback noise and everything

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:23,600
 gets blurry." It's a couple hours ago. Now, Cole is mowing his lawn. This is a very quiet lawnmower.

60
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:33,360
 And then the lawnmower flipped over. Whoa! And now it's laying on the ground, but it's face up.

61
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
 And he's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!" And he falls into the lawnmower.

62
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,240
 Technically, his words to Special Agent Neil and to other law enforcement was that

63
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,640
 when the lawnmower flipped over, the blades are spinning so fast it, quote, "acted like a bomb."

64
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,520
 Unquote. Now, the reason why the FBI agent is here is because Cole Carini had been arrested before

65
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,560
 for building bombs. But he's like, "No, no, no, I was lawnmowering. I was mowing a lawn is the way

66
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,440
 you humans say it." The lawnmower flipped over like I'm running goat simulator or something and

67
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,520
 hit an invisible wall and went, "Woo!" And then I fell into it. It was spinning so quickly it mimicked

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,200
 the effects of an explosive blast. That's why I have shrapnel in my neck and I'm missing a hand

69
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,320
 and fingers off another hand. So, law enforcement and Special Agent Neil go out to Cole's house.

70
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,680
 And I was reading like the affidavit, the arrest warrant, whatever the term is, the legal document

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,360
 about this. And it's, it's, it's, I love reading these sometimes because you can tell the person

72
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,400
 writing it had a lot of fun writing it. There's basically a narrative thread to this investigation.

73
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,360
 First thing, they get out of the, first thing, Special Agent Neil gets out of the car and he

74
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,800
 notices something. The grass is six inches long. Little leather sole shoes walking by as he's

75
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,680
 looking at it. Ladybugs scampering hiding from law enforcement. They're up to no good, you know,

76
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,680
 those little ladybugs. Their houses are always on fire. They're a bunch of arsonists. Notices that

77
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,040
 the lawn, first off, I would notice there's not a blood-soaked lawnmower. That'd be the number one

78
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,160
 thing, right? But anyways, the lawn is not mowed. So he's like, hmm, suspicious. Very, very suspicious.

79
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,080
 At this point, he really knows what happened. He's just trying. He has to do his job.

80
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,000
 He notices there's blood leading up to the car door and there's blood on the car door. Now,

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,520
 what I would assume, again, Basil, the great mouse detective, could figure this one out,

82
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,320
 was that this dude blew his hands off. I'm sorry, chopped his hands off in a lawnmower that acted

83
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,560
 like a bomb. And then he was trying to paw at his car door to get inside. And then I guess he

84
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,040
 probably realized, well, I only have two fingers across two hands. Even if I got inside, I'm not

85
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,600
 going to be able to drive. I'm assuming he called 911 or a neighbor took him to the hospital, but

86
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,760
 it doesn't sound like his neighbors were too fond of him. But anyway, so there's blood on his car

87
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,800
 as he's trying to get in. Then they follow the blood and they're like, hmm, looking around. They

88
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,480
 see it like dripping up the stairs, like drops up the stairs. He's basically, especially Agent Neil,

89
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,240
 went from being like in an episode of 24 to now investigating an Edgar Allen Poe story. He's like,

90
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,440
 hmm, very suspicious. Where's the gorilla now? He's looking at blood and stuff. He's like going

91
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,520
 up the stairs. So he gets to Cole's bedroom and here we get this great quote. Talk about Edgar

92
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,680
 Allen Poe. This might be a little more HP Lovecraft, honestly. Quote, at the bedroom door on the floor

93
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:42,000
 was a flesh colored substance that, based on my experience, looked like a piece of human skin.

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,120
 He didn't put the laugh in there, but he really should have because he could have just said,

95
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,000
 I walked up to dude's room. There's obviously a human flesh hanging off of his doorknob.

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,760
 But flesh colored substance, based on my experience, looks like human flesh. I'm sure he's seen a lot

97
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,240
 of grizzly things. I'm sure he's like, could smell it before he even got in there. He walks into the

98
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,400
 bedroom. There's bomb parts everywhere, like the PVC pipe. Dude's not a plumber. This isn't

99
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,040
 circumstantial PVC pipe, bunch of nails. You're like, Hey, I have those. Your neighbors aren't

100
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,400
 complaining about explosions happening in your shed all day long. When the feds are actually

101
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,960
 investigating, like talking to neighbors, they're like, Yeah, we kept hearing like popping in his

102
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,320
 shed out in the backyard because they went there as well. And then they got a warrant for there.

103
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,720
 And they found even more bomb making stuff. But we just thought he was shooting a gun in the shed.

104
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,600
 And I'm like, where, what neighborhoods is this guy living? That you can just, I mean, I listen,

105
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,720
 dude, I live in a pretty rural area up here. You have farm community, people are shooting off guns.

106
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,160
 You can go up in the woods shooting off guns. It's kind of rural community. I don't know where

107
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,760
 this dude lived. But first off, I would be very suspicious of anyone who was shooting in a shed.

108
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,240
 Because what target could you possibly not hit? That's only like two yards away from you. But

109
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,800
 anyways, their hand is pop, pop, pop. They think, Oh, that's just, that's just harmless coal who's

110
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,680
 been arrested several times for explosions. Let's just be shooting a gun. That's far less

111
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,960
 suspicious. Shooting a gun indoors is far less suspicious than a someone who's been arrested

112
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,240
 for building bombs and there's explosions coming from his house. It'll like cartoon smoke clouds

113
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,120
 shooting out the windows. So when they're in his room, though, they find a crumpled, they're back

114
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,520
 in his room now narrative wise, they find a crumpled up letter. And it was like, he was walking

115
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,440
 through the mall. This is one of those things where I wish I had the whole letter because we

116
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,880
 only have these fragments. I guess some of it's like covered in blood, which actually makes it

117
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,080
 kind of cooler. But anyways, the letter goes like this. This is what it said. Like you can read

118
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,920
 quotes from it. I'm going to paraphrase it a bit, but he was walking through the mall. Nobody knew

119
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,800
 how dangerous he was when they when they looked at his frail body. They didn't know the man,

120
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:58,480
 the monster that he really was inside. Yes, he was a three days grace song turned mortal

121
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,680
 and nobody could stop him now. Now they will pay. That's pretty much the gist of the letter. He

122
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,920
 makes a mention to Elliot Rogers and he says something that I'm sure sent chills down the

123
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,640
 FBI agent's spine. It probably sent chills throughout all of law enforcement. Definitely

124
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,400
 infuriated me. In this letter, he describes what his target is. In the letter, he's walking. He's

125
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,840
 talking about how awesome he is and he's walking through the mall with a bomb in his jacket. And

126
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:32,960
 he's headed towards his target. His target is quote, "hot cheerleaders." Shame on you, Cole.

127
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,520
 Shame on you. Do you know there's only 5,300 universities and colleges within the United

128
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,000
 States and we can average there's about 25 cheerleaders per college. That means at any given

129
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,200
 time. Yes, I did the math. There is only 132,500 active cheerleaders and you want to blow them up.

130
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,480
 How dare you? How dare you, sir? Neil reads that, throws the note on the ground. They're like,

131
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,760
 "That's evidence." And Neil turns around, tear streaming from his face. He wanted to kill cheerleaders.

132
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,720
 There was just everyone in the house is silent. The cat stops meowing. That's inhuman, Cole.

133
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:18,240
 And Cole is now facing real federal charges for building a bomb, for having a bomb blow up. I

134
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,400
 think there was two different charges and his hand's gone. Like he's missing one hand, the other

135
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,120
 hand he has a couple fingers. Honestly, like he's definitely going to do some time. The evidence

136
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,120
 is his missing hands. He still won't admit to it. He still says, "No, no, no, your honor. The lawnmower

137
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,120
 flipped over." You know how lawnmowers do? They just turn over and they act, quote, like a bomb.

138
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,120
 Anyway, still probably do like, I don't know, I'm going to assume 10 years. But the fact that he's

139
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,960
 missing a hand and a bunch of fingers means his sentence is going to last a lot longer than that.

140
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,000
 Cole, I wish you the best. I hope that your head gets right and maybe you get some robot hands

141
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,960
 or something like that. In the end, he didn't hurt anyone but himself. Like I'm glad, I wish that

142
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,800
 didn't even happen, right? I hope that he just was building a bomb and he looks in the mirror and

143
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,120
 goes, "Well, this is a stupid hobby and I'm not going to hurt people." And then just kind of pushes

144
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,520
 his side and goes up and plays Nintendo Switch. Moral of the story is don't attack cheerleaders,

145
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,840
 don't build bombs, and if you are going to try doing either of those two things, make sure you

146
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,920
 don't do it within Special Agent Neil Shemecky's jurisdiction because he will come after you.

147
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,880
 How do they put cuffs on? How do they put cuffs on this guy? He's like, "Aha! I've snuck out again."

148
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,680
 They're like, "Cole!" And then a little Looney Tunes logo goes, "Dun dun dun dun dun dun."

149
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,080
 And then that's the end of that segment. I had no other way to end that. Maybe I'll come up with a

150
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,920
 hand pun later. Anyways, not going to worry about it. Ashley's just in there tapping her fingers on

151
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,000
 the control panel of the carbon helicopter. Can we leave now? There's a bunch of helicopters

152
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,800
 trying to drop off lifelike people. Can we just leave because you're sitting there thinking of

153
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,240
 stupid hand puns? And I go, "Yes, we can leave." So Ashley is fire up that carbon helicopter again.

154
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,760
 We are headed out to Tennessee. Now this was a story I completely stumbled across. I don't even

155
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
 know what I was looking up. I have no idea what I was looking up when I came across this. We're

156
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,400
 flying out to eastern Tennessee, technically it's eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina. Obviously

157
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,120
 like as the United States was formed, the government was drawing state lines. But we're going farther

158
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,360
 back before the United States even existed. We're going back to a time where we don't really even

159
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,680
 have a time period it's taking place. This is just during the time when the Native Americans

160
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,720
 ruled the country and this particular portion of the country was ruled by the Cherokee Nation.

161
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,480
 Nowadays it's the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. At the Great Smoky Mountain National Park,

162
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,720
 there's a Chilliwee Mountain. So Ashley, let's bring the helicopter nice and low.

163
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,560
 It's now old timey America. We get out, we're walking around. Now we are sitting, we're hiding

164
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,920
 in the bushes, because that's what we have to do because apparently we're just a bunch of weirdos.

165
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,720
 We're sitting in the bushes. We see a tribe of Native Americans running around and the little

166
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,640
 kids are like, "Mama, mama, mama." Apparently they're Italian as well. "Mama mia, tell me about the

167
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,800
 story. Tell me about the story." And the mom's like, "Now you little young ones, I'll tell you the story

168
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,640
 one more time and I'll tell it very loudly in case anyone in the bushes is listening."

169
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,560
 So the mom starts telling the story long, long time ago. Now we're even further back in time,

170
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,680
 right? And this is the story. I don't know why I had that narrative device, but here's the story.

171
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,240
 The Cherokee warriors started to hear whispers throughout their nation that there was a creature

172
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,640
 hunting them. Now this was a group of hunters, of warriors, but now something out there was

173
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,800
 taking them out one by one. But it wasn't just that this thing was killing warriors. It was killing

174
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,800
 women. It was killing children. And you couldn't stop it. It was like a plague. That's the way

175
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,480
 they described it. It was like a plague. But they knew it was a person. They named it,

176
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,120
 I'm gonna butcher this, but they named it "Nun-Yuni," which means "stone dress,"

177
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,400
 which would translate to "skin of stone." Because the warriors who did interact with this thing

178
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,720
 realized something very quickly. You couldn't kill it. Any sort of arrow, club, spear, whatever you

179
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,040
 had just shattered when it impacted this creature. But that wasn't its only trick up at sleep. It

180
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,120
 would appear as an old woman. And of course, you need to value your elders in that culture.

181
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,240
 So you see an old woman walking through the middle of the forest. It's weird, right? You're two days

182
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,360
 outside of the village, but you see an old woman walking through. That will make you hesitate.

183
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
 That will make you not try to take that kill shot right away. She would always walk

184
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,160
 with her right hand kind of hidden in a shawl. But sometimes when the warriors would interact with

185
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,800
 this thing, they'd see what was really there. It was a normal hand, a closed fist, and the forefinger

186
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:11,200
 was a blade as black and sharp as obsidian. She would lunge at you. Hunter would have run away.

187
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,280
 Go back to tell people you gotta watch out there's something in the woods. Her name wasn't just

188
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,240
 stone dress. She also went by another name, utlanta, which meant spearfinger. And really,

189
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,560
 both names combined show how powerful and feared this creature was. Old woman, impenetrable, can't be

190
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,040
 defeated, and had a weapon that's hidden and would just go right into you. Now, the reason why they

191
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,040
 describe this as a plague was that, okay, you're like, there's an old woman walking around in the

192
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,960
 woods. Who cares? Don't go under the woods and if you see an old woman walk the other way.

193
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,000
 You might be walking away from an actual old woman who needs your help, but chances are not.

194
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,520
 Well, she was a shapeshifter. Not only was she a shapeshifter, she could assume the shape of somebody

195
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,280
 you loved. They said she would appear as your grandmother or your favorite aunt. That's fine,

196
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,320
 Jason. I hate aunts. I only like uncles. And I'm not particularly fond of my grandmother anyways.

197
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,720
 If I saw her in the woods, I'd just walk away. Those were her favorite forms, but she could be

198
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,160
 anybody. This was a master shapeshifter. To the point that the pe- this went on for so long that

199
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,200
 the people of the Cherokee Nation in this area were so paranoid of running into spearfinger,

200
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,400
 that if you left the tribe by yourself for any amount of time and you came back, they thought

201
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,480
 you were her. Hey, I'm gonna go pick some strawberries. Okay, hey, bring Billy with you.

202
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,920
 Yeah, sure, Billy. Come on. And Billy's sitting there playing Nintendo Switch. What? I didn't

203
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,320
 even know that was invented yet. Okay. Then you walk off, you get strawberries. You come back.

204
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,840
 Everyone in the tribe is their arms crossed. Billy's like, "I told him not to go out. I was

205
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,320
 gonna join him." I said, "You know what? I was just picking up strawberries and they would thank

206
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,160
 you or spearfinger." Now you would go, "Why don't you just hold your hands up and be like,

207
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,240
 'I'm not her. Look it. I don't have a spearfinger.'" Her number one thing. Yeah, but still, being

208
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,080
 under suspicion of a monster for even a couple minutes is rough. And I'm sure there are people

209
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,840
 who also said, "Well, maybe she hit her hand as well." That seemed to be a limit of her power.

210
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,880
 She couldn't actually shape shift her hand. People were super paranoid of this thing. So,

211
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,920
 Yurga Jason, why was this thing so threatening? I mean, the fact that it's impossible to kill

212
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,760
 and it has a built-in weapon. What she would do is she would stick you with her finger,

213
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,160
 stick it into you, and then you wouldn't even know what happened. You would feel no pain whatsoever.

214
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,640
 But a couple days later, you'd die. You'd get yellow, super gross, blah. And what would happen

215
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,760
 was after they would die, the medicine man would diagnose. I'm sure at some point they were doing

216
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,040
 an autopsy of sorts when people are just falling over dead. The liver would be gone.

217
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,160
 And people were putting two and two together. Wait a second. This guy was out by himself

218
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,440
 hunting. A couple days later, his liver's gone and there were sightings of spearfinger with blood

219
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:05,040
 on her mouth. So, the implication was that somehow she would be able to stab you, pull your liver

220
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,800
 out without you feeling any pain whatsoever, eating it, and then you die a couple days later once

221
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:17,120
 your body realizes you don't have a way of filtering out toxins. And to make things even worse,

222
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,040
 sometimes she would poke you out in the woods, you're far away from your tribe. She'll stab you,

223
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,320
 eat your liver, you die before you get home. She would then assume the shape of that warrior

224
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,560
 going to the village and feed to her heart's content. Now that type of hunting technique was

225
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,760
 done mostly before people knew to look out for spearfinger. Because again, they're like, "Hey,

226
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,160
 Johnny, how was the hunt?" And he's like, "Oh, it's pretty good." And they're like, "Hey, you can put

227
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,760
 your spear back." And he's like, "I already did." And I'm like, "What's that on your finger?"

228
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,080
 "I was eating some hot fudge. That's why it's black. Why is it sharp? Stick. Eatin' liver,

229
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,440
 runnin' away." As time grew, they started to learn ways to defeat this, or not defeat it,

230
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,000
 but at least avoid it. But in the beginning, it would come to a village. If it could get into

231
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,480
 your village, it would eat as many as livers as it could. Now, the one thing we look at cryptids a

232
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,120
 lot, that I like to look at cryptids a lot, are their weaknesses. Because we always have these

233
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,560
 weird weaknesses for these things. Spearfinger had two weaknesses. One, the reason why it always

234
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,120
 kept its right hand closed, even though it had that spearfinger that not just would stab people,

235
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,000
 but could pull their liver out without them knowing, that's also where her heart was.

236
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:37,120
 It was the one part of her body that could be pierced by a blade, is her hand, her wrist area,

237
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,280
 on the right hand. Anything else is just going to bounce off of her, so she always kind of

238
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,440
 guarded that. People just assumed she was doing it to hide her weapon, but it was actually her

239
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,000
 weak spot. Her second weakness was she had an equal. This is fascinating too, because I haven't

240
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,120
 really come across this encrypted lore. She had an equal. Stone Man. Stone Man was his name,

241
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,920
 the not super original name for that guy. At least Stone Dress is kind of cool. Stone Man.

242
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,840
 Now, he was actually more powerful. He had a magic wand that he could use to control boulders,

243
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,800
 build bridges and stuff like that. But neither of them were strong enough to kill each other,

244
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,080
 and they both ate human livers. So they definitely had to watch out where they're like. They had

245
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,880
 particular hunting grounds. I'm sure over time some of the deaths of spearfinger were blamed on

246
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,800
 Stone Man. It doesn't matter when your liver's missing. You don't care who took it, but you have

247
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 basically two ultra powerful cryptids, almost demigods at this point, fighting over control of

248
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,440
 who gets to eat the most livers. But he also wasn't penetrable to weapons. And they just kind of stayed

249
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,640
 away from each other. He had a magic wand to control rocks. I left this detail out. The fact she

250
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,400
 looks human, but she has skin as strong as stone. She can also pick up boulders. She can squeeze

251
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,760
 them together morph them. At one point she made this giant stone bridge to try to get to heaven,

252
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,680
 and the gods electrocuted it, and she flies off of it. She probably just bored one Tuesday. I don't

253
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,560
 know what building a bridge to heaven has to do with hunting humans and eating their livers, but

254
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,440
 apparently that structure is still in the area. It's called like stone tree or something like that.

255
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,160
 But anyways, so it's not like she's just walking around eating livers. She has the ability to

256
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,840
 throw boulders at you. She could pretty much wipe out any tribe anytime that she wanted to.

257
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,760
 Her main way of hunting was following to where population centers were. And every autumn in

258
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,040
 this area, the Cherokees would set brush fires all up and down, and it would make all the chestnuts

259
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,400
 fall off the trees, and then they would just eat roasted chestnuts, which I always thought was kind

260
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,080
 of a meme. Apparently it's a way you can survive in the wild. And she would see these fires from

261
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,160
 far off, and she would just continue her walk. Her "it follows" walk. Walk slowly, slowly, slowly,

262
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,600
 as long as it takes. There's no other transportation really back then. And eventually she's in the

263
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,120
 smoke, you're in the smoke, you're picking up chestnuts, and then three days later you go home and

264
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,400
 your liver's missing. Like you wouldn't even see her coming in that circumstance. Or she goes home

265
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,960
 and she's you, and then you show up later and they think you're her. And she was just a master of

266
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,880
 deception. Now, eventually, a bunch of different tribes of the Cherokee Nation got together and

267
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,520
 they go, "We have to take care of this thing. This thing is just decimating us." So they got this

268
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,000
 medicine man and he goes, "Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We know a little bit about her. One,

269
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,480
 we know she's a shapeshifter. Two, we know to stay away from her. She's impenetrable. The only thing

270
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,200
 we can do is hope to catch her and get lucky." Which is a bad strategy when the general's like,

271
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,440
 "Well, we're just gonna put a bunch of troops in this area. I don't know. Maybe the other guys

272
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,240
 were all like fall of a cliff or something like that. I don't know. Maybe we'll get lucky."

273
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,360
 But anyways, that's her plan. So what they do is they build a big old pit and they set a fire.

274
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,040
 And spearfingers off the distance. Ah, yes, I see the smoke and she starts walking towards the smoke.

275
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,880
 Now, it's pretty smoky, right? She can't really see where she's going. No one can really see where

276
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,880
 they're going. And some guy sees an old lady walking through the smoke. Now, he goes, "Oh,

277
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,840
 that's my grandma. I'm not going to attack her. Hey, guys, look out. Don't shoot. Yeah,

278
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,240
 there's a grandma walking by and the medicine man goes, "What the- No, that's really her. That's not

279
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,160
 a joke. That's actually in the legend. I'm not making- I'm not ripping on a joke. This guy,

280
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,960
 even though they know this is a shapeshifter who assumes the form of grandma, and they've

281
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,560
 set this trap to end this menace that has plagued their nation for a decade at this point, or if

282
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,600
 not longer. Hey, look at grandma. Hey, we're over here. Watch out. There's a big trap. Don't worry

283
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,880
 about it. The medicine man's like, "Shut up, you numbskull. That's- That's who we're hunting." And

284
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,800
 the guy's like, "Oh." So they start shooting arrows at her and of course they're bouncing off

285
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,280
 of her, but in the smoke and all of the chaos, she falls into the pit. It's full of spikes.

286
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,760
 Oh wait a second. These don't hurt me. She's just pushing the spikes over.

287
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,440
 Now she's yelling at them. Now she would sing a song about how much she loved to eat livers.

288
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,640
 That was like her hot- That was the only reason she existed. Like, I like eating food,

289
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,040
 but I don't sing songs about "Mmm, mm, mm, gonna eat a hamburger." But she's taunting them basically

290
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,960
 at this point. Stone Man also had his own song about livers. It's just some weird- It wasn't a

291
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,560
 lot of music back then. No VH1. She's in this hole. She's shaking her fist. Not the one with the

292
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,920
 spear on it, because she's hiding that one. She's shaking her fist in the air. Singing about how

293
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,120
 much she loves eating human livers, the Cherokee are up there and they're like, "Uh, this isn't

294
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,840
 gonna end well." Because she's immortal. She's in a pit. I mean, like, what are we gonna do? We can't

295
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,760
 make concrete. What's concrete? He's like, "I don't know. I don't even know why he said that. I don't

296
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,320
 know why. I don't know how we're gonna keep her in there." Now at that time, a little birdie,

297
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,000
 comes flying down from heaven, sent by the divine beings. It's a little titmouse.

298
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:56,960
 And it lands on a warrior spear and begins to say "Tip, tip, tip, tip, tip," which in Cherokee,

299
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,120
 that's not the actual translation, but it was making this noise that in Cherokee sounds like

300
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,040
 "heart, heart, heart." I think it was like "oon" or something like that. "Oom, oom, oom." That makes

301
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,760
 more sense. And the medicine man goes, "The weakness must be the heart." So they're like,

302
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,560
 "Concentrate all fire on her chest." So they're like, throwing spears down, shooting arrows,

303
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,560
 and the spearfinger's like, "Ha, ha, ha, nothing will defeat me," and she's hiding her hand. Now

304
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:28,080
 they take it as the titmouse, which is a bird, not a mouse, or a boob, was lying to them. So they

305
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,600
 get mad and one of the warriors takes the titmouse and cuts its tongue out, and it flies back to

306
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,080
 heaven. So that's the reason, if you ever wondered, if you're ever a bird watcher and you wondered,

307
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,920
 why does a titmouse have such a small tongue? It's because it was cut off for lying.

308
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,720
 Which when I read that part, I go, "That's kind of messed up because we know the weakness is the

309
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,480
 heart." They just don't know where the heart's at. So they're continuing to sit there and they're

310
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,560
 like, "Man, I probably should have just eaten that titmouse. I'm so hungry. How long are we

311
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,720
 gonna have to sit out here for?" "Well, you can eat its tongue. I'm, I was okay, but I'm still kind

312
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,440
 of hungry." Starts singing a song about titmouse tongue. Another bird comes flying down from heaven.

313
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
 [Sings a tune]

314
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,720
 And this one flies into the hole and lands on spearfinger's right hand.

315
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:20,080
 So the medicine man goes, "Oh, so sorry, titmouse. I think we only got half the message. Hey guys,

316
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,960
 come here." And they huddle together and they go, "I bet you that that bird on that right hand, at this

317
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,200
 point I imagine spearfinger's trying to shake it off and it's like perched on her finger."

318
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,280
 Like, "Get off, get off, get off. I bet you the heart that the titmouse is warning us about

319
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,200
 is in the hand. So concentrate all fire on the right wrist." And warriors go, "That's a good idea.

320
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,040
 That's a good idea. I'm just getting real hungry for some more delicious titmouse." So they get their

321
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,120
 arrows ready and they just launch a volley in and it actually goes into her wrist and severs her

322
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,080
 heart from her body. She falls dead almost immediately. Just "Wooah!" No more livers for

323
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,480
 spearfinger. And the warriors are like, "Yes, dude, totally awesome." Jumping up, they invented the

324
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,560
 high five at that moment. They invented the freeze frame. They jump up high five, freeze frame.

325
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:12,160
 Later on, they're at the village and they're like having this huge party. Someone's patenting the

326
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,160
 high five. He's like, "I'm going to make millions." They're having this huge party. Now they took

327
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,920
 spearfinger's hand, they chopped it off, and they mounted it outside of the village as a trophy

328
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,600
 and it's a warning because they all know Stone Man is still out there. But for now,

329
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:35,920
 they've defeated an otherwise impossible foe. And Stone Man walks by that village and he sees that

330
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,520
 hand perched up. It's like making the number one sign. We're number one tribe in Tennessee and

331
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:48,240
 North Carolina is what's written on it. And Stone Man just looks at that hand and it's dark and the

332
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,760
 fire's crackling in the distance. All the people are having this huge party. This hand is just perched.

333
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:02,400
 And Stone Man looks at that hand and he smiles because, see, they figured out her weakness. No

334
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:08,800
 one could figure out Stone Man's weakness. Stone Man now had no adversaries in the area. He could

335
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:16,320
 eat as many livers as he wants. Or so he thinks. And as Stone Man walks away into the darkness,

336
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:25,040
 humming a jaunty tune about eating human livers, will he be defeated? Or will his reign of terror

337
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:34,640
