1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
 Two men driving to work one morning witness a terrifying and impossible creature.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,800
 And then we travel to Boston to meet a young man who has repressed memories.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,880
 He's blocked out entire portions of his childhood because it was too painful to even comprehend.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,960
 But when a wave of terrible memories comes crashing over him, he realizes that he's

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,320
 only one thing to do. Become a killer. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:49,040
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,120
 Gardner and I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,640
 you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world. We got a bunch of stuff to cover

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,080
 so we're gonna get started right away. First off walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,960
 of our legacy patreons. Everyone get on your feet and give a good round of applause for

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:15,760
 TK. Woohoo yeah! Woohoo yeah! TK! Woohoo yeah! Come on in to Dead Rabbit Command. TK is actually

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,120
 not his real name. His name I don't know what it was. It was probably something inappropriate

13
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,160
 because Patreon just has him listed as invalid ID. But TK that's the first two letters of

14
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,960
 your email address so I hope that you know that I'm talking to you and not trying to

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,760
 talk to you. But I want to make sure you get credit because you've been a long time Patreon

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,320
 supporter. TK you're gonna be the captain, the pilot of this episode. You guys can't

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,760
 support the Patreon. I totally understand. It really do just helps spread the word about

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,560
 Dead Rabbit Radio. That helps out so much. It really does. TK let's go ahead and toss

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,320
 you the keys to the dead rabbit dune buggy. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:05,320
 Drive us all the way out to Mexico. Beep beep beep beep beep. Driving out all the way down

21
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:13,960
 south to Mexico. Specifically we're headed to Chiapas, Mexico. We're in the late 1990s

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,200
 and as TK is driving us down there we see another car driving through the area. This

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,560
 car is being driven by a man we're gonna call him Charlie. He didn't give his name online.

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,200
 Charlie and his co-worker were carpooling to work this day. Early in the morning it's

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 dawn really. This one's just coming up and they're like "Hey let's get to work." He described

26
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,440
 this area. He goes, "The area we were driving through of Chiapas was a suburban area so

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,560
 it would be like a couple houses, a building and then an undeveloped field and then a couple

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,080
 more houses, a couple more houses, building, building, undeveloped field." You know just

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,840
 kind of like a standard suburban area that's still starting to grow. And Charlie says

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:06,080
 as we're driving past this grassy field we see in the field this huge black dog and it's

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,640
 running towards them. And he specifically said it was tall. It's not that it was like

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,040
 a big bulky load of the ground dog. It was a really, really tall dog. It's running across

33
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,480
 the field and when Charlie and the co-worker are looking at the dog, the dog is looking

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,520
 at them now and it slows down. It's walking towards them now. It's still moving towards

35
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,480
 this car that's driving by. And I'm assuming that Charlie, that they're actually slowing

36
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,560
 down as well because it's such an odd sight and they actually get a really good look at

37
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,200
 this. I don't think they were flying by at 60 miles an hour. Charlie says me and my co-worker

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,120
 were watching this dog, this really abnormally tall dog walk, first run and then walk towards

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,880
 us and he said when you get a good look at the dog, it's not just that it was tall. The

40
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:09,800
 dog had two faces and he described it as one half of the face was a dog's face, which is

41
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:21,200
 what you would expect on a dog, but the other half of the face was a man's face. He says

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,280
 he's looking at this dog across this field, half of its face is that of a man. He said

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:35,840
 it was a Hispanic man and the face had really sharp features. He goes both me and my co-worker

44
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,040
 saw it. We both saw this. It's impossible, right? You can picture it in your head as

45
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
 like maybe like a cartoon or a drawing, but once you kind of start to think of, because

46
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,000
 the dog head is so much longer than a human's head, there would be a lot of deformity. I

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,320
 guess having a human face on a dog is a deformity, but you know what I mean? Like the snout

48
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,240
 comes out. I don't think then it was like a clean cut and then you have, or did the

49
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,960
 human face, did the nose turn into the snout? Was it a big human face? Was the human face

50
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,520
 is like, I guess I'm really focusing on the minor details. The point is this dog had a

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,240
 human face. Maybe it was a normal human-sized face. Maybe the face was all distorted to

52
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,120
 look like a dog, but be a human face, you know what I mean? That's not how I picture

53
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,920
 it. I picture it like it's like when Prince dressed up as Batman and Joker, like he has

54
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,600
 a line down his face and when he, that's what I imagine. Like if you saw the dog from one

55
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,800
 angle, you would see the snout. It would look like a normal dog, but then when it turned,

56
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,280
 when it turned towards you and went bat dance, you would see that it had a human, like a

57
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:54,280
 totally normal human face. So it's not like his jaw was all morphed out into the, like

58
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,760
 the morphine and snoop-tongue dogs video. I don't, I think it was just a normal human

59
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,920
 face on the, like the right side is how I imagine it too. I don't know why I have the

60
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,160
 detail in my head, but the human face is on the right side and it looks normal and the

61
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,560
 snout is all just like protruding, but it's not part of the human mouth. Does that make

62
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,080
 sense? You're like Jason, it kind of made sense the first time he said it. Now I'm super

63
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,320
 confused. Hey, when did Prince ever sing about Batman? You're like Googling that, you're

64
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,840
 like whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Is Jason having some sort of weird fit or did Prince

65
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,560
 actually dress up as Joker in the Batman? Super distracting, I know. I'm so sorry. You're

66
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:47,560
 like what? Anyways, that's what they saw and Charlie goes terrified him, obviously, right?

67
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,160
 It's so frightening. You wouldn't be like taking out your notebook, you're like let's do a

68
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,120
 little sketch. It's horrifying to see something like this and he goes even thinking about

69
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,880
 it today. Like this happened back in the 1990s. He goes even thinking about it nowadays, brings

70
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,480
 tears to my eyes. Scared tears. He wasn't like oh those, those dawn memories with my

71
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:18,120
 buddy. No, it was like it terrifies him. It's an interesting story. It was posted online

72
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,520
 by a guy going or I call him Charlie, but he goes by the name the Mystic Mind. It's an

73
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,640
 interesting story. I think this is one of the stories that honestly could be a werewolf.

74
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,000
 That's what a lot of people are saying online that he caught a werewolf mid-transformation.

75
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 That would check as far as the time, right, dawn happening and then I read that book breaking

76
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,280
 dawn and had a bunch of werewolves in it. You have the possibility it's a werewolf. It's

77
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,480
 possible that it's an unknown cryptid. It's some sort of beast. It's possible that it's

78
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,840
 a cursed man. I mean it's different than a werewolf. A man like cursed to walk the,

79
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,080
 yes, it's definitely a werewolf, but you guys know how much I hate people being forced to

80
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,920
 turn into things against their will. It could be a man being like all like freaking out and

81
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,700
 stuff like that. This is interesting too because it could actually be one of the more stories

82
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,560
 that we could give a plausible answer to. It could have been a dog with mange, right?

83
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,560
 It could have been a dog that was suffering some sort of like fur loss, but then again

84
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,960
 like he clearly recognized it as a human's face, not just the dog that had lost some

85
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,880
 hair. And they both saw it. It's interesting. It's also interesting to note that years ago

86
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,840
 it still stands as one of my favorite episodes. We had another encounter in Mexico. I'll

87
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,880
 put it in the show notes. I'm not going to give the ending away of the episode, but those

88
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,880
 of you know what I'm talking about. We had another encounter in Mexico. I think that's

89
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,040
 all I can say without giving it away. I'll put it in the show notes. Very, very fascinating

90
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,320
 story though. Like that's the time you don't expect to see anything spooky. You're driving

91
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,840
 to work. It's the morning and you see something that was so terrifying, so impossible that

92
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:07,080
 even thinking about it to this day brings tears to your eyes. You're not supposed to

93
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,320
 see stuff like that in the middle of a suburbs in the morning on your way to work. That's

94
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,520
 supposed to be the very least stories and fairy tales and the very most haunting the

95
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:30,120
 darkness outside of town. But here this creature was walking around as the sun rose. TK, let's

96
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,320
 go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are leaving behind Mexico. Fly

97
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:47,160
 us all the way out to Boston, Massachusetts. I want to give a shout out. I got, I had never

98
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,560
 heard of this story before. I got most of the information and I found out about this

99
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,400
 story reading an article on morbidology. They do a lot of true crime stuff on there. It

100
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:05,360
 was written by Emily Thompson. Let's go back to May 2011. We're going to be hanging out

101
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:13,400
 on Saratoga Street. We're about to meet a young teenager named Marco Tulio Flores. He's

102
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,480
 17 years old and he's over the house of a very close family friend in a very tight knit

103
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:30,300
 community. This friend's name is Jamie Galdamez. He's 31 years old. Now pretty much everyone

104
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,080
 in this community, this is in East Boston. They're immigrants from El Salvador. And so

105
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,560
 generally that happens. You have people kind of move up together and you're like, hey,

106
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,120
 let's go to this area. I know a cousin who's living there and then they move in there and

107
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,600
 then more people come up from another country and they're like, hey, let's go here. You

108
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,240
 know, my brother lived out here and you see everything's going really good. We got, that's

109
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,280
 how we have like Chinatown and Little Russia and all these ethnic groups, which would make

110
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,520
 sense, right? You're not going to be like, hello, Ohio and you're just walking around

111
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,000
 in the middle of a farm. You're like, yeah, I just got here from Bulgaria. Anyone know

112
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,640
 of a good Bulgarian joint to grab a meal at? Well, anyways, Marco is over at Jamie's house.

113
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,120
 I think they were having like a gathering or something like that. I don't think he

114
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,680
 was over uninvited, but Marco's over at Jamie's house, longtime family friend, upstanding member

115
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:29,680
 of this community. Marco sees a photograph and it's a photograph of Jamie and Marco's

116
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:38,840
 six year old nephew. Now again, this is a very close community. They have a lot of bonds

117
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,120
 together. So it's not unusual. It wouldn't be unusual to have a picture of two unrelated

118
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:52,320
 people because they're all brothers. But when Marco sees this photograph of Jamie standing

119
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:06,000
 next to Marco's six year old nephew, it's like a damn burst. Within a second, years

120
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 and years of traumatic memories begin to overcome Marco. He had repressed so much for so long.

121
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:29,440
 He had forgotten. He had completely buried what Jamie had done to him, but he remembers

122
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:39,120
 it now. When Marco was a little boy running around Saratoga Street, everyone knew him.

123
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,360
 Good little Marco, great kid, gets in trouble every once in a while. But you know, what

124
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:55,320
 boy doesn't? And he had very positive interactions with Jamie. But when Marco turned nine, Jamie's

125
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:04,280
 attitude towards Marco changed. The relationship seemed to change. Marco couldn't really place

126
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,640
 it at first. You know, he doesn't know. He just realizes that Jamie's acting differently

127
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,040
 around him. This adult who'd previously just been a guy that he, you know, big family gatherings

128
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:26,120
 hang out, he knew him. Now it's different. He's treating me differently. Didn't know

129
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,480
 what it was. What it was was grooming. But you know, a child doesn't know that term.

130
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,920
 He didn't realize what was going on. He didn't understand the predatory nature that Jamie

131
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,160
 now had for this young boy when he turned nine, right? When he turned to what Jamie

132
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,440
 was attracted to because Jamie was obviously a big ol' pervert. And that's where this story

133
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:57,800
 is headed. He began molesting Marco after he turned nine. And it lasted until Marco hit

134
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:11,400
 puberty. So three, four, five years, this went on. And once Marco hit puberty, Jamie just

135
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:22,640
 went back to being a friend of the family. Everything went back to normal. And Marco

136
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,480
 had to internalize that in some way. Had to figure out he must have done something wrong,

137
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,600
 right? Because things were totally normal. And then I had three or four years of pure

138
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:43,280
 hell. And now things are normal again. And he just took all those memories and buried

139
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:53,120
 them as deep as he could. So deep he'd forgotten that it even happened. So deep that he would

140
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,920
 even find himself back over at his abuser's house because he's a friend of the family.

141
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,200
 I wouldn't even think twice about it. Why would he? Jamie never did anything to me.

142
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,240
 He buried it that deep. But when he saw that photograph, when he saw a photograph of Jamie

143
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:20,000
 and Marco's six-year-old nephew, it all came flooding back. And he knows what's going

144
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,880
 to happen to this little boy in the picture. He knows the hell that will await this child

145
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:39,480
 if he doesn't do something about it. May 22, 2011, Marco sets up a video camera and records

146
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:51,640
 himself saying, quote, "Today is the day. I'm off now. I'm going to go for a bliss walk.

147
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,440
 And then I'm going to head down there." Marco loads up the video camera and a couple

148
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:05,360
 other tools he's decided to bring along with him. And he heads over to Jamie's house.

149
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:13,160
 This 17-year-old boy, powered by rage and adrenaline, is quickly able to take down this

150
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,280
 31-year-old man. But this isn't going to be a quick kill, Marco decided. He didn't want

151
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,440
 to just take Jamie's life. He wanted to take his legacy. He ties up Jamie and then sets

152
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,560
 up the video camera. Hits record and says, "You need to confess to what you did to me."

153
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,800
 Jamie's like, "I don't know what you're talking about, dude. You broke into my house. You

154
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:45,680
 tied me up. Let me go." No, you know why I'm tying you up. You know why I have this camera

155
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,720
 going. You need to admit what you did to me. You need to tell the camera. You need to tell

156
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,320
 everyone what you did to me all those years back when I turned nine. I remember it now.

157
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,960
 I don't know what you're talking about. I have no idea what you're talking about, Marco.

158
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:05,680
 Just let me go. He denies it. He's denying it. He's denying it. Marco is pressing harder

159
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,640
 and harder and harder. I know you did this. Admit it, admit it, admit it. This goes on

160
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:16,560
 until finally, I mean, Jamie, he's a child predator. These people aren't known for their

161
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:24,360
 strength, for their fortitude. He does crack under the pressure. He does. He looks into

162
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:33,960
 the camera and he admits to it. He goes, "Yes, I did." Well, that's Marco. Did it for years.

163
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,720
 You have to wonder how much of his, now that I'm saying this out loud, you have to wonder

164
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,520
 how much of his confession he thought, "If I just say what Marco wants me to." He obviously

165
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,760
 did it, right? I'm not saying that. I do believe he did it, but I'm wondering if he thought

166
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,160
 at this point, he's a bit of a spoiler, I guess, but if he would get out of this alive,

167
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,280
 if he thought all that Marco wanted was a confession and then he was going to turn

168
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,360
 it into the police and he could go, "Listen, the guy tied me up. He broke into my house.

169
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,480
 Like, of course, I was going to admit to whatever he wanted me to." Maybe he thought

170
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:15,280
 he could still walk away from this. But when Marco pulled out a knife and pressed it to

171
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:24,480
 Jamie's throat, Jamie had to know that this was the end. Marco puts the knife to Jamie's

172
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,840
 throat and begins to drag it across, but he can't get it deep enough. It's very hard

173
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,000
 to slit a human's throat, deep enough to kill them. You're not just cutting the skin. You

174
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,320
 have to really get in there. And most people don't know that. And he's slicing Jamie's

175
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:52,480
 throat, but it's very messy and extremely painful and he's not doing it right. And Jamie is

176
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,400
 pleading for his life, but again, he realizes at this point there's no way he's going to

177
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,520
 get out of this. And I think maybe in a last gasp of some sort of humanity, because he

178
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:14,160
 is a monster, maybe he does realize that this is justice in some sense, right? He's being

179
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,320
 killed by one of the children he abused. Maybe he's probably just a big, sicko. I don't

180
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,100
 think I should give him any noble motives. But whatever the case is, he pleads with

181
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,600
 Marco not "Don't kill me, but don't slit my throat." This is, there's blood everywhere.

182
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,240
 This is extremely painful and it's kind of gross. And just kill me another way. He's

183
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,560
 begging for death at this point, but not to have his throat slit. And it's too painful,

184
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,400
 there's just too much blood. So he asks, this is where another thing about maybe there's

185
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,800
 some weird sex thing for him, but he asks, Marco, can you just strangle me instead?

186
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,080
 What's interesting when Marco is putting together his kill kit? He had the camera, he had the

187
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,160
 knife, he had the rope, he also brought along a dog chain, which is another restraint device,

188
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,760
 obviously, right? It's like a doggilish chain, but it's not something I would bring. I don't,

189
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,240
 I mean, it's so specific, right? But the dog chain comes in, this is the reason why I'm

190
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,320
 not a vigilante killer. I can't pack well. The dog chain comes in useful because he realizes

191
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,480
 that's fine, I won't slit your throat, but I will strangle you. He wraps, this is all

192
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,320
 on camera, by the way. The video camera has not been shut off. This is the police, we're

193
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,200
 able to view all this. It might be online somewhere, he tries to slint the guy's throat,

194
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:45,720
 it's not working out well. Jamie asks to be strangled and Marco then puts the dog chain

195
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:53,480
 around his neck and yanks it tight until Jamie stops moving. Marco then walks over to the

196
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:01,600
 camera, talks directly into the lens and says, "It felt good to do this. It felt good to

197
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:12,600
 do this and I did it to protect other children." He also says, "I can think so much clearer

198
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:25,320
 now." You have to imagine all this, even with the repressed memories, once he realized what

199
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,680
 he was repressing, you figure that would have just, that must have been such a psychic strain

200
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,200
 on him and then remembering what happened. This all happened in the month of May, like

201
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:42,560
 he saw this photo sometime in May and by May 22nd he's killing his abuser. He can thank

202
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:52,720
 so much clearer now. He drags Jamie onto the bed, douses him in lighter fluid and then

203
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:06,160
 leaves. Marco returns the next morning, steals Marco's computer and his television set and

204
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:15,440
 then sets the apartment on fire. I don't know why he did the spread across two days. There's

205
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,520
 really no, I don't think in his kill kid he's like camera check, rope check, knife check,

206
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,920
 dog chain, double check and he never thought, "Oh, I should probably bring a lighter. I

207
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,320
 have all this lighter fluid." I don't think it was that. I'm not exactly for sure why he

208
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,280
 did that. We'll get to why he stole the computer though. He set the apartment on fire, the

209
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,480
 body is found obviously. There's a fire in an apartment. That's the most dangerous thing

210
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,480
 he did. Like yeah, he killed this child molester, whatever, but don't set apartments on fire.

211
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,320
 That's a safety lesson from your good old pal Jason. There are other people. There are

212
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,080
 other people living there. Anyways, fire department showed up, put out the fire, the burned body

213
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:06,000
 of Jamie is found. This is one of those things that Marco could have gotten away with, but

214
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,720
 he turned himself in. 18 hours after the body is found, because at the end of the day he's

215
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,480
 a good person. He murdered this guy, but he's a good person and good people want to get

216
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:24,200
 stuff off their chest, so they will confess. Bad people confess too, but he turns himself

217
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:31,400
 in and he gives them Jamie's computer. He says, "Yeah, I killed him. He's a real disgusting

218
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,680
 guy. I have a video of me murdering him." Starts off with him confessing to these horrendous

219
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,040
 crimes, but I figured none of that might hold up in court. Well, I mean obviously this video

220
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:50,680
 of me murdering him, that'll hold up, but here's his computer. He's making all these allegations.

221
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:56,760
 The community's completely shocked this good kid murdered this good man, as far as anyone

222
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:03,640
 knew. They took his computer in and the police started doing a forensic analysis of the computer

223
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:14,040
 and they found all of these encrypted chats with other pedophiles. So Marco wasn't making

224
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,760
 it up. It wasn't some weird delusion. It wasn't like he had some psychotic break and made

225
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,920
 all these stories up. No, the guy was a pedophile. And there were these chats. I don't think

226
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,760
 they found any child porn. I don't think they found any child porn on the computer, but

227
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,160
 not like that makes him any better. He's still a pervert, but he's talking to these people

228
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:42,080
 online about how he liked boys around the age of 10 years old. He said they were easy

229
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:48,360
 and they often asked for it. It's just disgusting piece of shit type of person. And all these

230
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:53,440
 people he was talking to, they were still out there. They weren't an army of Marcos taking

231
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,640
 them out one by one. All those human debris. Hopefully they found justice by now. Again,

232
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:06,880
 the story took place back in 2011, but and so he's writing this and he says that, you

233
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,440
 know, I'm not going to repeat it. You guys remember. And then he also said that this

234
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,560
 is so creepy. This is so creepy. Whether or not you feel like vigilance. He is I'm should

235
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:28,480
 be endorsed. This is nuts. So remember what started this whole thing was Marco finding

236
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,480
 the picture of him and of Jamie and Marco's nephew, six year old nephew. Jamie said to

237
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:43,200
 some of the pedophiles online that quote, there are some good ones coming up. Unquote

238
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,560
 So he was looking at these six year old seven year old boys in the neighborhood saying,

239
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:55,960
 you know, because he doesn't like them till they're nine, 10 years old. Discuss like disgusting,

240
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:06,280
 right? There are some good good ones coming up. So Marcos nephew was 100% going to get

241
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:12,120
 molested by this dude. Like he was part of the grooming process isn't just the child,

242
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,680
 but you groom yourself with the family as well. He was he was 100. He was 10 toes into

243
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,960
 this community. People just trusted him. Everyone loved them. They also this is again, it's

244
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,040
 absolutely insane. The police when they were doing this forensic analysis on the computer,

245
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,560
 this all came up in the trial. I don't think they went to Marco's cell and been like, Hey,

246
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,720
 you did us a favor. This all came up in the trial. But apparently not only was there the

247
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,320
 comment that there are some good ones coming up, meaning there are some other kids in his

248
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:49,080
 neighborhood. He can't wait to molest. They also found that very recently, like shortly

249
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:56,120
 before him getting murdered shortly before Jamie getting murdered, Jamie uploaded a photo

250
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:04,720
 of Marco uploaded a photo of Marco himself when he was a young boy. Jamie wrote when he

251
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:14,760
 uploaded the photo, the caption read quote, he was so beautiful then. It's creepy to think

252
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:21,120
 right Marco didn't even remember any of this. And this dude was talking about him online,

253
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,880
 like reminiscing like you would over an ex girlfriend. He didn't remember Marco did

254
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,920
 not remember a single thing. This guy was posting photographs of him as a boy, absolutely

255
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:40,040
 insane. And you can understand why people did not want this dude prosecuted. People in

256
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,440
 the community were like, Listen, we know vigilante ism is wrong. Because here's the thing vigilante

257
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,040
 is this is a good example of a vigilante a bad example of vigilante is a lynch mob. Someone

258
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,400
 going that guy did something. And then people going and hanging him. That's a problem with

259
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:08,480
 vigilantes. It's we have these cases where there's evidence. But imagine if there was

260
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,840
 no computer. Imagine if there was just a video of a guy begging for his life and saying,

261
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,480
 please don't kill me. I didn't do anything to you. And then after 1050 minutes of that,

262
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,680
 he goes, fine, fine, fine, I'm less than you. Let me go. And then then him getting his throat

263
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:28,800
 slit and then strangled instead. To this day, people would go, we don't believe there would

264
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,720
 be people in that community who would not believe Marco. They'd be like he was psychotic

265
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,920
 and he killed that guy. But because we have like, he saved the computer. Right. He had

266
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,520
 that evidence. But vigilantes, you know, they can go either way, you can have good vigilantes

267
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:52,280
 and horrific vigilantes. But the people didn't want him prosecuted. They go, Listen, this

268
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:58,240
 guy was a six scumbag and he abused Marco for years and Marco grew up and got strong

269
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,560
 enough and Marco took action. He took out a pedophile who was going to pray on other

270
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:13,560
 kids. And you know, the DA, the district attorney Ian Paulumam, he basically said, we got to

271
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,440
 prosecute this guy. Like you just can't not prosecute people who break into other people's

272
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,720
 houses, premeditated murder, breaking other people's houses, set up a video camera and

273
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,360
 murder them. You just can't do that. And DAs are constantly, I know people, you know,

274
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,800
 DAs constantly are making decisions over who to prosecute. And sometimes they drop the

275
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:44,240
 ball for sure. And sometimes they may overly prosecute other people, but it's on camera.

276
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,120
 I mean, you brought in a video camera, the whole thing was recorded. He could have gone

277
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,200
 away with it. Remember, too, would they have been able to track it back to just some random

278
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:01,840
 teenager in the neighborhood? But anyways, he goes, you can't just go out and kill people.

279
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,240
 We can. We have to prosecute him. And they did. And in 2013, this was the best outcome

280
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:15,600
 possible really with the laws that we have in 2013, Marco pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter.

281
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,480
 I mean, this was premeditated murder 100% first degree. The reason why he could get

282
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,400
 voluntary manslaughter or plead down to that one is public sentiment, right? If the people

283
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,680
 wanted to hang him, if the people wanted him in prison, right? If the public opinion was

284
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,720
 against him, the DA could have pushed harder, but you're going to have a hard time finding

285
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:41,080
 a jury. And two, voluntary manslaughter would basically be like, I went crazy because all

286
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,220
 of this stuff happened. And then yes, I meant to kill him, but I was under stress because

287
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,160
 of everything that happened to me. I think voluntary manslaughter is fair. He got sentenced

288
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:59,720
 to 15 years in prison, which as long as you do not have that L after it, you will get out.

289
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,520
 If it's 15 to life, you may never, ever, ever get out. But if they give you just, it's better

290
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:13,280
 to take 20 years than 10 to life because they just, they have the option of keeping you

291
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,120
 in there until you die. 20 years, you're going to get out maximum 20 years. You keep your

292
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,800
 nose clean. You don't get caught with any drugs, contraband, killing people in prison,

293
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,440
 anything like that, right? You'll do, you'll probably do 70% of that, maybe less than the

294
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,680
 amount of crime. But 20 years is better than 10 to life because you just may never get

295
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,080
 out. Anyways, he got 15 years in prison. So, you know, it's crazy. This is what I love

296
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:43,160
 about doing a true crime podcast, right? This story happened in 2011. He'll, he'll be out

297
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,520
 max in five years. If he's kept his nose clean in prison, he'll be out in five years

298
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:56,360
 and he will be welcomed back into that community with open arms because he killed a pedophile.

299
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:04,000
 He killed a monster, a true monster. He was planning on doing this to other kids like

300
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:14,440
 you can't get any worse than that. A predator in a tight knit community doing whatever he

301
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:26,600
 wanted. No one suspected him. It was so awful what he did that not even Marco suspected

302
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:35,040
 anything because he'd blocked it all out. They never say if there were other victims

303
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:41,600
 of his in that community, but I'd be shocked if there weren't. I hope there weren't. But

304
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,160
 I'd be shocked if there weren't. But I hope there weren't like obviously I hope. It's

305
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:56,520
 a story, isn't it? A vigilante videotapes himself murdering his abuser and it's true. He did

306
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:06,440
 it to save other kids and in the end he saved other kids. It's an insane story of a kid

307
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:16,680
 who grew up and then remembered everything he forced himself to forget. But then he did

308
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:24,200
 something about it. The memories came flooding back and he did something about it. He saved

309
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:32,360
 people. He saved, who knows how many kids? Who knows how many other kids from going through

310
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:40,880
 this torment. There are some good ones coming up is what Jamie had wrote to his fellow pedophiles

311
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:48,680
 online. He couldn't wait until those boys turned 10 years old. But little did Jamie

312
00:33:48,680 --> 00:34:15,840
 know he wouldn't live to see even his next birthday.
