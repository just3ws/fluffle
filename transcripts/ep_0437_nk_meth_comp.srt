1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Is there a box that if you look into it can tell whether or not you are gay?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we take a look at the allegations that the country of North Korea is not only one of the biggest distributors of methamphetamine,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 but also one of the biggest consumers today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 We had some technical problems with the first half of this episode, so I'm doing a rerecord.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Technical problems was that it sucked.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 And as I was editing it, I realized, nah, it's no good.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 So we're doing a whole new story. You're not missing anything.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And so there may be a bit of a sound difference, or the tone of my voice may change when we move to the North Korean story.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 That's all gonna stay the same, but so I apologize for that.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 But let's go ahead and get started.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 First off, I want to give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Thank you so much for continuing to support the show, Burt Toast Ghost.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Burt Toast Ghost, a long time listener, a long time supporter of the show.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Really, really appreciate it. It means a lot.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Burt Toast Ghost, you're gonna be flying us around in this carboner copter.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Burt Toast Ghost was actually the name of a web comic he was doing for a while.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I don't know if you're still doing that, but you should be.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We should continue to do the things that we love and the things that challenge us.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 It's always a good combination.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 So, Burt Toast Ghost, the little preachy, but Burt Toast Ghost, let's fire up that carboner copter.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 First off, we are headed up to Canada.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 And as we're flying to Canada, I want to say this, because I always want to say this.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Ward of Mouth really, really helps a lot.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So we're flying over the Pacific Northwest.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Beautiful forest as far as the eye can see.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 We're flying over Canada.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And we're gonna land in a nondescript Canadian building.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Is there any other kind?

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 We're gonna land.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We're gonna walk through the parking lot.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 We're wearing snazzy little 1950s clothes.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 We all look like we're from Mad Men.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 That should take place in the 60s. I never saw.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 But anyways, we land in the parking lot of this government complex.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Hop out of the carboner copter.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Now we're all dressed like 1950s people.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So I'm wearing like this slick suit dude.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Got a little hat.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Ding!

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 It's all sharp.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It's actually metal.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I can throw it at people.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 That's a special thing.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I only have that.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 You just have a regular old hat.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 No, you have no hat.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 The sun's beaming down in your head.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 You're like, "Ugh!"

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Walking around.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I'm wearing a suit.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I got a hat.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Ding!

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And it has like a metal brim to it.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 It's kind of heavy.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Probably could have picked a different hat.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 But if I need to throw it at him.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 You're like, "Who are you gonna throw this at dude?"

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 We're walking into a government building.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I don't know.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 If I have to throw my hat at someone,

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I'd rather it be a metal hat.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I will wear a metal hat every single day

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 for the rest of my life.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Because at some point between the time I'm 43

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 and the time I die at 83,

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I may have to throw my hat at somebody.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 It's graduation.

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I'm like, "Oh no, I forgot it's flying through the air."

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 We're walking into this government building.

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Metal hat, not needed.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And there we meet a man.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 He's a psychology professor named Frank Robert Wake.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And he's like, "Ladies and gentlemen,

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I'm glad you've joined us today."

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Nice hat, by the way.

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And I'm like, "Thank you."

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Sling!

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And he goes, "I have made a device

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 that can root out one of Canada's biggest problems."

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 We look at each other,

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 we're like, "You've been able to kill the beaver?"

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 No, no.

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 The beaver menace, we will never get rid of.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 But this chair, it's just a no--

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 It looks like a dentist chair, he points at it.

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 This chair will help us determine

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 who is a homosexual.

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So we kind of look at each other and we're like,

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 "Oh, it's just kind of a chair."

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And he's like, "The chair, technically,

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 is just where you sit."

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 The chair is just the most obvious thing in the room.

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 The box!

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Sling!

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 He pulls it out, a little glimmer-like.

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 The box is really wish-to-highlighted.

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Don't focus on the chair, it's just a really clear old chair.

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Now he pulls the box out and he goes,

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 "I need a volunteer."

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And I push you forward, you're like,

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 "Don't worry, I'll take a turn too."

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And you sit down in the chair

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 and they hook some stuff up to your hands,

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 sucking all these little electrodes

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 in the old 1950s electrodes.

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I don't know if they were any different,

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 but I just imagine they were, they were cooler looking.

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And then he puts a box in front of you.

114
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And basically you're looking at a little slideshow

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 and he goes, "Click."

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Oh, it's a pretty woman.

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Click.

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Oh, it's a muscular dude.

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Click.

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 It's a puppy.

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Click.

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Two muscular dudes.

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Click.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Sexy woman.

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Click.

126
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Two naked muscular.

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Click.

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Puppy.

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Click.

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Ugh, what in the...

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Click.

132
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 What?

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Click.

134
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Ugh, please, click.

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Stop!

136
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Click.

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And what it would do is you're looking into this box

138
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 and there's a camera measuring your pupils dilating.

139
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Whoa.

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And it would show you neutral photos, puppies.

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And then it would show you photos of sexy women

142
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 and photos of good looking men

143
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 and it would become more and more explicit as time goes by.

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 So if you're a woman and you're looking at this box

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 and they show a picture of like the strongest man in the world,

146
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Joe Atlas, and your eyes went, "Whoa!"

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Like bulged.

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 They're basically like cartoon eyes,

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 "Boring, boring, boring."

150
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 They'd go, "Oh, perfect.

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 She's heterosexual."

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 If they showed you a picture of Faye Dunaway

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 and your eyes go, "Whoa!"

154
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 They'd be like, "Mmm, mark that.

155
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Mark that down."

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And as the pictures became more and more explicit,

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 if you were responding to the same sex pictures

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 that were explicit, so you're a girl,

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 hot girls doing stuff to other hot girls,

160
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 how--when the world in 1950s porn looked like, actually,

161
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 now that I think about it.

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Wasn't it all just Betty Page stuff?

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I don't think I've ever seen a nude photo.

164
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Please don't send it to my email,

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 but I don't think I've ever really seen a nude photo

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 from somebody in the '50s.

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Like it was like June Cleaver.

168
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Just like spread eagle.

169
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Like, it actually kind of boggles my mind

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 now that I think about it.

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I'm assuming they were in black and white.

172
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Obviously, the first color photos was this pornographic spread.

173
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Super weird.

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 But anyway, so I can't imagine the pictures were too enticing.

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Same sex or opposite sex.

176
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Anyways, you got this.

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So they would put this box and what--

178
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 So this was the logic behind it.

179
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 This is the logic behind it.

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Because the U.S. government did this for a long time.

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 There's two reasons why the U.S. government--

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 three reasons why the U.S. government didn't want gays

183
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 in the military.

184
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Canada didn't want gays.

185
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 They used this for government employees.

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 They called it the fruit machine,

187
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 because it detected fruits.

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 This is the reason why.

189
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 One, people just didn't like gay people.

190
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 That was kind of just the overriding reason.

191
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 People didn't like gay people in general.

192
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Two, in the U.S. military specifically,

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 they believe that it lowers morale, basically.

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 When you have a gay dude in the unit, it lowers morale.

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 This was the big issue back in the '50s,

196
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 especially in this program, it went on for a long time.

197
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And this was an issue in America, too.

198
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 We didn't use the fruit machine,

199
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 but they found other ways to find--

200
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 they'd send people to investigate you.

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 If you were gay and you were engaged in a homosexual lifestyle.

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 In the '50s, if anyone found out about that one,

203
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 it was criminal in a lot of states and in Canada.

204
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 But two, if the Russians found out about it--

205
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 this is the middle of the Cold War, beginning of the Cold War, really.

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 We didn't know what was going to happen.

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 The Russians found out about it.

208
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 You had a choice.

209
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 The Russian agent comes to you and says,

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 "We caught you. Here's some black and white, old-timey photos of you."

211
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 You're like, "Oh, these are terrible."

212
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And the Russian guy's like, "Yeah, I know.

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 We need to figure out a sexier way to take photos."

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 But anyways, that's you doing that illegal action.

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 You have a choice.

216
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 You can either give us government documents and be a spy for us,

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 or I'm going to put these up on Facebook,

218
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 which in the 1950s was just printing a book with your face on it

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 and handing it out to people in your town.

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Because society outright disliked homosexuals back then.

221
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Like, it was a criminal charge.

222
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Nowadays, you'd be like, "Pfft, whatever. Have a Grindr account."

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Like, "Yeah, sure. Out me. I'm already out."

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 But back then, it would ruin your life.

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And so the government goes, "I'm not justifying this behavior,

226
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 but that was their logic behind it."

227
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 They just didn't like gay people either, but that's the logic behind it.

228
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 They go, "We need to get rid of government employees who are gay and lesbian

229
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 because it's a liability. It's a secret liability to us."

230
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Secret as in they'll give away our secrets.

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 So first off, they built this fruit machine.

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 This Frank Wake went to America and learned all about the new techniques

233
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 to decipher people's inner feelings and stuff like that.

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Came back, built the fruit machine.

235
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And at first, they'd be like, they'd invite government employees in and be like,

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 "This is a stress test machine. We want to see how stressed you are."

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And the guy's like, "Oh, man, I really need to sit down. I'm super stressed."

238
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 "Do you know how hard my job is? Yeah, I'll sit down and I'll look in this black box

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 and see how..."

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 "Wait, what? What? What are you showing me these pictures for, bro?

241
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Come on, dude, you're making me more stressed now?"

242
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 What they were really doing is they were getting people...

243
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Because, again, they didn't know who was gay or not.

244
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 So they were getting people at first, randomly, to sit down in the chair

245
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 to test their stress levels.

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And then they're looking in this box and they're seeing a bunch of gay dudes banging each other.

247
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And so people stopped volunteering. People started going, "No, I'm not going to volunteer."

248
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 But people were also getting fired because their eyes were like, "What?"

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 "Let me see these sexy dudes."

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 So this program ran from the 1950s to 1992 for 40 years.

251
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 This machine was in operation. And what's funny is it was...

252
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Because it was a government program, it wasn't really spoken about.

253
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 This was one of those stories... This is one of those conspiracy theories that I like, because it's true.

254
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And it just kind of disappears. And this is a conspiracy theory that affected people's lives.

255
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 This isn't "Queen Elizabeth is a reptilian and she's eating baby skin."

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Like, that's sci-fi fantasy stuff.

257
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And if it was real, unless you're the baby, I don't think you have much to worry about.

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And it's not real. But this one, people are getting fired. People lost their jobs.

259
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Marriages were dissolved. Some people killed themselves. People went homeless.

260
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 This was a conspiracy that the government engaged against its own population for 40 years.

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And when it ended, completely covered up. It's now starting to come out.

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 There was a little hint here and there. You'd hear about it here and there like a conspiracy theory.

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 You'd hear, "Oh, did you know about this operation?" There's a little hint.

264
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 But now it's starting to the point that Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, in the year 2017,

265
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 issued an internal investigation and an apology.

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And for all the victims of it, they get to split $110 million. That's nothing.

267
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Because they say like the thousands of... At one point, there was 9,000 people

268
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 who were being tracked by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police over homosexual activities.

269
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 That's not the full amount of people who got fired or had their lives ruined by the fruit machine.

270
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And the thing is, there's two issues with the fruit machine, other than the fact that it was used to

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 get people fired because of their sexuality.

272
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 One, the science behind it may be faulty. Some people have come out and said just in general

273
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 that the fact that your eyes are dilating doesn't necessarily mean sexual interest.

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Nowadays, we have stuff like they put that little thing on your penis and they show you pictures

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 and if it starts to get blood flow, then they go, "Oh, you're gay."

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I don't think they use it for gay people now, but they use it for pedophiles.

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 But the other thing is this. This machine, whether or not that science with the eye dilating stuff like that,

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 some people say, "Well, it does register in a slight way. It'll show a level of interest,

279
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 but the way you bring processes, it's subtle." So it could work. The science is not solid on that.

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 What is solid on that is apparently the fruit machine, the way it was constructed.

281
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Remember how it was describing the slides?

282
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 The picture, and I'm sure as the technology got better, I'm sure you didn't have this problem so much,

283
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 but the way the original machine was being run through the '50s and '60s was literally like a slide.

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 What happened was the pictures weren't always the same size.

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So when you would click it between pictures, sometimes more light would be showing through the back of the photo,

286
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 so that would make your eyes dilate because they're actually closing because so much light

287
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 and sometimes just the changing of the slide was enough to make your eyes shrink

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 because there's so much light coming through. And then when the picture of four sexy bears,

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 your eyes widen because it went from super bright to a darker photo now, and then you get fired.

290
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 So a true conspiracy, the government of Canada did use a device to root out homosexuals,

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 but it probably got rid of people of all orientations.

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Whether, and to be fair, whether or not the machine worked 100% and it only detected homosexuals,

293
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 it's still barbaric. I'm not like, "Oh, those poor straight people who got fired."

294
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 In general, the whole idea is awful. The logic behind it was if the Russians know that these people are gay,

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 then they'll blackmail us. Really, the solution could have been,

296
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 "Let's just not care if they're gay in the first place," and that doesn't give them anything to be blackmailed about.

297
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 But live and learn, live and learn. So hopefully that $110 million,

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 that doesn't sound like a lot of money to be divided up among all those people,

299
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 but hopefully it does something for them all these years later.

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 So we are leaving behind the fruit machine. Put it back. I saw you taking it.

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 You're like, "But these pictures are so sexy." I'm like, "Dude, I know you want those sexy photos from the 1950s,

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 but no, you cannot have it. Burnt Toast Ghost, fire up that carbonicopter. We are leaving behind Canada.

303
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 We are flying out to North Korea." Because it is North Korea week.

304
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 We're headed on out. This was Stealthy Steve's idea. Really, really appreciate it.

305
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Cody recommended this particular story. We're flying over North Korea.

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Take us low, Burnt Toast Ghost. We're coming low over the forest.

307
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 A lot of lumber industry, a lot of natural resources in North Korea.

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Very, very beautiful country. You can ignore the mass starvation.

309
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And if you can ignore that scent, that weird scent we're getting as we're flying over the city.

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Let me say this too. Everything I'm about to say is alleged.

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I'm going to talk about some, a lot of crime in this. It's all been alleged.

312
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Even people who steady North Korea, they just kind of shrug their shoulders sometime and go, "I don't know.

313
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 It's such a secretive place." But anyways, we're flying over the country.

314
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 We're going to land in a town square. We're putting on our cool little military uniforms.

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 We are now officially members of the North Korean military. And we got invited to a Lunar New Year's party.

316
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 So we walk into this nice little house. Everyone's sitting around, dressed up.

317
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 We're wearing our cool uniforms. And someone goes, "Oh, I'm so glad you guys came here. I'm so glad you guys came here."

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 It's time to exchange gifts. And we're like, "I don't have a gift. Did you bring a gift?"

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I push you forward and go, "Welcome. This is my gift. I'm giving you this slave."

320
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 You're like, "No, no. I'm like, "Silence, slave. You're now a gift. I wrap you up."

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 As you are-- I left a little breathing hole for you. And as you're standing there, I'll wrap double bow on your head.

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Ready to be traded. We see the other people trading gifts.

323
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Now, all the gifts they seem to be exchanging are fairly small. A size of your hand, maybe?

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Assuming you have a normal human-sized hand and you're not the Incredible Hulk.

325
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 And we see people open up the gift and go, "Oh, my God. This is exactly what I expected. And I'm super happy.

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Give me a hug." A hug. Someone else goes, "I knew it. I absolutely knew it. Give me a hug."

327
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 We're like, "What are they looking at?" "You can't see. I have to cut holes. So now you can look out of the wrapping paper."

328
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I'm like, "What are they looking at?" You're like, "What do I-- you listen to this part, guys. You're always trapping me."

329
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And then we're looking over one of the people's shoulders and they open up their gift and they go, "Thank you. Thank you so much."

330
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And I look at you and you look at me and we both look down and we recognize that as a giant shard of methamphetamine.

331
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 North Korea has a huge meth problem and they have it for two reasons. One, they manufacture a ton of it.

332
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 What's interesting is so after the 1970s, North Korea defaulted on a ton of loans, right?

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Basically, the mob came to them and said, "Where's the money, North Korea?" And they go, "Uh, give us a week."

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 They couldn't pay it. So what they did was they started smuggling alcohol, making counterfeit cigarettes, which is interesting because at first I thought,

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 "So are they not-- so is it just like cigarettes full of grass?" It's actual tobacco, but they would say marbouro. I can't say that word.

336
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 They would say camel on it, but they were knockoff camel cigarettes. They're making a ton of money, shipping booze, counterfeit cigarettes, counterfeit money.

337
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 The money that comes out of North Korea is considered super bills because they're indistinguishable from American money.

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 North Korea sees that as one, able to pay off their debts, and two, economic warfare against the United States.

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 I bet you if there was ever a true reckoning of how much counterfeit U.S. money is out there, it would be bad.

340
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 So anyways, then Soviet Union falls apart, so they lost major financial backing in the '90s.

341
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 They're like, "Well, we were able to get by just like selling coal to China and doing this stuff, but now we really need money."

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And it became a narco state. This is something not a lot of people know about North Korea.

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 They basically turned their economy into a drug state where they produced massive amounts of methamphetamine.

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 And because it's a communist nation, they have community farms, these massive plots of land, to feed the people.

345
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Now, after the Soviet Union stopped helping North Korea out, massive famine hit. They didn't have enough money to take care of everything.

346
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 So Kim Jong-il, who was the president at the time, said, "Cut down all the crops. I want opium."

347
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I mean, maybe he did want opium himself. They're like, "Kim Jong-il, we can buy some opium."

348
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 No, I want opium now, or three to six months when the crop grows, but I need it.

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 And people go, "Advisors said, 'Well, if we cut down all the crops to plant opium, then we're not going to be able to feed our people.'"

350
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And Kim Jong-il reportedly said, "With the money we make from opium, we could buy six times the grain that we could grow."

351
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 So stop growing wheat. Grow opium. We'll sell it. We'll buy food."

352
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 This went on from the 1990s to the early 2000s. Opium and methamphetamine.

353
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Now, they started off working with Asian gangs, and the Asian gangs are like, "Oh, dude, this is sweet."

354
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Because the North Korean meth is some of the most pure meth in the world, 98% pure. It was just perfect meth.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Most meth in the United States, it fluctuates depending on how the supply chain is, but it goes anywhere from 70% to 98%.

356
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It can get up there, but North Korean meth was consistently the best meth.

357
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 So the Asian gangs wanted it. They grabbed it. They stepped on it. They made it less pure.

358
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Then North Korea goes, "Wait a second. Wait a second. We're dropping these bundles out in the ocean.

359
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 We're giving part of our money to the dong. We're giving part of our money to the yakuza when we have diplomats."

360
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 We have all of these embassies all over the world. They started using their diplomats to smuggle drugs into the country.

361
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 To the point that between 1990 and like 2005, 2006, over 20 North Korean officials were either detained, arrested, or seriously investigated for distribution of drugs.

362
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Everyone knew they were doing this. People were walking into embassies with scarface shirts on.

363
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 They're like the big floral shirt and the gold sunglasses and everything. They got a tiger walking behind them. They're carrying a bag.

364
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Everyone knew what these guys were doing, but they had diplomatic immunity.

365
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Now, when this one guy got stopped in Israel with like 150,000 pills of like chlorazepam or something, that's not...

366
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Your diplomatic immunity is not bulletproof. You're smuggling drugs into Egypt. They're going to investigate you.

367
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 But anyways, around the time of 2000s, the government said, "You know what? Let's kind of lay off on the meth.

368
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 In fact, we're not going to sell meth at all anymore. We're just not going to do it.

369
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Now, I don't know if it was a distribution hub, because see, they'd have to get all their chemicals.

370
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Fettin' all and all that stuff is coming from China. North Korea had to get all of the effedrin and all that stuff from China.

371
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 China does not like drugs at all. I'm sure North Korea and China were kind...

372
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 There's a province next to North Korea that in 1990 had 44 drug addicts, and today it has 10,000.

373
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 So China's like, "Damn it, North Korea. We know you need to make money, right? And we know you're buying effedrin and stuff from us.

374
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 We know you're buying this stuff to make this drugs. And you want to sell it in the United States? Whatever. We don't like them either.

375
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 But quit selling it to us. Quit selling it to us, man. You're causing this huge drug problem.

376
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 A bunch of meth heads running around China right now. So North Korea actually stops doing it.

377
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 But this is what happens. You would have scientists who made meth, because the government was making meth.

378
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And then all of a sudden, they're not making meth anymore. But they know how to make really, really good meth.

379
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 What happened now was that you have these world-class meth cooks cooking in their own little laboratory and selling it to the people of North Korea.

380
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 The best meth in the world is in North Korea. And the only people who can buy it now are North Koreans.

381
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 So we're walking down the streets of Yongyang, the capital of North Korea, and you go, "Jason, so this is weird, because North Korea is a police state.

382
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 They have radios that are always on. If you're a high-ranking member, it has a volume control. You can turn it down.

383
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 But other than that, there's a radio plane in every household. People are constantly being bombarded with propaganda.

384
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You have to love the president. You have to love the Kim family."

385
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 So how is it possible that they are allowing this? Well, what's interesting is, so yes, yes, meth is illegal, but this is interesting.

386
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 It is illegal, and it's illegal not because of the massive health risks to it, but because the people end up worshiping the drug more than they worship the ruling family, more than they worship the Kims.

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It's actually in the subset of the law about overthrowing the government, insurrection. That's where meth is mentioned, saying, "Hey, no, no, no, no, this can upset society, but here's the problem.

388
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 People love it. The rich people, all the way down to the poor people, they love their meth."

389
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Now, look at it. You have a police state, and that's true. You have a police state. That's not allegedly.

390
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 And then you have a drug, and when we think of drugs, especially in the West, we think of degenerates, really.

391
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Like, generally, you could say part of that's rief or madness, part of that's propaganda, but definitely, and we can have that argument, but definitely when you look at harder drug, alcohol, weed, cigarettes, sure, whatever,

392
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 but when you start to look at stuff like heroin, meth, crack, there's definitely a degenerate lifestyle connected to those things.

393
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 You may be able to maintain for a while, you may be able to maintain longer than other people, but they all end down the same path.

394
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 How can you allow a drug that is that degenerative, body, mind, and soul degenerative? How can you allow it still, and if you had a police state, you should be able to lock it down like that?

395
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Well, here's the thing. It does do that. It does destroy the body, the mind, and the soul, but it makes you not hungry, and in a country that has famines to this day, as a hard time feeding its population,

396
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 if you can give them a drug that doesn't make them think about how hungry they are, that's a gift for a corrupt government. That's a gift.

397
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 It makes you an extremely, extremely productive worker, maybe not the safest worker, right?

398
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 These guys don't inject it, as far as I saw, some of them may. For the most part, they snort it, and then some of them smoke it, but the most of the population snorts it.

399
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Because there is a difference. If you're shooting up, your life is a complete mess.

400
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And the thing is with-- it's interesting because I've known a lot, and I've talked-- if you've listened to the show for a long time, I've talked a lot about a lot of people that I know who have had experiences with meth.

401
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It's been no good stories at all. But apparently meth isn't super physically addictive, like heroin is, or cocaine is, or crackers.

402
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 What it does is it destroys the dopamine receptors. You can't feel happiness or joy anymore after you do the drug for too long.

403
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Now, there are studies that show that dopamine receptors may return, but you need a long study to really look at that thing.

404
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And in the meantime, you can't be happy unless you're doing the drug.

405
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Now, happiness and joy are already in short supply in a police state like North Korea, really.

406
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 But let's go back to the "benefits" of this drug. It makes it so you're not hungry. It makes you an incredibly "productive worker."

407
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 You may be taking apart a car motor and putting it back together at 3 a.m., but when you're on the floor of a factory, you're not tired.

408
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 You're just going, going, going. You have so much energy in you.

409
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 In the country of North Korea, it's considered a medicine. And people-- that wasn't a skit at the beginning, well, it was.

410
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 But people do give it to each other as gifts. People will be walking around town.

411
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 You may be, "Hey, Barry, how's it going?" "Oh, it's going really good. Working in the factory." "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm talking to my amendment."

412
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 "Oh, man, you're talking a lot. You must have some of that good stuff." "Oh, yeah, they will say, 'Hey, man, snort some of mine.' I got the best stuff."

413
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 "Oh, man, ooh, that is good. Here, no, here, let me give you a little snort of mine."

414
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 It's an open secret. The government-- it's funny because the government kind of turns a blind eye to it.

415
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Because, again, you're thinking, countries-- I think at the end of the day, every country, the leadership would love for it to be a police state, as long as they're in charge.

416
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And if you had a police state, you would think you would have no drug problems.

417
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 The problem is, is that this is so invasive in the country of North Korea, that the people who would normally be calling for action and saying,

418
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 "Just stop this. Look at this. Killing our streets. Their kids, their wife, even them, take a little snort every now and then."

419
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 So nobody wants to ring the alarm bell because everyone is implicated in this. And yes, it is illegal, but since everyone does it, who's going to call for the big change?

420
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 We need to stop this because you have generals, generals, wives. It's become huge in the upper crust of North Korean society.

421
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 So don't get it twisted. They're not all peasants. They do have a leadership structure, and you have people who are fairly wealthy, you have very nice houses and stuff like that.

422
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And of course, you do have lower working class people, upper class people. The women do it as a diet aid. It's being touted as a way to lose weight and stay slim.

423
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 The lower class goes, "I don't need a diet aid because I'm already slim because there's a massive famine going on."

424
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 The last thing I'm worried about is not gaining weight. I wish I could gain weight. It's also considered like just medicine over there.

425
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Your back hurts? You have a muscle spasm? Oh, my back. Snorts and meth. Feeling gloomy? Things just aren't going your way?

426
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 You're looking over the 38th parallel and all the K-pop bands just dancing? You're separated by them by about 10,000 landmines?

427
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Do a little sniff. Things will feel better. Things will feel better.

428
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Now, what's interesting again is that the government, this is illegal. You're not supposed to sell it. You're not supposed to use it. You're not supposed to carry it.

429
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But again, no one really ever gets caught for this.

430
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 To the point that recently, and remember, the state stopped sponsoring this stuff back in 2005, 2006, in August 2016, there was this massive tower being built in Pyongyang.

431
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 It's Kim Jong-un's jewel. He wanted this tower. It's going to be a shining beacon of how advanced North Korea civilization, architecture, all that stuff would come.

432
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 But it starts to fall behind. Now, again, because it's a police state, the firms in charge of building the tower begin "drafting" local residents to work on it.

433
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Basically means knocking on your door. It's a Tuesday morning. You're working on the tower today, and you're going to be working on it until the tower's done.

434
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 You had a bakery. You did anything else, which I don't know if I'm pretty sure they're not allowed to own small businesses, but that could be wrong on that.

435
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Again, not a lot of people know a lot of stuff about it, but anyways, local residents were basically being forced to work on this tower, and it's still falling behind.

436
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 So again, allegedly, the construction firm began to pass out methamphetamines to speed up the process.

437
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 There is no job I can think of other than maybe mass transportation, where I definitely don't want to be working around meth heads, than a high-rise construction tower.

438
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Because best case scenario, you're working on the floor above them as they're constantly grooving to Leonard Skinnerd and dancing off of the Skauffeldeen and falling to their deaths.

439
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 The worst case scenario is you're working on any floor below him or on the ground, and somehow you can still hear "Stairway to Heaven" as a 150-pound man has reached terminal velocity and is about to slam right into you.

440
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 I can't imagine just the safety violations alone working with a bunch of meth heads, and everyone's on meth.

441
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 So you would be doing it too, you'd be "Hey man, no, Smoke on the Water is a way better song, here play that" and you guys are fighting over the boombox that you took apart last night and then "repaired" is just covered in duct tape now and you can barely hear anything.

442
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And then as the two of you are fighting over what would win in a wrestling match, a Phillips or a Flathead, both of you go tumbling to your death.

443
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 That is not, I mean obviously an airline pilot high on meth would be measurably worse, but working on a high-rise building is not.

444
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 But what's interesting about this, like every dystopia you do have a resistance movement, because around the construction site of this tower, graffiti is being sprayed on the wall.

445
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Pyongyang speed is drug speed.

446
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 The people know what's going on. This tower that's supposed to be a glimmer of hope at what North Korea can achieve is actually being powered by the poison in the veins of their countrymen.

447
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 That is as dystopian as it gets.

448
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And while the building may be beautiful, while it may be a symbol of what North Korea is capable of, while it may be a pet project spearheaded by Kim Jong-un, a personal source of pride for him, it's really a symbol of the toxins that flow through the country of North Korea.

449
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 But maybe, maybe there is a glimmer of hope.

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Because tomorrow's episode is where we wrap up North Korea week.

451
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 And we look at a different side of North Korea, a conspiracy theory from the conspiracy theory iceberg, and one that's floated around long before the conspiracy iceberg was even created.

452
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Is it possible that North Korea is actually a real-life Wakanda, a glimmering utopia that all of us would love to be a part of?

453
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 We'll address that tomorrow on Dead Rabbit Radio.

454
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
