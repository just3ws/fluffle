1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
 It's the start of Spooky Ghost Week.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,200
 Ooh.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,120
 First we're gonna go to a college where the ghost of a young woman

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,880
 still plays the piano late at night, and it has implications that are scarier than you think.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,840
 And then we take a trip to a haunted mine, but not just any haunted mine.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,520
 This one allows us to do an interactive adventure today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:38,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,960
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. It's the beginning of Ghost Week.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,280
 I actually just came up with an idea. I did a bunch of research this weekend, and I came up with all

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,880
 these great ghost stories. I was reading, well, because I was reading a book on ghosts, I came

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,320
 up with a bunch of stories in general, but I go, "I have so many stories about ghosts. I think we'll

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,480
 make this a theme week. Now not every story is going to involve ghosts, but every episode will have a

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,960
 ghost story in it, culminating with Friday being one of our, and I always say this, that it's the

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,640
 most requested topic, but this one here is actually the most requested topic from the conspiracy

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
 iceberg. We're going to cover it Friday. I'm not going to spoil it for you. I will give you a hint.

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:31,760
 It involves ghosts, but it's more than that. But let's go ahead and jump on in to our first story

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,000
 for Ghost Week. Now this one is interesting because a lot of times when I poo poo ghost stories,

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,640
 I start to bring in physics. Like how can a ghost stand on a boat? Like wouldn't they fall through

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
 the boat? If the boat was moving, wouldn't it fall off? Like I'm constantly trying to figure this

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,120
 stuff out. Can a ghost be in an airplane? Is the airplane taken off? They're like, "No, no, wait,

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:58,080
 wait, and they just haunt the runway?" Like how does ghost physics work? And this story kind of gives

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,720
 us an idea of what it could be, but before we get into that part of the story, so there's two ghosts

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,040
 that we're going to cover in this first story. So there is a college in Arkansas. So we're going

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
 to go to Arkansas. You know, we're going to put the carpenter copter aside for right now. We're

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,720
 going to take the dead rabbit dirgeable again. Now first off, I'm not going to do that stupid

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,520
 sound effect joke again because it totally failed. I listened to that episode a couple days ago and

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,440
 I was like, "That was a stupid joke, but it's there. It's recorded or whatever." And I want to let you

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,640
 guys know, actually, I did an episode on the ghost blimp and there was a YouTube commenter who

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,840
 made a remark saying, "Now I know why you use a helicopter instead of a blimp." And it was funny

30
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,960
 because he put this little nugget in my head. Later on when I invented, I mean, the dead rabbit

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,240
 dirgeable is real. It's totally real. But later when I remembered I had the dead rabbit dirgeable,

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,560
 I was like, "Wait a second, that guy. So I am a naming guy with the headphones. He is our co-pilot

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
 for the dead rabbit dirgeable." And we're going to take this dirgeable all the way from Hooda River.

34
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:05,520
 Okay, we're going to go to Arkansas. It's three years later now. It's 2022. The blimp is incredibly

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,880
 slow. Anyways, we're in Arkansas. We're specifically going to Harding College. So get your college

36
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,800
 books. Get your number two pencils and your scantrons. But then put those away because we don't

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,840
 need those. We're just going to walk around college. So we're at Harding College. I'm sorry,

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
 you already bought those school books. You can return them. You'll get half credit. But anyway,

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,800
 so we're at Harding College now and we're going to meet a ghost named Gertie Sue. Now, Gertie Sue

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,280
 is one of those ghosts that I'm not a huge fan of. They just kind of walk around. I always thought

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,400
 I was boring. Ghosts in a white dress walking down the hallway or something like that. I don't

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,040
 find that particularly compelling or scary or anything like that. And you're like, well,

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,720
 Jason, why are you wasting my time and telling me a story like that? Because it's not the main

44
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,680
 part of the story. Shut up. Don't interrupt me. It's not the main part of the story. And I think

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,360
 her origin is hilarious. So to cut to the chase, she is a ghost who there's like a brick path

46
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,560
 along Harding College. And her ghost will walk through the college and like, you know, just kind

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,240
 of like walking through at night. But anyways, her ghost just walks around campus, you know,

48
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,720
 looking, she's at Starbucks. She's like, oh, come on, man, where's my stuff? She's at the food court.

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,800
 She's like, oh, this food's disgusting, but I don't want to leave campus and lose my parking spot.

50
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,400
 And everyone else is like, she's basically slimer at this point. I basically turned into slimer.

51
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,680
 Her origin story, let me get to it. Her origin story is she woke up one night. She's like,

52
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,400
 so tired, I need to walk down the hallway for some reason. She's like walking through the halls of

53
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,880
 her dorms late at night. She's like, I'll just keep my eyes shut as I'm walking through here.

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,200
 It's not like I believe I'm going to become a go.

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:57,680
 Falls down an elevator shaft. Now, you might not find that humorous, but I find that I've realized

56
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,520
 doing the show that 90% of people die in ways attributed to Looney Tune characters. Like,

57
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:11,520
 how hard does it have to be to avoid a giant hole on the third story or second story or whatever

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,640
 it was of a building, of a door sized, multiple human hole? How hard is it to avoid that?

59
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,520
 She just walked into an elevator shaft and fell. Now, again, the couple problems I have with that is

60
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,160
 you don't just walk into an elevator. You're just not like, hey, Barry, and like face through the door.

61
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,880
 It just takes a lot of effort to open up an elevator door. Now, I had heard that story before

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,640
 and I read it a couple times when I was researching this. Then I found another version and they're

63
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,440
 like, there was a black thing. They totally sexed it up. They're like, all the girls in the dorm

64
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:55,200
 heard a piercing scream. They left out the squish noise and heard a piercing scream and as one of

65
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:02,880
 the girls ran out of her room, she saw a dark figure run away and all that was left was Gertie's

66
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,080
 broken butt. That didn't happen. That, come on, that didn't happen. You're just making that part up.

67
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,760
 Now they're just trying to add a murder plot to it. No, that didn't happen. That wasn't sourced in

68
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,520
 any other article. Gertie, you just fell down an elevator shaft, down a hole that never moves.

69
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,960
 The second ghost, however, is far more fascinating, also at Harding College. This happened in the

70
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,440
 1930s. Now, the thing with Gertie, people have said that they've seen her and that story may or

71
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,520
 may not be true. This story also has probably some faults in the telling of it as far as how

72
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,960
 factual it is because we don't have things like names and stuff like that. We just have vague

73
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,520
 time like the 1930s. But again, it's very, very interesting story. It's kind of out of the

74
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,000
 normal ghost stories we hear. 1930s. There is a dormitory. No, they didn't have an elevator,

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 as far as I know. There's this young woman who falls in love with a young man. Now, she lived on

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,200
 the third floor of the dorm, but it was an old girl's dorm. So you couldn't have boys over, but

77
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:11,440
 you could have some fun, a little sorority sexiness. You know, pillow fights and pajama parties,

78
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,400
 and maybe you're getting a little too drunk and you're doing the flapper dance. It's the 1930s,

79
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,480
 so they're doing the flapper dance and the girls are getting a little too close, but the room

80
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:29,120
 feels heavy and hot. Just things happen sometimes. It doesn't mean anything. Young 1930s ghost,

81
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,480
 eventual ghost woman, it doesn't mean anything. It's okay. You're just experimenting. You're in

82
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:44,720
 college. But my fantasy aside, the real story is that there was this girl, as I kind of wandered

83
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,560
 off into dreamland. There's this young girl who falls in love with the young boys. She goes to

84
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,680
 Harding College. She's in her dorm. Her dorm's on the third floor, but she wouldn't meet up with her

85
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,920
 with her boyfriend. I'm assuming they just held hands. That was like considered a home runback

86
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,880
 then. But he died tragically in a car accident and she was just completely inconsolable. She kind

87
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,880
 of broke off all of her social contacts and on the third floor of this, well, now I'm thinking it

88
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,760
 might not be a dormitory because there is a piano up there, but we'll just assume, we'll just, for

89
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,480
 the sake of the story, the point is, is that on the third story of this building, this young

90
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,960
 four-lawing girl that may or may not have been her dormitory, played the piano all day long. Super,

91
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,400
 super sad piano music. That was just the only way she could console herself. So she's up there.

92
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,480
 She's playing sad music. She's playing the theme song to the incredible hulk up there. And people

93
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,120
 are like, that's really catchy. She should try like selling that to a TV show or something. And

94
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,040
 people are like, what's a TV show? It's the 1930s and they started doing the flapper dance. Anyway,

95
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,160
 so she's playing the sad piano music on the third floor. That's all she ever did. Now, again,

96
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,480
 this is a point where I have to ask a question as a skeptic. They didn't kick her out of school.

97
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,600
 They just let her keep attending school and they're like, hey, you need to come to your

98
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,520
 classes and she would like play one key for yes and two keys for no. She's like,

99
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,840
 and they're like, whoa, sorry. So I mean, obviously they wouldn't just let her play the

100
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,600
 piano all the time. She'd have to go to classes and stuff like that. But a couple months later,

101
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,280
 she mysteriously died and the implication is that she died of a broken heart. So again,

102
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,720
 there's some factual problems with the story, but this is a legend at this school. She's up

103
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,480
 there. She plays the piano all day long. She's super sad. She passes away. Now they say to this day,

104
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:36,080
 on the third floor, you can still hear slow, sad piano music every so often. It's not all the time.

105
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:44,160
 You're not like trying to study. It's like, it's not like that. Like she, every so often,

106
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,400
 you'll hear like a sad piano song. But here's the interesting part. That building was completely

107
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,320
 torn down. And now there is no third floor. It only goes up two stories. So the building was torn down.

108
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,000
 And when they rebuilt it, they're like, oh, we don't have to build it that high.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,600
 They got lazy. They're like, there's a bunch of awnings still like set up. They're like,

110
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,960
 yeah, whatever. The building's only two stories high, but people on the second floor will hear music

111
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,840
 coming from the sky above them. Before the building was torn down, people would say the music came

112
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,160
 from the third floor. And now they say the music is coming basically from the roof. That's an

113
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,200
 interesting event because you don't see that happening a lot in ghost stories. I'll come

114
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,920
 across the story every once in a while, where something like that happens, where they will have

115
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,360
 a building that is burned out, and there'll still be a ghost in the area that originally was haunting

116
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,840
 that house. But the idea of a building actually being destroyed and rebuilt in a different way,

117
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:46,000
 and the ghosts still haunting the original location of the haunting, that's very, very rare. And I

118
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 think this is the only example off the top of my head I can think of. And the top of my head,

119
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,040
 I'm looking at notes, but there's one or two more that I've heard of. But in all of Ghost Lore,

120
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:02,400
 it's very, very unique. And to me, that makes it a little more plausible. The area, if you believe

121
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,440
 that the area that you haunt is the area that you haunt, whatever is done there shouldn't matter.

122
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
 So if a bunch of people die in a church and you build a museum on top of it and the ghosts haunt

123
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,400
 the museum, people are like, well, yeah, because a church burned down. But if you have someone on

124
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,160
 the third floor become a ghost, and then you raise the building, build up another one, and it's coming

125
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,600
 from the air, that would also logically still make sense. So ghosts don't stand on stuff. But here's

126
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,080
 the scary thing. Think about 9/11. Are there a bunch of ghosts like 80 stories up just wandering

127
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,400
 around? There's just nothing there anymore? They have that new building, but I mean, it's not like

128
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,200
 the exact same profile. Like, could you look out your window like late at night, three in the morning

129
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,040
 in New York, look out your window with a pair of binoculars and see like a guy in a business

130
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,160
 suit like doing his daily routine, just walking around in the sky? That's creepy. It's creepy idea.

131
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,000
 Because it totally offsets how we think of physics and reality and spatial things and stuff like

132
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,880
 that. So I thought that's that's that was really interesting. I really like that story. But I had

133
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,880
 to get through the elevator falling person first because I just thought that was hilarious. Okay,

134
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,680
 so now we're going to move on. Oh, and I want to say this too real quick. There is a Twitter

135
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,600
 account called the Cafe and Diner. It's @CafeandDiner. If you are into paranormal stuff, check them out.

136
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,000
 Check them out. It's an interesting Twitter account. It's an interesting Twitter account @CafeandDiner.

137
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,560
 Very interesting. Dead Rabbit recommends @CafeandDiner. Okay, I just wanted to get that out there.

138
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,120
 Now we're going to move on to our main story. Our main story is a story of haunted mine shafts. Now,

139
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,480
 mines are creepy to begin with. They're basically big old holes in the earth. Of course, I mean,

140
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,360
 that's literally the definition of a mine. They're giant holes in the earth. And some of them we make

141
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,360
 and some of them do you make a mine? Do people see a mountain and go, I wonder what's in there and

142
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:01,200
 start drilling into them into a mountain? Or do they find existing mines and go, Hey, look at

143
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,040
 there's like this hole in this cave. Let's make it bigger. Or let's start like taking our pickaxes

144
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,560
 and like knocking stuff off. I think it would probably take a lot of effort to have like a

145
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:21,280
 I just realized for some reason, I assumed scientists would have access to Cobra Commander's

146
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,840
 drilling machine. I don't think those really exist. I don't think there's really like a vehicle,

147
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,080
 a tank with a Cobra logo on it has a giant drill in the front. And they're like, let's mine boys.

148
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:42,000
 I don't know. I thought that was real for a second. They're always, I think they're almost always holes

149
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,280
 that are already in mountains. I don't think they're using 1980s cartoon technology to mine.

150
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:56,160
 But anyway, so we're going to Bodie State Historic Park in California. Now, in 1902,

151
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,280
 there's this mine that people were mining for a while. But in 1902, these dudes are mining it.

152
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,960
 And for whatever reason, maybe in 1902, they didn't have access to like,

153
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,440
 like maybe this was state of the art equipment back then, but they had a white mule in the mine.

154
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
 Now, not the fact that it was white made in high tech, but I guess you had a mule to help move the

155
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,720
 ore carts around. But I thought they had like those little pump thingies like when two guys are on

156
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,000
 both sides again, everything I know about the world is from cartoons. But anyway, so I guess

157
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,560
 that's probably why the mule was down there. 1902, they have this white mule deep in the mine is the

158
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,440
 500 foot drop 500 feet down the mine. It was called the fifth level. And then or cart broke loose.

159
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,920
 And like went down in the end of challenges sitting in it. They're like, no, in the end of no,

160
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,160
 it goes down the the track and hits the mule and breaks its back. And so the people there are like,

161
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,000
 that sucks. So they shoot the shoot the mule in the head. And they're like, well, you know, he was

162
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
 a good mule. He was a good mule. I don't know if they said that they may have hated his guts for

163
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,920
 all I know. But miners began. So now like people just go about their business. But over time,

164
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:16,080
 on the fifth level, 500 feet down, they begin to smell the smell of fresh mule droppings.

165
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:23,440
 Hey, Barry, do you smell that? And the other guy's like, dude, well, man, lay off the sasperilla.

166
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,680
 And he's like, there's no sasperilla around here. And it's not me. And sasperilla doesn't even do

167
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,880
 that. Oh, smells like mule droppings. My first question when I read that was, well, how do you

168
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,720
 know the difference between mule droppings and any other beast of burdens drop means the other guy

169
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,560
 could have been like, no, that's definitely camel. Other guys like, no, that's horse, probably a female

170
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,880
 horse. They're like, what? But anyway, so they would smell the smell of fresh mule droppings.

171
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,440
 It could have just been methane in the in the cave, but maybe they'd all be dead. And then

172
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,200
 people are like, well, whatever, we'll just get over it. It smells down here, but we'll keep working.

173
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,560
 But then people started like rounding a corner and they would see the white mule standing at the

174
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,400
 end of these tunnel, which is terrifying. A ghost girl walking down a pathway into college is not

175
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,760
 scary. It's kind of like, oh, that's kind of interesting. A ghost mule 500 feet into the earth

176
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,680
 is terrifying. And it got to the point that people wouldn't even work that level of the mind anymore.

177
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,880
 They're like, I'm not going down there. Smells. And I can deal with that. But then when I saw a ghost

178
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,720
 mule, like I'm walking it working down there with my head of lamp and I turn and there's just a

179
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,320
 mule at the end of a tunnel. I'm not, no. So they weren't basically that part of the mind no one

180
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,440
 would work. There was also an interesting part in that same mine where there was a 1200 foot shaft.

181
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,360
 There's like a drop and reportedly someone one day picked up a rock and threw it down the shaft.

182
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:51,120
 And when it hit the ground, they heard someone go, Hey, you. Now that I think is 100% made up.

183
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,480
 Because again, if you did that, after you left your own mule trappings in the mine,

184
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,840
 your first instinct would to be to do it again to see if it's replicated. But the mine is closed

185
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,640
 off now they blew it up. You can't get in there. So who knows. But I think the mule story is creepy.

186
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,680
 However, now though, what we want to do is we're still in the Bodie State Historic Park. We are

187
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,160
 going to Lucky Boy Mine. And in Lucky Boy Mine, we are going to play an interactive adventure like

188
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,040
 we have before. I saw Bandersnatch, by the way, it was okay. Kind of lost the novelty in a bit,

189
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,080
 but I'll give them an A for effort. I think they can perfect it, but we're doing our own version,

190
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,760
 but very, very low tech. This is after World War Two. So fairly recent, fairly recent.

191
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,520
 After World War Two, shortly after World War Two, right now is after World War Two,

192
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,200
 I should be more specific. After World War Two, Lucky Boy Mine was closed down. And the town

193
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,400
 that was built to support Lucky Boy Mine became a ghost town except for six people. So go ahead

194
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,000
 and pick a number between one and six. Okay, so you got your number. That number will determine

195
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,320
 your fate in the course of this story. So you got your number in your head. You might have written

196
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,360
 it down. I don't know because I told you to get your number two pencils earlier. You're like,

197
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,480
 why, I bought these. I got to use them for something. Bodie State Historic Park, Lucky Boy Mine.

198
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,680
 The town is empty except for six people. Now I know the name of one of them. One of the names

199
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,440
 has been recorded historically. The other five we don't know the names of. So I've had to give

200
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,560
 them names. Ed, that is a real name, his wife, Misha, a young Indian woman. And then there's four

201
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,800
 other members of the series. Ed and his wife, then you have four other members of the town. Tommy,

202
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,120
 Philbert, Mackenzie, and Jonas. They're just, I mean, it sounds like a boy band. Those are the

203
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,000
 names they came up with on the spot. I don't know many Indian women named Misha, but again,

204
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,480
 you just got to cut me some slack. Cut me some slack. So we're in the town surrounding Lucky

205
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,240
 Boy Mine. Spooky little town, spooky little ghost town. Only six people in a town, which

206
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,640
 would be creepy anyways. Ed was not a nice person. He was not known to be a nice person. And if you

207
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,920
 pick the number four, you are Ed. So you're not a nice person. You're not, and you're like, Jason,

208
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,560
 that hurts my feelings. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, you, you might be a nice person in

209
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,120
 real life. But for the sake of the story, you're kind of a douchebag. Now he's especially not nice

210
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:17,360
 to his wife, Misha. And if you picked one, you're Misha. One night, he gets really,

211
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,320
 really mad. Ed is just had it with whatever minor thing Misha has done this time. He grabs his

212
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:35,920
 shotgun. So sorry, number one. He grabs his shotgun, blows her chest off, just kills her. She doesn't

213
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,480
 die right away. It's a very slow death. Well, not relatively slow. Because it's a slow death,

214
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,120
 you'd be living to your 80s and dying your sleep, but she didn't just die immediately. She blew part

215
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,880
 of her chest off as she bled out for a while and died. Now, there's no law. There's no law enforcement

216
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,960
 there. There's no cops. There's only four other people there other than Ed and his now deceased

217
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,480
 wife. And three of them, McKinsey, Tommy, and Philbert, could not let this injustice stand.

218
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,640
 They thought that the murder of his wife was just, you have to be punished. So one night, they grab

219
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:20,000
 Ed. "Let go of me, you vormit! What are you doing? Get off me!" They lead him down to a creek. There was

220
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,240
 a creek nearby the town. Now, they tie him up. "What do you get to do when I get loose of these ties

221
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,360
 and get my shotgun? I'm gonna show you stuff." They throw him, this might be one of the most

222
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,320
 inefficient ways to murder another human. They throw him into the creek to drown him.

223
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:45,040
 He doesn't drown, obviously, because he can just lift his head a couple centimeters, and he's fine.

224
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,720
 So then, there are three guys who're standing around and they're like, "Well, we didn't really

225
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,720
 think that one out. There was like a raging river 20 feet away." And they're like, "We don't know why

226
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,920
 we took him to this creek, and we're kind of lazy, so we don't want to pick him back up."

227
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:02,800
 They then proceeded to kick him in the head. But, not to kill him. They kicked him in the head

228
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,200
 until he became unconscious, so he would drown. Now, there's another way. One, they could have just

229
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,160
 kicked him to death. Two, they could have just held him underwater. But the idea of kicking

230
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,640
 someone into unconsciousness so they will drown is so ineffective. But anyways, well, I guess not

231
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,000
 because it works. McKinsey, Philbert, Tommy, they all jump in the air, give each other a high five,

232
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,160
 at the same time, even though the high five hadn't been invented. Fun fact, they invented the high

233
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,720
 five and the freeze frame when they all stood up there. And Ed had drowned. So, if you pick number

234
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,960
 four, you're a drowned victim. And it was fun. You got kicked until you became unconscious. I wonder

235
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,720
 what he dreamt about. I wonder if he dreamt about not getting kicked in the head. It's like,

236
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,200
 "This is a beautiful dream. I'm not getting kicked in the head anymore." Two months go by,

237
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,920
 and these four dudes, now they have to town to themselves. I'm going to make an assumption.

238
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:02,640
 Probably got a little gay. Four guys in the town, middle of nowhere. You know, just hanging out,

239
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,840
 doing little after World War II dances. But the room's hot. It's heavy. And it's okay. You're

240
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,360
 just prospectors. You're just experimenting. It's okay. Doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean

241
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,880
 anything. But anyways, so two months later, they're the only ones in town. And one night,

242
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,800
 McKenzie's laying in bed. Jonas is next to him. No, no, no. So, McKenzie's laying in bed, and he sees

243
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,520
 the ghost of Ed, the frightening form of Ed appear in front of him, shaking his fists silently at him.

244
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,720
 I imagine him thinking, "Why you little!" And fades from view. And McKenzie wakes up and

245
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,560
 was like, "Oh my god. What the hell is that?" Next day, he tells his friends, "I saw the ghost,

246
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,600
 I saw Ed's ghost, and he was shaking his fists furiously at me." And the two other guys who helped

247
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,320
 murder him, Tommy and Philbert, were like, "I saw him last night too." Now at this point,

248
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,240
 Jonas is very, very happy he didn't take part in the murder of Ed. Very, very happy. He's just

249
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,400
 sitting there drinking his sasperilla. He's like, "I told you. Told you you shouldn't have kicked him

250
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,880
 until he drowned." And they're like, "Shut up, Jonas. We'll take you down to the creek too." And he's

251
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:19,440
 like, "Gulp." Short time later, Jonas is walking through the empty town, whistling a song, and he

252
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:27,280
 turns a corner, and he sees the body of Tommy with a huge gash in his head. It's just split open.

253
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,000
 He turns to you and goes, "If you pick number three, that's you." And then he just goes back to

254
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,840
 this loon, drinks more sasperilla. So Tommy got his head split open. Nobody in the town knew why.

255
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,280
 None of the three other people knew why. Maybe he fell. Maybe a bear or a crotty chopped him.

256
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,280
 Nobody knew. Short time after that, Jonas is hanging out. He gets a phone call at home.

257
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,480
 Well, I guess they don't even need phones. They just yell across the street. All of a sudden,

258
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,280
 he hears Philbert go, "JONES! Jonas! Jonas, come here!" Jonas is like, "Damn it.

259
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,640
 I've got other stuff to do, but apparently I have to go over here." He goes over to Philbert's

260
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,920
 house. He sees Philbert's head. "Hey, let's make this dramatic. He walks into the house. All the

261
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,480
 lights are off, and there's a roaring fire." And he just sees the silhouette of a man hunched over

262
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,040
 the fire, and he's like, "Philbert? Philbert, are you okay?" And Philbert slowly turns towards him

263
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:33,520
 as the fire crackles. And Jonas goes, "Sounds like you're just crinkling paper!" But no, no, so

264
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,560
 Philbert keeps turning, and his head is swelling up in front of Jonas. He has this massive hemorrhage.

265
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:47,680
 Like, you can just see the blood pouring out of his skull and brain, but it's not splitting the skin.

266
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:55,200
 His head is inflating like a balloon, and he turns to Jonas and goes, "Help me!"

267
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:03,920
 And dies. And then Jonas turns to you and goes, "If you picked number five, that was you!"

268
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,560
 He goes back to the saloon. At this point, Jonas is having a real hard time telling it

269
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,320
 between fantasy and reality. He's like, "For some reason, I feel like I'm in a podcast in

270
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,800
 the year 2019. What's going on?" Short time after that, there's only two people left in town. There's

271
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,720
 Jonas and McKinsey, and then one day, there's just Jonas. He's like, "That's weird. This town's even

272
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,400
 more deserted than it normally is. What's going on? There should be two people here." McKinsey,

273
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,960
 McKinsey. His dog comes running up. He's like, "Oh, I forgot I named my dog McKinsey,

274
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,560
 but I wasn't asking for you." McKinsey. His voice is just echoing through the town.

275
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:50,480
 McKinsey. McKinsey's body is never found. Jonas just kind of shrugs and he goes, "If you picked

276
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,320
 number two, you're never found." But I have my made-up way, because I don't want you to just be a

277
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,240
 missing person, because then you can be like, "Well, fine. I just went to Vegas." Ed grabs you and

278
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,520
 brings you into the hell realm where he pokes your eye out, pulls out your teeth, puts him in

279
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,560
 your eye socket, and gives it to a devil baby as a rattle. So that's you. So you would have much

280
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,760
 better off than having just a hemorrhage or your head split open. If you pick number six,

281
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:25,040
 you're Jonas. You're the one who survived to tell the tale of the lucky boy mine and one of the

282
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:32,880
 most frightening examples of a ghost returning from the dead to kill his murderers. DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com
