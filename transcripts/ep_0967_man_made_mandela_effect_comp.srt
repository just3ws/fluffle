1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 What would you do if you were standing at a urinal in a public restroom?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,000
 When all of a sudden you see a man standing in the corner, staring at you with sparkling

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 eyes.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,480
 This isn't a romance episode.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,320
 And then we travel to Greece to take a look at a bizarre encounter that happened on a

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,280
 country road late one night.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,360
 And it all happened when a man called the police to inform the authorities there was

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,320
 something standing in the road.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,480
 Something pretending to be a person.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:47,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,240
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend and I hope you guys got some cool Halloween plans

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,240
 coming up.

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,440
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so first off, walk into Dead Rabbit Command.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,680
 Everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
 Get on your feet.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,880
 I don't care what you're doing.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,240
 You're holding a bunch of babies in a maternity ward.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,560
 Clap those hands for Mori Sato.

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
 Woohoo!

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
 Yeah!

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
 Come on in Mori.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,880
 Mori, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,720
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
 I really do.

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
 Just help spread the word about the show.

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,000
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,160
 If you get any amount of value from the show, please share it with others.

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,760
 That helps the show grow.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,120
 Now, Friday's episode, I ended with a little bit of a cliffhanger.

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,920
 I said I was going to cover the story about this empire that has been completely erased

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
 from history.

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,520
 It's not the Tatarian Empire either.

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,800
 I don't want anyone to think that we're going back down that rabbit hole.

38
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,520
 But that does play a part of it.

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,760
 We're going to look at that theory as well.

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,960
 But I came up with some more information that I wanted to give that story some time to grow.

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,320
 So we're not going to address that one today.

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,480
 Just to let you know that this empire didn't silence me as well.

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,600
 But we'll keep that on the back burner.

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,880
 That'll come out later this week.

45
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,880
 Right now, Mori, I'm going to go ahead and tush the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're going

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,600
 to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

47
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:15,720
 Drive us all the way out to Jolly Old England.

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,760
 Old timey car driving across that world famous continent bridge, spanning the Atlantic Ocean.

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,560
 We're headed to a town called Chester.

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
 And that's in England.

51
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,360
 We're in the city of Chester.

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,560
 It's called a cathedral city.

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,720
 So maybe it used to be a big church that they knocked down all the walls and put up a 7-Eleven.

54
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
 I don't know.

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,160
 Because I'm not interested in that.

56
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,640
 I mean, I could easily looked it up on Wikipedia, right?

57
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 I saw this cathedral city.

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,520
 I was like, "Ah, that's enough information.

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,520
 Let's get to the ghosts because that's what we're about here."

60
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,720
 I'm all about ghosts in public toilets.

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,600
 When I saw that, I was like, "Oh, you got to cover this one."

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,440
 In Chester, there's a place called Fraudsham Street.

63
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,120
 And on Fraudsham Street, this is still here, there's public restrooms.

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,480
 You're like, "Listen to this podcast as you're walking around."

65
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,480
 You're like, "Oh, tell me the address, bro.

66
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
 I have to go to the bathroom.

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
 I have to go to the bathroom."

68
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,320
 You're running up and down Fraudsham Street.

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,240
 Well, hold it in because this story is quite terrifying.

70
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,080
 On Fraudsham Street, there's these public toilets.

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,160
 And because this is a tourist destination, people constantly have to go to the bathroom

72
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,000
 because they're drinking more fluids and they get home.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 They're all dehydrated.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 They're like, "Boss, I need to take a vacation.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I need to drink some fluids.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,440
 Ah, I go to Chester."

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
 So they're drinking a bunch of stuff.

78
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,360
 They're walking around with all big gulps and things like that.

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,760
 And they're like, "Oh, my bladder.

80
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,320
 It's totally going to blow up."

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,480
 You go in the men's restroom and you walk in.

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
 You're all alone.

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,360
 You're all alone in this men's restroom.

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,200
 You walk up to the urinal to go pee.

85
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,000
 Now that's a bad idea to begin with.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Here's a tip.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
 Don't ever use the urinal.

88
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,560
 Don't ever use the urinal because when you're standing at the urinal and you're going pee,

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,960
 someone can walk behind you and get you in a choke hold.

90
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,640
 I'm very rarely use urinals because that's where people beat you up.

91
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,840
 It's never happened to me.

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,040
 It's never happened to me in 46 years of life.

93
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,800
 But when you're standing there, your pants are down, right?

94
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
 You're peeing.

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
 You only got one arm.

96
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,560
 You're going to be elbow them on the side because you still have to pee, right?

97
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,080
 Your bladder's full.

98
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
 You're super exposed.

99
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,400
 I always go to pee in the stall.

100
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,560
 So first off, there's a tip from your good friend, Jason Garminer.

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
 Don't use the urinal.

102
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,040
 You might get choked out and robbed.

103
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,880
 But in this case, you didn't get my advice.

104
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,960
 You're just hanging out.

105
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,400
 You're not worried about getting mugged in England.

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
 You're standing there at the urinal.

107
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
 You're going to the bathroom.

108
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,480
 The second reason that's a bad idea is because of this one event.

109
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,320
 Because of this one story, you should never use the urinal.

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,840
 If you use the urinal at this public restroom in Frodecham Street, you're going to pee.

111
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,440
 And all of a sudden, remember the bathroom was empty.

112
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,080
 Bathroom was empty when you came in.

113
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,480
 All of a sudden, you see out of the corner of your eye, there's a guy standing in the

114
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
 corner.

115
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
 You're like, "Uh-huh."

116
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,200
 You're all of a sudden tucking your chin in so you don't get choked out.

117
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,760
 You turn and you look over and you see this young man.

118
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
 He's standing in the corner.

119
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,920
 You're like, "Wait, there's no urinal over there."

120
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,480
 Also he's staring at me.

121
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
 This is kind of weird.

122
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,200
 And you're looking at this dude.

123
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,040
 You realize he has pale skin, kind of like a sickly look to him.

124
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:31,200
 But his eyes, his eyes are described with such adjectives as sparkling or vivacious.

125
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,560
 They don't say if he winks at you.

126
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,520
 They don't say if he goes, "Ting!"

127
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
 Winks at you.

128
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,360
 He's staring at you with these very lifelike eyes while the rest of them looks like he's

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
 just like deathly ill.

130
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
 You're looking at him.

131
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,000
 You're kind of making eye contact with him now.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,720
 And then you go, "I want to see what the rest of this guy looks like."

133
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,000
 So your eyes begin to travel down his body and that's when you notice in one hand he's

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 holding one of those old to timey straight edge razors.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
 And you're like, "This is not good."

136
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
 But fear not.

137
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
 Fear not.

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
 He's not going to...

139
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,080
 Fear not, dear traveler.

140
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,680
 He's not going to use that razor on you because you look, you breathe a sigh of relief when

141
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
 you see this.

142
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,120
 You're like, "Good."

143
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,920
 He has slit his own wrists and there's this blood pouring out of his forearms, dripping

144
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,440
 off the razor blade, pooling on the bathroom floor.

145
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
 And you're like, "That was a close one.

146
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,160
 I thought it was about to get killed."

147
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,880
 But he just killed himself.

148
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:38,120
 This is the ghost of this public toilet, this public restroom on Ford Sham Street.

149
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,720
 There's been a ton of sightings of this guy.

150
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,200
 This was one of those stories I found on theshadowlands.net.

151
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,280
 Actually, no, it wasn't.

152
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,160
 This was a story I was looking for other stuff.

153
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,200
 I was looking for some other ghost in England and this story kept popping up.

154
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
 I was like, "Oh, that's pretty dope."

155
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,160
 I mean, listen, when I say that it's sad that a man killed himself, I want it to be very

156
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
 clear.

157
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,920
 I feel like I always have to say that I'm never pro-death just so I can tell a ghost

158
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,280
 story.

159
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,800
 But that aside, that's pretty dope, right?

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,240
 Because public restrooms are already scary.

161
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,560
 You could get mugged at any time.

162
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,160
 They're scary because you're so exposed.

163
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,760
 You're doing your pooping or your peeing and it's hard to fight when you're doing either

164
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
 one.

165
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,200
 And if you're doing both, I think you could just not fight.

166
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,520
 I think you could just give them your wallet at that point.

167
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,000
 You're pants are down around your ankles.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,520
 You're trying to squat and poop and punch all at the same time.

169
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
 Probably not a good idea.

170
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,440
 I would be incredibly impressed if you could fold that off.

171
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,320
 Public restrooms are scary.

172
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,720
 Pooping and peeing in public.

173
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,440
 You feel super exposed.

174
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,680
 And then ghost, adding a ghost into that.

175
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,240
 You walk into a restroom and there's a bloody dude standing in the corner.

176
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
 It's so disturbing.

177
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,360
 We talked about it recently on the show.

178
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
 Why are there so many bathroom ghosts?

179
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,680
 And this is one of the stories I was kind of thinking in the back of my head.

180
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,920
 I kind of wanted to tell this one separately.

181
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,840
 A bathroom is actually a perfect place, I think, to contain a ghost.

182
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,320
 You have all this running water and a lot of times running water, bodies of water are

183
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,560
 considered great conduits for spirits.

184
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,840
 I think also all the mirrors can have some sort of reflecting power to it.

185
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,840
 Like, you're just making stuff up now.

186
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
 Bloody Mary's like, "No, stay here.

187
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,000
 It'll be totally awesome."

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,880
 I do think there's something spiritual, something eerie about mirrors.

189
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,800
 Actually I wasn't planning on talking about this, but I recently read this article on

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,400
 AnomAlien.com.

191
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,680
 They were talking about a study that was done where this Italian psychologist Giovanni Caputo

192
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,880
 got some people to stare in mirrors for a long time.

193
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,240
 And then he wrote a paper on it.

194
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,640
 He wrote a paper on how vain Italians are.

195
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,800
 He wrote a paper on it and he said, "Listen, if you have these conditions where you have

196
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,160
 very low light, the lights behind your back and you stare at a large mirror, within a

197
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,440
 minute you'll see something."

198
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,400
 This has always been an origin story for the Bloody Mary type phenomenon.

199
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,280
 When you stare in a mirror long enough, your eyes will try to adjust to the light and it

200
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,240
 will actually distort your face and it will make you look monstrous.

201
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,880
 Looking at this article, he published his results in a journal called Perception.

202
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,120
 He had these 50 volunteers do this mirror test and after 10 minutes, they had to do

203
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
 this for 10 minutes.

204
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
 These were the results.

205
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,560
 66% of the 50 people saw deformities in their own faces, which is what I had always told

206
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,600
 is what would happen and that's what we were figuring out.

207
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,160
 Your brain's trying to process information in very, very low light conditions and it

208
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,840
 starts to distort your face.

209
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
 That's fine.

210
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,880
 60, because you know that's not true, right?

211
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,280
 You know that you're not, "Oh no, I'm an old witch from some comic strip.

212
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,200
 You don't have these giant nodes with all these warts and stuff like that."

213
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,920
 I just walk out of the room.

214
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:00,240
 But 66% of them saw huge deformations in their own face.

215
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,200
 18% of them saw a parent's face.

216
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,680
 So they actually saw one of their relatives face with a monstrous look.

217
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,640
 I was like, "What?

218
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,320
 That's actually a pretty big percentage.

219
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,920
 You're seeing your dad standing behind you and he looks like an old-timey witch."

220
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
 You're like, "Ah!"

221
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:28,800
 18% saw a parent's face and out of that group, 8% of them saw it as alive.

222
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 A parent that was alive and the remaining 10% saw a dead parent staring back at them.

223
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,280
 28% of the total group saw an unknown person, someone they had never recognized.

224
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,120
 18% saw these.

225
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
 These are going to go over 100%.

226
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,480
 Now that I'm looking at these, these clearly go over 100%.

227
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,720
 So I'm thinking there was some morphin going on.

228
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,240
 But 18% saw animal faces appear, such as a cat, a pig, or a lion.

229
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,200
 And 48% saw monsters.

230
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,880
 Which is interesting because again, I always figured, yeah, your face would get deformed

231
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,600
 in low light situations, but these people are seeing separate entities.

232
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,360
 Now like, "Oh, it's my face with a couple of warts and I just have all these bumps

233
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,960
 and bruises on my skin."

234
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
 No.

235
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,480
 They're seeing like Golgarthar, the warlord of the deep or something like that.

236
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,720
 They're seeing these fantastical beasts.

237
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
 They're a unicorn.

238
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,360
 They're like, "Oh, this is totally awesome.

239
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,040
 I'm going to go Grant wishes."

240
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
 Fascinating stuff.

241
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,280
 So I'm wondering maybe the science isn't so cut and dry of mirrors, right?

242
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,680
 Maybe mirrors are a little spooky.

243
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,120
 Because who would have thought you would see monsters in them?

244
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,720
 Like Jason, they're not seeing actual monsters.

245
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
 It's still the same thing.

246
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
 It's still the hallucination.

247
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,000
 But probably.

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 But you have mirrors in this bathroom and you have multiples of them.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,520
 You have the running water and then you have the public space where people keep coming

250
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,800
 in and expending energy, defecating into the water supply and all that stuff.

251
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,400
 It goes into the sewage system.

252
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,560
 I know it's not going into the avion machine factory, but there is something creepy about

253
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,040
 bathrooms and I wonder if they are the perfect ghost catching device.

254
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,800
 And then this one here, we have the added tragedy of...

255
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
 Maybe one thing if you walked in the bathroom and there was just like a little kid go standing

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 in there with a balloon.

257
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 I mean, it's still terrifying.

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It's still a little kid.

259
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,160
 But he's not like actively bleeding on the floor.

260
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,280
 He's like, "I died of internal damage."

261
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,320
 I was like, "Okay, buddy, that's totally fine.

262
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,640
 You do you."

263
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,680
 But yeah, like the blood pooling and everything like that.

264
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,800
 That just makes it so much creepier, creepier the guys bleed and out.

265
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,760
 What's interesting too about using the bathroom as the perfect ghost catching device, they

266
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:51,640
 did do pretty major renovations on this bathroom and the sightings quote unquote intensified

267
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,120
 after the renovations in 2011.

268
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,640
 And I don't know what they mean by intensified.

269
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,840
 I don't mean, I don't know if that means the spirit was appeared in a clearer form.

270
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
 Like you can see them.

271
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,920
 I don't know if he started chasing you around with the razor as you're trying to pee into

272
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,080
 the urinal.

273
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,920
 They've intensified.

274
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,200
 And you know, it's another, I didn't plan on talking about this, but we're going to

275
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,720
 segue to this real quick.

276
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800
 Mori Sato keep us driving around in the Jason Jalopy.

277
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,000
 Also in Chester, there is an old Roman amphitheater.

278
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,280
 Back when Rome actually had settled into the area.

279
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,640
 They built this huge amphitheater back in around 79 AD.

280
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
 And it's pretty big.

281
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,240
 It could hold up to 12,000 spectators and they could sit and watch people roll around

282
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,200
 in the dirt and stab each other in the neck.

283
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,080
 So you had this Roman amphitheater.

284
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,560
 This is on Vickers Lane in Chester.

285
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,680
 And apparently the ghost story goes like this.

286
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:54,200
 You can see an entire legion of Roman troops marching around, marching around, marching

287
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
 around, tour buses are going through them.

288
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,600
 You're like running through them because you have to pee.

289
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 You're like, out of the way legionnaires.

290
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,320
 I got to get to that haunted bathroom.

291
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,880
 Apparently you can see this Roman legion of troops marching around this area.

292
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,120
 What's interesting about that is the earliest sightings of the ghosts were in the time period,

293
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,920
 the two door time period.

294
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,000
 These ghosts were seen a long time ago and you'd see these legionnaires walking around.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,240
 But as we've moved on, that was a long, you know, a couple hundred years ago.

296
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,680
 The two door times, right?

297
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,920
 I obviously know exactly what I'm talking about when I read that off of a webpage.

298
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,200
 Two door times were olden times.

299
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,760
 As time is marched on, the legion has become fainter and fainter.

300
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,880
 Like the old reports are like, it looked just like a real Roman soldier, a whole group of

301
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,200
 Roman soldiers marching around.

302
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,600
 You could hear the armor clinking together.

303
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,280
 But nowadays when people sight them, they're just faded away.

304
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,520
 So again, it goes to that whole story, that whole theory that paranormal activity does

305
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,200
 over time fade away and then stop existing.

306
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,520
 So Chester seems to have a lot of paranormal activity and a lot of pretty strong paranormal

307
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,600
 activity.

308
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,480
 The man in the bathroom who locals call Tom, they don't know who this guy was.

309
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,680
 He's just as alive as ever.

310
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,480
 And maybe because they did the renovations, he came back and he was mad.

311
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,760
 He was a ventral spirit or who knows?

312
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,200
 Maybe they moved the mirrors around and he's trapped for another 100 years.

313
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,320
 I don't know, I'm winging it at this point.

314
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,080
 But it's interesting, it's just outside the bathroom.

315
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,640
 Not like right outside the bathroom, but in the same area you do have this Roman legion

316
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,160
 that over time is slowly, slowly dissipating.

317
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,800
 Morisato, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the world famous carbonicopter.

318
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,200
 We are leaving behind Chester.

319
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,960
 I hope you guys all went to the bathroom on that story.

320
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,720
 Because this time we're going out to a country road somewhere in Greece.

321
00:15:46,720 --> 00:16:16,720
 TATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATAT

322
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,640
 You can hear my bets on this one.

323
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,560
 I think it's a really fascinating story.

324
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,280
 I think it could definitely be plausible.

325
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,680
 I can't get a hold of the person who wrote it.

326
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:36,120
 And the person who wrote it is into the SCP, which is the Secure Contain, Prevent or Protect.

327
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,560
 It is like a creepypasta group.

328
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,920
 So I was like, oh, I hope this really isn't creepypasta.

329
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,480
 But even if it is creepypasta, I think it leads us to an interesting theory.

330
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,800
 Because whether or not this story is 100% true, I do believe stuff like this could have

331
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
 happened.

332
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,240
 Really Jason Yattsch or Slenderman can show up too.

333
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,360
 Let's reserve the creepypastas until the end.

334
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,480
 We'll discuss it because it could be true.

335
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
 I'm taking a punt.

336
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,000
 I really am.

337
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,680
 We're headed back to the year 2006.

338
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,200
 It's November 2006.

339
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,680
 And we're hanging out in the Piraea Police Department.

340
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,000
 So in Greece there's this town called Piraea.

341
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,160
 There's a bunch of cops sitting there, feet up on the desk.

342
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
 Not doing much.

343
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
 It's midnight.

344
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,720
 So how busy can a city's crime problem be at midnight?

345
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,840
 The Piraea police are just kind of hanging out.

346
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,440
 All of a sudden the phone rings.

347
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
 Blalalalala-ing.

348
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
 Blalalalala-ing.

349
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,520
 Officer picks it up.

350
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
 Police, what's going on?

351
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,200
 And there's a guy on the other line and he's panicking.

352
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,400
 The police officer immediately realizes that the caller is really, really upset.

353
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,240
 The caller goes, "Listen, I'm on the road.

354
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,480
 I'm on the road between Piraea and Ney Epivades."

355
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
 And there's something out here.

356
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,520
 There's something out here and I don't know what to do and I really need police to come

357
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,280
 out here and check this out.

358
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,800
 Officer's like, "What are you talking about?

359
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
 What's out there?

360
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
 A log?

361
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 A log fall down?

362
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
 Is there a car accident or something like that?"

363
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:22,000
 And the caller said, "There is a fellow here pretending to be a person."

364
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,560
 Police officer's like, "What are you talking about?

365
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,760
 Is there a vagrant out there?

366
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,160
 What's going on?"

367
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,120
 He can't make sense of that statement.

368
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:38,400
 There's a fellow out here pretending to be a person so the caller responds, "A thing

369
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,440
 is standing in the middle of the road and I can't go near it."

370
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,440
 So the officer goes, "Okay, there must be some hobo out here.

371
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,480
 This guy might be a hobo as well.

372
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,120
 There might be a lot of drinking going on on this road.

373
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,240
 Hey, let's send out a squad car out there though to figure out what's going on.

374
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,720
 Is traffic getting blocked?

375
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
 We got nothing better to do, right?

376
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,360
 So all these people are being robbed on the other side of the street.

377
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,680
 Everyone's using the urinal at the same time being attacked.

378
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,080
 Let's get a squad unit.

379
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,920
 Let's get a squad car out there.

380
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,720
 Let's see what's going on."

381
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,440
 About five minutes later, squad car pulls up to the area and they see the caller standing

382
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,640
 in the middle of the road and the caller turns and looks at him and begins running to the

383
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,720
 police officers.

384
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,840
 And he's pointing.

385
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,520
 He's pointing at something down the street.

386
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,880
 He's sitting there and he's pointing as he's running towards the police.

387
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
 He's pointing.

388
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,680
 The two officers are looking at each other and they're like, "What's going on, dude?

389
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
 What's going on?

390
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,640
 He's blocking the road."

391
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,480
 And they realize that the man, the caller, the person who originally called him, doesn't

392
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,120
 seem, he's either not speaking or he can't speak.

393
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,400
 The person who was previously talking on the phone is now running down the street and he's

394
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,640
 almost just, he's just, just stipulating.

395
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,040
 And it seems like he wants to talk but he can't for some reason.

396
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,920
 Almost like a creepypasta.

397
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,960
 But hold on, hold on.

398
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,400
 So the police officers call back to the station.

399
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,040
 They go, "Hey listen, we got a situation here.

400
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,120
 We got this guy, the guy who called us originally, we think that's him at least."

401
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,280
 He's just kind of freaking out and standing next to us now just pointing and we see what

402
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,680
 he's pointing at.

403
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,840
 There's something in the middle of the street.

404
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,800
 And the officer who's calling home base, he keeps saying there's something in the street.

405
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,280
 There is something in the street and we got it, it is, it's going to block traffic.

406
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,840
 We also don't know what in the world it is.

407
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,560
 It seems to be standing up, it's standing on two feet but it's just growling.

408
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,880
 It just keeps growling.

409
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,360
 So police officers say, "We're going to arrest this dude, this thing."

410
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
 Right?

411
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,520
 "We're going to get him in the back of the squad car."

412
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,960
 "We'll take it back, we'll let you deal with it."

413
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,560
 They're calling it in and when they say we're going to go apprehend it.

414
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
 The line goes dead.

415
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,800
 Okay, here's the thing.

416
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,320
 The more I'm telling it, I read the story, I was like, "Wow, that's cool."

417
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,000
 And then I was writing my notes and I was like, "Wow, this is really cool."

418
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,560
 And the more I'm telling it, it really sounds like a creepypasta.

419
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,240
 But wait, wait.

420
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,120
 Bart Simpson shows up with realistic blood pouring out of his face.

421
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
 Hold on.

422
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,760
 The officer's at the police station.

423
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,120
 They're trying to get a hold of the police officers at the scene and they keep calling

424
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
 it.

425
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
 "Hey, are you guys there?

426
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
 Are you guys there?

427
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
 What's going on?

428
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
 Did you capture the thing?

429
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
 Did you find the thing?

430
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
 Did you capture it?

431
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,280
 Did you capture it?"

432
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,680
 And then just, "Can you just pick up the radio, please?

433
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,000
 Like, what are you guys doing?

434
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 We're getting worried."

435
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,080
 Well, after 30 minutes of this, which is a really long time after police officers go

436
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,880
 off the line, they should add 30 officers there in a heartbeat.

437
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,800
 After 30 minutes of trying to get a hold of these police officers, they go, "Okay, let's

438
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,160
 send another unit out to go check it out."

439
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,640
 And then play this cursed video game.

440
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,240
 Ben drowns as you drive out there.

441
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
 They're like, "What?"

442
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,840
 So they're driving out there.

443
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,760
 This other squad car goes out there.

444
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,360
 And when they get to the scene, because they knew exactly where this was, they knew the

445
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,080
 location they knew was on this rural road, they get there.

446
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,760
 The police officers call back to the station and they go, "Everybody's gone.

447
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
 Everyone's gone.

448
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 There's nobody here."

449
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,560
 And police officers will, like, "What do you mean?

450
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,280
 Does it look like they were pursuing them?

451
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,160
 Does it look like maybe they were chasing something?"

452
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
 And here's the thing.

453
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,520
 They go, "Listen, the person who called us originally, they're gone.

454
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,000
 The police officers are gone.

455
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,880
 The police car is gone."

456
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,560
 And whatever that thing was that everyone was so worried about, it's gone.

457
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,080
 This street is completely empty.

458
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,840
 So you do start to think, did they get overpowered?

459
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,480
 Did they go on some long pursuit with these guys?

460
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,440
 So they begin to search the area and as time goes on, the search perimeter gets bigger and

461
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
 bigger and bigger.

462
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
 They can't find these missing police officers.

463
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,280
 That's their main concern, right?

464
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,720
 These are their brothers in arms.

465
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,360
 They got to find these dudes.

466
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,840
 For 30 days, they're looking for these cops.

467
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,040
 They're not ignoring the guy, the caller, but they definitely want to find their cops.

468
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,640
 And what happens is during their investigation as they're trying to find these people, they

469
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,220
 are able to identify the caller.

470
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,080
 Most likely because he was missing from his work at this point, right?

471
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,240
 30 days have passed.

472
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:48,080
 His name was Athanosios Mercatus, Athanosios Mercatus, who wasn't just some ordinary schmo

473
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
 in town.

474
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,960
 He was actually a very well respected resident and he was also a member of the local municipal

475
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,960
 council.

476
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,160
 So he's a local leader, very well liked person, gone missing.

477
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,120
 Now you have two police officers and a politician gone and the only thing they have to really

478
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,280
 go off of is a location and a phone call saying this thing is pretending to be a person.

479
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,960
 But after 30 days of searching and no idea of where these people are at, the state comes

480
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,760
 in, the state police comes in and says it's not a local police issue anymore, we'll take

481
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,400
 care of it.

482
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:36,800
 Three months after the disappearance, there was a local radio station called Radio Aperius,

483
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,640
 94.5 on the dial if you want to check them out.

484
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,720
 It actually seems more of like a Pop 40 station.

485
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,680
 It wasn't listening to it.

486
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
 I tried.

487
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
 It was in Greek.

488
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
 It was just Greek.

489
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,800
 It was just like this super loud Greek music.

490
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,240
 I was like, "Ugh, that's not for me.

491
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
 That's not for me.

492
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
 No Taylor Swift."

493
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,360
 But apparently it's a Pop 40 station pop Greek music.

494
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,560
 I don't understand it and it was really loud.

495
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:09,120
 But Greek Top 40 music is what it seemed like for the .5 seconds that I actually listened

496
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
 to it.

497
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,480
 I was like, "I've made all judgments based on this."

498
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,520
 Top 40, that's what it looks like, 94.5.

499
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
 Anyways, apparently they also have a news division, which a lot of radio stations do.

500
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,000
 In America they don't anymore, but there's a journalist there and they go, "Hey, I want

501
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 to look into that story.

502
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,440
 Remember a couple months ago when those police officers and that politician went missing?

503
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
 They never found them.

504
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,800
 I want to go see what could be going on just to kind of get an update."

505
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,280
 So that journalist goes to the police department in Paris and says, "Hey, you know, I work

506
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,280
 for the radio station 94.5 Radio Apparice.

507
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,880
 I would like to talk to you, interview you and some of your officers about the missing

508
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,240
 police officers and that politician and the police are like, "What are you talking about?"

509
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,200
 Journalist is like, "Remember, it was just three months ago.

510
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,560
 You had two police officers go missing during a call and the politician was never located

511
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
 either.

512
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
 What was that about?"

513
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,560
 And the police officers are like, "We don't know what you're talking about."

514
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,960
 And the journalist goes, "Okay, well, I obviously got to speak to your boss because this is

515
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
 some sort of cover-up.

516
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,160
 Like, we all know that this happened.

517
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,720
 You guys are having this huge search for 30 days.

518
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,000
 I'm not an idiot."

519
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,480
 So eventually the journalist does get an interview with the police chief and the police chief

520
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,600
 says, "I don't know what you're talking about.

521
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,760
 That never happened."

522
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:36,800
 And apparently the journalist got a copy of a record basically showing that didn't happen.

523
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,320
 It was basically, that's the way the story was presented.

524
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,840
 So it might have been given a list of calls that night, like who actually called 100,

525
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,640
 that's their version of 911.

526
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,920
 Who called the 100 number that night?

527
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:56,680
 Or you know, but basically the police chief was showing them that we never had that call.

528
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
 That never happened.

529
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,000
 I have no idea what you're talking about.

530
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,120
 We never had two police officers and a politician go missing.

531
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
 Nothing.

532
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,680
 Why are you asking to look into a case that doesn't exist?

533
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,600
 I can't really prove to you it doesn't exist, but look at all these records showing that

534
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,360
 we have no record of it.

535
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,840
 Like, this is the day this has happened.

536
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
 This is all this stuff.

537
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
 There's nothing here.

538
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,320
 Then the journalist goes, "Listen, I know that this story happened because I remember

539
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,200
 the name of the politician, Athanasios Merkates."

540
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,360
 So the journalist then starts trying to look at the city council, right?

541
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,200
 Trying to find a record that this guy used to be going to city council meetings and he's

542
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
 not there anymore.

543
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,160
 There is no record of this man ever being a member of the city council.

544
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,920
 No record of the call.

545
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,120
 No missing officers.

546
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,280
 No record of a missing council member.

547
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:54,600
 No record that that council member ever sat on the city government there.

548
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,640
 Everything is gone.

549
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,720
 Now this is a really interesting story because obviously, listen, it could be a creepypasta.

550
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,880
 This came from a guy who he goes by the internet handle SCP Ethics Committee.

551
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,440
 So I'm assuming that is in reference to the creepypasta stuff.

552
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,880
 It's definitely possible.

553
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:22,080
 He does end it by saying, "This story is still discussed among police officers.

554
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,840
 There is a people in the police force still talk about this.

555
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,120
 They were ordered not to reveal anything to anyone who asked, but it's still a really

556
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,880
 creepy event that they talk about.

557
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,280
 He says that his best friend's dad was a cop, which I know is about as legit as saying

558
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,560
 my uncle works for Nintendo."

559
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,320
 But could it be true?

560
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,640
 Now we could look at this story and we could go, "Yes, this could be creepypasta.

561
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,680
 There's the other version.

562
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,400
 This could be an urban legend going among police officers, right?

563
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
 How they're trying to scare each other.

564
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,280
 I'm thinking police officers were famous for those campouts in the middle of the woods,

565
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
 cooking s'mores and telling ghost stories.

566
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,200
 It could be some way to haze the newest recruits."

567
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,960
 So that type of stuff, it could be that.

568
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,320
 The SCP poster, SCP Ethics Committee.

569
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:18,720
 People said this story used to float around on Greek paranormal boards back in the day,

570
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,200
 like around the time this took place.

571
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,080
 It was a story that was floating around on these boards.

572
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,400
 So it's possible it was creepypasta back then.

573
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,000
 He's repeating it as truth.

574
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,120
 It's possible that he's making it up whole cloth.

575
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,840
 It's possible the story's an urban legend.

576
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,800
 It's possible that the story has elements of truth to it.

577
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,440
 Or it's possible that it's a little bit of everything.

578
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,600
 The reason why I wanted to tell this story, I thought it was kind of cool.

579
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,440
 If it was just a creepypasta, I'm sorry for wasting your time.

580
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,840
 I really am.

581
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,960
 But if it's true, I do think this is how this type of stuff would play out, obviously.

582
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,800
 You would have, because here's the thing, whether or not this story is true, we've seen

583
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,240
 similar stories that have taken place in the Soviet Union before the fall of communism.

584
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,960
 You would have another group come in and they would look just like regular police officers

585
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,440
 or state police officers, but they'd basically be federal just wearing these uniforms of

586
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
 these police.

587
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,160
 They'd come in, they'd take all the files, and they would just completely delete all

588
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,720
 proof that these people existed.

589
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,280
 If this was something they wanted to cover up.

590
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,360
 And it's exceedingly easy to do that.

591
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,720
 It's exceedingly easy.

592
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,880
 You'd be shocked how easy it is to eradicate information.

593
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,800
 Like we talked about this on a recent episode.

594
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,520
 I said, I think the body count from Hurricane Katrina was much higher than the official

595
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
 number.

596
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,920
 I think it was like 5,000 to 6,000 people died.

597
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,480
 Because you had all these reports.

598
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,560
 You had all these reports of all these bodies.

599
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,880
 And I think you can even count all the people who got murdered or just killed leaving the

600
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
 area, right?

601
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,400
 And then you have the people who were killed in the Thunderdome or not Thunderdome.

602
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
 That's from Mad Max.

603
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,400
 But they had to take all the refugees, put them in the Superdome, right?

604
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,320
 The giant football arena.

605
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,440
 And it's not made to be a humanitarian place.

606
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,000
 And I think the government artificially kept those numbers down so they wouldn't exceed

607
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,960
 the death toll of 9/11, which was around 3,000.

608
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,440
 2,997, I think.

609
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,240
 I think you had more people died during Hurricane Katrina.

610
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,080
 And the thing, what I'm saying is that you wouldn't know that if you lost your grandpa

611
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,440
 during Hurricane Katrina, and they said 1,500 people or 2,000 people died, you would assume

612
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,360
 they're counting your grandpa or your uncle or your sister.

613
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,560
 You would assume that that.

614
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,040
 But that's not the truth.

615
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,600
 They're actually leaving people out.

616
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,840
 Or they're saying, well, they didn't die during the hurricane.

617
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,880
 They drowned two days later.

618
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,200
 So technically, Hurricane Katrina didn't kill them.

619
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,920
 They're able to wiggle all this stuff.

620
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,840
 It's super easy to do stuff like that.

621
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,040
 And that's just fudging numbers.

622
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,400
 I think that would be even easier.

623
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,920
 But you could.

624
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,280
 You would go, what about the people who knew this guy, who worked on the city council?

625
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:05,240
 Again, you would assume if you're on that city council and a council member went missing

626
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,360
 and you thought that was weird, but they looked for him for a month and then the state police

627
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
 came in.

628
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,320
 You would assume that the state police is sparing no expense to find this guy.

629
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,800
 He'll pop up eventually.

630
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,440
 And then you'd stop thinking about it.

631
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,400
 You're not going to use your power to press on the state police to figure out what's going

632
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
 on.

633
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,280
 And then one of them, after six, eight months, did.

634
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,520
 Like this journalist, go, hey, what's going on with this?

635
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,400
 But most people would just, we always assume that the government has our back and they're

636
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,280
 taking care of it.

637
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,000
 But if one of these politicians or one of these people in a position of power went to

638
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,880
 talk to the police, the police would say the same thing.

639
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,680
 I don't know what you're talking about.

640
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,920
 That person was never reported missing.

641
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,160
 Would you continue to go up the government ranks and try to find that out?

642
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,560
 Would you start putting your...

643
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,800
 And then you would run into the speed of a month and they go, listen, you're asking too

644
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,640
 many questions and I know you really like your job on the city council.

645
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,320
 We'd hate to see you lose your position.

646
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,360
 I mean, you like it, right?

647
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,960
 And obviously that's the veiled threat.

648
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,760
 Now I tried looking for this person.

649
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,840
 Not in flat degrees and started going through the bushes.

650
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,040
 There is no mention of this person's name anywhere online.

651
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,280
 Now that would make sense if it's a fake name, right?

652
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:27,240
 If it's a fake name written for creepypasta, that would totally make sense.

653
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,160
 But it would also make sense if it was not creepypasta and he was completely scrubbed.

654
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,640
 And really there's a huge difference between the internet of 2012 forward and 2012 back.

655
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,560
 Now so much stuff is being archived.

656
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:47,480
 But again, I archive things all the time trusting archive.org and the way back machine.

657
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,560
 You know, what happens when they get a something from the government, a letter from the government

658
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,480
 or an order saying delete these pages that have been archived.

659
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,040
 They would do it.

660
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,000
 And I wouldn't be any wiser.

661
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,680
 I just have all these archive links in my website.

662
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,080
 So it's super easy to make information disappear.

663
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,920
 We know that and it's super easy to make facts and figures disappear.

664
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,440
 We know that.

665
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,240
 So it's not a stretch to make a person disappear.

666
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,480
 Not physically, but all record of them.

667
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
 So it's an interesting story.

668
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,160
 Again, if it's creepypasta, I really apologize for wasting time because I don't like reading

669
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
 creepypasta.

670
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
 I mean, I like it.

671
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,680
 It's entertaining, but I wouldn't waste your time on the show.

672
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:36,240
 But I do like it as an example of how easy it would be to not only cover up that this

673
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,880
 is being investigated or was ever investigated, but cover up the fact that these people ever

674
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,040
 existed.

675
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,240
 It sounds ludicrous.

676
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,160
 It actually sounds like it would be hard, but it's far easier to do with the internet

677
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,000
 than it ever was.

678
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,440
 Because not only can you erase evidence of these people ever existed, you can plant evidence

679
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,640
 supporting that they never existed.

680
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,680
 Just this big wheel turning, which sucks because we would think if we were the ones missing,

681
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,120
 if we were the ones that faced some sort of tragedy, we want to think that all stops are

682
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,840
 being pulled to save us.

683
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:19,200
 But it depends on the circumstances of our calamity.

684
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,360
 It could be the opposite.

685
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:28,840
 Not only could it be, no one's looking for us, but there could actively be a campaign

686
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,080
 to make it seem like we never existed.

687
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,040
 A man-made Mandela effect.

688
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,520
 To the point that even this journalist after asking so many questions has to wonder, am

689
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,400
 I going crazy or did this story actually happen?

690
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,760
 Because there's zero proof of it, but I know that it happened.

691
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,560
 What we're talking about is a man-made Mandela effect.

692
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,280
 We have to ask ourselves, is this a super rare occurrence?

693
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,480
 Or does it happen all the time?

694
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,760
 But unless we're following the story in the media, unless we're investigating it on our

695
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,880
 own, we have no idea these little changes that are taking place.

696
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,640
 To the point that when we're confronted with information that is contrary to what we believe,

697
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,680
 we have to ask ourselves, well, am I wrong?

698
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,800
 Maybe I misheard that.

699
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,520
 Maybe that was just some story I heard, but I'm pretty sure I remember that.

700
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,200
 But here's this information.

701
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,400
 You have to choose what you believe.

702
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:51,520
 A foggy mind, a whispered memory, or the facts laid out on paper in front of you.

703
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,960
 It's a terrifying story.

704
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,680
 We're comforted because we are the ones looking at the paper.

705
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,920
 We're the ones who can walk away and go, maybe I was wrong about that.

706
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:11,440
 And we hope we're never the ones who went missing.

707
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:21,160
 Because in the end, not only is nobody looking for us, nobody even remembers we existed in

708
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,160
 the first place.

709
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,840
