1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 Previously on Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:02,940
 *Growl*

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,940
 *Shrrrrr*

4
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,100
 Knocking stuff over!

5
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,600
 This is a Dead Rabbit show!

6
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,200
 Whatever it's called, Dead Rabbit Radio is the actual name,

7
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,400
 but this show is revealing the secret truths we have.

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,200
 Every episode he does is true!

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,800
 But some of his episodes contradict the other episodes that he does.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
 It doesn't matter!

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 Those episodes are actually even more true!

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,900
 We have to stop him.

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,600
 We have to stop him before he exposes all of our evil plans!

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
 *Pfft*

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,800
 *Pfft*

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,800
 *Pfft*

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,100
 Oh man, so fun playing Apex Legends while my break's going on,

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,600
 but it's time to shut it off!

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,400
 And now I'm going to sit back, relax, and assume nothing bad is going to happen!

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,800
 *Pfft*

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,700
 Oh, what was that?

22
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,300
 Game's off!

23
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,200
 *Pfft*

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,400
 I ran outside!

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,500
 *Pfft*

26
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
 Open my squeaky door!

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
 Oh my god.

28
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
 Oh my god.

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,800
 Bodies.

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,400
 Everywhere.

31
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,900
 The destruction, if you could only see it, is...

32
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
 It's shocking.

33
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,200
 But I don't know any of them, so...

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,000
 That's cool.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,700
 But...

36
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,500
 Oh my god.

37
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,100
 My...

38
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,500
 My hanger.

39
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,300
 And my garage that's attached to my hanger.

40
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,600
 *Pfft*

41
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,500
 No, I wasn't clapping.

42
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,300
 I was running into the hanger.

43
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,200
 Oh my god, no.

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,800
 Carpenter copter.

45
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,900
 It's on fire.

46
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
 Oh my god, and it's destroyed.

47
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,700
 It's completely destroyed.

48
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,400
 *Pfft*

49
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,300
 The Jason Jalopy.

50
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,200
 Oh no.

51
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
 Oh no, the Jason Jalopy burned to a crisp.

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,100
 *Pfft*

53
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,900
 Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

54
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,100
 Oh my god.

55
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,300
 The Dead Rapid Durageable is still here, and it's in one piece.

56
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,500
 No!

57
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 There's only one thing I can do now.

58
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,700
 I have to assemble a team.

59
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,300
 *Pfft*

60
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,300
 *Pfft*

61
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,500
 *Pfft*

62
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,200
 *Pfft*

63
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,100
 After I finish playing some more Apex Legends, but now I will assemble my team.

64
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,200
 So, I heard you're the man to come to...

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,100
 If I need some muscle.

66
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,300
 Mmmmm.

67
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,900
 Mungo has lots of muscle.

68
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,400
 Given to me by god, and supplements.

69
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,100
 Thank you, Mungo, will you be on my team?

70
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,500
 *Mungo grunts*

71
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
 As long as we can push nerds.

72
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
 Hey, do that anyways.

73
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,900
 Come on, Mungo.

74
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,900
 Hey.

75
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,500
 *Mungo grunts*

76
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,900
 A bunch of pictures being taken.

77
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
 *Pfft*

78
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,100
 I don't know how to make that sound.

79
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,900
 *Pfft*

80
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,700
 I don't have phones.

81
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,500
 Either using phones.

82
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 There's no noises.

83
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,100
 All these photos are being taken.

84
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,900
 Hey, hey.

85
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,600
 *Gasp*

86
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,900
 Jason, my best friend ever.

87
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,500
 Yes, yes, Miley Cyrus.

88
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,700
 It is I, your best friend.

89
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,900
 I'm putting together a team.

90
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,100
 Say no more.

91
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,500
 Now, we just have one more person to put on our team.

92
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 *Mungo grunts*

93
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 Hello?

94
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
 Hello?

95
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
 Hello?

96
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 Is anyone here?

97
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 Here?

98
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,100
 *Mungo grunts*

99
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,500
 Mungo no like this house.

100
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 Looks like Gollum's house from nerd novel.

101
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,100
 Yeah, what we're about to face is far worse than Gollum.

102
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,500
 *Mungo grunts*

103
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 Did you know?

104
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
 Did you know?

105
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 Did you know?

106
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 Did you know?

107
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 Did you know?

108
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
 Did you know?

109
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 Okay, Franz, Franz, dude, quit creeping us out with your-

110
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
 How are your arms that long?

111
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,500
 Why do you come here?

112
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 Franz, listen, dude, what, truce, I need your help to fight the bad guys who blow up all

113
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 my stuff.

114
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 Hmm, you need my help.

115
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 As I sound very Gollum-like?

116
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 Yes, Franz, we need your help.

117
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 I'm declaring a truce.

118
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 Hmm, did not know about the truce.

119
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 What do you have to offer me?

120
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,500
 How about a 12 pack of diet cranberry spray?

121
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 Maybe, listen, Franz, you don't have anything better going on.

122
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 You're scurrying around your dark apartment.

123
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 Just come with us.

124
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 Okay.

125
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,500
 And now, season five of Dead Rabbit Radio.

126
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 Pshh, pshh, pshh.

127
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 Meow.

128
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,500
 That's a preview when we go to the jungle and we get attacked by a giant cat and I throw

129
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
 Franz in front of it.

130
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,500
