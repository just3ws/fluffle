1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
 Two brothers engaged in murderous tactics to win over a goldmine.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,880
 Are they still fighting their battle to this very day?

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,760
 What happens when a woman goes to the doctor just to get treated for asthma and ends up

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,800
 becoming the talk of the town?

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,480
 And then we cover the story of a time-traveling train.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:31,680
 A story that is so bizarre, this very episode may have already traveled back in time.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,680
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:44,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,720
 Hope you guys are having a great day too, hope you guys are having a lot of fun.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:56,120
 I hope you guys are 20% less sweaty than I am because I'm dripping sweat.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,800
 I'm recording this podcast, this is like 9.30 at night.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,040
 I feel like the swamp thing.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,160
 I feel like something of the swamp thing would go like "No, I'm good, I'm good, I will

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,280
 go fight some other monster, you're too sweaty."

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,720
 No segue, no segue away from that.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,000
 Let's go ahead and take a look at today's submission for FANAR FRIDAY.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,160
 This is old, this is from episode 154, something like this.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,080
 I got this off of the original Discord way back in the day.

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,760
 I mean, this is old school and it was made by Snippy Jammin on Newgrounds.

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
 It's not old.

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,160
 The first new true, this still has a Newgrounds account.

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,200
 It's a picture of MUNGO, one of the very few reoccurring characters on this show, from

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,760
 one of still one of my favorite episodes.

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,280
 The story about a Christian scientist who believed that there were not like the religion

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,120
 Christian scientist, but he was a Christian and a scientist who believed that every planet

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,000
 in the universe had a ton of people on it.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,360
 It's a really, really interesting episode.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,280
 I'll put it in the show notes and that is a picture of his father, Mungo Dick.

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,600
 Real name, not a joke, not a joke.

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,520
 Someone named their son Mungo Dick.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,120
 So thank you Snippy Jammin.

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,400
 I will check out your Newgrounds account and I'm sure you have some cool video games

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
 recommended as I do.

35
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,640
 I spent so much time on Newgrounds back in the day.

36
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,080
 All Hallows Eve was my favorite game.

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,720
 Oh wait, Flash isn't even on.

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,040
 I don't think you can have Flash anymore.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,960
 But if I can find all Hallows Eve, I'll put that in the show notes as well.

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
 My brain has become water at this point.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,040
 I'm totally just talking about random stuff.

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,160
 But this dude's not random.

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,160
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command writing on the back of a stegosaurus.

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 It's Rabbit Fish.

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,680
 Everyone give a round of applause to Rabbit Fish.

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,400
 Rabbit Fish just joined the Patreon.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,040
 One of the earliest listeners of this show.

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
 Thank you for joining the Patreon.

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
 It really means a lot.

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,960
 Rabbit Fish, I'm going to go ahead and toss you some coal.

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,880
 We're going to hop back into the Carboner Caboose.

52
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,080
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

53
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,960
 We are headed out to Gold Hill, North Carolina.

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,000
 Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga Chugga

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
 We were there earlier in the week.

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,320
 They actually seem to have a lot of ghosts in North Carolina.

57
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,000
 I didn't know it was one of the most haunted places in America.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 But we're back here.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's Gold Hill.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,560
 We're back on the Gold Rush days.

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,280
 North Carolina actually had the first major Gold Rush of the United States before California.

62
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,560
 And I can already tell you guys right now because that intro was so long with me talking

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,400
 about being sweaty and fighting the swamp thing.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,280
 We're not going to have time for the medical freak story.

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,320
 So if you were here for that one, tune in Monday.

66
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,000
 We're at, I don't want you to wait with bated breath through this one and be like, "Oh

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,240
 man, I have asthma."

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,720
 And I was the talk of the town.

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,240
 Maybe he's going to do an episode on me.

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,960
 I spent too long on the intro.

71
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,840
 But anyways, so it's January 1954.

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,120
 We're at Gold Hill, North Carolina.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,480
 There's this big mine hole.

74
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
 What are these things called?

75
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 Caves.

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
 Caves, right?

77
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,160
 There's this giant hole in the mountain.

78
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
 Two people are walking around.

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,120
 It doesn't say what they're doing at the mine shaft.

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,760
 The mine shaft has long been closed.

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,000
 So we know they're not miners.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,160
 I'm thinking they were there like to neck.

83
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,440
 I'm thinking they were there probably to like make out or something like that.

84
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
 It was a young couple.

85
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
 They're out in the middle of nowhere.

86
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
 They're by this mine shaft.

87
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,400
 Hey Betty, you want to see a fork throw rock down the mine shaft?

88
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,680
 Like I don't think they were there to goof off.

89
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,760
 I think they were there to goof off if you know what I mean.

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
 Sometimes I'm hitting your ribs with my elbow.

91
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,480
 You're like, Jason, I got it.

92
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,760
 They're going to make out.

93
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,080
 These two witnesses are hanging out around the Gold Hill mine.

94
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,280
 And just when things are getting a little haun heavy, if you know what I mean, you're

95
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,160
 like, Jason, yes, we know what you mean.

96
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,400
 Just finish the story.

97
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,560
 This is why you can never get to the story about the woman with asthma.

98
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,120
 Because you're always going off on these tangents.

99
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
 Okay, okay, fine.

100
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
 I'll tell you the story.

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,080
 So I'm so sweaty.

102
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,280
 I can barely think.

103
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
 It's so hot in here.

104
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,800
 It's like recording a podcast in a microwave.

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,640
 This couple is at the mine shaft.

106
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
 They're making out.

107
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:09,560
 And then all of a sudden they look over and they see a floating arm.

108
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
 That's alarming enough.

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,960
 If you were with someone, if you were with someone and you're trying to kiss them, they

110
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,520
 see a floating arm.

111
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,640
 That's totally going to totally ruin the mood.

112
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,000
 But then they see a floating foot and then a floating thigh.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
 They're like, what?

114
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,560
 How many floating body parts are there going to be?

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
 All of them.

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,880
 Coming out of the mouth of the cave was a bunch of body parts floating in the air.

117
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,720
 They seem to have this bioluminescence to them.

118
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,920
 They're glowing in the dark.

119
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,000
 You see the torso ripped in two legs.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,560
 If this episode is too spooky for you, it's too late to shut it off.

121
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,040
 The torso is ripped in two with ultra realistic blood pouring out of it.

122
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,560
 Thighs and kneecaps and toes and fingers floating through the mine shaft.

123
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:14,560
 They see the head and its eyes are rolling back.

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,360
 Its mouth opening and closing.

125
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,280
 And this assemblage of body parts is floating closer towards the young couple.

126
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:32,060
 And then the sound of lightning deafens them for just a moment.

127
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,960
 The sight vanishes.

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,720
 The young couple runs back to town and they begin telling people, oh my god, you won't

129
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
 believe what just happened.

130
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,560
 Up at Gold Hill Mine and the townspeople go, oh the glowing body part showed up.

131
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,600
 The glowing body part showed up.

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,120
 You were trying to make out with her and a bunch of glowing body parts showed up and

133
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,320
 the head was like, uh, they were like, yeah, that's exactly what happened.

134
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 Do you know?

135
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,560
 Is this something people in town know about?

136
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,960
 Yes, the glowing body parts.

137
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 That's on their map.

138
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,000
 Well you take a left at the glowing body parts and keep driving until you see the gremlins.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,880
 We know who the glowing body parts belong to.

140
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,960
 Back in time, back during the North Carolina Gold Rush, there was two brothers, Joe Newman

141
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,840
 and Walter George Newman.

142
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,720
 They were both owners of the Newman Mine.

143
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,840
 But we're talking about a hole in the earth full of gold.

144
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,360
 Is there really enough gold for two people?

145
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
 There's enough gold.

146
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
 There's enough gold for more than two people.

147
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,280
 But greed got the best of these brothers.

148
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,240
 Joe wants all the gold, Walter wants all the gold, but Walter's a little more vicious.

149
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,200
 Now some people say this was an accident.

150
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,680
 Some people say Joe was just being a little clumsy that day.

151
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,280
 Other people say somehow Walter had planned this.

152
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,680
 You're living in the old times, you own a gold mine, so you are going to have a bunch

153
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,240
 of dynamite in your house.

154
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
 This is just something you have.

155
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,200
 You're like, uh, don't smoke in here.

156
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,440
 This is the dynamite room.

157
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,720
 Let's go to the lounge.

158
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,880
 You have dynamite in your house.

159
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,320
 And one day Joe was at home.

160
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,400
 He's like smoking a big stokey.

161
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,600
 He's like, "Nah, nah, nah, nah."

162
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,720
 Should have turned the light on before I walked into this room.

163
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,400
 I'm sure it's not the dynamite room.

164
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,240
 One day Joe's at his house and the house blows up.

165
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,640
 All the dynamite goes off.

166
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,240
 Joe is blown to pieces.

167
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,120
 Torsho ripped in half.

168
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
 Witnesses said the blood was ultra realistic.

169
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,280
 So when a floating specter of body parts comes floating out of the mine, I'm sure there

170
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,360
 are people who are like, "Joe, is that you?"

171
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,280
 Like I'm sure people recognized him.

172
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,960
 They're like, "Oh Joe, you were always so funny when you rolled your eyes in the back

173
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,760
 of your head and went, 'Arr, arr, arr.'

174
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,800
 You always made all the other miners laugh."

175
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,680
 Some people probably recognize this collection of body parts.

176
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,160
 I recognize that thigh anywhere.

177
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
 That's good old Joe.

178
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,760
 He's always playing the spoons on that.

179
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,880
 People go, "Oh that's Joe.

180
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,000
 That's good old glow in Joe."

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,920
 He's always glowing and floating.

182
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
 Show off.

183
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,200
 His brother though did get control of the mine.

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,560
 Cause that's what's going to happen, right?

185
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,720
 Whether or not Joe blew himself up or Walter somehow planned it, he gets control of the

186
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,600
 mine.

187
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,240
 However, in 1918, as people tend to do, Walter died.

188
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,040
 And it doesn't say that he was killed by a ghost.

189
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,240
 It doesn't say that one day he woke up with a stick of dynamite in his mouth.

190
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
 He just died.

191
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,040
 He just died like normal humans die.

192
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:51,760
 But to this day, some people say if you visit the Newman Mine, you'll see not one ghost,

193
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,720
 but two.

194
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:02,960
 The floating limbs of Joe Newman and the ghastly spirit of Walter as well.

195
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:12,920
 He will walk out of the mine at dusk and travel into the nearby towns.

196
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,440
 Is he looking for his gold?

197
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,000
 Did he become the leprechaun when he died?

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,080
 Is he looking for more gold or is he trying to hide from his brother?

199
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:30,880
 The brother he blew to smithereens.

200
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,000
 Spooky ghost story, I think if you're afraid of floating body parts, it's terrifying.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,080
 The reason why I love this story is this is the type of story that would get me to go

202
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,480
 out there.

203
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,560
 We've covered other stories this week where he had the glowing ball in the mine because

204
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,760
 the one dude got murdered.

205
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,640
 I mean, she's in the arch of paranormal research.

206
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,120
 There's a bunch of phantoms floating around the library.

207
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,320
 Are they blown to pieces?

208
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
 I'm not going.

209
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,800
 They're like, "Oh, we're getting possessed."

210
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 I'm like, "Yawn."

211
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 You know what I mean?

212
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
 Glowing lights, you could always say that's some sort of gas fissure or something like

213
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
 that.

214
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,000
 The woman in the horse that's the one we covered yesterday, the woman in the horse running

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,840
 through North Carolina.

216
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
 What am I supposed to do?

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,920
 Walk around North Carolina up and down that street until maybe I see a horse.

218
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,960
 This one is creepy.

219
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,920
 I would go out to a mine shaft and if it was just a glowing ball, I wouldn't be interested

220
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
 in it.

221
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,560
 But first off, it's not just one, but two ghosts.

222
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,720
 So that's great.

223
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,080
 And two, one of the ghosts is absolutely disgusting.

224
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,720
 If I want to see a ghost, then I do.

225
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,560
 I've seen ghosts before, but you still want to see ghosts.

226
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
 You want to see future ghosts.

227
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,800
 If you had your choice between, "Okay, here's how I'm going to rate them."

228
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 I'm taking this away.

229
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,440
 I don't have time to talk about the asthma story.

230
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,280
 I'm going to rate ghosts I want to watch.

231
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,480
 First off, super gross.

232
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,080
 No, no.

233
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,160
 First off, spooky ghosts.

234
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,000
 I remember once I covered a story about this young couple were at a hotel.

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,320
 They walked into the hallway and they saw a screaming head just floating there.

236
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,200
 It was just screaming and then it slowly faded away, but they could still hear the screaming

237
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,640
 and then that faded away afterwards.

238
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,800
 That is a ghost I would want.

239
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 That's terrifying, right?

240
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,720
 Or like you turn around and there's like a skeleton all covered in blood and gore.

241
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,800
 And see that moves into the next one if it's not spooky.

242
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,360
 Like a skeleton with eyeballs going, "Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah."

243
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
 That's spooky.

244
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,760
 It's actually kind of funny right in plain as ribcage.

245
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,680
 He's like, "Stop it.

246
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,600
 Spooky ghosts are the best one.

247
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,840
 Eight foot tall grim reaper guys."

248
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,840
 Stuff like that.

249
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,280
 Secondly, super gross ghosts, which is why that head one was so great.

250
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,320
 So like ghosts or Charmander, the one in Oregon, the Charmander one who jumps in the

251
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
 back of your car.

252
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,840
 I'll put that in the show notes as well.

253
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,640
 I love ghosts like that because it's super gross, right?

254
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,160
 Like you want to see them all like decayed and chasing you and you want to see them like

255
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,720
 grody, right?

256
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,040
 I, if I, again, we're breaking them down.

257
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,560
 Like if some butler wants to show up tonight, some butler ghost wants to show up tonight

258
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
 at my place.

259
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,120
 I'm not going to kick them out, but I might be a little unimpressed until like he pulls

260
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,480
 his skin off and I'm like, "Now that's what I'm talking about.

261
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,960
 Let me grab my camera."

262
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,240
 And then you have, so you have scary ghosts.

263
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,840
 Those are the best to see, which I've seen scary ghosts and I've seen gross ghosts as

264
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
 well.

265
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,480
 And then the third one down that I've never seen is like a super hot ghost.

266
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,240
 Like a ghost in like old Victorian clothing or like Elizabethian clothing.

267
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,640
 And she's like, she's built, you know, she's pretty stacked, right?

268
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,080
 She's thick.

269
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,240
 And she's like just flown around and I'm like, "Hey, hey, you come here often?"

270
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,840
 She's like, "Yeah, I've been haunting the place for a hundred years."

271
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,280
 I was like, "Oh, that's the only pickup line I have."

272
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
 Like a hot guy.

273
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,480
 I've never seen a sexy ghost before.

274
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,800
 And then after that, a normal ghost.

275
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,960
 And then after that, like orbs and all that stuff are at the bottom.

276
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,640
 Like I would just be like, "Oh my God, that's so impressive."

277
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,160
 You came back from the dead, but you're only a three foot glowing orb.

278
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,440
 Call me when you get hot or gross, one of the two.

279
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
 So there you go.

280
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
 That is what you didn't ask for it.

281
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,800
 You didn't ask her at all.

282
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,040
 There is Jason's ranking of ghosts.

283
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,440
 Yeah, I've seen scary ghosts before.

284
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,720
 I've seen ghosts of people with like, with no face.

285
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,280
 Like like bloody skeletal, like muscle tissue ghosts type of thing.

286
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,360
 And I saw that little blue boy for the longest time.

287
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,880
 I'm pretty sure I talked about that on the show.

288
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,560
 I'll have to look and it's really hard.

289
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,200
 I don't have show notes for my personal stories.

290
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,560
 So sometimes I don't know if I've talked about it before, but I sure I talked about

291
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,280
 that little blue boy that I ran over with my car.

292
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,320
 Like Jason, you never told us a story.

293
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,760
 I ran over this ghost with my car and then it haunted me for like months.

294
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
 It like followed me to work.

295
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
 I thought I was losing my mind.

296
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
 It was terrifying.

297
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,120
 Maybe I'll be able to find that in the show notes.

298
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,080
 But that's actually a great segue.

299
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,040
 Believe it or not, I did not plan that.

300
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,880
 I don't really plan anything on this show.

301
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
 I just have a couple notes.

302
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,720
 It's a great segue though to our next story.

303
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,880
 Rabbitfish, it's actually interesting that Rabbitfish is on this show because he's been

304
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,440
 listening to the show since the early days.

305
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,000
 Rabbitfish, I'm going to toss you the keys of the carboner copter.

306
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,960
 We are headed out to Italy.

308
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,300
 One of the things that I say at the end of the show that I truly mean and pretty much

309
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,680
 everything I say on the show I truly mean, I can't think of any time I've like lied.

310
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,640
 I'm like, I hope you're having a terrible day.

311
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,600
 I'm having a great day, but I hope yours is awful.

312
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,160
 No, when I say you don't have to listen to every episode, but thank you for listening

313
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
 to this one.

314
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
 I'm glad you listened to this one.

315
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,360
 I actually think is how it goes.

316
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,960
 I mean that.

317
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,680
 It's awesome that people are listening to these episodes.

318
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,080
 Very rarely do people listen to all the episodes.

319
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,760
 A lot of you guys have emailed me and said, "Hey dude, I've listened to every single episode."

320
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
 Which is awesome.

321
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,320
 But a lot of people can't.

322
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
 And I'm not like, "Oh man, you didn't listen to 670?

323
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
 What are we on?

324
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,240
 684 episodes?

325
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,920
 You didn't listen to what is that, 300, 400 hours of content?"

326
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,240
 You're not a true fan.

327
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,160
 I view it as like the nightly news.

328
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,920
 You don't watch the nightly news every single night.

329
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,600
 Some people do.

330
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,360
 But I don't get offended if people do.

331
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,200
 If I was a newscaster, that's kind of how I view this show.

332
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,560
 I don't get offended if you were a weatherman and they're like, "Hey man, I really love

333
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
 your weather report."

334
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
 Oh yeah?

335
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,920
 Well, what was the weather last week then, huh?

336
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,560
 And they just go, "I watch the weather every single day."

337
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,400
 That's how I view this show.

338
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,920
 But I do appreciate it if people listening to it.

339
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,920
 So this next story is going to be weird.

340
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,600
 Some of you have listened to every single episode of the show.

341
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,400
 Some of you have listened to a lot of them.

342
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,560
 Some of you, this may be your first episode.

343
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,120
 And thank you if you're still around after all that randomness.

344
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,280
 But I can almost guarantee, and maybe I can't guarantee you.

345
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,160
 I'm not giving you your money back or anything.

346
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,240
 I'm not giving you your time back.

347
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,680
 I'm going to tell you this story and we've already heard it.

348
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,040
 And not like you've heard it on another podcast, not like you've already heard it on a YouTube

349
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,400
 channel or you've already read an article on it.

350
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
 No.

351
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
 You've already heard me tell this story.

352
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,000
 But I haven't recorded it yet.

353
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
 Really really bizarre phenomenon.

354
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,560
 Whenever I have this feeling, because listen, I'm 44 years old.

355
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,280
 I've produced 684 episodes of this show.

356
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,720
 Each one has two or more spooky stories.

357
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,880
 I have come very close to covering the same thing twice.

358
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,800
 And actually in early episodes I warned you guys about that.

359
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,320
 I go, there's a chance it all covered because my memory is going.

360
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,520
 I'm 44 years old.

361
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
 I'm consuming all this information.

362
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,560
 Maybe a chance I tell the same story more than once, especially a personal story.

363
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,720
 And here's why.

364
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,600
 If I think I've already recorded a story, I go to my website that has all of my episodes,

365
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,800
 my podcast website.

366
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,360
 You can listen to the podcast online other than YouTube or Spotify and stuff like that.

367
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,280
 You can just go to my website.

368
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,800
 And I go into the search bar and I'll type in, like say, "Gold Hill."

369
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,360
 Let's say a couple months from now, I think I'm going to do a story about Ghosts in Gold

370
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,640
 Hill and I go, "I think I already got this."

371
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
 I'll type in "Gold Hill."

372
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,240
 It'll pull it out right out of one of the headlines or even the URL.

373
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,760
 And I'll be like, "Oh, I did cover that before.

374
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,560
 I already covered that story."

375
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,680
 And because my show notes are so comprehensive and it's something that I'm very proud of

376
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,920
 because a lot of podcasts, especially podcasts like this, don't source their stuff.

377
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,840
 And I think it's important.

378
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,680
 That's why I feel comfortable doing 15, 20 minute segments.

379
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,120
 Because if you're really, really interested in it, you can do more research.

380
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,520
 I really pack in as much as I can into those 15, 20 minutes.

381
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,120
 Like I don't leave a lot of stuff out.

382
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,680
 But if you ever want to know more, you can go to those show notes and you can read those

383
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
 articles.

384
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,840
 So I'm very proud of my show notes.

385
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
 They're very, very comprehensive.

386
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,480
 My personal stories, there are none because what I'm supposed to link to, my grandma's

387
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,800
 phone number.

388
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,680
 So this story we're about to cover, I've already recorded it.

389
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,040
 I swear that I've done this story.

390
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,440
 There are parts of it that I'm like, "I already did this."

391
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,320
 But when I look for it in my show notes, I can't find it anywhere.

392
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,480
 I've tried all sorts of terms.

393
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,000
 I've never spoke of this story.

394
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,520
 I've never spoke of this company.

395
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,240
 I've never spoken of this amount of people.

396
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,200
 I was going through every episode where the word "train" appeared in the show notes,

397
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,760
 either in the headline of an article or the URL.

398
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,920
 And I've never talked about the story before, but I'm pretty sure I recorded it.

399
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,840
 And I was talking about this to the people who joined me on the Patreon live episode

400
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,400
 that I record on Sunday mornings.

401
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,520
 They come to the Discord.

402
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,880
 And I told them this story and I go, "Doesn't that sound familiar?"

403
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,640
 And a couple of them said, "Yeah, it does."

404
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,200
 So for an episode that's dealing with time travel, could the episode itself already

405
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,240
 traveled back in time?

406
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,800
 Let's take a look at this story.

407
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,080
 July 14th, 1941.

408
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,880
 We're in the Lombardi Mountains in Italy.

409
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,920
 Zenetti is an Italian train company.

410
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,040
 They've created a new model train, state of the art.

411
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,920
 They got wheels on this one.

412
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,600
 They're other ones that didn't do too well.

413
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,240
 There's three luxurious compartments for passengers.

414
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,600
 This thing is ready to rock.

415
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,480
 Zenetti actually, for this maiden voyage, tells people, "You know what?

416
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,160
 This ride, it's on us.

417
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
 It's free."

418
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,840
 Now, if you told them what Jehovah was that, I think they told their normal,

419
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
 normal clientele.

420
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,920
 They go, "We got this new train.

421
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,680
 This is going to be the way you're going to want to travel around Italy."

422
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
 Hop on board.

423
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
 The trip's on us.

424
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,440
 The alcohol will flow and the food will be...

425
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,720
 There's 100 passengers on this train and six crew members.

426
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,680
 And it's stocked to the brim with drinks and food.

427
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,600
 The maiden voyage starts off without a hitch.

428
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,760
 The train chugga chugga chugga's along the track and the people who work for Zenetti

429
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,460
 are waving to it and they're like, "Man, that sure was awesome.

430
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,240
 That train is going to be the Cadillac."

431
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,840
 Is Cadillac invented back then in 1911?

432
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,600
 That train is going to be the bee's knees.

433
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,160
 And they watch the train go down the track chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga.

434
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,480
 Now if this is just a normal train story, right, that's what I want to talk about it

435
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
 on this podcast.

436
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,960
 It's another podcast about old-timey trains.

437
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,920
 The reason why I'm talking about it is the train never reached its destination.

438
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,160
 So the business people, they're trying to wave high to the train.

439
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,680
 It never shows up.

440
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,800
 Their arms get tired and they're also worried about their massive investment.

441
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,720
 They're not just worried about their cramps.

442
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,280
 They send a search and rescue team.

443
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,200
 They must have broken down somewhere.

444
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,360
 You got to figure out what happened to this train.

445
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,480
 And as they're looking for this train, they get to a tunnel in the Lombardy Mountains

446
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,760
 and there's two dudes just kind of sitting on the ground.

447
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,480
 People are like, "What?"

448
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,840
 And the search and rescue team goes, "Hey, you vagrants, what are you guys doing in the

449
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
 middle of nowhere?

450
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,200
 Did you happen to see a train that went by here?"

451
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
 And the two guys were insane.

452
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,760
 Those are the worst witnesses you could ever...

453
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
 Let me list the witnesses.

454
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,160
 I want the least, least of all, insane ones.

455
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
 Block.

456
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,600
 Second ones are the gross ones.

457
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,360
 I don't want gross witnesses.

458
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,880
 They're insane.

459
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
 But they're all that they got.

460
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,440
 And you're not just going to leave them out there.

461
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
 You go back home and you're like, "Hey man, what happened to the train?"

462
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,640
 Well, we didn't find it.

463
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,400
 We found these two insane people, but they had always left them out there unfit for themselves.

464
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,720
 They bring the insane people back and slowly they become less insane and they tell the

465
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,880
 story.

466
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,080
 They were on the train.

467
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,440
 The train has taken a normal journey.

468
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,040
 Everyone's having a bowl.

469
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,080
 And then all of a sudden black smoke starts to fill the train.

470
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,400
 A fire broke out is what they could tell.

471
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,760
 But they didn't see a fire.

472
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,160
 They just saw black smoke filling the passenger compartments.

473
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,280
 So everyone starts trying to run to the back of the train.

474
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,040
 There's only three compartments.

475
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,120
 You don't have a lot of place to run.

476
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,280
 And there's 100 people spread out on this thing.

477
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,160
 And one of the dudes jumps out of the train.

478
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,680
 Like he's like, "See you guys later.

479
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
 Deal with it."

480
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
 Jumps out of the train.

481
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,360
 The other guy's in the train a little bit longer.

482
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,040
 He said the black smoke was choking his very acidic.

483
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,120
 And he gets ready to jump out of the train as well.

484
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,600
 And he sees the train about to enter the tunnel.

485
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,800
 And white mist is billowing out of the tunnel now.

486
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,200
 So he jumps out as well.

487
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
 Lands on the ground.

488
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,080
 The train enters the tunnel.

489
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,200
 And they're just like, they look at each other and just go insane.

490
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,000
 They're like, "Ahhh."

491
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,200
 The train never came out of the other side of the tunnel.

492
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,560
 And the men never saw the train again.

493
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,120
 No one ever knew what happened to this luxurious train that was sent out by this Annetti train

494
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,960
 company on its maiden voyage.

495
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,760
 And then in World War II, so what is that?

496
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
 Like 30 years.

497
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,480
 If you find it in the tunnel in 30 years.

498
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,040
 But I thought this was a, I don't know why they added this detail.

499
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
 Maybe because people want to go into the tunnel.

500
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
 It got bombed.

501
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
 Bombers.

502
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,640
 Bloop, bloop, bloop.

503
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
 Blew up the tunnel.

504
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
 So you can't visit it nowadays.

505
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,840
 If you're hoping to solve the mystery yourself, I hope you have some construction equipment.

506
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,040
 You can't go into the tunnel.

507
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,280
 So the train was never seen again.

508
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
 You can't visit the tunnel.

509
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,880
 It was completely blown up.

510
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,480
 However, scattered all over the internet are clues.

511
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
 They're all directly connected to the story.

512
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,560
 I wasn't able to find like a crazy fact website where they're like, "You know that a bangled

513
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,720
 tiger loves goat milk and loves to eat the goat too."

514
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,040
 You know like this crazy fact website.

515
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,360
 I never saw one of them repeat one of these facts.

516
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,840
 Whenever I saw these facts, it was directly related to the story.

517
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,480
 In Modena, Northern Italy, the time medieval times, medieval times.

518
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,880
 It's a theme restaurant.

519
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,200
 But it was a whole continent in the actual time period.

520
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,600
 There was a bunch of monks in Modena and they're sitting in their monastery and they hear a

521
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:58,600
 choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker choker ch

522
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
 lot of its pipes.

523
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,800
 "Oh chuka chuka chuka chuka."

524
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,200
 Now I don't know if you know a lot about technology or history or just anything.

525
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,720
 There weren't trains around during the medieval times.

526
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,520
 If there was, the Black Plague would have been everywhere.

527
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,040
 It would have gotten to every corner of the planet.

528
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,720
 There were no trains in medieval times.

529
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,320
 But these monks see this train or a sled with a pipe driving over the countryside and actually

530
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,600
 stops outside the monastery.

531
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,760
 And two people get off of this train and they walk up to the gate and they start yelling.

532
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
 Maybe they weren't yelling.

533
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
 Maybe they were kind of polite.

534
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,920
 But these two people are asking the monks for help and the monks were so scared.

535
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,840
 They thought this was a vision of the devil.

536
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,600
 That they refused to help the people and eventually the two people got back on this sled with pipes.

537
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,960
 "Chuka chuka chuka chuka."

538
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,000
 And it goes over the countryside and is never seen again.

539
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,280
 Until there is a sighting in 1840s Mexico.

540
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,280
 "Chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka chuka

541
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:18,800
 There is reports of this train in the countryside of Mexico.

542
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:27,920
 People of Poltava saw a strange old fashioned train traveling down the tracks.

543
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,040
 It moved silently.

544
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,760
 The blinds were closed on all the passenger cars.

545
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,520
 It didn't appear that there was anyone in the operator cab.

546
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,280
 It just silently glided until it was out of sight.

547
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,520
 October 1955.

548
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,200
 Also in the Ukraine.

549
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,480
 This time it was traveling in a place with no train tracks.

550
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,000
 1940s Mexico.

551
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,720
 Last call everybody.

552
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:00,720
 Choooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

553
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:17,040
 104 people checked into a Mexican insane asylum.

554
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:23,640
 104 people got checked into a mental hospital in Mexico.

555
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,200
 And when the doctors were interviewing them, one they all spoke Italian.

556
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,040
 So that made it a little difficult, right?

557
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,040
 And two, they got to figure out that all of these people were claiming the same psychosis.

558
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,160
 They all said they were on a train from Italy.

559
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,000
 And that train had departed back in the year 1911.

560
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
 One of them had a cigarette box on them.

561
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,960
 It's a cigarette box that has a date on it.

562
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,720
 1907.

563
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,400
 We don't know what happened to these patients after they were checked into the insane asylum.

564
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,960
 You know one of them lost their cigarette box.

565
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:10,800
 Because that box is supposedly sitting in a museum in Mexico.

566
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
 Fascinating story.

567
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,680
 And you guys who listen to the podcast a lot know how much I love portal stories.

568
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,760
 The idea that you could be walking down a hallway and then appear in Paraguay or on

569
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,320
 an alien planet or in the Black Lodge.

570
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,720
 All of that stuff fascinates me.

571
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,160
 I love the idea of portal.

572
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,840
 So here we have a portal, an entire train, 104 people disappearing, traveling through

573
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
 time.

574
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,520
 Is any of it real?

575
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,160
 This is always the issue with these stories.

576
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,680
 We don't know every...

577
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
 It would have been great.

578
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,160
 We talked about this on the Mike Madman Markham episode.

579
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
 About time travel.

580
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,960
 It would have been great if I had at some point come across an article that was like a crazy

581
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,760
 fact thing or a sighting.

582
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,360
 And they said, "Yeah, it's really weird.

583
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,200
 Back in medieval Rome there was a sighting of this mechanized beast moving over the landscape.

584
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,080
 No one ever knew what it was.

585
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,080
 It had three boxes behind it and you could see people."

586
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,240
 And then that would give you something to bite onto and it would be completely unrelated

587
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
 to the story.

588
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,880
 But every time like when I read this story and I was researching it, it would list all

589
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
 these...

590
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,000
 Some websites would list more details than other.

591
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,280
 Like I saw the medieval monks a couple of times but I said, "I need more than that."

592
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,800
 I just can't say medieval monks.

593
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,200
 So I was able to keep digging on it.

594
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,840
 I found a website that specified it happened in Modena.

595
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,120
 I found another website that specified what they...

596
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,480
 I saw like what they...

597
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,320
 How they described it.

598
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,400
 So I had to keep checking around.

599
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,200
 Some had a more slim version of it.

600
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,840
 Some people didn't mention that it went to the Ukraine.

601
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,640
 So is that the myth evolving?

602
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,280
 Is it changing for different audiences?

603
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,880
 It's weird that it went to Mexico twice and it went to the Ukraine twice.

604
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,000
 I thought that was bizarre details.

605
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,240
 And again, it's spread across different websites.

606
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,560
 So just on the face of it, I think it's an interesting story.

607
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,400
 Time traveling train, people trapped.

608
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,560
 It reminds me of that old Twilight Zone episode about the plane going back to dinosaur times.

609
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,800
 I saw that as a kid.

610
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
 I loved it.

611
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,040
 Terrified me but I loved it.

612
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,640
 So this reminded me of that but I am certain I've told this story before.

613
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,480
 104 people going to a Mexican insane asylum.

614
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,000
 I am almost certain I've done that before.

615
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 I talked about it before.

616
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,440
 I'm almost certain I talked about the cigarette box before.

617
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,080
 I mean, specific details about this story.

618
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,920
 The monks seeing the train.

619
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,160
 I was like, "I've covered this before."

620
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,760
 But when I typed in every search term I could possibly think of into my website, nothing

621
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
 was pulling up.

622
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,320
 Like I said, if it had the word train in the headline of the article or in the show notes

623
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
 it popped up.

624
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,520
 I looked up the word "zeneti."

625
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,960
 I looked up "zan."

626
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,120
 I was looking up all this stuff.

627
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,480
 I could not find it.

628
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,600
 It's going to be so funny.

629
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,800
 If someone's going to be like, "Oh no, it's here."

630
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,600
 And even if I did repeat this episode, it's going to happen.

631
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,200
 I love this story.

632
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,800
 I'm 44 years old.

633
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,160
 I will repeat stuff.

634
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,720
 So it'll be hilarious if someone does find out that I've covered this before, but I couldn't

635
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,520
 find it.

636
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,640
 And wouldn't that be an amazing twist to this episode?

637
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,240
 Wouldn't that be just an awesome twist?

638
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,600
 An episode about time travel.

639
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,760
 Time traveled.

640
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,360
 To where some of you may have already heard it.

641
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,640
 And you guys will be looking through that website as well and you're like, "Jason, I

642
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,520
 know you did this story."

643
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,440
 I don't remember what episode it was, but I remember you telling this story.

644
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
 I remember telling.

645
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,240
 I remember the details.

646
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,160
 I remember there's a story I covered about a guy who teleported from the Philippines to

647
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,680
 Mexico.

648
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,360
 There's that one.

649
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,640
 And I've covered a lot of train more stories than you would think on a paranormal podcast.

650
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,400
 I've covered a ton of train stuff.

651
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,240
 I've covered two train stories this week.

652
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,800
 I actually found out about the train in India when I was researching this one, because I

653
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,800
 was going everywhere and it took me down this haunted train, weird train path.

654
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,800
 But wouldn't that be amazing if an episode about a time traveling train itself time traveled

655
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,960
 back in time?

656
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,000
 It's one of the just the layers that I love about the world of the paranormal.

657
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,520
 You never know what to expect.

658
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,560
 And there could be a rational explanation for it.

659
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
 I love the story.

660
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,520
 I could have already recorded it and I just couldn't find it for some reason.

661
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,360
 That'd be rational explanation.

662
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,800
 Or it could be that some of you will sit there tonight after listening to this episode and

663
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,720
 go "I know I heard this one before."

664
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,800
 From you.

665
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:57,480
 The mystery of the time traveling train continues even when you're simply telling the story

666
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:17,160
 to a friend.

667
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:32,200
 Bye guys.

668
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,780
 (upbeat music)
