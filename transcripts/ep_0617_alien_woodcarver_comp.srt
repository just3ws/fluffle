1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
 What happens when a couple ghost hunters go into a cabin looking for a ghost?

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,960
 Instead they find something oddly unsettling

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,440
 Other than the ghosts they were there for something else

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,200
 And it would take a look at the story of a young woman who is visited by an alien one night and

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,460
 Gives her visions of them having sex

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,000
 Her worst fear is that she's now pregnant from this alien invader

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,560
 But is that really the worst thing that could happen today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,680
 *music*

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:41,100
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,440
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,840
 So we're gonna slide right into this first off. Let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons riding in on a giant haul

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,140
 Is Steve Jones? He's like what? What? He's like Bill Wilder and he was sitting in my office now

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,280
 I'm gonna hog but we're gonna clap for him anyways. He's riding this hoggin

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,520
 Steve you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode on big pilot this episode

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280
 If you guys can't support the patreon or don't have pigs to ride that's fine too

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,200
 Just help spread the word about the show Steve go ahead and hop off that pig here. The reason why the pigs in here

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,840
 Let's all pet this giant hog. I'm actually recording today and tomorrow's episode back to back because tomorrow

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,080
 I have an appointment. I talked about this a long time ago. I have to hold down a hog for God knows how long

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,320
 Well another man saws off its hoofs

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
 No, no, no, no, no that came out wrong

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,560
 We're not jigsaw protege's he's gonna grind down the toenails of this giant hog

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,400
 So I'm a little nervous

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,060
 I'm recording I'm recording the next two episodes in advance because I might get injured not only the pigs gonna eat my face

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,520
 Or anything that is possibility. I think the pigs gonna eat my face

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,040
 It's a really old hog and I'm gonna hold it down away from its face

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,040
 But I might like you know hurt my back or something like that or shatter every bone in my legs

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,600
 So I'm recording the next two episodes just in case so I can take the days off and recuperate and bones heal in three days

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,040
 Right guys, so Steve. Thank you for writing this hog in we're gonna leave this big old pig at Dead Rabbit command

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,680
 And I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Pigville USA

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,520
 formerly Dead Rabbit headquarters. We're headed out to Illinois

31
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:30,840
 Steve drive us on down there actually this was a story that Nicholas sent me the other day was actually

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,880
 Part of when we did that tour of Illinois, but it didn't really fit in to that episode

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,840
 I also got to say got a lot of complaints got a lot of complaints about the people who picked number three and and were suffered

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,440
 Eternal damnation the other people just got stabbed by a clown or entered a television show full of hobos

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,760
 If you pick number three spoiler alerts

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,080
 You were trapped in hell for the rest of eternity, but anyways

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,480
 I

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,560
 Appreciated all of those emails and made me laugh a lot at how much you guys were but anyways no numbers to be chosen here

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,360
 This one didn't really fit into the interactive format, but this is really interesting when you research

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,920
 Paranormal conspiracy stuff for so long the outliers are very very important

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,840
 This is something we've been hitting on fairly recently on this show

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,880
 The outliers are super important because it tells something more about the mythology could be totally made up

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,360
 That would explain an outlier to Steve stop the Jason Jalopy right here. We're at witches bridge in Clarksdale, Illinois

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,920
 Now very briefly of course this bridge has a legend with the name like witches bridge

45
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,040
 It's not like Johnny which built the bridge

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:45,920
 Apparently a witch was hung from the bridge. Who knows if that happened. I'm sure people have been hung from bridges there

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,920
 Whether or not it was an actual witch it would be kind of hard to to hang someone who can fly away

48
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,960
 Honestly, she's like my last wish is to hold my broom as you hang me. They're like, okay. What's the worst thing go wrong?

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,480
 I don't think anyone was actually hung from the bridge

50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,520
 There is a cabin nearby and here's another story. That's very very typical with these type of things

51
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,280
 There was a man he had his family he got mad at him

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,240
 He murdered them all with an axe probably or a shovel or whore while talking just let it crush all their bones and

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:23,800
 Then he hung himself on the bridge now apparently this house is guarded by a zombie dog now all of that stuff is

54
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,320
 Very run-of-the-mill. We have the cursed bridge. We have people getting hung from it

55
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,600
 That's super super common in the lore in ghost lore family annihilators

56
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,560
 Super common in the lore even ghost dogs hellhounds things like that real dogs are part of the lore

57
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,040
 This was really interesting the cabins no longer there. It's now been moved to Rochester, Illinois

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,520
 So they're like we want the zombie dog. That's their mascot in that town the zombie dogs go

59
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,560
 So they cracked it down the zombie dogs like oh man. I really miss my view

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:01,000
 Apparently though when the cabin was in Clarksdale, Illinois, there was a room in the cabin

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,720
 Obviously right you're like whoa J. You're waking up your buddy. Do do I don't know why you're sleeping next to your buddy

62
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,800
 But you're like dude dude. There's a cabin with a room in it. I haven't gotten to the cool part yet, right?

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,360
 But but it is cool that you're waking up your buddy to listen to the show

64
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,360
 There's a room in this cabin and no matter what the temperature was outside if it was hot

65
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,040
 If it was cold if it was moderate you would go into this room and it would always be

66
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,480
 Warm

67
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,160
 Huh?

68
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
 See that's the twist we've

69
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,280
 Cold spots is one of the main things we're like

70
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,400
 Yes, yes, because it's always cold spots

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,520
 It's all I've never ever in 30 years

72
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:53,120
 Come across a ghostly encounter where you entered a room and no matter what the temperature was the room was warm

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,880
 It's always oh, it's so much colder in here. Look if we're gonna pull out this thermostat. Look how cold it is

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,400
 It's a cold spot cold spots are always the signs of ghosts

75
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,560
 I have never ever ever heard of a house that had a haunting in it and there was a room that was constantly warm

76
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,560
 See to me that's fascinating if this was just a cabin where a guy murdered his entire family and then hung himself and

77
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
 That story is not real then I wouldn't even mention it

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
 And if it had a cold spot I wouldn't even mention it because we hear that stuff all the time

79
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
 I've never come across and when you look at outliers like this again

80
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,880
 You think oh, maybe some maybe some guy made it up and he wanted to be maybe his name is Johnny Warm

81
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,040
 And he wanted to start a reputation. It's possible that it's made up obviously, but it's such an outlier. It's worth investigating

82
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,840
 Unfortunately, we can't anymore the cabin's been moved

83
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,760
 But that is a place if someone said hey, there's a house on the outskirts of town

84
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,600
 It doesn't matter how hot or cold it is outside you go in a student room. It's cold

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,360
 I would I wouldn't get out of bed to go visit that haunted house honestly and be like boring

86
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,360
 There's a demon's floating around there battling angels in the living room. I'm like oh cold spots

87
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,680
 They're like no no no there's other stuff going on and getting back in a bed with your buddy

88
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,160
 I'm sleeping with your buddy - but if someone said hey, there's a house on the outskirts of town

89
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,200
 There's a room that's always warm. I would go that night. It's crazy and it's funny because just something that small

90
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,680
 It's such an outlier that to me that means there's definitely something going on there

91
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,640
 Assuming that it's true assuming that this is just not someone making this up if that was a verifiable report

92
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,360
 There's definitely something going on there. I can explain cold spots drafts with how often are you in a hot room?

93
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,840
 And you get like a cold draft. It doesn't happen all the time, but you can explain that windows open

94
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
 other stuff other stuff but

95
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,080
 To be in a room and it's freezing cold and warm comes in or it's always just warm really interesting again

96
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,000
 It could be a weather phenomenon. I'm not saying it's definitely paranormal

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,400
 But when you come across outliers like this, they're very very important to investigate

98
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,200
 Because the other ones you're just if you know if you know haunted houses are supposed to have orbs

99
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,840
 It's supposed to have cold spots and supposed to have like creaky floorboards

100
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,080
 You think someone's walking from behind you you're gonna note

101
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,040
 You're gonna notice this you're gonna expect those things you might even in your head make those things happen

102
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,680
 So it's possible that that was an actual real house now. It's been moved. There's as far as I can tell no reports

103
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,480
 Since then so Nicholas. Thanks for sending that story over. I didn't want to include it in I don't want to give you a number

104
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,600
 Just say if you pick number three you're warm

105
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,100
 No, I want you to be damned to eternity, but in an alternate universe if you pick number three

106
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,080
 How about this you're just warm so there you go and you just go home so Steve

107
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,500
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are leaving behind Illinois. We are gonna fly out to Russia

108
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,740
 So as you're flying out to

109
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:52,560
 Russia I wanted to give you guys a dead wrap recommends and this one's kind of a hybrid and I really went back on forth over

110
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,400
 Whether or not I wanted to recommend this movie or do a full segment on it

111
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,900
 It's not that I don't think the movie is not worth recommending because the movie is definitely worth recommending

112
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,000
 But it's so such an interesting story that I almost just did a whole segment on it

113
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,540
 I came to the conclusion of the movie so good. I can't do a justice

114
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,640
 But I'm gonna do a little teaser for it and then I want you guys to watch this movie

115
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,020
 Steve actually let's not go to Russia yet

116
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,220
 Turn around we're headed to Monterey County because I forgot I did want to cover a little bit of this story

117
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:31,760
 Specifically we're headed to the Pacific Grove Municipal Golf Course in Pacific Grove, California. It's November 3rd at 2013

118
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:43,080
 We're flying overhead and it's 7 20 in the morning and we're flying super low and people are messing up their their golf shots

119
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,820
 It's hilarious and then we see a man over by the restrooms

120
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,440
 Running around and he's not just having a good time like playing with a dog or something like that playing with a zombie dog

121
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,520
 He's on fire

122
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,420
 He's running around he's on fire and we're gonna throw some water on him

123
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,820
 But by the time we get there he's already dead. His name was Richard Hafner. He's 56 years old

124
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,820
 People at the golf course said that this fire was so intense when they could see this

125
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,420
 They actually thought a building was on fire

126
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,620
 Like it was such a big fire

127
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,700
 It was shocking to them when they found it was just one guy

128
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,360
 because what happened is he kind of ran from like this walled area to the men's restroom and

129
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,200
 Died against the men's restroom walls, which is a horrible place to go

130
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,360
 But it's not like being on fire is a picnic or anything

131
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,680
 But it's just a horrible combination of things. He actually he was so hot when he touched the wall

132
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,960
 He was like scorching the brick of the bathroom the police fire department. They all show up and they started the investigation

133
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,280
 homicide

134
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,680
 Suicide

135
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,140
 Accident they found what appeared to be accelerant in his car

136
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:02,700
 So it looked like he was sitting in his car caught on fire and then started running around and then died about 20 feet later

137
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,180
 Very very intense fire spontaneous human combustion. Well one man has the answer to this

138
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,440
 Christo

139
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
 Apollo of Monterey County

140
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,420
 He believes it was a UFO attack. I

141
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,860
 Started watching this documentary called curse of the man who sees UFOs

142
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,940
 It is awesome. I totally recommend you guys

143
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,880
 It was one of those documentaries actually watching on my vacation last summer and I put it in and I was like playing Minecraft or something

144
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 And I was half paying attention and that story is kind of towards the beginning and I paused and I rewound it and I go

145
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,040
 That's not true. It's not true like what a guy just exploded in flames

146
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,340
 I mean considering what I talk about on this show, right? I'm thinking there's no way this is true

147
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,400
 And then I kept watching it again and they start showing like local news reports

148
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,940
 They're like a man burst into flames today

149
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,940
 I stopped the movie shut off Minecraft and started looking it up and a hundred percent this story happened

150
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,040
 But the concept of the documentary is you're following a man called Christo Rapolo

151
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,260
 Who is an avid UFO hunter and he finds them all the time?

152
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,060
 It's a really really interesting documentary and when you start it off you go this guy

153
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:20,440
 He he strikes you as if the big Lebowski and Steven Greer morphed into one

154
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:27,360
 He believes in that whole like I can look him in the sky and I can ask the UFOs to appear and then little dots will appear in

155
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,560
 The sky and they're catching all this stuff on video. He's just a man who's just kind of living on the edge

156
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,660
 I think like he like his apartment was messy or something like that or his car was messy

157
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,780
 Not like that makes you a crackpot, but he just his life was a mess and you're following this man

158
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:50,200
 And he's talking about all these UFO events in Monterey County and then a crop circle appears

159
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:57,500
 And Christo goes nuts. It's I've said this before and I'll say it again the best documentaries

160
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
 They are there at the right time

161
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,820
 cartel land

162
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,100
 dig

163
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,360
 overnight

164
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:11,080
 Curse of the man who sees UFOs. These are all documentaries the crew just happened to show up at some random point in time and

165
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,700
 Capture a one-central. I recommend all of those documentaries. They they just show up at one point in time and capture

166
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,420
 History and I remember I was I was on the edge of my seat cuz I was like what is going on with this crop circle

167
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,660
 It's dope. I really really and I

168
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,700
 Was thinking about doing the whole doing a whole segment on it, but I can't do it justice watch

169
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,340
 Curse of the man who sees UFOs. It's a really interesting profile on someone who's like just kind of a wacky UFO

170
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:43,420
 Allogist he's very very lucky or he has some sort of control or connection to these things and

171
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:49,460
 Then the underlying mystery is him trying to figure out this crop circle and it's great

172
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,780
 This is a great documentary catch curse of the man who sees UFOs Steve Jones

173
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,020
 Let's go ahead and turn around this carbon helicopter or just give us a globe so you can keep flying in the same direction

174
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,200
 But we are leaving behind Monterey County. We are headed out to

175
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,880
 Northern Russia

176
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,280
 We got all of our snow gear on our parkas and our

177
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:18,480
 Like face masks. We all look like Arctic warrior GI Joe's. It's the winter. It's 1989

178
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,000
 We're beyond the polar circle, so we're way up there. This is northern Russia

179
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,600
 It's one in the morning

180
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
 Steve Jones expert snow pilot

181
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,620
 That was his GI Joe name snow pilot and as Steve is flying us in with this carbon helicopter

182
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,880
 We're going to see a young woman sitting at a radio station now not like

183
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,820
 105.9 with like lasso in the scooch. It's like it's like a listening station for the Soviet Union

184
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,280
 It's 1989 and there's a young woman working at this listening radio station

185
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,820
 Turning the knobs and stuff like that. She's just like I don't know what I'm doing. She goes home

186
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,680
 She gets off work. She walks through the snow. She gets home. She goes to bed

187
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,420
 It is one in the morning after all but when she wakes up she's sleeping next to her husband when she wakes up

188
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,220
 There's a beam of light right in her face. Oh man

189
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:19,920
 She's kind of swatting it away. She sees outside what's shining the light in her face. She sees an egg-shaped yellow object

190
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,500
 It's interesting she describes it and we've come across this a couple times in ufology

191
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,220
 She said it looked like she was egg-shaped, but she said it looked like a cloud, but the edges were diffused

192
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:38,100
 So there wasn't like she was watching an incredible edible egg floating by it was like she could see it was fuzzy

193
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,500
 And I like that because it it adds to that whole that other worldliness of it

194
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,820
 You've never looked at a jet close up and go man. They sure have perfected that fuzzy technology

195
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,600
 Everything's very defined even flying saucers. They have very defined edges

196
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,340
 But whatever this was you couldn't even look at it correctly

197
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:04,640
 It was interdimensional or just putting out some sort of weird energy source. She said the edges looked blurry

198
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,500
 She sees a whitish shadow again an interesting visual a white shadow

199
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:18,180
 Float out of the object and as it's coming closer. She describes it as what we would describe a gray alien 1989 Russia

200
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,880
 That wouldn't have been really well known especially that far away in Russia

201
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,700
 That wasn't part of the social consciousness, but she describes big head tiny body giant eyes gray alien

202
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,080
 This creature flies through the window just glides through

203
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,540
 She's wide awake her husband's just laying there next to her hasn't moved an inch

204
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,420
 The alien is now standing next to her in bed and then she has a

205
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,060
 This is so weird

206
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:48,220
 I love this story because there's just so many weird elements to it the alien standing next to her in bed

207
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,200
 And then she sees a projection of

208
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,820
 her and the alien having sex

209
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:59,100
 So is the alien having sex with her in the future? Is she

210
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,500
 Astrily traveling out of her body is she looking down at the alien having sex with her?

211
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,100
 Is it the only way she can kind of compartmentalize what's going on?

212
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:14,780
 Because in this story she is very very clear. She does not want this to happen

213
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,580
 She doesn't want to have sex with this alien and the alien is continuing

214
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:26,820
 To try to have sex with trying to rape her and then the alien gives her a drink and she calms down

215
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:35,020
 But I'm not sure if she sees the alien give her the drink in the vision or in the projection

216
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:41,620
 If she's being shown this event and she's panicking in bed and the alien gives her the drink in bed

217
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:49,160
 It's all very abstract the way the story is laid out, but after the drink she calms down the alien

218
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,220
 touches her cheek

219
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,340
 In in next to her in the bed, and then the alien floats out the window

220
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:01,180
 Svetlana did I say her name earlier? Her name is Svetlana if I didn't say it earlier Svetlana

221
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:08,340
 She is absolutely paranoid by this now. She doesn't know a lot about UFO ology or aliens or anything like that

222
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,900
 They don't have exiles over there. They don't have the book communion that stuff would leak into the culture later

223
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:19,180
 But at this point she knows that she had sex like whether or not she had sex in some alternate reality

224
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:26,700
 Or she was being shown that event or she that was happening to her and she was removed from her body to deal with it

225
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,100
 She knows for a fact that in some way she had sex with this alien and

226
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,860
 She is petrified

227
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,100
 She is pregnant

228
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,700
 She believes there is a chance that she has a baby inside of her. She doesn't tell her husband what happened

229
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:48,340
 She's waiting for the signs of pregnancy to appear though, but something else starts to happen to her

230
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:54,540
 She notices that her face the skin on her face is starting to get tighter and a little more supple

231
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,620
 She sees moles that she's had for years

232
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,140
 slowly

233
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,380
 Disappear she gets up she looks in the mirror in the morning

234
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,020
 She can tell she's visibly younger than she was the day before

235
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,140
 Eventually the time came where she didn't even have to wear glasses anymore

236
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,740
 She was

237
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,820
 de-aging

238
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,980
 somehow

239
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:23,180
 Another odd side effect from this was that according to her her sex drive increased tenfold

240
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,980
 She could not get enough sex which the husband is like I don't know what's going on

241
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,900
 But you're looking great, honey, and all this sex ten times the sex is amazing

242
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,900
 We were already having like sex ten times a day. That's a hundred times a day now. We both have to quit our jobs

243
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,900
 at this point a couple months have passed and

244
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:46,580
 She hasn't given birth she has to show no signs of being pregnant and she's actually very relieved by that

245
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,460
 Because that was her biggest fear. She looks a lot younger than she used to she's having sex

246
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,140
 Oh, she might get pregnant again very very soon, but she's not pregnant with an alien baby

247
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,220
 She's finally come to peace with that

248
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,040
 But one morning she wakes up and she has a burning desire

249
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:10,340
 To carve wood this was something she never done before she never even thought about before she actually bullied the people in

250
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,140
 The wood carving club in high school. She goes out she gets some wood and she just kind of begins whittling it down

251
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,580
 She doesn't really know what she's doing, but she has a need to carve wood

252
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,180
 Whittle whittle whittle whittle whittle whittle

253
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,500
 over time

254
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 She ends up getting like a carving knife better pieces of wood

255
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,860
 She can really get in there and she finds herself carving a very specific image

256
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,260
 It's the image of a gray alien

257
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,620
 She's taking these pieces of wood and she's carving away everything all that's left

258
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,100
 Is the image of a gray alien that floated into her window, but it's not just the gray alien

259
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,100
 It's what we would describe what we know as now of an alien hybrid

260
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,500
 It's a human with the giant eyes of a gray alien

261
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,980
 She's carving these figures over and over again

262
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,180
 Eventually she had such a collection of these really interesting figures

263
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,100
 She had an art show in st. Petersburg in 1993

264
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:14,060
 Where she displayed all of these little gray alien hybrid human figurines to the public

265
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,540
 That story was I got it from think about a docs.com and they got it from a Russian ufologist

266
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,380
 We've covered this gentleman before Leonid somov. That's from a book

267
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,740
 He wrote called 100 stories of encounters with the unknown in published in 2004

268
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,900
 The story is interesting on a couple different notes. It's funny

269
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,740
 I kept wanting to interrupt myself, but I wanted to keep the flow of the story going one a lot of times when women are abducted by

270
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,220
 Aliens and they're subjected to these type of hybrid experiments

271
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
 They don't remember them

272
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,820
 We covered one story and this is really common, but once the way that sticks out of my mind was there was a woman

273
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,340
 She was abducted. She found herself like paralyzed

274
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,220
 There was something covering her lower body and alien was walking towards her her legs are spread open

275
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,660
 She wakes up. She's at home

276
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,860
 That's common. That's usually common when when men get abducted and they have sexual encounters with aliens

277
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,840
 They tend to remember them they remember the experience, but a lot of times when women are having sex with aliens

278
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,720
 They don't we did cover a story of a woman who's getting gangbanged on the moon by reptilians, but that was made up

279
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,120
 That was I will fully say that story is made up. That's not true

280
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,360
 So she can remember whatever she wanted it never happened, but when we look at all these other more believable UFO

281
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:35,320
 Hybrid experiment stories women don't normally remember it. So I this again is an outlier. It's very interesting

282
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,740
 Not only did she remember it. She viewed it as a third party

283
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:45,080
 She was watching it happen and again was she watching it in the future was it happening and she had astrally projected from her body

284
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,400
 We don't know

285
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,360
 But not only does she remember it she remembers it as a third party in there

286
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,020
 We also have the interesting thing a lot of times in aliens and counter humans. We'll see them

287
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,920
 Remove tumors will see them heal people and this one she was getting younger

288
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,600
 Which is an interesting side effect to the whole thing

289
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,240
 Because that would that's a huge benefit obviously not just looking good, but you're actually de-aging your prolonging your life

290
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,620
 Now we only have the first names Fetlana. I'm sure it's a very very common name

291
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,220
 It's not like you just go around and look for all the youngest radio operators in Russia who have incredible sex drives

292
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,100
 You look for everyone. He's still horny, but you have those things that happen

293
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,540
 I think the most interesting part of the story and it's a very interesting story

294
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,640
 And I love all the little different rabbit holes. We can go down on it is the wood carving now there is

295
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:41,420
 Stories of people getting just normal people getting bonked on the head getting a metal pipe through the brain the next thing

296
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,420
 They know they're a concert pianist

297
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:50,520
 All of these hidden skills people have that they're magically unlocked not really magically unlocked like parts of the brain are damaged

298
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,100
 It's the reverse of magic. That's tragic and

299
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,960
 They're able to develop these skills. She didn't really have that type of experience

300
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:04,400
 But something prompted her to start carving wood and I think the most obvious answer to the story is the saddest

301
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,140
 There's nothing like a human parents love towards their children

302
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,720
 When a father or mother sees that little baby

303
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,140
 It just radiates love it should I know it doesn't happen all the time

304
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
 And I know there's a lot of bastards out there

305
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:26,220
 We can't form that connection, but you know what I mean it needs to that's part of the human condition

306
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,140
 Even as I'm doing this segment. I'm kind of holding my arms like I'm creating a little baby person a

307
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,080
 humans love for their offspring is

308
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,660
 boundless and I believe that

309
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,200
 Can translate across the stars

310
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,840
 Aside from the reptilian gang bang on the moon

311
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,080
 The aliens aren't coming down here and having sex with human women just to have sex with human women

312
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,860
 Let's put our conspiracy caps fully on here guys because we're gonna talk about this space alien hybrid program

313
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,400
 Which is really common in UFO lore

314
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,500
 The great aliens aren't coming down just to have sex with humans

315
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:09,380
 They're coming down to create human alien hybrids and a lot of times the human women don't give birth to the children a lot of

316
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,500
 Times they're just used for the sexual act and then the women are deposited back at home

317
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,740
 Now there are some human women who claim they've given birth to hybrids, but for the most part the story is

318
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,520
 They're in some sort of chamber. They're in some sort of

319
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:31,600
 Breeding pod some sort of surrogate birthing method. So I believe Svetlana while not praying in herself

320
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:39,080
 Did have a alien hybrid child that she never saw that she never held

321
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,600
 She never kissed good night

322
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,400
 Never took it to its first day of space school

323
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,680
 Never got to do any of those things, but her motherly love reached across the stars and

324
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,060
 Gave her the vision of her child

325
00:25:54,060 --> 00:26:00,460
 And not only gave her the vision of her child, but gave her the ability to see that child

326
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,300
 She may never be able to see him in real life

327
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,860
 But it gave her the ability to create art of a very specific purpose

328
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,220
 The child wanted to visit its mom

329
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:19,420
 The child wanted to make its presence known, but it couldn't all it could do is reach across the stars and

330
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,400
 Give its mother a memory of

331
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,320
 What it looked like

332
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,040
 She turned that subconscious memory into art

333
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,400
 The alien hybrid baby gave her a gift and in return that child was loved

334
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,800
 Even if the mother didn't know that child existed that child was loved a

335
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,840
 Parents love

336
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,680
 Can reach across the stars. It's never too far away

337
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
 To say I love you

338
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,420
 Is that a homework card is that it that should be something that should be like a phone commercial dead rubber

339
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,580
