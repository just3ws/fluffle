1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 A shocking attack in a small town has people wondering, "Are vampires real?"

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,800
 And then we meet a man who says he knows the best way to avoid getting sick from COVID-19.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,280
 Having sex with women who have been abducted by aliens.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
 That's a cure.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,360
 I don't think you can get it right, AID, but apparently it works.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,240
 Then we take a look at a new conspiracy theory that popped up and was almost immediately

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,240
 shut down.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,120
 However, it's quite intriguing.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,640
 I think this one might have some legs and might come back.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,800
 Is it possible that modern day celebrities are actually the reincarnated forms of the

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,240
 old gods today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:53,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,840
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
 I'm having a great day.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,340
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,520
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,440
 So we're going to get started right away.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,040
 First off, racing into Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
 Everyone give it up for Garrett Hopkins.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
 Woo!

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
 Yeah!

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
 Come on in doing Jumbo Jacks and stuff like that.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,440
 He's like, "I didn't know it was going to work out."

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,840
 Man, you're always working out in Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,800
 Garrett's our newest Patreon supporter and you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,480
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or can't do Jumbo Jacks, the Lord knows I can.

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,560
 That's fine too.

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,780
 This helps read the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,140
 What's the purpose of a jumping jack?

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,300
 Does it make you more agile?

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,300
 Does it have any sort of...

33
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,780
 I literally can't do a jumping jack.

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,900
 I imagine it's like a full body workout, but it just must kill your ankles, right?

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,060
 Jumping up and down, sticking your arms out and stuff like that.

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,100
 Anyways, Garrett, let's go ahead and actually give this episode started.

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,900
 We do have a lot of stuff to cover.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,140
 I'm going to toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Roadboat.

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,080
 We're going to go on a nice leisurely rowing journey all the way out to Pennsylvania.

40
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,760
 We're headed to Pennsylvania.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,800
 Specifically, we're in Silver Spring Township in Pennsylvania on a little road known as

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,480
 Ashburg Drive.

43
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,200
 So if you are from this area, watch out.

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,440
 On August 27th, 2022, it's 7.15 in the morning in this little driveway, this parking lot for

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,980
 this residential care home.

46
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,500
 A very ghoulish sight is seen.

47
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
 Is blood.

48
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,660
 Now, blood, you know, that's not super gross, right?

49
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,460
 I mean, I don't want it on me.

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,420
 I'd prefer to have it in me and prefer it to be my own.

51
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,260
 But you know, if I was walking on the street and saw some blood on the ground, it wouldn't

52
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,620
 totally freak me out, right?

53
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,620
 I wouldn't make a...

54
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
 I probably would step on it.

55
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,940
 I was about to say I wouldn't make an effort to step on it.

56
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,660
 I'm not jumping in it like a puddle.

57
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,660
 Wee!

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
 You just keep on going, right?

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
 You just keep on going.

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,660

 You just keep on going.

167
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,660
 Hey, did you happen to have a patient who came in last night with no blood in them?

168
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,660
 They just showed up and they're like, "I'm missing about seven feet of blood."

169
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,660
 None of the hospitals have reported any injury of this magnitude as well.

170
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,660
 The police at this point are completely flummoxed.

171
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,660
 They have no idea what could happen.

172
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,660
 Now they're saying, "Well, this is when you know this.

173
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,660
 You have a bunch of lazy cops."

174
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:12,660
 The police are saying, "Well, you know, there's actually no proof of a crime having to comply."

175
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,660
 They're actually saying that because it's their job to investigate crimes, not mysteries.

176
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,660
 They don't want to investigate this anymore.

177
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,660
 They go, "There's no proof that a crime is actually taking place."

178
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
 That is a lot of blood, though.

179
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,660
 We agree.

180
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
 We're professional bloodlookers.

181
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
 We see it all the time.

182
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,660
 That is a lot of blood.

183
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,660
 And then people ask, like, you know, journalists are curious about this.

184
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,660
 It's a talk of the town, apparently.

185
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,660
 And they go, "Is it possible, like, if you all of a sudden lost seven feet of blood out of your body, would you be fine?"

186
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,660
 And the police go, "Uh, you would be able to get up."

187
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,660
 They say you'd be able to live for a couple of years.

188
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:55,660
 They said it is possible that you could lose seven feet of blood and then get up and walk around.

189
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,660
 But it's not a crime.

190
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,660
 So basically they're done investigating it.

191
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,660
 And that would be that, right?

192
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,660
 I mean, that's an interesting story in and of itself.

193
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,660
 Just seven feet of blood appearing outside of a residential home.

194
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,660
 Or any home, or factory, or in the middle of the woods.

195
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,660
 The location isn't weird.

196
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,660
 But having this mass amount of blood and no body and the police are basically giving up, they can't answer this.

197
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:27,660
 But there is another detail in this article that makes me think, this isn't just--this just isn't any old blood.

198
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,660
 Oh, and I should say.

199
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,660
 They have tested it because you're probably thinking, "Oh, maybe it was a pig or a bunch of ducks or something like that."

200
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,660
 No, it is human blood.

201
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,660
 But this is what they found.

202
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,660
 Tell me this is not awesome, right?

203
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,660
 They found a seven foot wide puddle of blood.

204
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,660
 And next to the blood--I'm not making this up.

205
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,660
 When I immediately read this, all of a sudden a techno song started playing in my head.

206
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:02,660
 They found a seven foot wide pool of blood and right next to it, there was a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses.

207
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
 Blade, dude.

208
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,660
 Blade!

209
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,660
 You know, from the movies, Wesley Snipes chopped people up.

210
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,660
 He always wore sunglasses and he was always around blood, right?

211
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
 There was always blood where he was around.

212
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
 Blood and sunglasses equals blade.

213
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,660
 And then you go, "Maybe, Jason, maybe you're jumping the gun.

214
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,660
 Maybe it does not equal a fictional character."

215
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,660
 Think about it, you're right.

216
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,660
 Blade might be hoping for too much.

217
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:34,660
 But when you think of sunglasses and blood, you immediately think of vampires who are wearing sunglasses.

218
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,660
 They're walking out of sunglasses because the sun's too bright.

219
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,660
 And I guess they would have wanted some vampires in sunglasses.

220
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,660
 The rest of them burst into flames.

221
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,660
 But he still has his baby blues just sitting there on the ground.

222
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
 Vampire, though.

223
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660
 Vampire.

224
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
 There's no way.

225
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:58,660
 Despite what the police are saying, you can't, if you lost seven feet of blood, you're not walking away.

226
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,660
 And if you did walk away, you'd probably like stand up, take a couple steps, and then fall back down.

227
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,660
 You're like, "I'm too tired. I need a lot of blood to do this walking thing."

228
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,660
 And the police are like, "It's not a crime. There's no proof of a crime being committed."

229
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
 So they're done investigating it.

230
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,660
 I think once they saw those Ray-Bans, they figured Blade's got it taken care of, right?

231
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,660
 The fictional character is apparently alive and well in our small township.

232
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
 Let's let him take care of it.

233
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,660
 But yeah, vampire attack...

234
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,660
 The Blade theory non-withstanding.

235
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660
 This does seem like a vampire, right?

236
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,660
 It seems like a very sloppy vampire who doesn't...

237
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660
 Maybe he does it backwards.

238
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,660
 Maybe he drains all the blood and only eats the body.

239
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,660
 I don't know.

240
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,660
 I definitely think this story has some sort of paranormal answer because what else could it be?

241
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,660
 How...

242
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,660
 Or I guess it could be like a drug deal gone bad.

243
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,660
 A guy's like, "Pshh, got shot."

244
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,660
 And all this blood comes out.

245
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,660
 But why would you take the body and leave the blood?

246
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
 And they have no idea when this happened either.

247
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,660
 It happened sometime between 11 p.m. and 7 p.m. and that's prime vampire hunting.

248
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,660
 Actually, no, that's during the Taste of the Best Time to Un...

249
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
 What if it's Blade's blood?

250
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,660
 Or what if it doesn't involve a fictional character?

251
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
 Weird, though, right?

252
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,660
 4 foot by 7 foot puddle of blood just appearing in the middle of the town.

253
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,660
 Very least...

254
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
 True crime, right?

255
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,660
 Very most fictional characters alive and well.

256
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
 The dimensional merge has begun.

257
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,660
 Chris Chan's predictions were right.

258
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,660
 And if you don't get that reference, I'll put that episode in the show notes.

259
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
 But let's go ahead and move on.

260
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
 Let's go ahead and toss...

261
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,660
 Garrett Hopkins the keys to the Jason Jalopy were leaving me.

262
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
 I'm doing donuts in the blood.

263
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
 They're like, "That's evidence! Quit spinning around in it!"

264
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
 We're leaving behind Pennsylvania.

265
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
 We're gonna head all the way out to...

266
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
 Some dude's house.

267
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
 [imitates gunshot]

268
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,660
 And inside his house lives a man.

269
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,660
 He goes by the online name Howling Abandoned.

270
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
 But we're gonna go in and call him Harold.

271
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,660
 And Harold, he's a dude just kinda hanging out doing his thing.

272
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
 But...

273
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
 Life wasn't always that great for Harold.

274
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,660
 When he was a young man, he had some close encounters...

275
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,660
 that got a little too close for comfort.

276
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,660
 He says that when he was a kid...

277
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,660
 he saw the book cover of Whitley Strybers Communion.

278
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,660
 You know, there's a picture of a little grey alien dude and it scared him.

279
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
 He saw that and it totally freaked him out.

280
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,660
 And then...

281
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,660
 [laughs]

282
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,660
 He's like, "Jason, this guy's either insane or making it up."

283
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
 Yeah, maybe.

284
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
 Maybe, right?

285
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,660
 But first off, let's know...

286
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,660
 Let's not think about how ludicrous any of this stuff is.

287
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
 But it is quite hilarious.

288
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,660
 He sees a book cover and it scared him.

289
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,660
 So then, later on, he says when I was like a teenager...

290
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,660
 he started to have these visitations.

291
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:05,660
 He began to have these memories of being abducted by grey aliens.

292
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,660
 He remembers waking up in the middle of the night and these figures would be standing around his bed in the darkness.

293
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,660
 He'd have fleeting memories of walking through the woods.

294
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,660
 And then he has this quote here.

295
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:27,660
 It goes, "And even being introduced to other abductees for mating sessions."

296
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
 It's in parentheses.

297
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,660
 "When I was older, of course."

298
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,660
 So I don't know if he started having the visions...

299
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
 I don't know if he's...

300
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,660
 The way he wrote this and his account has been suspended.

301
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
 He's posting crazy stuff all over the place.

302
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,660
 But from what I understand, or actually I don't understand,

303
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,660
 I don't know if he remembers being abducted as a kid and those memories came flooding back when he turned 16.

304
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,660
 Or if he began to get abducted around the age of 16.

305
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,660
 It's kind of hard for just the way grammatically he's telling the story.

306
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,660
 But first off, I want to take this piece apart.

307
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
 I find this so fascinating.

308
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,660
 I think we've talked about this on another episode briefly, but...

309
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,660
 he says that he was being forced to have sex with other human abductees.

310
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,660
 And then he adds, "When I was older, of course."

311
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,660
 And I thought...

312
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,660
 Please do not continue.

313
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,660
 I know exactly what you're about to say.

314
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,660
 Please stop.

315
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,660
 Why would aliens care about, like,

316
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,660
 "Yo, no, if we're gonna abduct you for our breeding programs, you have to be 18."

317
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,660
 Because that's the law in most parts of America.

318
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
 They wouldn't, right?

319
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,660
 We're like having ducks when we're breeding ducks for our failing duck breeding business.

320
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,660
 How come no one wants to buy our ducks?

321
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,660
 You don't go, well, you know...

322
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,660
 All your ducks are...

323
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,660
 They're all 18-year-old ducks.

324
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,660
 They're like, "I don't even think ducks live that long."

325
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:14,660
 When you're breeding animals, you don't wait until the cow gets to the point where it can rationally decide for itself whether or not to take a mate.

326
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,660
 You're like, "This cow has just started milking itself."

327
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,660
 Whatever, whatever how you ever tell when a cow is sexually mature.

328
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,660
 Let's do it.

329
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,660
 Let's get them cows together.

330
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,660
 I don't think you're like, "No, let's let it wait until it's older and can make the decision for itself."

331
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,660
 And that's how aliens view us.

332
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,660
 If an alien abducted a 16-year-old and a 24-year-old...

333
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
 [laughs]

334
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,660
 Just stop, just stop.

335
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
 We know what you're saying.

336
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,660
 Okay, I'm not...

337
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
 You know what I'm saying, though, right?

338
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,660
 Why would aliens follow human laws?

339
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,660
 They're already kidnapping people.

340
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
 They've already crossed that Rubicon.

341
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,660
 Why would they care about anything else?

342
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,660
 Why would they worry about that?

343
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,660
 I just thought it was such a weird addition.

344
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,660
 And if not only are you kidnapping people, they're raping them.

345
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,660
 And if you ever met a rapist who was like, "I do rape.

346
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,660
 I do rape a lot.

347
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
 But I wait till they're 18 years old."

348
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,660
 You'd be like, "You're still absolutely disgusting."

349
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,660
 So aliens are already kidnapping and raping people

350
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,660
 and forcing them to have sex with each other.

351
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,660
 Why would they care if he was 16 or he was over the age of 18?

352
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
 I don't understand that.

353
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
 That makes no sense.

354
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,660
 Now, if this was happening when he was before the age of 16...

355
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,660
 Sure, right?

356
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,660
 I don't even want to think about that.

357
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,660
 But I can't imagine an alien abducting someone and they're just 17 of the aliens.

358
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,660
 You can just walk around the UFO for a while.

359
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
 We thought you were older.

360
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
 Doesn't make sense.

361
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,660
 And to me, it's little details like that that really make me question

362
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,660
 the whole alien abduction phenomenon to begin with.

363
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
 Because if you're all...

364
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,660
 I do believe it exists, but stuff like this really makes me think,

365
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,660
 "Why are they only doing these breeding programs with adults?"

366
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
 Women in their 20s and stuff like that.

367
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,660
 Do they have a moral code like we do?

368
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,660
 And see, there's a flat-out thing going, "No, that's too gross. They're too young."

369
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,660
 I don't get that part.

370
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,660
 When I was older, I get that part being a human, obviously,

371
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,660
 and having a human moral code.

372
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,660
 But I'm not kidnapping and raping people to begin with.

373
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
 And they are.

374
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
 So, so weird.

375
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,660
 And the fact that he added that in makes you go,

376
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
 "Yeah, that's true.

377
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,660
 Aliens do only abduct consenting adults

378
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,660
 to have non-consensual sex with other aliens or with other humans."

379
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,660
 I can't think of a time, and I'm not going to go looking for one,

380
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,660
 but I can't think of a time where the abductee was much younger

381
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,660
 and you had these type of experiments being run with.

382
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,660
 It just doesn't make any sense.

383
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,660
 We don't do that for the species that we experiment on.

384
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,660
 So anyways, back to this story.

385
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,660
 Jason, thankfully, Harold said that these visitations continued.

386
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,660
 He kept waking up and finding these aliens at the edge of his bed

387
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
 until he started fighting back.

388
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,660
 He said sometimes he'd wake up,

389
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
 which is man after my own heart, right?

390
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,660
 I love beating up aliens.

391
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,660
 He said he would start to grab them, grapple them,

392
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
 and they finally was just like, "Dude, this is too much.

393
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,660
 We're just down here on this routine kidnapping mission."

394
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,660
 And all of a sudden, they're fighting back.

395
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,660
 This sucks.

396
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
 He says, "I ended up roughhousing with them so much

397
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
 they left me alone."

398
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
 And that was back when he was 16.

399
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
 Now we're going to fast forward.

400
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,660
 He says everything was kind of normal until COVID-19 came around.

401
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,660
 And he said, "Listen, I've been vaccinated three times

402
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,660
 and I've never gotten COVID."

403
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,660
 So, let's set that statement aside for a second, okay?

404
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,660
 He's been vaccinated three times.

405
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
 He's never gotten COVID.

406
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,660
 He can't figure out why he hasn't gotten COVID.

407
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,660
 He goes, "I've been vaccinated three times

408
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
 and I haven't gotten COVID."

409
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
 It doesn't make any sense.

410
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,660
 He goes, "My girlfriend's had COVID.

411
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,660
 My parents have had COVID."

412
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,660
 And he goes, "I was constantly like kissing my girlfriend

413
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
 when she had COVID too."

414
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,660
 He did state that.

415
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,660
 That's not a joke that I'm making.

416
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
 He did state that.

417
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,660
 He goes, "How is it possible that I did not get COVID

418
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,660
 even though I was vaccinated three times?"

419
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,660
 People go in the comments to this post.

420
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,660
 They go, "Well, it's possible that maybe because you were vaccinated

421
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,660
 and got the booster, that's the reason why you didn't get COVID."

422
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,660
 But Harold says, "No, that's ridiculous.

423
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,660
 We all know that the vaccine doesn't work."

424
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,660
 He says that.

425
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
 He goes, "The vaccine didn't work.

426
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
 I don't know why he got it three times then,

427
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,660
 maybe for his job or whatever."

428
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,660
 Everybody goes, "We all know the vaccine doesn't work."

429
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
 So that doesn't --

430
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,660
 So get rid of that answer right away.

431
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,660
 The only reason why I didn't get COVID

432
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
 isn't because most people who get it are asymptomatic.

433
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,660
 It's not because that the vaccine was effective.

434
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,660
 It was because of aliens.

435
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,660
 You see, the aliens must have been protecting me from COVID-19

436
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,660
 because that is the only thing I can think of.

437
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,660
 There's no other rational answer of why I didn't get COVID-19

438
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,660
 other than the aliens.

439
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,660
 And he goes, "And not only did the aliens protect me from COVID-19,

440
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,660
 I feel like they're abducting me again."

441
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,660
 He goes, "So they're back.

442
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,660
 They're actually abducting me again."

443
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,660
 He doesn't go into details about what that is like.

444
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,660
 Is he waking up in there at the edge of his bed

445
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,660
 or is he being taken under the woods anymore?

446
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,660
 But he says they have come back.

447
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,660
 And he said they are forcing me to have sex with other alien, abductee women.

448
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,660
 That's happening.

449
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
 He says with a big smile on his face.

450
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,660
 But, yeah, like he goes --

451
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
 he ints his post like this,

452
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,660
 "Did they come back to protect me or to steady me?

453
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,660
 Are they the reason I haven't gotten COVID-19 when everyone else I know has?"

454
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660
 Unquote.

455
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,660
 So, an interesting cause and effect story, right?

456
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,660
 Is it possible that the aliens are protecting him from COVID-19?

457
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
 I can't see anything.

458
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
 That was a straight face.

459
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,660
 For the most part, you probably got it right.

460
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,660
 He's asymptomatic.

461
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
 Most people are asymptomatic.

462
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,660
 But it's impossible that the aliens protected him from getting COVID-19

463
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,660
 and why are the aliens back now after all these years?

464
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,660
 He's COVID-19, brings the aliens back.

465
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,660
 Are they there to protect him?

466
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
 Are they there to steady him?

467
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
 Why, I see once again part of this breeding process.

468
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,660
 Why does he continue to eat pickles right before he goes to bed

469
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,660
 and have these crazy dreams and he doesn't know why the aliens are back?

470
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
 But I don't know.

471
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,660
 I mean, I have to go back track.

472
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,660
 I do believe in the alien abduction phenomenon,

473
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
 but I do -- you're like, Jason, okay, we got it.

474
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,660
 Don't talk about that other thing again.

475
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,660
 I just find it weird.

476
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,660
 Some of the experiments they run follow human laws.

477
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
 It just doesn't make sense to me.

478
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,660
 I'm glad they do, right?

479
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,660
 I'm not a proponent of them doing grosser things.

480
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
 Just find it weird, right?

481
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,660
 And is it possible that this guy's COVID was prevented by aliens?

482
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
 Probably not.

483
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,660
 But actually, didn't we cover a story where the aliens brought COVID-19 in the first place?

484
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,660
 If I said that enough times to get my podcast bold,

485
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,660
 from every podcast distributor, it's a weird story, right?

486
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:23,660
 It's either the story of a crazy guy who is connecting dots that aren't there to be connected,

487
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:29,660
 or it's the story of someone who's telling that it's either completely fake or completely true,

488
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,660
 maybe something in the middle, right?

489
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,660
 I actually believe the aliens may be coming back to visit him.

490
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,660
 He might be connecting it to COVID-19 when there isn't one there.

491
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
 But then his account got suspended.

492
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,660
 I would have liked to talk to this guy more or see what else he was posting on.

493
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,660
 His account got suspended and in all the posts, they were just starting to argue over whether or not the vaccine was effective.

494
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,660
 So nothing interesting for me to read.

495
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
 All this stuff I've been reading this stuff for years.

496
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,660
 But Garrett, we got one more place to go this episode.

497
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,660
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous Carbindercopter.

498
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,660
 We are leaving behind this dude's house.

499
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,660
 We're headed all the way out to Hollywood.

500
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,660
 [imitates carbinder]

501
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:18,660
 You know, when I was down in Sacramento on my vacation, I was playing this game called Sleeping Dogs.

502
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:26,660
 It's about your like this Hong Kong police detective dude who goes undercover into the gangs, the Chinese gangs in Hong Kong.

503
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
 It's a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it.

504
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,660
 But I'm playing it and there was a scene.

505
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,660
 I always love, like, you know, you're consuming this media, right?

506
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,660
 I'm watching these television shows, movies, and when a video game is something like that.

507
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,660
 And when every show often you get something that sticks with you, right?

508
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,660
 Every show often there's just like a line or a scene or something like that.

509
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:51,660
 And the older you get, the less it happens because you've just consumed so much media that stuff stops really kind of resonating with you.

510
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:58,660
 But I was playing this game Sleeping Dogs and you, at one point you have to go hang out with this really sleazy record producer guy.

511
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:06,660
 And he said he was there, you're supposed to escort around this bombshell singer, actress type in the game.

512
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,660
 And it was a really interesting thing.

513
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,660
 The producer was just a slime ball. He'd been sleeping with all of his talent and blackmailing them.

514
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:22,660
 And I think there was kind of an insinuation that he was killing women as well who weren't like doing what he wanted in his, you know, record company.

515
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,660
 He tells the main star, he goes, "Who's you?" actually.

516
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,660
 Because it's a video game he says, "Have you ever had sex with a famous person before?"

517
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,660
 He goes, "It's amazing. It's like nothing you'll ever do before."

518
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:38,660
 He said, "You're driving on the road and you see a 40 foot billboard of a woman.

519
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,660
 And then you go to the hotel and you banger brains out."

520
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:48,660
 He goes, "It is insane. It's just this amazing moment."

521
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,660
 I remember listening to that and I thought that, I never really considered that before, right?

522
00:22:52,660 --> 00:23:01,660
 We all have our celebrity crushes, but I never once, and it's what's funny when that popped up, when that cutscene popped up, I thought, "Eh, maybe."

523
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:07,660
 But it stuck with me. Like that, he was supposed to be a slimy character, so you're not really supposed to be agreeing with him.

524
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,660
 But that statement did stick with me.

525
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,660
 And I go, "There might be something to that."

526
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:21,660
 Like, when you sleep with somebody and they're famous, there's a 40 foot image of them, an effigy, really, on your commute to work.

527
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,660
 Maybe there is some sort of power behind that.

528
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:29,660
 I've always thought one of the worst torments I could ever wish on any human, and hopefully it never happens to me,

529
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:39,660
 is for you to be in a relationship that ends badly and then she goes on to be like the progressive insurance girl flow.

530
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:47,660
 Like, whenever I see people in commercials, and it's these commercials that go over and over and over again, I'm like, "Someone dated that person."

531
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,660
 Nobody dated the Gecko Gecko, but somebody dated Flow.

532
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,660
 Somebody was in a relationship with Flow, the progressive insurance lady, and it didn't end well.

533
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:05,660
 They dated early in college, and maybe he messed things up, or maybe she wanted to explore her options or whatever,

534
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,660
 and it ended up being like, "You like my Flow, the progressive girl fanfiction?"

535
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,660
 They break up. It's freshman year in college, and they break up.

536
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,660
 And then you're like, "Oh, whatever, it was just the girl."

537
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,660
 You lie to yourself, your heart's broken, and then you jump ahead six, seven years right, you're sitting at home,

538
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:30,660
 and your ex-girlfriend has like a national commercial, and you're like, "Oh my God, this is the worst."

539
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,660
 Like, I can't, every time I turn on television, there's Flow. That's not a real name, but whatever, right?

540
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,660
 Now imagine if that commercial ran for the next 12 years.

541
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,660
 The Flow, the progressive girl, has just been on forever.

542
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,660
 I can't imagine somebody broke up with the Charmin Bears.

543
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,660
 He's like, "Oh no, you were my perfect fit. Oh no, and you left that toilet paper on your butt."

544
00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:01,660
 You know, I just think it would be the worst thing to date someone, and then not just become famous, right?

545
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:07,660
 If I dated Angelina Jolie, I'd never see her. Does she still even make movies? I'm not for sure.

546
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:15,660
 I could avoid photos of Angelina Jolie, but you cannot avoid Flow, the progressive girl. She's everywhere.

547
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:22,660
 I always thought that would be the worst thing in the world where you can fall into a wheat thresher,

548
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,660
 in a world where you can be devoured by a pack of wild dogs.

549
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:31,660
 For me, the worst torment would be spending every time you turned on television,

550
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,660
 went to commercial, you were in fear that your ex-girlfriend was going to pop up.

551
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,660
 Oh man, that would be the worst. That would be the worst.

552
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:46,660
 But anyway, so the sleeping dogs thing, I heard that quote and I go, "Oh yeah, that could be."

553
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,660
 You know, I did think about it for a while, and then fast forward about a week or two.

554
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,660
 I'm on the X-board and someone posts this conspiracy theory.

555
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,660
 It almost wasn't even a conspiracy theory. It was like just a headline.

556
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,660
 And the reaction that it generated was, I go, "There might be something to this.

557
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:14,660
 There might be something to this." The post was titled, "Celebrities are the reincarnations of old gods and goddesses."

558
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,660
 And the reason why I clicked on it, because they included a picture of Britney Spears. That was the first picture.

559
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:25,660
 I saw that and I go, "Aaaahhh!" You know, I actually didn't really even give it any thought.

560
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,660
 I saw the headline, it kind of chuckled, saw a picture of Britney Spears.

561
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:36,660
 And then I clicked on it and I'm looking through and it really is just a lot of pictures of hot women, hot celebrity women, like Eva Green.

562
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:42,660
 And then, there's not much, the person who posted this isn't really backing up their statement.

563
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,660
 They're just posting pictures of hot celebrities.

564
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,660
 But it's so interesting because again, that was it. That was the statement. There were a couple pictures of women.

565
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:56,660
 And the blowback is immediate. People started going, "No, they're slaves. The MK Ultra Mind-Controlled Slaves.

566
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:03,660
 These people aren't gods. That's blasphemous." Like, the comments were really, really spit and fire at us, dude.

567
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,660
 And there was, again, no pushback. There was no initial even thesis statement.

568
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,660
 It was just like, "Here we go. There was nothing backing it up. A couple pictures of women."

569
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:16,660
 And yet, the wolves came out to hunt and they're like, "No, these people are pathetic. They're beneath us.

570
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,660
 They're mind-controlled. Their brains are broken. You can look at people throwing up these satanic signs.

571
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:27,660
 Rihanna's crazy, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." And I archived the page. I go, "I might look into this.

572
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:33,660
 I might look into this later." But again, just like the Sleeping Dogs comment, I kind of go, "Ah."

573
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,660
 As much as I love Britney Spears, I kind of stay out of her personal life.

574
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:44,660
 She doesn't have the restraining order against me. No, as much as I love Britney Spears, I don't read all the gossip on her.

575
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,660
 I don't read it. I wasn't following the conservatorship story. I wasn't part of the Free Britney movement.

576
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:57,660
 I like her art. I'm sure she's a nice person. I just try to not -- she's not a person that I spend a lot of time reading the personal details on.

577
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:10,660
 However, recently there was an interesting article that -- because I knew she got married recently and that her very first husband, like, stormed the wedding.

578
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,660
 I picked up all that stuff through Osmosis, but I was like, "Okay, that's sad.

579
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,660
 Her childhood sweetheart, who she married in Vegas for 72 hours."

580
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,660
 You're like, "Jace, you don't know her. You don't know her gossip.

581
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,660
 However, you can spat it out off the top of your head. Storms the wedding."

582
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:32,660
 You know, I didn't really click on any links, but I did see this article recently written for BuzzFeed News, and they talked about her children

583
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:39,660
 and how they felt their mom needed some mental health counseling, stuff like that.

584
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:50,660
 And I clicked on this, and I actually read this article. It was really a well-written article, and it kind of just went through everything that's going on with the kids.

585
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:55,660
 I guess the kids have a real -- her two sons have a really hard time with Britney as their mom.

586
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:02,660
 Like, they spend most of their time with Kevin Federline, their dad, and they were kind of using -- they were kind of like beefing with each other.

587
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,660
 The two sons did not go to the wedding.

588
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:11,660
 It all seemed very tragic to me, right? They're 15 and 13 years old, and it just seemed tragic, right?

589
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:18,660
 Everyone's very young, right? Kevin and Britney and her new husband, all young people.

590
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,660
 What does any of this have to do with the conspiracy theory at all?

591
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,660
 Well, what's interesting was I saw the Sleeping Dogs quote, and that stuck in my head, and then I saw the export post, and that also stuck in my head.

592
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,660
 I actually had that. I was still kind of looking at it every once in a while, the archive to me.

593
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:40,660
 But when I read this Britney Spears story, I thought there might actually be something to this conspiracy theory.

594
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:49,660
 Because when you look at the lives of celebrities, it does match up. A lot of stuff. Again, correlation versus causation.

595
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,660
 Who knows? Are these people just have tragic stories, or are they actually reincarnated old ones?

596
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,660
 This is interesting because you can't actually draw these three lines.

597
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:05,660
 When I was reading this article about our two children, I thought, "That's a really... It's so funny because I'm not going to try to go on about this for 20 minutes."

598
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:12,660
 But when you look at the stories of the gods, you always see these same themes pop up.

599
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,660
 Mostly, I'm going to be referencing a lot of Greek mythology because that's kind of what I know best.

600
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:24,660
 And then maybe something else here and there. But you see children having relationships with their parents gone wrong.

601
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,660
 It's part of the human condition. But when you talk about Kronos being...

602
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:36,660
 Kronos was eating his children. You constantly see these things. We see that play out in Hollywood all the time.

603
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,660
 However, you see families that have children issues as well.

604
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:48,660
 You also... Something that I don't think you see reflected in modern society as much as you do in Hollywood. I think it's amplified.

605
00:30:48,660 --> 00:31:02,660
 The idea of madness. How often... It's almost a cliche that these celebrities have a breakdown and they go insane, right?

606
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:08,660
 Britney Spears famously had her breakdown where she shaved her head and she was attacking reporters with them probably.

607
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:14,660
 Which would be funny. To be honest, it was kind of funny, but I felt bad for her, but it was an interesting image.

608
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:20,660
 We have that type of thing, right? All of this turmoil, all of this madness.

609
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:28,660
 It's interesting because you have to think, "Is it because they're related to the old gods?"

610
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,660
 I guess I'm kind of losing the plot here. Let me back up for a second. Let me give you my thesis statement.

611
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:46,660
 I think that is a valid conspiracy theory that what it is, is that the stories of old are retold over and over and over again.

612
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:55,660
 Before it was the ancient Babylonian gods, and then we have the ancient Egyptian gods, and then we have the ancient Greek gods.

613
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:05,660
 To the point that when you get to the story of Jesus Christ, you can go, "Well, you know, it's interesting that his story matches these elements from these older stories."

614
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:11,660
 And going forward, now we have Flo the Progressive Girl and Britney Spears.

615
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:23,660
 And is it because what we have is actually... Let's take Jesus out of this real quick. I know I'm in trouble already for including him, but Jesus Christ, let's move him out of the box.

616
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:30,660
 Is it possible that these stories are being retold because they're intriguing?

617
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,660
 Or is it possible that these stories are being told because they are intrinsically part of the human condition?

618
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:43,660
 Or is it possible that these stories are being told because it is the same players each time?

619
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:51,660
 If you took like some Babylonian war god who consumed the flesh of his enemies and dropped him in modern-day America,

620
00:32:51,660 --> 00:33:01,660
 his name is Armie Hammer. This guy who comes from this immense wealth, everything is given to him to the point where the decadence takes over.

621
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,660
 Or Dionysus, the god of wine from Greek mythology type of stuff, right?

622
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:18,660
 You have these characters, and you can even have one person split into multiple people because there are more celebrities than I think there are gods, but the essence of this.

623
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:26,660
 Is it possible? I think because when we look at celebrity, one of the key things to being a megastar...

624
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,660
 I'm not even talking about like, "Oh, I got a million subscribers on YouTube." That's not a celebrity.

625
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:37,660
 I'm talking about the megastars. I'm talking about the people that you know, your grandma knows, your mom knows.

626
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:43,660
 That's what I'm talking about. So I'm not talking about some dude who just like, "Look at me, I can do really cool spins on my bike."

627
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:52,660
 And he gets 64 million views. I'm not talking about that guy. I'm talking about people that everybody knows like, Armie Hammer, who eats people.

628
00:33:52,660 --> 00:34:00,660
 You have this component, and you almost always have to have this component. You had it with Michael Jackson, you had it with Elvis, you had it with Britney Spears.

629
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:09,660
 You have to have the comeback. You have to have the fall from grace, the literal, not literal, the allegorical fall from Mount Olympus.

630
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,660
 You're at the top and then you completely lose everything. And then you build yourself back up.

631
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:23,660
 And what's interesting is there is always the component, mostly always I'd say, of coming from nothing. Right?

632
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:33,660
 If Britney Spears... We have child actresses that are, you know, singers like that, who come from famous families like Drew Barrymore, her dad, their family was famous.

633
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:43,660
 Carrie Fisher, her family was famous, but for the most part, the stories that endure are, "Yeah, Carrie Fisher's famous, but you know, Harrison Ford was a carpenter on the set."

634
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:48,660
 He was building sets and someone goes, "Hey, you look like a rugged space smuggler."

635
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:55,660
 And now we have Han Solo. Like, it's those stories. Did you know James Cameron started off doing special effects for Piranha?

636
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:02,660
 For Roger Corman, he was building these little things with his hands and now he has these whole universes to play with.

637
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:10,660
 Those are the stories that resonate with us, right? Britney Spears was a 12-year-old singing at some cocktail bar in Thailand.

638
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:18,660
 She was at some contest, a talent contest in Bangkok or something like that. That's a true story. I'll see if I can find that video.

639
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:30,660
 And then she just worked the circuit and then got on Disney Channel and you put your do's in. Those are the stories that resonate with us and I think those also are the stories of the gods.

640
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:41,660
 Hercules, even though his dad was Zeus, he was putting in work, right? He was doing some stuff. And I think even the gods themselves, they came from nothing because the universe was nothing.

641
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:50,660
 Okay, maybe that last one's a bit of a stretch. But is it possible and you do have all the elements of people worshipping celebrities?

642
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:59,660
 And not only do people worship celebrities, you may go, "Well, Jason, I'm not sitting there and getting my hair cut like Jennifer Aniston. I don't like her that much."

643
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:05,660
 You're right. You have people who go to all the concerts and have a giant tattoo of Lady Gaga on their back.

644
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,660
 That's to prevent her from pushing you off if you're ever on a balcony with her. If she sees her own face, she won't attack.

645
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:21,660
 You have a tattoo or something like that. You have people who are really into it like that. And then you have the fans. I'm a huge fan of, let's say, Goldfinger, that band, Goldfinger.

646
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:30,660
 I don't have any Goldfinger tats. I have a hat. I have all their albums. I really like that band. So I'm like a hanger on. I'm just kind of like a casual fan.

647
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:39,660
 But so you have that, right? Just like how you have Christians who totally celebrate the War to Christ and then you have the people who just show up on Thanksgiving.

648
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:46,660
 Not Thanksgiving. I guess I'm a bad Christian. You know, on Easter and what's the other one? Christmas.

649
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:53,660
 And then you have rivalries between these celebrities. Not the celebrities themselves. It's usually rarely the celebrities themselves.

650
00:36:53,660 --> 00:37:05,660
 You have the fans fighting each other. Britney Spears versus Christina Aguilera. They have a little spat here and there, but they're like, "I'll get in. I'll get in some arguments over that one. Who's better?"

651
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:14,660
 So I think it's the same thing. You have this religious fervor and then you also have these people kind of be whipped up by these otherwise totally normal humans.

652
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:23,660
 And I would say that I don't think that's the mega celebrities. I don't think Leonardo DiCaprio, when we're not watching him, we think he's getting in private jet. He's really flying around on a cloud.

653
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:33,660
 I don't think they have any special powers. I don't even think they really know it. And I'm not going to say like, "Oh, George Clooney is that Greek dude who made armor."

654
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:40,660
 But Leonardo DiCaprio is Hermes because he moves fast. Catch me if you can. I don't think it's that simple. I don't think it's that...

655
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:51,660
 Let me give you a moment to laugh at my own joke on that one. I don't think it's that simple. I don't think it's that one God equals one celebrity, but the essence of these old gods.

656
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,660
 So I think it's a really fascinating question. I'm actually having to shut myself up right now because I can just keep droning on about this.

657
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:10,660
 But it's really two questions. One, is it possible that the celebrities of today are the reincarnation of the old gods? And that's really why it's so hard to make it.

658
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:25,660
 Like, people already know it's really hard to make it in successful... In any industry, right? But if your industry requires you being famous, having you do your art to be famous, it's a really hard industry to break into.

659
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:34,660
 And I think that you could go, "Well, I gave my best, but I'm not a reincarnated deity." I don't think that they would know that they are reincarnated deities either.

660
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:45,660
 But let me back up. I was just wrapping this up. Now I'm getting on another subject. I don't know if they're actually the reincarnations of these old world gods, or if just the stories are so human.

661
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:56,660
 It's the reverse. Those stories belong to the gods because the people who came up with those stories back then saw those things happening in their own lives, or in their own history.

662
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:04,660
 Right? You had the corrupt king who was slain by his son, and yet the son eventually became corrupt himself.

663
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:09,660
 And that would be the story of Kronos and Zeus, and then, you know, the other gods kind of turning against him.

664
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:19,660
 And those stories resonate because they're interesting to us. The stories that resonate with the human brain are the ones that are repeated over and over and over again.

665
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:29,660
 And it's the ones that we hang onto, right? Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Geller just celebrated their 20th year of marriage. That's nice for them.

666
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:41,660
 I'm a little jealous. I'm a little jealous. But that story doesn't resonate. There's no...or I'm sure there's passion, but there's no, like, betrayal. And it's not dynamic, you know what I mean? The good stories.

667
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:49,660
 The fun stories, I'm glad that they're there. But we don't remember them. We remember Brandy Spears coming at someone with an umbrella.

668
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,660
 [crickets chirping]

669
00:39:52,660 --> 00:40:00,660
 I love her. Don't get me wrong. I love her. But what a horrible moment to have captured on camera. Um...

670
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:10,660
 Yeah, it's just...it's such a f- This is one of those conspir- I have a feeling that season 19's gonna be real heavy on this crazy conspiracy theory stuff, 'cause it's popping up a lot. It's popping up a lot.

671
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:19,660
 And some of them we're gonna laugh at, and some of them like this, you're gonna laugh at, and I'm gonna laugh at, but I also, this could be true in a sense.

672
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:27,660
 It could be that the gods are actually reincarnated. Their shards, essence, little piece of their essence is what makes them mega-celebrity.

673
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,660
 And that's why you have two people. You may have one person who has a great amount of talent, a better amount of talent.

674
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:42,660
 There are a thousand actresses better than Angelina Jolie or Jennifer Aniston, you know. But they don't make it. Why don't they make it?

675
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:51,660
 Because they're not the reincarnated form of Isis. And maybe that's why they're always doing that one-eye thing. 'Cause they're saying...they're saying hello to their...

676
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:58,660
 Okay, now I'm just making stuff up. But I don't know why they do the one-eye thing. I don't think they're all MK Ultra victims. But you know what? Maybe. Maybe.

677
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:05,660
 I'm not sold on either one. That they're all brainwashed sex slaves or that they are ancient gods.

678
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:13,660
 But I will end it like this. I find it super odd that people hated this conspiracy theory so much.

679
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,660
 'Cause it's quite intriguing. And I think people hated it because it went against what they already believed.

680
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:24,660
 And I think part of being a conspiracy theorist is having...is opening your mind. That's the whole point of occult knowledge is hidden knowledge.

681
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,660
 And if you're like, "Nope, this is my theory. I'm sticking to it. It's MK Ultra all the way down. That's the only thing I'm gonna believe."

682
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:39,660
 You're not a conspiracy theorist at that point. You're...you're a normie. You're an NPC. That's the definition of a NPC.

683
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:45,660
 You're running on one set of programs. We can disagree on stuff, but if you get new information and then it makes you really mad,

684
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,660
 so start typing stuff out, proving, quote-unquote, "proving" the other person wrong.

685
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:56,660
 Because if you...the reason why you had that viewpoint in the first place about MK Ultra or whatever, which did exist.

686
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:03,660
 I'm not "poopoo" in MK Ultra as a thing. I mean, it does exist, but if you close your mind off to other theories,

687
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,660
 then what got you to believe in that in the first place? It was having an open mind.

688
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:14,660
 So basically the moral of the story is, no matter how much research you do on a particular topic,

689
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:21,660
 always be willing to listen to an anonymous poster online and a guy recording a podcast in his haunted closet.

690
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:25,660
 You will always be better off for it.
