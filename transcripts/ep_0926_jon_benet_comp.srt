1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,780
 What would you do if you were out for a simple nature walk and you saw a group of ghosts

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,920
 performing a religious ceremony?

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
 Pretty weird, right?

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920
 Right?

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
 Am I not sure?

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,600
 Is that weird enough for dead reveredio?

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,600
 I think it is.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,400
 And then we travel to Boulder, Colorado to take a look at a bizarre new conspiracy theory

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,700
 swirling around the death of Jean-Benet Ramsey.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:35,120
 Is it possible that Jean-Benet Ramsey wasn't murdered because she never existed in the first

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,920
 place?

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:49,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
 I'm having a great day.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,240
 I hope you guys are ready for a fun episode.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,760
 First off, I know one of the stories is about a murdered child, but you know, we'll try

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,280
 to keep it lighthearted.

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, shaking their head, they're like, "There's

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,240
 no way you can make this lighthearted."

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,640
 It's one of our live stream contributors, everyone on your feet, and give a round of applause

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,640
 for SegaMetsyMogoMotsy.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
 Woohoo!

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
 Yeah, come on in SegaMetsy.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,600
 Yeah, come on in.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,040
 Thank you so much for donating to the show.

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,560
 SegaMetsy, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,440
 If you guys can't support this show financially, that's totally fine.

30
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
 It really is.

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,880
 Just help spread the word about this show.

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,240
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,640
 SegaMetsy, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,320
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,520
 We're going to head all the way out too.

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,000
 Calico, California.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,680
 The reason why we're headed down to Calico, California is we're going to go hang out

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,880
 in the high desert in Southern California.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
 That's a different type of desert.

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,360
 I don't know what makes it different.

41
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,080
 I think it's like the shrubs are different and like they have different bugs and animals

42
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
 living in it.

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,240
 I know it's different than you think of a desert.

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,760
 People are already shaking their heads.

45
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,280
 They're like, "Jason, come on, the internet's right in front of you.

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,600
 Just double check it."

47
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,720
 I know there's a high desert where I live and I've asked people before, "Is that different

48
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,960
 than a regular desert?"

49
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
 They say people go, "Yes."

50
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,840
 Then they explain to me the difference and I totally forgot.

51
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,360
 Anyways, we're in the high desert of Calico, California.

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,920
 I'm pointing out all the differences between a regular desert.

53
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,920
 As we're just sweating, you're like, "Oh, Jason, you need to tell us we're going to

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
 be in the desert.

55
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,760
 We should have brought some water."

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,440
 So we're out in the high desert of Southern California.

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,520
 This area is pockmarked by ghost towns from the Gold Rush era.

58
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,040
 That's not like a cool ghost town.

59
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,920
 There's a bunch of ghosts floating around and stuff like that.

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,080
 It's the real estate ghost town.

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,200
 It's a town where people used to live and because of economic factors or because people didn't

62
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,720
 realize that they were moving into a desert, they lived there three days and they left.

63
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,120
 The town's now abandoned.

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,760
 So you've got old buildings and doors swinging open.

65
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
 That's not a ghost, though.

66
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,320
 Don't get too excited.

67
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,200
 That's just the wind.

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,960
 So back during the California Gold Rush, a bunch of these towns sprung up and now they

69
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,360
 just sit there abandoned.

70
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
 But Calico is a ghost town.

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,920
 Calico technically is a ghost town, but it has a very unique feature.

72
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,960
 Behind the ghost town, if you walk for a little bit, but not too far, there are a bunch of

73
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,360
 tunnels and pits that have been dug because people were looking for gold.

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,880
 And when the town is abandoned, it's not like people are like, "You know what?

75
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,160
 We should probably fill in these dangerous pits.

76
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 Someone might fall in.

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
 No one's going to fall in.

78
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
 No one lives there anymore.

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,640
 Everyone just left."

80
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,800
 So there's a bunch of dangerous drop offs as you're walking around out there.

81
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,840
 And there's signs, too, saying, "Don't go in these caves.

82
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,840
 I know how much you want to walk into this cave, but this hole is not yours.

83
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
 You can't just walk into it."

84
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,640
 Well, you can, but you'll die.

85
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,040
 One or two reasons.

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,520
 Three, one, you just get lost and no one's looking for you.

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,480
 And if they were looking for you, you're in the middle of the high desert.

88
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,160
 Nobody knows where that's at.

89
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,280
 Secondly, you could walk in and just have a sudden drop off.

90
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
 Ah!

91
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,000
 You're falling down, bro.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,360
 You don't know if you pick the number two, you fall to your death.

93
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,520
 That would be terrifying, right?

94
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,520
 You fall down in a dark cave, 30, 40 feet, you break both your legs, and then you just,

95
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,080
 you're in the darkness until you die.

96
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,720
 I mean, maybe you brought supplies with you.

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,960
 Maybe you have a good amount of food and water, and you couldn't be down there for a couple

98
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,760
 of weeks, but still, it's pretty rough.

99
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,520
 But also, they say, "Don't go out here," because there's a bunch of trapped gas in

100
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,200
 these tunnels, in these caves.

101
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,680
 People mine in and they poke a hole in the wall, and then a bunch of natural gas comes

102
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,480
 out and you can't smell it and stuff like that.

103
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,520
 So they say nowadays, "Don't go into this area, it's super dangerous."

104
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,040
 But we're not here because of any of that.

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,360
 I just thought it was interesting trivia about the area.

106
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,960
 There's nothing to do with ghosts or really anything to do with the ghost stories.

107
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,560
 Although now that I think about it, a place that has a lot of natural gas coming out of

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
 holes could cause you to hallucinate, right?

109
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,160
 So maybe that is a part of this phenomenon, but the reason why I wanted to talk about

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:20,160
 this, very, very interesting ghostly phenomenon in Calico, California, I found out about this

111
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
 on the awesome website, theshadowlands.net.

112
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,040
 They cover a lot of really cool ghost stories.

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,600
 I found a couple other sources that mention the same thing.

114
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:36,960
 If you show up to this area on the winter solstice, a little ritual is performed by ghosts.

115
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,040
 Ghosts show up and put on a show for you.

116
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:50,920
 First off, a bear shows up and is walking by you and you're like, "Oh dude, that's pretty

117
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,440
 dope, a ghost bear."

118
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,080
 And then you start to see a bunch of ghost animals walk up like a bunny rabbit.

119
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,320
 It doesn't specify, I'm just going to start naming my favorite animals a bunch of ants,

120
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
 a bunch of ghost ants.

121
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,880
 They're just walking around.

122
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,840
 You start to see all of these ghostly animals perform ritual.

123
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,120
 And then you start to see ghosts of humans also walking around out there.

124
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
 This is behind town.

125
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
 This isn't like in the town.

126
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,280
 It's not like a wah wah.

127
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,320
 So there's a rabbit dressed up as a bandit.

128
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,000
 They're like, "Oh no, bunny bandit's back.

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Save us."

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,600
 You are sitting outside of the town and you're watching this get performed and you see the

131
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,200
 ghost of animals and the ghost of humans performing a ritual.

132
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,920
 It's an interesting phenomenon.

133
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,240
 And I wonder, we talked about this, I think it was on yesterday's episode about hauntings

134
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
 that are just recordings of events.

135
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
 So we have three options.

136
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,400
 One, you're hallucinating because of all of the natural gas in the area and you're about

137
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:03,640
 to die. Two, that this was some sort of ceremony that had been done years past, right?

138
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
 Decades, eons past, really, not just decades.

139
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,040
 You'd have these animals and these humans performing this ritual and it's not any sort

140
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,520
 of ghostly activity you can interact with.

141
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,720
 It's just a recording of an event.

142
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
 It's possible.

143
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,800
 I can't think of a ritual that animals and humans do today other than like a bear trainer

144
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,480
 or something like that, that would leave such an event.

145
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:35,160
 What I think this is, it's so weird, is that the ghosts are the spirits of departed people.

146
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,200
 This isn't a recording of an event like a psychic recording, which is the cause of

147
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
 a lot of ghosts.

148
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,160
 I think the ghosts are coming to this area to perform the ritual.

149
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,600
 I'm not thinking that these animals died in the ritual and these humans died in the ritual.

150
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 It's weird, right though, because you have this going on.

151
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,760
 I don't know how many bears also were walking around in the desert if I had to design an

152
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
 animal that would die in the desert.

153
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,560
 A bear would probably be one of them.

154
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:11,200
 What I find puzzling though is what's the ritual?

155
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,720
 All we have is that the bear walks across this open area.

156
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,320
 It's like right behind Calico, the town of Calico.

157
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,880
 There's this open area and the slow-moving bear crosses the length of the area, almost

158
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,960
 as if to clear the room, to clear the stage for what's about to happen.

159
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,160
 Then the humans and the animals, this collection that goes perform a ritual, but there's no

160
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,800
 description of what the ritual is.

161
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,120
 So it could be some lame ritual where people are kind of like walk.

162
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,360
 And then it's like the ritual of the walking.

163
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
 Humans' rituals.

164
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,000
 When I think of a ritual, I'm thinking of something from a Dracula movie.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,400
 There's candles and stuff like that.

166
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,000
 And then people are combed to us Dracula, summoning somebody.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,280
 A ritual like that.

168
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,840
 Technically, a ritual would be a guy walking out and hitting a gong.

169
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,520
 That's a ritual, right?

170
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
 It's not a cool one.

171
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,880
 Oh, my ranking of rituals!

172
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,680
 I'd give that a 3 out of 10.

173
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
 But yeah, so I wonder what type of ritual it is.

174
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
 I don't really talk about this on the show much, but I always do like hauntings that

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,880
 take place on a regular schedule because I figure they're easier to visit.

176
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,380
 You know what it's going to be.

177
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,600
 But if you do live in Calico, California, maybe swing on by, maybe after your Wild West

178
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,680
 Roundup live show that you're a part of, after you've had the shootout and you've drank enough

179
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,840
 sass real to give yourself type 2 diabetes.

180
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,920
 Hang out!

181
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,880
 You happen to be there on the winter solstice.

182
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,080
 Go behind the town, I'm telling you, I'm just warning you how dangerous it was.

183
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,320
 I was like, go behind the town of Calico.

184
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,920
 Don't tell anyone where you're going!

185
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,720
 Shut your cell phone off and leave it back at the hotel room and walk out behind the

186
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
 town of Calico.

187
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,880
 You might see a bunch of ghosts perform in a ritual.

188
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,680
 And if you do, let us know.

189
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,600
 If you do, if you're able to survive that and the natural gases, I'd like to know what

190
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
 that ritual is.

191
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 Is it a cool one?

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,680
 Or is it just a bunch of, I mean, I guess if a bunch of ghosts are doing something that

193
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,200
 in and of itself is cool, but are they trying to summon something?

194
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,560
 Are they trying to bring themselves back to life?

195
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,520
 Or are they happy that they're dead and they're performing this ritual so they don't get reincarnated?

196
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
 I mean, the mind boggles, right?

197
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,800
 I can list a thousand things of what this ritual could be, but if we don't know what

198
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,080
 the actual ritual is, then, you know, we, it's all just guesses.

199
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,560
 But an interesting story nonetheless, it kind of creepy, but more intriguing than anything.

200
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,720
 And I guess it begs the question, are ghosts still religious?

201
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,440
 Like if you were a nun ghost and you died and now your ghost is floating around, are

202
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,520
 you like, I should go to church today?

203
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,720
 Because that's what I do.

204
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
 That's what I did when I was a person.

205
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
 I'm going to go haunt this church.

206
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,120
 Probably not a good idea to be floating around as a ghost in a church.

207
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,520
 But you know what I mean?

208
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,120
 If a ghost, if a human dies and becomes a ghost and they're religious or they have some

209
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,600
 sort of religious belief, would they still believe that as a ghost?

210
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,800
 Or would they be, be kind of like, well, I didn't expect this.

211
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,840
 I thought I'd be in heaven right now.

212
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,720
 I got little Casper legs and floating around like, and maybe God's like, no, this is what

213
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
 you're going to do for a while.

214
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,560
 I need you to do stuff on earth.

215
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,120
 I need you to fulfill this mission.

216
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,320
 I need you to stop those big robbers.

217
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 Casper, you're like, what?

218
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
 My name is not Casper.

219
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,640
 And God's turning everyone into Casper.

220
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,520
 He's like, hey, listen, you either get into heaven, you go to hell, or you become Casper.

221
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,480
 I call you Casper because I find that hilarious.

222
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,960
 So who knows, our ghosts religious, that's a totally different topic.

223
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,160
 But fascinating story nonetheless.

224
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,640
 Saygamedzi, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonar copter.

225
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,960
 We are leaving the high in California.

226
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,920
 We're headed all the way out to Boulder, Colorado.

227
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:04,360
 Jean Benet Ramsey, you guys remember Jean Benet Ramsey.

228
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
 Quick overview.

229
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,040
 Jean Benet Ramsey, six year old beauty pageant contestant.

230
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,120
 I think she won a couple.

231
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
 So beauty pageant winner.

232
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,560
 She was murdered in her house on December 25, 1996.

233
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,120
 Her body was found in the basement.

234
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
 She was strangled.

235
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,800
 There's a couple of questions about whether or not she was sexually assaulted.

236
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,160
 I believe now the consensus is no.

237
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
 Super weird story.

238
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,760
 They found a ransom note originally that she'd been kidnapped.

239
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,680
 The ransom note mentioned an amount of money.

240
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,280
 It was something like $54,000 just off the top of my head.

241
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,440
 And that turns out to be the same amount of money that Jean Benet's father had recently

242
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,320
 gotten in a bonus.

243
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,000
 And the ransom note was written on paper from the house.

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
 It was all this stuff.

245
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
 It went on for a year.

246
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,560
 I mean, it's still unsolved, right?

247
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
 It's still unsolved.

248
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,800
 People thought that the brother did it.

249
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,120
 Her older brother did it.

250
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,760
 People thought that the father did it or the mother did it.

251
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,800
 Or it was a family crime.

252
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 Who knows?

253
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,000
 It was such a bizarre, true crime story.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,800
 The facts that I just told you are all undisputed.

255
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,840
 I'd like to say that, but we're about to talk about someone who disputes all of those facts.

256
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,480
 This person goes by the name online of human vibration.

257
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,040
 And I found this Twitter account.

258
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
 I found it.

259
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,280
 I was going through Reddit, which I hate, but it's part of the job.

260
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,320
 And we have this Reddit called conspiracy no poll, which means no politics.

261
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,320
 We don't want to hear anything about your dumb conspiracy theory involving current politics,

262
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,840
 old politics, maybe sometimes if it's old enough, like Abraham Lincoln's still alive.

263
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
 Yeah, sure.

264
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
 I want to hear that.

265
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,360
 But we don't want to hear your view on the state of the world.

266
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,680
 You can go to regular conspiracy board for that.

267
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
 Conspiracy theories, no politics.

268
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,240
 That's pretty fun.

269
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,640
 We get stuff like this, right?

270
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,840
 This would have got buried out by the 20th Dr. Fauci's trying to take over the world

271
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,640
 post on the other conspiracy board.

272
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,920
 So here we have Jean-Bené Ramsey never existed.

273
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,640
 And this is being put forth by this person named human vibration.

274
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,520
 So I found her Twitter feed and I'm going through it.

275
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,920
 And it is such a simple conspiracy theory.

276
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,720
 And that is why people are falling for it.

277
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,760
 This conspiracy theory is growing.

278
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,960
 I don't think it'll ever be the size of Flat Earth.

279
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,160
 But I think it can get up there.

280
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,200
 I think it'll pass monkeys don't exist.

281
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,720
 I think it will pass a couple of the other really obscure conspiracy theories.

282
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
 Let's take a look at this.

283
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,320
 That's enough of a preamble.

284
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,840
 Here's the mission statement.

285
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,440
 Jean-Bené wasn't a sacrifice at all.

286
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,560
 She was a spell cast over all of us.

287
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,960
 The death of Jean-Bené Ramsey was for one thing.

288
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,880
 To generate raw emotional energy from humans.

289
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,040
 Which then can be converted or really it's the purest form of an energy source called

290
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
 Lush.

291
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,760
 Which is something that demons feed on or the Archons feed on these cosmic entities gobble

292
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,600
 this stuff up.

293
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,560
 And you can produce Lush by experiencing huge emotions like love and joy.

294
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,280
 But those things are hard to come by right?

295
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,320
 Everybody loves different things.

296
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,240
 It's harder to produce it.

297
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,960
 The other way to produce it is fear and anger.

298
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,960
 I mean if you really think about it, if you met someone on the street do you think it

299
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,440
 would be easier for you to make them love you or make them mad at you?

300
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,760
 You can just make them mad at you by stepping on their shoe or spitting in their face or

301
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,200
 being mean to them.

302
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
 Nice pants.

303
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
 Loser.

304
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,560
 They're running away crying and you're just like huffing in their emotional energy.

305
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,720
 So that's Lush.

306
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 That's how it's generated.

307
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,800
 But what if you were a demon and you just needed a bunch of it?

308
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,480
 You needed a bunch of Lush at once.

309
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:12,480
 You could scare, according to this theory, millions of people at the same time.

310
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,160
 That would be a great way to do it.

311
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,880
 Now again you could do it through a war, some sort of huge traumatic event like 9/11.

312
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,920
 But again, what's easier?

313
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,680
 Destroying three buildings in the middle of New York or killing a girl.

314
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,000
 Don't put that to the test.

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,400
 Don't go, I'll find out.

316
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,360
 And what's easier, killing a girl or just saying you killed a girl.

317
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,760
 And that's what this theory really is.

318
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,520
 This is a demonic conspiracy to produce Lush.

319
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,200
 So what they did, here's the setup.

320
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,880
 Jammini Ramsey never existed.

321
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,640
 She was an AI generated image.

322
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,160
 And you go, Jason, what is this?

323
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,560
 One of the most photographed six year olds in the world.

324
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,440
 Yeah, they're all AI.

325
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,640
 She never existed.

326
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,400
 All that video footage of her doing those dances at the beauty pageants, fake.

327
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,040
 Every photo of her fake.

328
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,640
 And Human Vibrations says if you look at the very first photo of her that was released,

329
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,320
 you can obviously tell it's fake.

330
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,880
 Versus this photo that she, I know you guys are googling the photos right now, okay, it

331
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,040
 does not look that fake.

332
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,360
 But anyways, it's also in the show notes.

333
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,200
 Here's a photo of her that came out the day she was murdered.

334
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,080
 This is the photo they used in the newspaper in the year 1996.

335
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,880
 And here's a photo, the same photo, but it looks much clearer nowadays.

336
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,960
 Now that this photo has the negative been used because it was a professional photo and

337
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,560
 it's actually been digitized and they probably have done some touch up work to it as well.

338
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,920
 What a shocker that a photo that was run in the newspaper article in 1996 looks a little

339
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,960
 grainier than one that you would see today or one that came out 10, 15 years later, right?

340
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,520
 So we're in that type of conspiracy theory world.

341
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,800
 This photo looks bad because the AI program wasn't that good at, well it didn't exist,

342
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,640
 it didn't exist back then, but fine, I'll give them the argument that, because she,

343
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,960
 Human Vibrations keeps talking about the website, this person does not exist, which randomly

344
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,680
 throws together this AI to make these photos.

345
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,960
 Now I go to that website, I won't say I go to the website all the time, but every so

346
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,600
 often it pops up in these stories.

347
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,280
 So, and I'll spend, I'll spend a good 10, 15 minutes clicking through, looking for a

348
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
 hottie.

349
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:43,200
 And I'll say this, that when you keep refreshing it, you start to see that it's really like

350
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,160
 maybe two to three out of 10 are believable.

351
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,680
 And then there's just some weird ones, eyes are wonky, there's some sort of mutant in the

352
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
 background.

353
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,320
 So it's not foolproof today.

354
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,440
 It's not foolproof today, but they're saying, no, no, no, it was foolproof back in 1996,

355
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
 Jean-Baptiste Ramsey never existed.

356
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,440
 All of those documents of all those child pageants where it shows what she, her ranks

357
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
 were, those were fake.

358
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,840
 Everyone who met her at those pageants, they didn't meet her, that's all fake.

359
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,160
 I think you guys are seeing a theme here, every piece of evidence about her doesn't

360
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
 exist.

361
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,560
 Or it exists, but it's of a fake person.

362
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,280
 It's a conspiracy theory that just denies and sent this a good conspiracy theory takes

363
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,960
 place in a time and a location that's not easily verifiable, right?

364
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,680
 I, first off, I have no interest to go back and start interviewing people who worked in

365
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,080
 the child pageant industry with Jean-Benais.

366
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
 Somebody could, right?

367
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,720
 I don't think it's a good use of your time, but somebody could and they could verify they

368
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,800
 could go up to these other contestants, they'd be what?

369
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,800
 And their twenties or thirties, they'd be in their thirties by now and you've talked

370
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,920
 to them, be like, did you know Jean-Benais Ramsey?

371
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,240
 You could do on the ground research, but nobody's going to because it's one of those things

372
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,880
 that everyone knows she exists.

373
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,040
 So why prove it?

374
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,400
 And that's what happens with a lot of these conspiracy theories.

375
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,920
 But because we're in the year 2022, I don't have access to those records.

376
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,840
 All those, all those records were pre-digital.

377
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,600
 And the thing is, is that if you did have access to the records, they would just say the records

378
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
 are fake.

379
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,000
 So you'd have to go actually interview these people and then they just go, well now you're

380
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,920
 just part of the conspiracy theory.

381
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,640
 But another, this is so interesting and you may think that Jason's just reading this weird

382
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,960
 conspiracy theory.

383
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,440
 This conspiracy theory is gaining traction.

384
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
 This conspiracy theory is gaining traction.

385
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,240
 And the thing that human vibrations likes to do is conflate two events.

386
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,720
 For example, she makes the statement that, let me read this to you.

387
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,840
 This is from the Twitter feed.

388
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:02,800
 "Two logbook pages recording the arrival of Jean-Benais Ramsey at the morgue went missing,

389
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:11,400
 stolen, gone, as if they never existed."

390
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,880
 And she takes that and goes, they never existed.

391
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,440
 She keeps conflating the two.

392
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,120
 The pages were stolen like they were never existed, therefore they never existed.

393
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,720
 That's not the case.

394
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,080
 We can look at, I found this article.

395
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,520
 She goes, no one can find anything about this anymore.

396
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,860
 I found this article.

397
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,600
 She goes, this stuff isn't covered in the news.

398
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,080
 I found this article 30 seconds of Googling.

399
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:41,520
 In 1997, there was some sicko named James Thompson, who apparently became obsessed with Jean-Benais

400
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
 Ramsey.

401
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,040
 If you want loose generation, go to this dude's house.

402
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,440
 He's known as a corpse artist.

403
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,320
 Apparently he takes photos of dead people.

404
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,560
 It's not like made of cake.

405
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,320
 Takes photos of dead people holding up signs or they have messages written on their stomach

406
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,920
 with lipstick or something like that.

407
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
 I don't know.

408
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,040
 But he's a corpse artist, right?

409
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,120
 And he broke into the morgue, which he merely has access to.

410
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,960
 He's taken all those photographs.

411
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
 And he stole the two pages from the logbook.

412
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
 That is true.

413
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,920
 He could steal those pages.

414
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,240
 But the article that I just pulled up, right?

415
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:23,720
 The Verifers article pulls up states that he made photocopies of those logbook pages

416
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,360
 and sent them to his friends.

417
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,040
 So not only do they exist, there's multiple copies out there.

418
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,160
 It says in the article, there's multiple copies of this.

419
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,040
 In the article, it does not state if they ever got the pages back.

420
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,240
 So it's possible that the morgue got the pages back or they didn't.

421
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,480
 It does state that he broke into this guy's nuts.

422
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,960
 This guy broke into the Ramsay house, spent the night.

423
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
 They weren't there anymore.

424
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
 Right?

425
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
 They left the house with horrible memories.

426
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,280
 This was back in '97.

427
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,160
 He broke into the house, spent the night, and then he pushed some papers through the mail

428
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,480
 slot in the door and lit them on fire.

429
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,480
 And then he called the cops and said, "I set a fire at the Ramsay house and they arrested

430
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
 him."

431
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
 It's just a local weirdo, right?

432
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,280
 I don't know if the papers that he burned were the logbook pages.

433
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,240
 The article wasn't specific about that.

434
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,400
 But what it is specific about is there's multiple copies of these pages out now.

435
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,080
 So they didn't exist.

436
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
 They existed.

437
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,600
 How could you steal something that didn't exist?

438
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,200
 How could this guy break in and steal these pages that didn't exist?

439
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,600
 It would be far easier for them to just say, "Oh yeah, we lost it."

440
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,920
 And then not have to create a whole new backstory.

441
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,680
 Is she saying that James M. Thompson doesn't exist as well, that he's actually just a fictional

442
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,440
 character?

443
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,760
 We also get this.

444
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,320
 And like I said, she says this was never reported and that she'll show screenshots of articles.

445
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,280
 And you're like, "It was clearly reported.

446
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,120
 You took a photo of it.

447
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,400
 You took a screenshot of it.

448
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,240
 So how are you saying that this wasn't reported in any mainstream news sources and stuff like

449
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,040
 that?"

450
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,760
 She also has weird stuff like this.

451
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,360
 So she's already said that they were stolen like they never existed, therefore.

452
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,080
 And actually, that's a good point.

453
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,920
 Why does Jean Benet Ramsey not exist, but the parents do?

454
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,600
 Like are they also holograms?

455
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,680
 Because wouldn't have been easier to have.

456
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
 This would be the easier thing.

457
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,560
 If I was setting up some sort of diabolical fake scenario like this, I would have had

458
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,880
 the entire family massacred.

459
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,320
 And you'd have a photo of a little boy and a little girl and a dad and the mom and a

460
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,840
 puppy, and they are all brutally slaughtered on Christmas Eve.

461
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,920
 And the killer was never caught.

462
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,320
 And you have all of these fake photos and all of these fake home movies.

463
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,080
 And then you would not have to worry about any of that stuff.

464
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,520
 And again, that's just me.

465
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,520
 That's just me in what, 45 seconds came over there?

466
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,920
 We're talking about demonic forces.

467
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,560
 So why even have the two parents walking around?

468
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,640
 It would be an unsolved mystery.

469
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,800
 They were brutally slaughtered on Christmas Eve.

470
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,880
 He sliced off each of their skins and then put it on the other person.

471
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,720
 So the little boy was dressed up like daddy and the little girl was wearing mommy's loose,

472
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,400
 flabby skin.

473
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
 There you go.

474
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,200
 How much loose did I just generate by putting that image in your head?

475
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,040
 A mom's flayed body wearing the skin of her dead daughter just stretched over her face.

476
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
 There you go.

477
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,120
 You're welcome demons for creating more loose.

478
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,520
 That'd be the easiest thing, right?

479
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,840
 And then again, so you would have, this would be a con you'd have to pull on all the police

480
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,800
 and Boulder, all of the officials, all of the authors who's written about this, who

481
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
 have gone to Boulder.

482
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,960
 This guy James, who broke into the house and he goes, "What?

483
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,560
 It doesn't look like anyone ever lived here."

484
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,080
 And the demon knocks him over the head with a frying pan and goes, "Ha ha ha, you discovered

485
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
 a secret."

486
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,880
 Everyone in town would have to be in on it.

487
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,680
 Everyone in that neighborhood would have to be in on it.

488
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,120
 Now if you think of demons running things and you could just be like, "Oh, demon.

489
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,000
 You're just fan waving it all away.

490
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,680
 Demons making powers and stuff like that."

491
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,520
 But every author who interviewed the family to write a book, I could see this conspiracy

492
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,680
 theory working, but you would need to do more than what's been done.

493
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,880
 Again, just massacre the entire family.

494
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,760
 That would cover up all of this stuff of people walking around and possibly giving up the

495
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,600
 con and stuff like that.

496
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:29,080
 But whatever, because human vibrations and people nowadays have no way of actually proving

497
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,880
 she's alive or she ever existed because you can't, right?

498
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,320
 At this point you'd have to do all sorts of groundwork.

499
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,320
 That's why these conspiracy theories that say X isn't real, X doesn't exist, they're

500
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,280
 actually really hard to disprove.

501
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,600
 Most people just go, "That's stupid.

502
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,920
 I'm not even going to give that any thought."

503
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,480
 And that's what happens with flat earth.

504
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,680
 Flat earth people were going, "The earth is flattened."

505
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,000
 So people were like, "I'm not even going to debate that with you."

506
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,080
 And now it's one of the biggest conspiracy theories.

507
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,120
 I think a lot of people do it as a joke, but it's one of the biggest conspiracy theories

508
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,760
 out there because no one stood up and said, "No, no, no, this is why that doesn't make

509
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
 sense.

510
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
 People just let it grow and grow."

511
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
 And now you can't fight it.

512
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,680
 There's just too many of them.

513
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,320
 Then she goes into this weird fascination.

514
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,680
 I mean, I'm going to give her credit for two things.

515
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,320
 One, she's laying it out.

516
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,920
 It took a long time, just a lot of photos of the Twitter thread, and apparently she

517
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,840
 had posted this originally and it got deleted.

518
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,840
 Because it's definitely, people could see it was insensitive.

519
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,320
 I'm not pro-deleting the conspiracy theory.

520
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,320
 I don't think it's necessarily harmful.

521
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,560
 But what's interesting is she mentions the previous thread and she says this.

522
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,480
 And I'm questioning if she was posting the thread from somewhere else or if she'd written

523
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
 it.

524
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
 I don't know.

525
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
 I don't know.

526
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,600
 Maybe it's been a good scrub of it or maybe she deleted it.

527
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
 Who knows?

528
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,240
 But she says the previous thread, "Although intriguing and seemingly well researched,

529
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,920
 was 100% speculation."

530
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:05,840
 Yeah, this is pretty speculative too in the sense that speculative is made up.

531
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,840
 But maybe because she feels like she has these sources and things like that.

532
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,440
 And she starts to get into this really weird rant about spark plugs.

533
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,400
 She, okay, so here's the thing.

534
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,600
 In every good conspiracy theory, there's a point where you have got to go, "Yeah, that

535
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,480
 is a little weird."

536
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,960
 That is a little weird, right?

537
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,040
 So here's the thing.

538
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,760
 She included these quotes where they're like the family would be talking or their community

539
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,280
 member would be talking and they're like, "Jean-Bené Ramsey was the spark of life in

540
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
 this family."

541
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,600
 Jean-Bené Ramsey, she just had a sparkling personality, that kind of stuff, right?

542
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,680
 And she starts talking about, human vibration starts talking about spark plugs because a

543
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,040
 spark plug is used to like, spark plug is basically used to deliver that electrical current into

544
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
 your ignition system.

545
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,200
 Yes, I did have to look that up on Wikipedia.

546
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,040
 She starts comparing Jean-Bené Ramsey to a spark plug and I was like, "What in the

547
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,600
 world are you talking about?

548
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,120
 This is so bizarre."

549
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,680
 Yes, people say you light up my life.

550
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,240
 That does not turn me into a thermonuclear weapon.

551
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,720
 It's a term of endearment.

552
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,560
 She had such a spark in her and now it's gone.

553
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,800
 And then she posts this quote from Jean Ramsey.

554
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,000
 I was struggling to remember his name the whole time.

555
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 I didn't write it down in my notes, but until I got this far down now, I see it.

556
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,240
 Jean Ramsey, Jean-Bené's dad wrote a book called The Death of Innocence and it says

557
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,600
 in the book, quote, "As I lay in bed staring into the morning darkness, I couldn't help

558
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,560
 but remember what a spark plug Jean-Bené always was to our family."

559
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:55,840
 Okay, that does not mean that I agree with you that she does not exist.

560
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
 That is a weird term.

561
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,960
 You're basically, your family's just a motor sitting there waiting to get started and

562
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,920
 Jean-Bené comes in and goes, "Hi guys!"

563
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,560
 I mean, maybe he called her a little sparky.

564
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,920
 I don't know.

565
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,240
 But again, that is weird.

566
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,120
 Like that, I don't give her credit where her credits do.

567
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,840
 You think she's a spark plug because she's generating luch.

568
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,600
 See, she's at the beginning of this perpetual luch engine.

569
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,960
 She's the spark plug and that was kind of his way of letting those in the know know that

570
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
 she wasn't real.

571
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,080
 I wonder what she thinks about Madeleine McCann.

572
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,560
 I wonder what she thinks about these other big true crime cases.

573
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,640
 But yeah, that's basically the theory.

574
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,120
 Jean-Bené Ramsey never existed.

575
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:50,920
 This was all a ritual to produce massive amounts of luch for demonic overlords or the

576
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,680
 Archons or whatever.

577
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,360
 Jean-Bené Ramsey never existed.

578
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,920
 Every piece of evidence you've ever seen of her is created by an AI.

579
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,280
 Apparently, this is the level of research.

580
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,400
 Jean-Ramsey worked her place called Access Graphics.

581
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,800
 And she's like, "What type of graphics, dude?"

582
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 Look it up!

583
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,560
 Why don't you find out what type of company Access Graphics is?

584
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:22,200
 That will tell you there's no hint that Jean-Ramsey was working for SkyNet, working for some advanced

585
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,120
 AI back in 1996.

586
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:31,320
 The program barely works today, but it was able to produce hours of content.

587
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,960
 That can now be upscaled up, right?

588
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,440
 But see again, if you took old video footage from 1990s and you wanted to show it on Netflix

589
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,920
 documentary, you're going to boost the resolution.

590
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,240
 You're going to do all this stuff to make it look better.

591
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,200
 In their eyes, it's just a cover-up, right?

592
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,160
 They're making, they're perfecting the AI.

593
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,160
 Access Graphics, by the way, they sold hardware and software developed by Sun Microsystems.

594
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,560
 I don't even know if Sun is still around.

595
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,360
 They were big when I was a kid, but Sun Microsystems.

596
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,920
 And they were owned, see this is part of the conspiracy theory, right?

597
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,320
 They were a subsidiary owned by Lockheed Martin.

598
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
 So there you go.

599
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,120
 You still have that, "Hmm, Lockheed Martin, huh?

600
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,760
 The fence contractor, maybe they would do this."

601
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,320
 It would be much easier to fake the entire family.

602
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,640
 And honestly, it would be 100 times easier if you're a demon, if you have this type of

603
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,360
 power at your hand to just kill the kid for real, right?

604
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,560
 Wouldn't that be easier than faking it?

605
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,120
 Like demon just going and killing.

606
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,400
 I'm not an advocating murderer, but I'm saying like if you were going to fake it, this is

607
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
 a scenario.

608
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,920
 People get killed all the time.

609
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,880
 Kids get killed all the time.

610
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,520
 I as part of the job of doing this show, I read two to three different true crime websites

611
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
 a day, not just articles.

612
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,520
 And people are getting like killing their kids with hammers and throwing them out of windows.

613
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,480
 Horrible stuff.

614
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,040
 Horrible murder, suicide.

615
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,640
 That's unfortunately how I wake up every day.

616
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,880
 Little kids, multiple murder suicides.

617
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,040
 You don't have to fake it.

618
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,200
 But that's that conspiracy theory that it is all faked.

619
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,280
 And again, like any good conspiracy theory, there's stuff that's going to pop up.

620
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,480
 When I was just trying to find out what access graphics did, because I go, I can't say she

621
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
 needs a researcher, I should research it as well.

622
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,520
 I'm getting other conspiracy theories.

623
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,800
 Like they're popping up as I'm trying to find these people.

624
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
 Like, well, you know, in Colorado, Paladin Press used to be there.

625
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,480
 And they used to put out conspiratorial magazines and magazines how to kill people and stuff

626
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
 like that.

627
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,000
 It was an old, back for the internet, you had to buy books on that, Paladin Press.

628
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,760
 So that's a conspiracy theory in a nutshell.

629
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
 Jean-Bonne was fake.

630
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,880
 It was a fake event to generate a bunch of loosh.

631
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,160
 I remember I was reading that and I go, okay, this is super interesting.

632
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,200
 Let's see if I can find out a little bit more about human vibrations, right?

633
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,840
 Because that might give me some sort of context.

634
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,560
 Is this someone who just spews off nonsense all the time?

635
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,040
 Is this a one time Twitter thread thing?

636
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,680
 I went and I looked up human vibrations.

637
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
 She has a podcast.

638
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,880
 And I go, oh, hmm, a fellow podcaster, eh?

639
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,680
 Let's see what she's up to.

640
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:21,080
 I may be accused of a lot of things on this show, but I will not be accused of being a

641
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,680
 simp for human vibrations.

642
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,120
 But man, a woman has a sexy voice.

643
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,000
 I was reading all this stuff and I was like, this is nuts.

644
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,040
 And she has quite a sexy voice and that's not fair to Han's warm hat, right?

645
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
 His voice is not sexy.

646
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,800
 So I make fun of him all the time.

647
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,320
 But I'm hearing her voice and I was like, wow, you know what's so interesting about human

648
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,720
 vibrations is that not only does she have a very pleasing voice to listen to, she sounds

649
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,920
 like a normal person.

650
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,800
 She does the show, it's called, and I'm not like trying to start internet beef or anything

651
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
 with them.

652
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,640
 And she does a show called Real Eyes Radio.

653
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,360
 And I was like, okay, I got to check this out.

654
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,080
 Like, let's see what's going on here.

655
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,800
 She's doing the show with somebody else.

656
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,920
 Some dude with a British accent wasn't interested, so I didn't really look into it.

657
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
 She does the show with someone else.

658
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,160
 They sound completely normal.

659
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,320
 I've listened to a thousand podcasts over my life and it sounds like any podcast.

660
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,160
 It sounds like they could start talking about their careers in stand-up comedy in LA.

661
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,160
 It sounds like they're about to start talking about their favorite television show.

662
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,320
 It sounds like they're going to start talking about Marvel Comics, whatever.

663
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,420
 Totally normal people.

664
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,800
 And I'm listening to it and they're doing an episode on Ghislaine Maxwell and they start

665
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
 talking.

666
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,040
 I just picked the most recent episode.

667
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,320
 They're talking about Ghislaine Maxwell and they do start saying stuff like, Ghislaine

668
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
 Maxwell doesn't exist.

669
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,760
 And I was like, okay, so is this the whole shtick?

670
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,320
 Ghislaine Maxwell doesn't exist.

671
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,320
 And they talked about, there was that weird Photoshop photo of Ghislaine Maxwell.

672
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,840
 We covered it a long time ago where she was at the fast food restaurant outdoors and like

673
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,320
 the book and the background was changing.

674
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
 It was quite weird.

675
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,480
 Ghislaine Maxwell doesn't exist.

676
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,920
 She goes, how come we've never seen a mugshot of Ghislaine Maxwell?

677
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,200
 It's because she doesn't exist.

678
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,880
 But you're thinking, well, wait a second.

679
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,120
 If there's a Photoshop of her standing next to Bill Clinton, who was there?

680
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,260
 Because like that's the big photos, right?

681
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,280
 Her standing next to these other world leaders.

682
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,400
 Who, what?

683
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,680
 Were they all fake?

684
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:24,080
 And if they could fake those photos, why can't they fake a mugshot?

685
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,320
 Like again, I just totally blows in my mind and then probably the best way to wrap up

686
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
 this episode.

687
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
 It's gone a little long.

688
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,280
 But they were talking about Ghislaine Maxwell.

689
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:39,120
 So obviously Jeffrey Epstein came up and she goes, you know that I always say Epstein didn't

690
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,800
 kill himself because Epstein didn't exist.

691
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,680
 And I was like, okay, I've now listened to about 15 minutes of a random episode of your

692
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
 podcast.

693
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
 Very good production values.

694
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,880
 They seem very knowledgeable.

695
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,280
 And at least the conspiracy theories they believe in.

696
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
 Sounds great.

697
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,560
 Super sexy voice.

698
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,560
 They have a good community.

699
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,000
 I don't agree with anything that they're saying, but a lot of people listen to the podcast.

700
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
 They got a lot of good Patreon supporters.

701
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,160
 So nice, right?

702
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,400
 But if we come on and now Jeffrey Epstein doesn't exist, I wish that was true, right?

703
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,640
 Basically he doesn't exist.

704
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,160
 And she goes, the tagline Epstein didn't kill himself is actually a trick.

705
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,200
 It's to make you think, yeah, you're right.

706
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
 Epstein was murdered.

707
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,840
 And then when you realize that Epstein was murdered, you believe Epstein was a real person.

708
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,120
 It's all a trick.

709
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,320
 It's all a mental trick.

710
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,960
 Epstein didn't kill himself because Epstein never existed.

711
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:44,560
 And it is so hard to prove something existed.

712
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,240
 If you're not in the room with it and you're having an argument with someone, you can literally,

713
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,120
 no matter what they say, you can literally say that didn't exist.

714
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,760
 And as they try to pull up photos, they're like, no, come on, our son, our son does exist.

715
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
 He's just at school.

716
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
 You have to go pick him up.

717
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,040
 You're like, nope, I don't believe it.

718
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,080
 All the evidence you can show, you can just go, that's fake.

719
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
 That's fake.

720
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
 That's fake.

721
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:11,600
 It's surprisingly hard to argue with someone if they just simply refuse to believe in something.

722
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,840
 But that is the saga of Jean-Benet Ramsey, or at least in the minds of this group of people.

723
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,960
 Jean-Benet Ramsey never existed.

724
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,000
 And mark my words, this will become a big conspiracy theory over the next year.

725
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,200
 I really believe, definitely as you have people who were born way after this event, I'm sure

726
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,640
 the hosts of Realized Radio are probably about 10 to 20 years younger than me.

727
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,960
 You get farther away from that.

728
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,160
 They will believe it.

729
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,000
 And this theory will spread and it will spread to Facebook.

730
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,840
 And then even people my age will go, well, you know, maybe they're right.

731
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,840
 Maybe all that stuff I saw was fake.

732
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,840
 And once you start thinking that, the floodgates are open.

733
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:03,840
 If you want to generate loo-sh, you want to generate fear and anger, make someone believe

734
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,840
 that their entire life was a lie.

735
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,840
 Make someone believe that every moment of every day they've been lied to and deceived.

736
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,840
 Make people believe that they don't know what reality is.

737
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:25,840
 That is the ultimate loo-sh machine.

738
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,840
 It makes you so mad you want to tear down the system.

739
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
 You don't know who to believe.

740
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
 You don't know what to believe.

741
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
 You become paranoid.

742
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,840
 You think even the people around you who are saying, no, clearly that's real.

743
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
 They're part of the system.

744
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,840
 They're not just a toy.

745
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
 They're a toy.

746
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,840
 Anger, hate, rage.

747
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:54,840
 This conspiracy theory may be about a ritual that was designed to create loo-sh for the demonic overlords.

748
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,840
 But is this conspiracy theory the ritual?

749
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:10,840
 It's not designed to open our minds, but to provide the loo-sh, the demons, or after all along.

750
