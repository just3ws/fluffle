1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Suck you by, ink you by, and everything in between.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,320
 And today we take a look at love spells

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,600
 that may finally help you get the girl or guy

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,760
 of your dreams today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,340
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,080
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,600
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,880
 I hope you're having a great day.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,240
 Today we wrap it up.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,840
 Today we wrap up.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,640
 It's our last episode of our sexual conspiracies.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,000
 There's a few more that will go on throughout the series,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 but this is the last day

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,460
 of the sexual conspiracy themed week.

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,680
 And it's going to be a doozy.

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,280
 We're talking paranormal, we're talking ghosts

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
 and demons and all sorts of craziness today.

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,600
 You know, the good thing about the internet

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,960
 is you can always find recipes for stuff.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,040
 Now I don't cook a lot, so it doesn't really help me out.

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,360
 But you know what, like you can go and find a recipe

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,280
 on how to basically make your own Chipotle burrito at home.

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,040
 Now I'll take a side note here.

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,120
 Chipotle is the best chain restaurant

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,480
 in the history of humanity.

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,040
 I think if I had a time machine and I could go

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,840
 and try out every kebab stand,

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,920
 every crusader meat wagon,

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
 every old tiny Benjamin Franklin

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,620
 served lightning crusted churros.

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,540
 None of them would compare to the deliciousness of Chipotle.

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,600
 I used to work next to a Chipotle

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,700
 and I ate Chipotle every single day for a year.

36
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,060
 And I loved it, I love Chipotle.

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,000
 I'm actually going on vacation soon.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,840
 It shouldn't affect the,

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,480
 I may end up taking a couple of days off

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,280
 towards the middle of the vacation.

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,500
 But the good thing of it is that I will be vacationing

42
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,300
 right next door to a Chipotle.

43
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,540
 So I will be going there every day.

44
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,740
 I'm thinking about going in there,

45
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,780
 introducing myself to the staff.

46
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,220
 So they get to know me

47
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,660
 because I will be in there all the time.

48
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,260
 I'll probably start dating a girl there.

49
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,260
 We'll have a little whirlwind affair.

50
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,300
 Get a discount of course,

51
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,900
 because I'm dating one of the girls.

52
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,780
 I can't wait.

53
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,500
 Deliciousness there.

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,460
 Steak burrito, chicken burrito, it doesn't matter.

55
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,160
 It's all good.

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,140
 What's the barbacoa?

57
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,260
 Yeah, that's pretty good too.

58
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,020
 And the carnitas, not a fan of the veggie one.

59
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,780
 It's just a bunch of corn and a tortilla.

60
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,300
 But it's all good.

61
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,420
 Chipotle.

62
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,260
 Eat fresh.

63
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,260
 I actually don't know what their slogan is,

64
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,580
 but if I knew what their slogan is,

65
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,660
 I would get a shirt.

66
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,860
 I actually wrote Chipotle

67
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,700
 and asked them to open up a Chipotle in Hood River.

68
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,340
 You know, I have a friend up here from Long Beach.

69
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,580
 We're having a lot of fun.

70
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,700
 We're having a lot of fun up here, doing our thing.

71
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,860
 The best thing about having friends come though,

72
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,660
 from out of town up here to the Pacific Northwest,

73
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,140
 little hamlet of Hood River, is the comfort food.

74
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,420
 It's always a nice treat.

75
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,740
 A nice little diversion.

76
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,340
 Let's get started with the episode.

77
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,540
 So today, we are going to talk about succubi and incubi.

78
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,940
 Now, the difference is a lot of people use the terms

79
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,340
 interchangeably and they're actually

80
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,780
 completely different things.

81
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,260
 A succubi is a female demon who has sex with you

82
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,540
 and sucks the energy out of your body.

83
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,700
 An incubi is a male demon who has sex with you

84
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,100
 and sucks the energy out of your body.

85
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,780
 Now, that alone should be the risk-reward calculation

86
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,620
 for you.

87
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,300
 Like, yes, I'm having sex with an otherworldly entity

88
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,140
 who can be as hot as it wants to be,

89
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,220
 but they're draining my body of energy.

90
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,020
 That's always been the trade-off.

91
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,780
 Now, of course, there are subcultures on the internet

92
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,060
 who don't believe, well, first off,

93
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,500
 they believe that succubi and incubi are real.

94
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,080
 And those are old legends.

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,860
 The idea that these creatures come and suck your soul

96
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,940
 and are, among other things, at night,

97
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,260
 they prey on you, those are old legends.

98
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,680
 This is nothing new, but the new internet community

99
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,680
 believes that you can date them.

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,740
 You can go out with them and you can have relationships

101
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,780
 with them and there's all sorts of tips

102
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,780
 on how to summon them and have them be a part of your life.

103
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,060
 Now, I get it, sometimes dating real people

104
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,180
 can be a bit of a pain.

105
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,220
 You have to actually go out and meet people

106
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,940
 and then convince them that you're worth being,

107
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,980
 you know, at the very least having sex with, if not,

108
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,300
 you have to prove a little more worth

109
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,140
 to have being a relationship with them.

110
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,100
 So if you're feeling lonely or particularly randy that night

111
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,340
 or you just wanna try something new,

112
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:38,180
 I can see the allure of wanting to bang a demon woman.

113
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,980
 It's probably not a smart deal.

114
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,580
 There's quite a few websites, though, dealing with this.

115
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,580
 One of them, the kind of the most basic thing you do

116
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,540
 is you have to write a letter of intent to Lilith.

117
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,260
 Now, Lilith, that's old Jewish mythology,

118
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,340
 so basically Adam, God created Adam,

119
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,740
 and then he created Lilith and she was a total bitch.

120
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,540
 I mean, she just wouldn't follow any of the rules

121
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,460
 and she was just a total pain in both God and Adam's side.

122
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,580
 Get it, 'cause the rib, get it?

123
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,820
 Anyways, and so she got banished

124
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,180
 and basically erased from religious history

125
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,340
 and then God created Eve.

126
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,900
 Now, because of all that, she's the queen of the succubi.

127
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,100
 I also think she's the queen of miscarriages,

128
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,340
 like she's the cause of miscarriages

129
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,060
 if you miscarry or maybe even abort a child.

130
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,700
 It belongs to Lilith, whatever.

131
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,980
 But apparently out of that horrible side quest

132
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,300
 of her taking, you know, unborn children,

133
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,300
 she also is the queen of the succubi.

134
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,320
 And so what you have to do is you have to write her a letter.

135
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,220
 Here's the ritual.

136
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,100
 You're gonna write Lilith this demon woman

137
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,840
 who existed 10,000 years before the rest of humanity.

138
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,620
 You have to write her a letter, apparently.

139
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,880
 You can't send her an email,

140
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,900
 Lilith@gardenofedon.com.

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,700
 Okay, I'll stop telling those bad jokes.

142
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,500
 So you're gonna write a letter to Lilith

143
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,180
 and this is what you're gonna put in here.

144
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,460
 First off, you have to know what you want.

145
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,980
 So if you just want like a quick flaying,

146
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,540
 you have to go into thinking,

147
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,140
 "I want a hot Randy succubi

148
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,040
 "to come to my house tonight

149
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,680
 "and we're gonna do all sorts of crazy things."

150
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,080
 And she's a ghost, so nothing will stay inside of her

151
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,840
 and my sheets are gonna get all sticky.

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,960
 Or I wanna have a girlfriend who is from another dimension

153
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,880
 and has wings and can set my enemies on fire.

154
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,120
 You have to know what you're getting into.

155
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,920
 It says the optimal time to do this ritual is at 3 a.m.

156
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,120
 So already she's kind of set the time limits.

157
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,920
 Don't change me, Lilith.

158
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,680
 I'm my own man, I'll do it when I want.

159
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,800
 You write this letter and you're gonna write,

160
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,340
 "Watch, I'm gonna read this out loud

161
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,460
 "and a bunch of succubi are gonna beat me up tonight."

162
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,620
 Okay, so you write this letter out

163
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,460
 and you're gonna write,

164
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,100
 "I wonder if you write it out with intent."

165
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,820
 You get a succubi, but does Lilith listen to podcasts?

166
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,920
 If I read these instructions out loud with intent,

167
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,380
 will I get a handy from a demon woman tonight?

168
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,500
 Please be hot.

169
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,660
 You know, I will say that at least the artwork

170
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,900
 for the succubis forums and stuff,

171
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,200
 they're pretty hot, these chicks are pretty hot,

172
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,160
 but they don't exist in this form.

173
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
 If it looked like this,

174
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,080
 then everyone would be banging these things.

175
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,040
 Anyways, okay, so I'm gonna write this letter out.

176
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,780
 Let's see, what personality should my succubi lady have?

177
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,680
 She should be randy, but not too grabby.

178
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,960
 I hate it when she should know what she's doing.

179
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
 That's the first thing.

180
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,840
 And a one night stand.

181
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,820
 I don't want anything long term with a demon lady.

182
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,840
 So you're gonna write in this letter,

183
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
 "Lilith, please receive this offering.

184
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,380
 I give this truthfully and willingly."

185
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,220
 What offering?

186
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,380
 There's nothing listed there.

187
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,840
 Maybe I didn't skip steps, but there's definitely,

188
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,680
 yeah, there's nothing there.

189
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,940
 You just write to Lilith on the top of it

190
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,220
 and then you say, "Oh, I should specify this.

191
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,420
 One of her daughters, one of her daughters,

192
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,540
 not one of her sons."

193
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,540
 Let's specify that, okay.

194
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,380
 "Lilith, please receive this offering.

195
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,980
 I give this truthfully and willingly."

196
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,460
 There's no offering in here, so it doesn't matter.

197
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,560
 You light a candle and then you set the paper on fire,

198
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,280
 which I'm not gonna burn my laptop.

199
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,920
 And then it says, "May the light of this candle

200
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,760
 burn brightly and guide your daughter/son to me."

201
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,800
 Again, I don't think that's, I think you should specify.

202
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,400
 You see, this is a problem with spells,

203
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,200
 is that one, you're supposed to be ultra specific,

204
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,160
 but in the sentence itself, you write daughter/son.

205
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,120
 So do I write or say daughter/son?

206
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
 This doesn't make sense.

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,140
 You're gonna cause a hot male demon

208
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,860
 to break into my house tonight.

209
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,260
 You let the candle burn for 30 minutes,

210
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,340
 you relax and clear your mind for a while.

211
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,540
 Next step, this is gonna shock you guys.

212
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,580
 The next step, you just imagine,

213
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,220
 you just pretend that a demon woman is in your house

214
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,620
 and you masturbate.

215
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,100
 Queen of the demons cannot move objects in your house.

216
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,700
 She cannot flick your lights on and off.

217
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,660
 She cannot turn your television on to the spice channel,

218
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,960
 you know, for a little bit of background entertainment,

219
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,740
 in case you can't get it up.

220
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,980
 She can't do any of that stuff.

221
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,340
 She only appears in your head.

222
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,340
 So basically what you've told me to do is to write a letter

223
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,640
 and then imagine, i.e. masturbate,

224
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,940
 that I'm having sex with a demon.

225
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,780
 And I know what you're thinking,

226
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,700
 "Jason, you just picked the wrong website."

227
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,100
 Well, I found another website.

228
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,100
 This one, you know to trust because it has a black background

229
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,940
 and what spooky website doesn't have a black background.

230
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,100
 This one, you cut out the middleman.

231
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,480
 You don't talk to Lilith.

232
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,320
 Why?

233
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,160
 You don't go to the middle manager.

234
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
 You're gonna go to the top.

235
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,720
 This one, you talk to Father Satan.

236
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,880
 So apparently that's his title now.

237
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,960
 And once again, you have to be very specific

238
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,520
 of what type of girl you want.

239
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,920
 This one specifies that some demons are monogamous.

240
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,560
 Okay, I thought monogamy was a social construct,

241
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,800
 but anyways.

242
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,240
 So you should find a demon that is compatible with you

243
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
 and it's kind of hard.

244
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,760
 There's not really a tender for these type of things.

245
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,900
 And this one also tells you to imagine

246
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,260
 that they are there and to masturbate

247
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,020
 and you'll feel it in your head

248
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,580
 and other parts of your body.

249
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,860
 This one's funny because it says,

250
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,000
 "Demon friends and lovers are wonderful

251
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,620
 "for those who are in prison,

252
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,580
 "isolated or incarcerated in any way."

253
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,380
 Sure, good enough, but there's a bit of a problem here.

254
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,220
 If I'm in prison or isolated or incarcerated,

255
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,660
 probably don't have access to the internet, dude.

256
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,800
 So how am I gonna read this?

257
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,680
 Anyways, this one, you also basically perform a ritual

258
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
 to Father Satan stating your needs and what you want.

259
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,800
 And then a demon may or may not show up, spoiler alert,

260
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,200
 they won't.

261
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,000
 And you just begin fantasizing

262
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,680
 about having intercourse with the demon.

263
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,840
 This one actually uses the word fantasize multiple times.

264
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,840
 So all you're doing is praying to these creatures,

265
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,700
 these Lord and Lady of Hell,

266
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,940
 and then imagining that it actually happens

267
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,840
 and somehow that's proof that it actually happens.

268
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,540
 Suck you by and ink you by.

269
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,140
 Now, what's funny is there's actually been a lot of reports

270
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,300
 of people being raped by demons.

271
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,320
 So you have the ghost sex side of it,

272
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,520
 which is like the consensual stuff.

273
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,620
 And then you have ghost rape,

274
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,100
 where it is not, well, I guess you know

275
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,820
 the definition of rape, it's not consensual.

276
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,900
 I was looking at these articles,

277
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,020
 one of them said that in his findings,

278
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,180
 15% of all people on the planet report themselves

279
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,100
 being raped by a demon.

280
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,340
 Now, that's actually fairly common,

281
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,420
 but there's another word for it.

282
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,760
 It's called sleep paralysis.

283
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,840
 It's also times a lot of connected to,

284
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,480
 a lot of times connected to alien abductions.

285
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,780
 You can't move your body, you feel pinned down

286
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,420
 and you're very helpless.

287
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,460
 And some people see that as a sign that the,

288
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,780
 some people see it as a sign

289
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,060
 that the grays are coming to abduct them.

290
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,820
 Some people are seeing it as some sort of paranormal force

291
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,300
 holding them down and ravishing you.

292
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,260
 And then science sees it as basically

293
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,080
 as you're falling asleep or in that,

294
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,620
 you're in that waking state,

295
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,740
 your body's not aware that you're not dreaming anymore.

296
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,940
 And it does two things.

297
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,300
 You physically can't move

298
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,980
 'cause it thinks you're sleeping.

299
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,860
 And you begin to hallucinate

300
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,340
 'cause you're waking, dreaming.

301
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,500
 To put this theory to a test,

302
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,700
 it's something you can do yourself.

303
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,380
 When you go to sleep tonight,

304
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,420
 it's very interesting.

305
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,580
 I do it all the time.

306
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,500
 Close your eyes and you can trick your body

307
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,020
 into thinking you're asleep.

308
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,420
 And what you do is you close your eyes

309
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,180
 and you lay there and you're perfectly motionless.

310
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,760
 And what will happen is some part of your body

311
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,060
 will begin to itch and you'll itch it.

312
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,460
 And that's your body testing to see

313
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,500
 whether or not you're asleep or not.

314
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,380
 'Cause if you're asleep and your leg itches,

315
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,840
 you won't itch it 'cause you're asleep.

316
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,980
 Your consciousness doesn't perceive it.

317
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,860
 And then if you don't scratch it,

318
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,140
 that's one of the first steps to start lucid dreaming

319
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,940
 'cause your brain goes, okay, okay, he's asleep.

320
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,180
 Now I can start the process of unloading

321
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,320
 all of this information and I can start dreaming.

322
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,460
 So you, and what sleep paralysis,

323
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,660
 it's the other side of that.

324
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,860
 Your mind is awake, but your body,

325
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,500
 your brain still thinks it's asleep.

326
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,780
 And the reason why it has a self-defense mechanism,

327
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,980
 so you're not dreaming about being chased down the street

328
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,140
 by a bunch of bug chasers or something

329
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,860
 and you're not running around your apartment.

330
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,220
 You're perfectly emotional.

331
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
 As you may roll side to side, but in your dream,

332
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,420
 you're like sprinting for miles.

333
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,540
 My body is keeping me motionless there,

334
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,140
 but it has to test itself

335
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,460
 and it has to stick these limits on you.

336
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,180
 That's what sleep paralysis is.

337
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,980
 You're coming out of the sleep,

338
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,840
 but your body is still frozen.

339
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:49,020
 Now, I don't deny that there's paranormal activity.

340
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,340
 I don't even really deny the existence of demons.

341
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,980
 But I think if it was so easy

342
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,660
 that I could simply write a letter to Lilith or Satan

343
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,820
 and get a reply that, I mean, technically,

344
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,980
 it should, stuff should be flying around my apartment.

345
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,540
 We're talking about two of these like insanely dark,

346
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,500
 evil forces and the worst they can do

347
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,980
 or the most they can do with all of their power

348
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,140
 is put a picture in my head of a busty,

349
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,700
 I can imagine that right now.

350
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,380
 I am imagining that right now.

351
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,380
 I don't need to do any sort of ritual to imagine stuff.

352
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,060
 It's ridiculous.

353
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,260
 People spend so much time on this though.

354
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,340
 Now, it may happen.

355
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,340
 People may get raped by ghosts or demons, I don't know.

356
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,340
 But again, I don't think it's as simple

357
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,300
 as writing a letter or anything like that.

358
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,860
 If it happens, it happens.

359
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,220
 Now, I know what you're thinking.

360
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,780
 Love spells are really right, Jason.

361
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,900
 You totally believe in this stuff.

362
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,400
 You know, I talked a little bit about this

363
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,180
 on the episode "Salt Mining"

364
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,140
 where we talked about Arb corn stars

365
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,660
 unwitting psychic sexual vampires.

366
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,820
 I do believe that if you're putting energy out

367
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,020
 into the universe, other people can be receptive to it,

368
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,860
 whether they know it or not.

369
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,780
 I definitely think it works

370
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,660
 when two people are meeting face to face.

371
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,900
 So the theory goes, could it work across distances

372
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,140
 without the other person knowing?

373
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,940
 And to that, I don't know.

374
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,620
 I kind of think so.

375
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,700
 I think you can affect people.

376
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,020
 But I have nothing to back that up other than a theory.

377
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,180
 So if anyone can prove me wrong, I'm more than welcome to it.

378
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,460
 So I think on that issue,

379
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,580
 can I send my energy out towards somebody

380
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,580
 and get them to think about me?

381
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,900
 I personally don't see why not.

382
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,540
 And you may be thinking, Jason, you're an idiot.

383
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,660
 That's impossible.

384
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,340
 And like I said, fair enough.

385
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,340
 I think that is more likely and more possible

386
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,740
 than a love spell/love ritual.

387
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,460
 I've never been a fan of rituals in general,

388
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,700
 whether it's organized religion

389
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,260
 or a bunch of wickens running around naked in the woods.

390
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,660
 I think the fact that you can just do or say these things

391
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,140
 and somehow you've accessed the cheat code of the universe,

392
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,140
 I'm not a huge fan of.

393
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,700
 Not saying it's absolutely not true,

394
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,500
 but I think it's oversimplifying things.

395
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,740
 But I did wanna look at some of our magic spells,

396
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,700
 some of our love spells.

397
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,540
 So I was looking at this one.

398
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,340
 This one is a black magic true love spell.

399
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,580
 So this one is going to get somebody

400
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,660
 to fall in love with you.

401
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,700
 They're going to, you're gonna look inside your own soul

402
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,860
 and you'll find that block

403
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,580
 that is keeping you away from your true love.

404
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,180
 That's directly from the website.

405
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,340
 These are the ingredients.

406
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,380
 And one organic chicken wing.

407
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,860
 Not, you gotta get like foster farms or something.

408
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,460
 You can't get like a chicken nugget

409
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,860
 or anything that's been pumped full of hormones.

410
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,140
 One organic chicken wing, one pink candle,

411
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,540
 whoa, one sterile needle.

412
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,380
 Where's this going?

413
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,780
 Three drops of blood, yarn or thread matches,

414
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,060
 made out of wood, one sheet of parchment paper.

415
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,860
 You write on the paper with the organic chicken wing.

416
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,380
 Okay, and it says you won't see the name,

417
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,820
 but basically use the organic chicken wing

418
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,600
 to write the name or your name on the parchment paper.

419
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,300
 Use the candle and drop seven drops of wax on the paper.

420
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,060
 Get the needle to be sterile

421
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,260
 and drop three drops of blood on it.

422
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,940
 And then you think about your soulmate.

423
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,380
 You blow out the candle and say,

424
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,780
 "Sim words I can't understand."

425
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,420
 You wrap the chicken wing in the paper

426
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,940
 and use the yarn or thread to pack it into a little package.

427
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,340
 That same day, bury it

428
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,180
 and then eventually that person will fall in love with you.

429
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,060
 Oh wait, no, you have to light the remaining candle

430
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,260
 on the following full moon until it's burned itself out.

431
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,880
 Okay, so easy enough.

432
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,060
 So I had seen that one earlier and I go,

433
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,380
 oh, I wonder if they have any other spells.

434
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,340
 So we're on this website, Wishbonix,

435
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,980
 is the name of the website.

436
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,180
 So I found a black magic spell to stop cheating.

437
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,300
 So this is going to keep someone from cheating on you,

438
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,140
 obviously.

439
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,020
 Ingredients, one organic chicken wing.

440
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,820
 I think this website has own steak in a chicken farm

441
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,640
 because a lot of their spells involve chicken wings.

442
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,940
 It's pretty much the same thing.

443
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,500
 You're gonna write your name with the organic chicken wing.

444
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,020
 Seven drops of wax through drops of paper.

445
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,820
 This one, fans of 4chan will love this.

446
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,340
 The spell involves you saying kek three times, kek kek kek.

447
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,180
 Plus some other stuff I can't pronounce.

448
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,820
 That's to keep someone from cheating on you

449
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,060
 and that will go about the same way.

450
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,180
 Now again, I don't understand why you would have to use

451
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,420
 any sort of chicken wing and all that nonsense.

452
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,560
 Why can't you just use the power of the whale?

453
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,820
 But then again, I am not a magician.

454
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,820
 And I know what you're thinking.

455
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,140
 You're like, Jason, you're just kind of

456
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,300
 just reading off nonsense at this point.

457
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,940
 You don't believe it.

458
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,780
 You don't believe any of these rituals make any sense.

459
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,980
 I don't believe any of the rituals make any sense.

460
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
 I being the listener, you're just kind of like,

461
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,700
 dude, you're wasting my time.

462
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,540
 Let's talk about ageless travel again or something.

463
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,020
 This is the problem with this.

464
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,260
 Because again, it's praying on people.

465
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,620
 On this website, they have comments for whatever reason

466
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,520
 'cause it just makes them look like complete trash.

467
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,600
 Not the people commenting, but the website itself.

468
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,940
 On the spell on how to prevent the breakup

469
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,460
 with the candles and the chicken wing and all that stuff.

470
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,820
 Here's what a commenter left.

471
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,060
 And this was just in March 12th of this year.

472
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,300
 Please enlighten me.

473
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,220
 It's midnight here now and I just saw this page

474
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,100
 and I'm extremely desperate to do this specific spell.

475
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,580
 But I only have seven pieces of pink tea light candles

476
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,740
 while I have a good size red one.

477
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,340
 Can I still use the pink tea light

478
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,260
 and describe my name on its side?

479
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,020
 Can I use one pink tea light just for tonight

480
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,280
 as I can get a good size, same as my red one.

481
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,720
 First thing tomorrow, then it's inscribe the new one

482
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,360
 with my name again.

483
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 I really have to do this now.

484
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,120
 Do I keep all the remnants of the candles?

485
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,000
 So this woman is desperate.

486
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,760
 She's sad.

487
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,840
 Someone's about to break up with her life as she knows it.

488
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,320
 She feels isn't going to be the same.

489
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,080
 And here she is, blogging on this website

490
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,400
 and she never gets an answer on here to her question.

491
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,640
 She's like, I need to do this now.

492
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,960
 Please, please help.

493
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,460
 There's another spell on how to prevent a divorce,

494
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,060
 which that one, surprise, surprise,

495
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,700
 chicken wing included in that.

496
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,380
 It's kind of the same spell as well.

497
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,940
 And this person says, please help me.

498
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,500
 My wife is in the process of divorcing me.

499
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,420
 Please stop her now.

500
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,420
 You know, at a certain point,

501
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,620
 you're just praying on people in a moment of desperation.

502
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,740
 It's quite sad.

503
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,700
 You know, that's when this stuff goes

504
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,180
 from being entertaining and being like,

505
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,020
 ha ha, look at these rubes right in this website.

506
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,960
 And then you just have these poor people

507
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,740
 like really devastated and they're like, please magic website.

508
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,080
 Please candle organic chicken wing spell.

509
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,620
 Like help save my life.

510
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,080
 Help save this person from leaving me.

511
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
 And they're not responding.

512
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,220
 They're just, you know, trying to sell products

513
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,540
 and sell these issues and it's just gross.

514
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,680
 It's just gross.

515
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,740
 While looking for all this though,

516
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,320
 I did find a spell and this kind of sums everything up.

517
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,520
 It's very simple scale.

518
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,480
 It's very, very simple spell.

519
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,740
 It is a simple spell that will hopefully make known to you

520
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,060
 whether or not the person you like is gay.

521
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,540
 What do you need for this spell?

522
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,700
 One red candle, that's all.

523
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,300
 And it's pretty simple.

524
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,900
 It doesn't even tell you to light the candle.

525
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,260
 I don't know if you keep it in your pocket

526
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,100
 as you're walking around

527
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,020
 or if it's just sitting on your bookshelf.

528
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,980
 This is the spell.

529
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,460
 This, you chant these words anytime during the day.

530
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,420
 Send me signs throughout the day

531
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,220
 to help me know if blank is gay.

532
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,120
 That's it.

533
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,960
 That's it.

534
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,140
 So I'm wondering if when you say that

535
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,360
 you'll see a rainbow up here

536
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,760
 or your walk past the store

537
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,800
 and they'll be selling assless chaps for 50% off.

538
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,120
 Or you walk in a room and you see that person

539
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,280
 giving a blow job to another man.

540
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,120
 I don't know.

541
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,840
 They're all signs, technically.

542
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,320
 I don't know what you need the candle for.

543
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,800
 Nonsense.

544
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,760
 Nonsense, at least with the theory I have,

545
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,000
 there could be some sort of pseudo scientific principle

546
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,920
 behind it.

547
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,320
 You're not walking around saying,

548
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,860
 "Send me signs throughout the day

549
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,540
 "to help me know if blank is gay."

550
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,420
 I wonder what would happen if I did that to myself

551
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,660
 if I said that throughout the day.

552
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,720
 "Send me signs throughout the day

553
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,100
 "to help me know if Jason's gay."

554
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,500
 I wonder what would happen.

555
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,340
 I don't know.

556
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,580
 Maybe I'd end up buying some assless chaps.

557
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,880

562
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,080
 Well, we have finished our Sex Spiracy Week.

563
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,520
 I hope you had as much fun listening to it

564
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,320
 as I had researching it,

565
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,880
 because I didn't have a lot of fun,

566
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,880
 no, that's all I had, a fun researching it.

567
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,920
 Some of the last episode was a little rough

568
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,640
 because it got gross reading, all that stuff.

569
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,920
 But this episode was fun.

570
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,160
 Took the piss out of some magic users

571
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,920
 and people who believe that they're being demons.

572
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,840
 Dude, if I'm not mistaken,

573
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,460
 I believe that they're being demons.

574
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,960
 Dude, if I have sex with a demon tonight,

575
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,220
 I'm going to be upset.

576
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,860
 And if you end up, like, maybe this is like the ring

577
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,580
 that everyone who listens to this episode

578
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,740
 will end up being visited by a Suck-You-Buy or an In-Q-Buy.

579
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,620
 Depending on your intent, of course.

580
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,460
 Let me know.

581
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,500
 Hit me up on email.

582
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,620
 Send me an email.

583
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
 No photos, please.

584
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,860
 No, I don't want to see you, you know,

585
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,620
 masturbate and being like, "I'm being a ghost.

586
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,460
 "I'm being a ghost and it's just a 30-second video of you.

587
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,440
 "I can do without that."

588
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,820
 But we are going to move on.

589
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,600
 Next week, we're going to have all new stories.

590
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,300
 And you know, next week, I'm also,

591
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,160
 I got a lot of requests for this.

592
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,020
 I did not want to include it on this week

593
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,500
 because we were talking about a lot of the Suck stuff.

594
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,520
 But next week, we will finally cover the issue in Iowa.

595
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,220
 Is there something going on in Iowa

596
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,260
 with these missing children?

597
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,020
 Missing teenagers, adults, things like that.

598
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,780
 I just didn't want to cover it this episode.

599
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,100
 And I was hoping for some new information to come out.

600
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,660
 But really, it was just,

601
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,380
 with all of the stuff we were talking about this week,

602
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,260
 I didn't want to mix the two because one is,

603
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,180
 you know what I mean?

604
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,340
 Like when people go missing,

605
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,780
 you don't want to think of that type of stuff

606
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,620
 happening to them.

607
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,780
 And I thought that the segues would just be too weird.

608
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,900
 But we will be covering that.

609
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,340
 I've been getting a lot of requests for that.

610
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,980
 We'll be covering that too.

611
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,460
 So after this, what I'm going to do,

612
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,700
 I'm just going to go get some coffee.

613
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,260
 If you're interested, you could always join me

614
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,620
 for some coffee as well.

615
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,500
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy

616
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,980
 and true crime podcast.

617
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,940
 You don't have to listen to it every day,

618
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,260
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

619
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,900
 Have a great weekend and we will be back soon.

620
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,740
 Have a great one.

621
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,320
 (upbeat music)

622
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,900
 (upbeat music)

623
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,480
 (upbeat music)

624
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,060
 (upbeat music)

625
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,640
 (upbeat music)

626
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,220
 (upbeat music)

627
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,800
 (upbeat music)
