1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
 Two middle school girls enter a basement and three come out.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,840
 And then we go house hunting with a young couple trying to buy their first home.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,560
 They've looked all over the area and they've surprisingly found a very nice home right

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,640
 in their price range.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,600
 And from the second they pull up to check this house out they realize something's wrong.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:43,800
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,800
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing rolling around in the

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
 grass getting all itchy.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 I'm not going to judge.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,160
 Maybe that's your weirdo fetish.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,080
 But someone who doesn't have that fetish.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,280
 I'm assuming I don't think anyone has a grass fetish.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,200
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy patreons.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,560
 Long time supporter of the show.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,560
 Give it up for Matt Sprinkler.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,880
 He's brushing the grass off of his shoulders.

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,080
 They found my secret shame.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,120
 Matt you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
 If you guys can't support the patreon.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
 Totally understand.

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,680
 Just help spread the word about the show.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
 That really really helps out so much.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,440
 Matt I'm going to go ahead and toss you a little train engineer uniform.

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,680
 We got a special little whistle.

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,920
 We're taking a journey on the Carbunner caboose.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,320
 We're going down the rail line all the way out to a middle school.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,320
 Chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica chica

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:46,200
 The train's going by Matt's looking at all the grass out the window.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,960
 He's like oh that looks so fresh.

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,480
 If only I didn't have to ride this train.

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,920
 I could just roll around in the grass.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,880
 Well you do because you're our captain or engineer or whatever it is on a train.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,520
 And we're pulling up outside of this middle school.

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,840
 Now I found this story online.

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,720
 We don't have a location of where this middle school actually is.

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,320
 It would be interesting to investigate this phenomenon or not.

41
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,280
 Depends on how terrifying you want your afternoon to be.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,160
 Most people zero right.

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,040
 Most people don't want a terrifying afternoon.

44
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,560
 We do have a year though.

45
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,960
 The year is 2017.

46
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,840
 And there's two eighth grade girls.

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,440
 Now this girl online she goes by the name fabulous caramel 335.

48
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,800
 We're going to call you Rebecca.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
 And if that's your real name is just a guess.

50
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,040
 We have Rebecca and then we have her friend Michelle.

51
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,760
 Both of these girls are in eighth grade.

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,160
 The year is 2017.

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,400
 At this particular middle school the art classes are taught in the basement.

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,480
 And the way that Rebecca laid it out she said it's a very long basement.

55
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,880
 It doesn't though art class doesn't take up the whole basement.

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 Just a portion of it.

57
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,920
 So when you have to go to class she says you descend down the stairs and now you're walking

58
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,560
 underneath the school and she says there are these patches of darkness as you're moving

59
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,280
 towards the art class.

60
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,080
 It doesn't seem like it's the safest.

61
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
 Maybe it is.

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,640
 Definitely seems like it's this extra spooky way.

63
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,440
 Basements are already scary enough.

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,800
 And now the teachers are like and if you really really love art you will go through this journey

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,040
 of darkness to reach us.

66
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,920
 So you have to walk down the stairs.

67
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,520
 You walk down this long basement and you see the art class in the horizon.

68
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,440
 I don't actually know if it's that far.

69
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,400
 It's on the curvature of the earth.

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
 But it's far away.

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,480
 So it's creepy.

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,960
 Everyone knows that it's creepy.

73
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
 Everybody knows that it's creepy.

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,280
 So when Rebecca and Michelle they get there early they're getting to the art class early

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,600
 they're like oh this is extra spooky.

76
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,200
 It's just us two eighth grade girls.

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,120
 And Rebecca goes you know what hey Michelle I got a P and will you here hold my art supplies

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,640
 I'm gonna go P and will you stand outside the bathroom because and Michelle goes because

79
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
 we're in a spooky basement.

80
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,400
 Rebecca says yes because we're in a spooky basement.

81
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,640
 So Rebecca hands Michelle her books and she goes to the bathroom.

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,320
 After a period of time Rebecca's done she flushes the toilet she washes her hands.

83
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,160
 Hopefully she didn't include those details when I'm assuming she's a civilized human.

84
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,280
 And then she walks out of the girls bathroom.

85
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,400
 She's completely alone in the basement.

86
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,360
 And she's immediately met this is what she was trying to avoid.

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,000
 She's now standing alone in this room of intermittent light.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,440
 This basement that's buried underneath the soil all of that life above you.

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,640
 Basements are just intrinsically not a fun place to be.

90
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,600
 And now Rebecca's all alone and she's pissed at Michelle for leaving her hair and she looks

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,760
 and Rebecca sees her books and her art supplies laying on the ground next to the bathroom door.

92
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,720
 And then she sees walking away from the bathroom.

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,840
 It quite a distance at this point.

94
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
 Michelle.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,920
 Michelle is just walking away and she's actually walking past the art room class past that area.

96
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,160
 She's walking to a second set of stairs.

97
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,720
 And Rebecca's like hey Michelle, hey Michelle why did you leave the bathroom?

98
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,800
 And Michelle's just continuing to walk.

99
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 Michelle.

100
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 What's.

101
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
 Michelle.

102
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,000
 She starts to follow her and then starts to pick up the pace and she's now in basically

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,880
 a jog towards Michelle who's making her way up the stairs to leave the basement.

104
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,560
 And she's so mad.

105
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,680
 Michelle left her at the bathroom that Michelle left her supplies there that Michelle's ignoring

106
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
 her.

107
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:40,440
 She's continuing to shout the name Michelle when she feels a hand on her shoulder.

108
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,680
 She spins around and standing there is Michelle.

109
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,000
 Rebecca immediately looks back to the staircase where she saw Michelle walking up.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,720
 There's nobody there.

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,520
 And then she turns back and she's staring at her friend Michelle.

112
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,760
 But that's not the end of the story.

113
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,480
 A doppelganger story as fun as they are, we see a lot of them.

114
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,840
 This story continues.

115
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,200
 Rebecca's looking at Michelle and she's flabbergasted.

116
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
 She's like Michelle what are you doing here?

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,120
 I just saw you walking up the stairs.

118
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,520
 Like how did you get behind me so quickly?

119
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,520
 And Michelle said what no, no I wasn't walking over there.

120
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,240
 I was following you because you were yelling my name that way.

121
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,280
 You were yelling my name the opposite way that I was.

122
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,360
 And I was walking behind you and I saw you.

123
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
 I didn't know what you were doing.

124
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
 You kept saying Michelle, Michelle, Michelle, but you're facing this way.

125
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,000
 I was behind you the whole time.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,720
 And then Rebecca goes, well okay listen I don't know what that was.

127
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
 That's super creepy.

128
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,160
 Let's get out of the basement but I'm also a little pissed at you because I told you

129
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,080
 I was going to the bathroom to hold my art supplies and wait for me.

130
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,640
 I don't know what's going on here.

131
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
 I'm super unsettled.

132
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,720
 Why didn't you wait for me outside of the bathroom?

133
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,440
 And Michelle looks at Rebecca and says that didn't happen either.

134
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:16,680
 I had to go pee and I asked you to stand outside that door.

135
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,200
 It's easy to categorize this as a doppelganger story if it's dropped in the middle of it.

136
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,840
 And we see a lot of doppelganger stories.

137
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,560
 We see a lot of stories where people are seeing doubles and other voices that are perfectly

138
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,320
 imitating other people's voices and stuff like that.

139
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,320
 I've covered that quite a few times on this show.

140
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
 But it's more than that.

141
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,600
 The fact that you have almost this split in the timelines, because basically we're having

142
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,440
 two young women both giving us different versions of events, they're saying that in

143
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,440
 their world they were the one to go to the bathroom, the other girl was supposed to stay

144
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
 outside.

145
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,040
 Like how do you even wrap your head around that one?

146
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,920
 Like that's the added detail that just elevates us to true high strangeness.

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,440
 Rebecca enters the bathroom, Michelle's waiting outside, Michelle's entering the bathroom,

148
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,080
 Rebecca's remaining outside.

149
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,760
 But both of them exited the bathroom and both of them ended up, who ended up in what world

150
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,320
 and who was the Michelle walking away?

151
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,040
 Some people online were saying maybe that was a demon and why that's possible or skin

152
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,960
 walk or some sort of phenomenon.

153
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,080
 I don't think it's that.

154
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
 I think actually the more interesting thing isn't the Michelle that walks away, it's

155
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,520
 the fact that they both entered the bathroom and their realities merged in some way.

156
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,400
 The question for those young girls is which one moved to a different universe?

157
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,760
 Because they both didn't go to the bathroom.

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,520
 We know that for, I'm spending an uncomfortable amount of time talking about eighth grade girls

159
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,040
 going to the bathroom, but they both entered these rooms and when they came out, what

160
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,920
 one of them shifted somewhere else?

161
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,800
 And honestly, if I had to, because we do have the doppelganger of Michelle, I'm almost

162
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,600
 thinking that Michelle shifted into Rebecca's reality.

163
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,840
 But who knows, a terrifying story and again, I love these stories that take place.

164
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,440
 The basement is not a mundane location, it's very spooky, but it's during the day.

165
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
 It's during school.

166
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,760
 You have this event where realities converge and both girls swear, no, you were supposed

167
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,320
 to stay outside and I was going to the bathroom.

168
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,120
 And now one of them is not home.

169
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,160
 In one of these realities, either Michelle or Rebecca has gone missing.

170
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,520
 Young girl goes into the bathroom, never comes out.

171
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,600
 Like how would you ever solve that mystery?

172
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,040
 But it's funny because we do have true life mysteries like that.

173
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,000
 We do have true life mysteries where people enter, there's that one famous one where a

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,240
 guy went into a bar and never came out.

175
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,500
 Never ever came out.

176
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,960
 They think maybe he fell into a construction site next door because apparently it was baby's

177
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,400
 day out and he was walking around giant steel girders.

178
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,120
 I'll put the mystery in the show notes.

179
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
 It's a pretty popular one.

180
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
 That's why I've never covered it.

181
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,360
 But you have that story.

182
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,160
 There is a story I was going to cover about a guy who entered like a US embassy in another

183
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
 country.

184
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,280
 Never came out.

185
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,600
 Now those you could say, well, maybe the guy was in, I'll put that episode in the show

186
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
 notes.

187
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,800
 I didn't do the episode and I'll put that article in the show notes as well.

188
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,880
 You figure maybe there's some sort of international intrigue there and stuff like that.

189
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,180
 But then you have stories like Barbara Bolik, which I did cover.

190
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,500
 So one of my favorite cases where she's literally walking 30 seconds behind another hiker and

191
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,020
 he turns around and she's gone.

192
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
 They've never found her.

193
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,980
 This is not like a missing 411.

194
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,780
 This is a real life police investigation case.

195
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,140
 They've been looking for this woman for years case.

196
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,380
 No blood, no struggle, no sound.

197
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,140
 She vanished.

198
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,280
 So people do just disappear in odd locations.

199
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,680
 Is that what happened?

200
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,440
 Was this just a quirk in the glitch and memories were kind of reset?

201
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,640
 Was it just doppelgangers?

202
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:10,080
 Was it a ghost type of situation that's easily explainable or did someone leave their reality

203
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
 and come here?

204
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,240
 One of those two girls is in our reality now.

205
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,760
 But in their reality, a young girl walked into the bathroom while her friend sat outside

206
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:33,020
 awaiting and waiting and waiting and then finally went in the room and it was empty.

207
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,140
 Truly a mystery, but a mystery for another reality to solve.

208
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,620
 Matt, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

209
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,180
 We are leaving behind this middle school.

210
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:55,160
 We are headed all the way out to Ontario, Canada.

211
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
 And as we're headed out there, I want to do really, really quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

212
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,560
 I actually did this on Monday's episode.

213
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,680
 I had to cut it for time so I want to fit it in now because I really implore you guys

214
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
 to watch this movie.

215
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,280
 It's brilliant and it is right up the Dead Rabbit Radio alley of movies.

216
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,240
 It's called The Northman.

217
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,300
 It's out of theaters right now.

218
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,180
 If you can support it in the theaters, that's fantastic.

219
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,100
 It's kind of like a classic revenge story.

220
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
 This guy's dad is killed.

221
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,780
 It takes place in old Viking times like the 600 AD era.

222
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:34,220
 The story is a little boy witnesses his dad being murdered and the boy then swears revenge

223
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,020
 on the father's killer.

224
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,100
 That's really the plot of the movie and we've seen that plot a hundred times and it's been

225
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,500
 interesting a hundred times, right?

226
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,100
 It's a really interesting plot.

227
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,800
 When I went to go see this movie though, I did not know how it's a fantasy film.

228
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:58,160
 It is 100% a fantasy movie and the pagan gods of old are main characters in the movie.

229
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,360
 It's not like Clash the Titans where Odin's sitting on a cloud and being like, "I must

230
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
 help."

231
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,640
 But the movie makes it very clear very early on.

232
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,520
 It's not like someone goes, "Show me a sign, Odin," and then like a lightning bolt strikes

233
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,140
 something and it could be Odin or not.

234
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,140
 No.

235
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,460
 They're basically praying to gods.

236
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,660
 Things immediately happen in very magical ways.

237
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,660
 It's dope.

238
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,980
 It's very, very good.

239
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,860
 It's a beautiful looking film.

240
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,580
 It's very brutal.

241
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:32,340
 It's completely unforgiving for that time error how brutal people were towards each other.

242
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:38,100
 So it's a great revenge thriller and a completely supernatural movie at the same time.

243
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,180
 There's stuff that starts to happen in the movie where you go, "Did he have the time

244
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,560
 to do that?"

245
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,600
 Or was that an ancient pagan demon who tied a woman up with another man's human intestines?

246
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
 I don't know.

247
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,520
 Maybe he had the time to do that?

248
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,840
 It's really good.

249
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
 It's dope.

250
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,640
 And as the movie progresses, it just gets more and more fantastical.

251
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,440
 So the ending is so mythological.

252
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,580
 Like the way the story culminates to me was so mythological and so symbolic that as I

253
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:17,340
 was watching it in the theater, I thought, "If I had to visually show you how the world

254
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,380
 ends, it would be this scene."

255
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:28,660
 Like it's just shot in such a way that you're like, "This is a story of the last two nations,

256
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:35,240
 the last two people on earth fighting over the ruins of a nuclear wasteland."

257
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,000
 That's what that last scene felt like.

258
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,280
 It was so powerful.

259
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
 So check it out.

260
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,720
 Dead Rabbit Radio highly recommends you watch The Northman.

261
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
 It's a great movie.

262
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,120
 If you can see it in theater and if you can support this type of cinema, all the better.

263
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
 All the better.

264
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
 I'm a fan of...

265
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,640
 I'm going to go see Doctor Strange this week.

266
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,740
 I'm a fan of Marvel movies and comic book movies, but we also need to support non-comic

267
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
 book movies.

268
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,860
 Otherwise, we're just going to get Jonah Hex and R.I.P.D. until our eyes fall out and nobody

269
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
 wants that.

270
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,500
 Matt, go ahead and land this car.

271
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,740
 He's wearing his R.I.P.D. shirt.

272
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,180
 He's like, "Oh, I'm a huge Ryan Reynolds fan.

273
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,980
 Oh, I love that movie.

274
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,100
 Sorry, I'm insulting all of your favorite passions, Matt."

275
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,780
 Go ahead and land this car.

276
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,940
 He's like, "Who the hell is R.I.P.D.?

277
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,300
 No one remembers that movie."

278
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,000
 Go ahead and land this Carvener Cotter here in this sunny field.

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,280
 The year is 2021 and we're in Ontario, Canada.

280
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,120
 It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon.

281
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
 I found this story online.

282
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,640
 It was posted by someone going by the name of Kitten.

283
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,640
 We're going to go ahead and call you Ashley.

284
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,200
 Is your real name?

285
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
 Just a guess?

286
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
 It's not even a guess.

287
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
 I'm just coming up with a name then.

288
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,960
 I'll remember, which I never do.

289
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,400
 There's always link pauses I have to edit out as I was like, "Was her name Rebecca or

290
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
 Rachel?"

291
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,780
 So, Ashley is house hunting with her boyfriend.

292
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,780
 It's pretty serious.

293
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,260
 I don't think I can move in with a girlfriend.

294
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,780
 I don't think I can move in with anybody, honestly.

295
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,100
 But she's house hunting with her boyfriend and they were looking, been looking through

296
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,340
 the listings and all that stuff and they see a photo of this beautiful home.

297
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:16,060
 It's this town home, three bedrooms, three baths, three big living spaces and they're

298
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,700
 like, "This looks great."

299
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,540
 And shockingly, it's in our price range.

300
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,100
 Let's go check it out.

301
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,520
 So as Ashley and her boyfriend are driving up to the house, they see it and it's just

302
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,120
 as beautiful as the photo showed.

303
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,760
 But they start to notice something.

304
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,040
 There's no one else there to view the home.

305
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,240
 And Ashley says to you, "We've been house hunting for a while and normally there is

306
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,040
 a line of people out the door waiting to get a viewing of this house."

307
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,600
 She goes, "It's Sunday, so maybe there'd be less people but for nobody to be viewing

308
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 the house?"

309
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,540
 But she doesn't really think anything of it.

310
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,540
 Nothing's really clicking with her just yet.

311
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,340
 So Ashley and her boyfriend, they walk into the house, the realtor's there greeting this

312
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,580
 person, "Hey, what's up?"

313
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,340
 And immediately Ashley's like, "Okay, now I see why this house is not selling up because

314
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:13,300
 the realtor's like a big ugly slaw, but you're like, "Burp, eating all these donuts, three

315
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,260
 donuts to view the house.

316
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,980
 That's the charge from the house troll."

317
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,900
 No, that's not why.

318
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
 The house was a dump.

319
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,440
 Right, it looked great.

320
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,960
 The photo of the house looked great.

321
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,200
 It was very spacious, but it was spacious garbage, right?

322
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:35,120
 She said that the carpet was like sunken the floor, the walls were yellowed and sticky.

323
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,560
 She said the cabinets were barely operational.

324
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,840
 Just like everything that could go wrong with the house was wrong with this house.

325
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,880
 But they continue to look around because you're like, "Maybe we could do a fixer up or maybe

326
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,720
 things aren't that bad."

327
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,860
 They go upstairs and the upstairs is just as bad as the bottom.

328
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,380
 I don't know why they thought, "Well, maybe whoever was here really did good upkeep on

329
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,380
 the upstairs."

330
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,140
 The house is just battered, right?

331
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,940
 It was just a very lived in house plus more.

332
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,300
 It was just gross.

333
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:11,260
 But as you're looking around the house, Ashley starts to get a sensation of dread.

334
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,100
 And she's thinking as this is going on, again she's rationalizing this, when they pulled

335
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,520
 up the house and no one wanted to view the house, she thought, "Well, maybe it's a Sunday,

336
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,120
 people are doing other stuff."

337
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,320
 Then she's walking around the house and she's starting to feel this sense of dread and she

338
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,160
 goes, "Uh, it could be the ever looming presence of the death that probably lingers in this

339
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,480
 house or it could be..."

340
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,720
 I'm looking at all the repairs that would have to be made.

341
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,960
 This house is totally perfect for our price range, but we'd have to spend tens of thousands

342
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,820
 of dollars to just make it livable.

343
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,500
 She's talking to her boyfriend and she goes, "You know what, let's go back to the car,

344
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,900
 let's talk about it, let's talk this over, see what we want to go."

345
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,340
 And the realtor's probably like, "It takes two donuts to leave the house!"

346
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,420
 They cook two donuts and they feed the house troll and then they leave and they're sitting

347
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,620
 in the car and they start talking about the house.

348
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,400
 And really the house is right there like, "Oh, that was really disgusting, but it's such

349
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,200
 a good price and it's such a big home."

350
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,440
 They're talking about it, they're weighing the pros and the cons and as Ashley's having

351
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,360
 this conversation with her boyfriend, she starts to feel depressed.

352
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,840
 But it's not just depressed, it's depression.

353
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,360
 There's a huge difference between the two.

354
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:39,780
 When she's beginning to feel wave after wave of this deep, heavy depression just splash

355
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,860
 over her soul.

356
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,720
 It's overwhelming.

357
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:53,300
 She gets this sensation of loss, of intense loss.

358
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,060
 She said, she goes, "I've never lost a child in my life, but as I'm sitting in the car

359
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,280
 outside of this house, that's what this felt like."

360
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,720
 She goes, "I can't even describe it in any other way."

361
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,200
 She goes, "I'm sitting there and I felt a loss that I could never comprehend.

362
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,200
 But if I had to describe it in some way, this must be what it's like for a parent to lose

363
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,320
 a child."

364
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:30,780
 And she goes on to say it was odd because she felt physical sensations of this depression.

365
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,660
 And this was why she was connecting it to more than, "Oh no, this horrible thing happened

366
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,660
 to me."

367
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,660
 Type of depression.

368
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,980
 She goes, "I felt physically numb.

369
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,220
 My body stopped working.

370
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,820
 My hearing got muffled.

371
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,620
 My head has this buzz to it."

372
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,640
 She just feels empty.

373
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,080
 And she describes herself, "Normally, I'm a very happy person."

374
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,960
 And that's what made this whole process, this whole sensation even more bizarre because

375
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,600
 not only am I feeling the deepest loss any human could ever feel.

376
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,120
 That's what I can feel in my soul.

377
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,000
 But my mind is happy.

378
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:27,100
 I'm actually still in the normal mental mind space of being the happy, joyous Ashley.

379
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,100
 But my soul is empty.

380
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,740
 My body is broken.

381
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:38,620
 My heart is gone.

382
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,100
 As her boyfriend's, boyfriend's still talking about the frozen cons of the house.

383
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,640
 Ashley turns to him and says, "I'm sorry, but I feel like crying."

384
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,660
 And begins to sob.

385
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,280
 And as she's breaking into tears and she's sitting in his car and she's just crying,

386
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,880
 she's looking at her boyfriend.

387
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,720
 Her boyfriend's looking at her and says, "I feel it too."

388
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,080
 Recently he had lost the relative.

389
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,820
 I think it was his grandfather.

390
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,840
 And he knew loss.

391
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
 Right?

392
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
 Everyone knows loss.

393
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,680
 I'm sure Ashley's lost people in her life.

394
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,420
 But he said that as he's sitting in the car, and she goes, "My boyfriend never cried."

395
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,980
 He is someone who always kept his emotions in check.

396
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,460
 But as he's sitting there next to me in the car, he goes, "It feels the closest I can

397
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,500
 compare this to him when my grandpa died recently.

398
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,980
 Like I feel like I lost someone, like just now.

399
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,140
 I feel like a deep soulful bond has been separated.

400
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,740
 I feel what you're feeling.

401
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,280
 I feel like we lost somebody."

402
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,120
 Let's go get something to eat.

403
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,920
 He goes, "Let's go get a snack.

404
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,120
 Let's go clear our heads."

405
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,160
 They're still actually thinking about buying the house at this point.

406
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,680
 They're still gotta work it out.

407
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
 It is a really good price point.

408
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,640
 It might be haunted by the ghost of sadness, but you know, good schools in the neighborhood.

409
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,680
 So they drive to the supermarket and they buy a snack.

410
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,980
 And she says, "As we're driving away from the house, I'm still sobbing.

411
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,580
 And when we go to the store to buy a snack, I'm not necessarily still deeply heaving."

412
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,580
 That type of thing.

413
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,620
 But she goes, "I'm walking through the store and I felt the physical sensation of losing

414
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,620
 a child.

415
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,460
 I felt, my whole body felt numb."

416
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,540
 She goes, "This 100% must be what parents are going through when they lose a child.

417
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,100
 My body's numb.

418
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,760
 My brain is fuzzy.

419
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,800
 I can't even really hear anything.

420
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:46,040
 I'm just going through the motions."

421
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
 They leave the store.

422
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,040
 At this point, they have decided not to buy the house.

423
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,920
 At this point, they've said, "There's probably someone going on here."

424
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,520
 And they're driving away from the area.

425
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,600
 And she says, "As we're now, we got our snacks.

426
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,240
 We're eating our snacks as we're driving away."

427
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,380
 The feelings start to dissipate, but only slightly.

428
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,780
 It's not like every mile they put between them and the house, they start to feel better.

429
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,580
 It took a full day.

430
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,260
 Ashley said it wasn't until she woke up the next morning did they feel like they were

431
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,360
 back to normal.

432
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,460
 She ends her post by saying, "I don't know what was going on or what went on in the house,

433
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:31,060
 but I think it's safe to say that whatever it was, it did not want us to be there."

434
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,780
 And you're talking about haunted houses.

435
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,120
 You gotta think of a haunted house as basically a Venus fly trap.

436
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,400
 It can't move to catch its prey.

437
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,640
 It's actually going to want you in.

438
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,440
 It's going to feed off your energies, right?

439
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,520
 If it's a malicious entity, it wants you to come in.

440
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,200
 It's going to make sure that certain things fall into place to get the right family into

441
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,800
 that house.

442
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,840
 Can't go to its prey, so the prey has to come to it.

443
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,100
 I don't think it was sending out a message that I didn't want anyone there.

444
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,740
 I think that this house probably was infused with some really dark psychic energy.

445
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,300
 And it was almost like trying to contain this storm in a box.

446
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,180
 I'm saying that the house is putting off these shockwaves that everyone who visited it, no

447
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,260
 one stayed.

448
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,580
 And I'm wondering if it was sending off such powerful shockwaves.

449
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,500
 Remember, there weren't even people there to visit the house.

450
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,800
 I'm wondering if it sent off such powerful shockwaves that other people who are even

451
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,200
 just viewing the photo online of the house listings looked at it and went, "Ugh."

452
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 I don't want to.

453
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,760
 The house is not for me.

454
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,000
 But honey, look at the price point.

455
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Nah, I'm good.

456
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,960
 They could have put their finger on it, but just by viewing the photo, the shockwaves could

457
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,480
 have been that powerful from whatever this house was emanating.

458
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,040
 Because these people visited the house, they walked around, they were probably there for

459
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
 about an hour.

460
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,740
 It took 24 hours for them to return to normal.

461
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,660
 So whatever this house was giving out was so powerful that it could affect you when

462
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,140
 you weren't even in the area, that's what I'm saying.

463
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,700
 Just by looking at a photograph of it could give you the heebie-jeebies.

464
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,740
 But these stories would end in one of two ways, right?

465
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,340
 The house never gets sold.

466
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,900
 It just sits there, starts to fall apart, becomes a nuisance.

467
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,860
 The fire department uses it as a burn house.

468
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,340
 Eventually, it's reduced to rubble.

469
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,760
 It'd be a legend in the neighborhood.

470
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
 Don't go there, that's the house.

471
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,240
 That gives you crippling depression.

472
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,840
 That's one way for the story to end.

473
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,200
 The other way is that there are people who just aren't sensitive to these type of things,

474
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,520
 that you can take them to a location that's infused with positive energy or negative energy.

475
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,280
 And they'll just walk right through it.

476
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,800
 They can't pick up on it at all.

477
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,680
 And if they do, they just immediately brush it off as, "Ah, you know, faulty wiring.

478
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
 Ah, carbon monoxide."

479
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,900
 I mean, those are important things to be aware of, but, you know, come up with legit answers

480
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,980
 and somebody who comes in and they see this house is probably going for even less than

481
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,340
 it was in 2021.

482
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,340
 It's a steal.

483
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,780
 It's such a great deal.

484
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,420
 This young couple's not picking up on any of these cues.

485
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,420
 They're moving through the house and they're like, "Oh, we gotta do all these repairs,

486
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
 but the price is so good.

487
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,340
 The price is so good actually that even with all the repairs, we're still getting a huge

488
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,900
 bargain."

489
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,560
 And they're talking about this house and all the stuff they're gonna do for it.

490
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,760
 The realtors sobbing in the corner.

491
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,480
 They've been dealing with this house for so long.

492
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,400
 They've been racked with this emotional energy, but they have a job to do.

493
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,260
 And they see this young couple come in and they're so enthusiastic.

494
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,160
 And the realtors thinking, "Well, just wait till you get upstairs, because that must be

495
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,800
 when the depression really is gonna hit you."

496
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,120
 And the couple goes upstairs and they're looking around.

497
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
 They're like, "Look at this view.

498
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
 This is great.

499
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
 And this is where we'll put the baby's room."

500
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,920
 The realtors are like, "Oh, no.

501
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
 They're gonna have a baby too.

502
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,020
 Oh, this sounds like a nightmare.

503
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,420
 But I gotta sell this house.

504
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,980
 It's been sitting here all this time and this is my job."

505
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:59,900
 And this young couple who don't pick up on any of the psychic cues, sign the dotted line.

506
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,900
 They're gonna buy it.

507
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,020
 The house has finally been sold.

508
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:09,060
 And part of the realtor wants to say, "Hey, listen guys, I know that this seems like your

509
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,980
 dream house, but it's been on the market for a long time because of a reason."

510
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:20,080
 But as that contract is getting signed, the realtor realizes once this house is sold,

511
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,360
 I'm free of it.

512
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,560
 It sucks that I'm offloading it on them, but if I don't sell it to them, then I have to

513
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,040
 keep coming here to try to get someone to buy it.

514
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:37,840
 So she watches that signature get put on the line and keeps her mouth shut.

515
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,460
 And later that night when the realtor goes home to her own family, they're all sitting

516
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:50,340
 around their dinner table and the family knows mom's a little more quiet than usual.

517
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,140
 And her husband says, "How was work today, honey?

518
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,860
 How did it go?"

519
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:03,020
 And the mom just sits there and kind of plays with her food with her fork and says, "I sold

520
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,120
 the house today."

521
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,040
 Dinner table falls silent.

522
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,760
 Everyone in that family knows exactly what house she's talking about.

523
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,640
 And everyone in that family knows that while that means that mom will now no longer have

524
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,640
 to go to this house, that something worse has happened.

525
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,100
 While their mom would have to visit it on occasion, now a family would be living in

526
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,180
 that house.

527
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:45,700
 A family that had no idea they just purchased a Venus flytrap.
