1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
 A criminal plot torn from the pages of a comic book goes predictably wrong.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then centuries of mayhem torment the country of England today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
 I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
 I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,640
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,040
 I had a pretty good weekend.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,440
 I don't remember most of it.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,280
 I mean, doing after Thanksgiving stuff.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
 Bought some movies.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,880
 Bought some Black Friday movies.

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
 You know, it's funny.

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,280
 So over the weekend, one of the big things for the podcast is we break the podcast up,

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
 we put it on YouTube.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
 We have now reached over 1000 subscribers on YouTube.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,280
 So to be monetized on YouTube, to be able to put ads on YouTube to make some money,

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,280
 you have to have 1000 subscribers in 4000 watched hours.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,840
 We hit the 4000 watched hours a while ago.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,920
 We were waiting to get those 1000 subscribers.

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,600
 And once you hit 1000 subscribers, YouTube really starts promoting your channel more

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,760
 because they see that you're taking it seriously and people are responding to it and so on

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
 and so forth.

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,960
 The podcast, the growth is slower, but people who listen to the podcast, they listen to

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,960
 the whole thing, like from start to finish.

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,560
 With YouTube, I have a lot of viewers who just watch a couple of minutes and then go

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
 to the next thing.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,680
 So it's the show is still, I produce the show to be listened as a podcast and then cut

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,280
 it up and put it on YouTube because the podcast audience just seems to dig it more.

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,960
 One thing I've noticed, and this is funny because when I first started doing the podcast,

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,160
 when I first started putting it on YouTube, people were like, "What is this?

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,720
 What is this nonsense?"

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,840
 And the podcast listeners gone on board real quick.

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,520
 They're like, "Oh, we get what's going on here.

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,240
 It's this guy, he's doing this daily show, it's weird news."

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,440
 Not the most well researched or well pronounced stuff, but the enthusiasm more than makes

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
 up for it.

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,080
 But so when we first came out with the YouTube channel, there's a bit of growing pains there.

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,840
 People were like, "Yo, what's going on here?

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
 This is nonsense.

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
 What are you talking about?"

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,400
 And over time, those people were like, "Oh, okay, now I get it."

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,720
 Well now that we've hit a thousand subscribers and YouTube's promoting the show more, the

44
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,440
 past couple days, the comments have been like, "Yo, what's going on?

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,640
 You're leaving out all these facts.

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,880
 I'm glad whoever's commenting is apparently from Brooklyn."

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,960
 But they're like, "Yo, what's going on?

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
 You left out all this stuff.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
 You're an idiot."

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,880
 And I'm thinking, "Yeah, yeah, that's kind of the point."

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,680
 The point isn't to be stupid, but the point is, "Hey man, we're a daily show.

52
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,080
 We gotta put stuff out every day.

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,440
 I can't do a full breakdown on Nikolai Tesla or even pronounce his name right every single

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
 day.

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,200
 That's just not what I'm possibly..."

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,400
 And I can just imagine what these guys are gonna do when they get to the Hero Dotus episode,

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,320
 which a lot of people were like, "That's not how you pronounce his name."

58
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,600
 Hero Dotus, his name is Herodotus.

59
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,360
 But to the new fans, welcome.

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,320
 If you are, happen to be from Brooklyn and you're like, "Yo, what's up?

61
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
 The show sucks.

62
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,200
 This wasn't aimed at just at you."

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,920
 Because I want people to listen to the show and come on board.

64
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,720
 And people give me negative feedback, "Hey, that's okay too."

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,080
 But that's kind of the...

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,200
 I don't want to say gimmick, but that's kind of the vibe of the show.

67
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,600
 I get out the information that I can in a day.

68
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,880
 And we move on to the next topic.

69
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,560
 So if you're listening to the show for the first time, I hope you enjoy it.

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,920
 If you've been listening to the show for a while, you're like...

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,480
 You're just kind of shaking your head and you're like, "Yeah, it takes a while to get

72
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,680
 used to this dude."

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,160
 But it has its own charm.

74
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,680
 And we are doing some episode on an upcoming Greek philosopher.

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,840
 And if you didn't like Herodotus, you might want to skip that one.

76
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,520
 The following story contains information about an ongoing criminal case.

77
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,800
 All suspects are innocent until proven guilty.

78
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,320
 This is just my opinion based on news articles.

79
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,160
 I am not alleging that the following person, suspect, or individuals may actually be guilty

80
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,760
 of this crime.

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,280
 This is just an comedy podcast where I'm talking about someone currently facing criminal charges.

82
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,560
 I have no proof one way or the other that this person is innocent or guilty.

83
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,520
 Again, all suspects in you, all suspects in the United States are innocent until proven

84
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
 guilty.

85
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
 Enjoy.

86
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,080
 Okay, let's go ahead and get started with our first story here.

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,600
 Now, this first story is something that I read in the news probably about a month or two ago.

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,840
 And I was like, "Oh, I gotta cover this."

89
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,040
 Because it's so ridiculous and then I completely forgot about it because the amount of ridiculous

90
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,720
 stuff that I deal with, things kind of fall to the wayside.

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,600
 But over the weekend when I was prepping all my episodes for the week, I said, "Oh, I

92
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,040
 need to find that story again."

93
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,440
 Because I had thought about it here and there.

94
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,440
 So this is the story.

95
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,680
 So speaking of mispronouncing people's names, I have no idea how to say this dude's name.

96
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,720
 It's, well, it looks like it's Asciiir.

97
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,080
 So I mean, Asciiir, and he deserves to be called Asciiir if that's not his real name.

98
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
 His name's Asciiir Ulfer.

99
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,480
 This guy's from Apopka, Florida.

100
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,840
 So this is the story of Asciiir.

101
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,360
 Now Asciiir was a guy, he's 26 years old.

102
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,120
 He was roommates with this girl named Christina Scar, which is a pretty dope name.

103
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 It's much better than Asciiir.

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,120
 So anyways, Asciiir and Christina were roommates and he was really starting to fall in love

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
 with her.

106
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,240
 This happened earlier this year.

107
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,280
 So he was starting to fall in love with her and Christina's, you know, kind of, "Oh,

108
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
 you know, he's a good roommate.

109
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
 He's a nice guy.

110
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,720
 But no, there's nothing between us.

111
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
 There's nothing there."

112
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,200
 She actually was dating somebody else and he couldn't get over her.

113
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,560
 And she actually overheard him telling friends that, "Oh yeah, you know, we're dating and

114
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,760
 then she would have to correct him."

115
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,800
 And being like, "No, you know, he's a nice guy, but we're not dating.

116
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 We're just friends."

117
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,120
 And, you know, Asciiir's like in the shadows, "Ugh, someday I'll have you, Christina."

118
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,840
 Well, a lot of the information, a lot of the personal details between the two, other than

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,280
 him standing in the shadows shaking his fist, a lot of the personal details between the

120
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,000
 two I don't have a lot of access to him.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,440
 But for whatever reason, he moved out.

122
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,040
 Now I can assume what the reason is, is because he was a total weirdo who was telling everyone

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,840
 he was dating his roommate and he was getting creepy.

124
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,280
 I don't think he moved out because he found a better deal across town.

125
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,280
 I would assume that it's just because he's a creepy guy.

126
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,640
 However, I have no proof of that.

127
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,400
 It's just general world knowledge and existing on the planet for 42 years.

128
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,480
 That's my opinion.

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
 That's the reason he moved out.

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,800
 And the reason why I think that is because what follows.

131
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:29,280
 So he hatches a plan that really is something that you would see in a cartoon or a comic

132
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
 book.

133
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,440
 This is his, this is what his plan is going to be.

134
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,320
 He's going to wh- I'm laughing because I know what's coming.

135
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,360
 And it's also tragic, but the details are funny.

136
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,400
 So Asciiir, his goal, he goes, "Okay, I have a master plan.

137
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,240
 I'm going to wait till she's alone.

138
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
 And I'm going to wear a disguise.

139
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,760
 I'm going to wear all black with a hoodie on.

140
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,280
 And I'm going to break into her house.

141
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,480
 And I'm going to attack her and tie her up and like, "Ruff her up, right?

142
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,560
 Give her the good ol' one, too."

143
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,520
 Probably he imagined it in his head that he comes out of the darkness and he commands

144
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,440
 her to, you know, like, get down.

145
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,960
 She does because she's just in total fear of him and that the power would get him off

146
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
 as well.

147
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,800
 And then once he had her restrained, he was going to then leave the house and then come

148
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,520
 back as Asciiir, no costume, and go, "Oh my God, Christina, you're tied up.

149
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
 What's going on?

150
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
 Help me, Asciiir.

151
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
 Help me."

152
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
 Like olive oil.

153
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,800
 And then he was going to untie her.

154
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,920
 And then she was going to fall in love with her hero who saved the day, leave her boyfriend,

155
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
 be with Asciiir.

156
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,520
 So that was his plan.

157
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,120
 Now there's a couple problems with that plan.

158
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,800
 The biggest one being that if your plan goes 100%, if your plan has no problems with it

159
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,040
 whatsoever, and it actually works, which it wouldn't, but let's say that it goes off without

160
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,160
 a hitch and you run and you save her and she doesn't realize that an Asciiir-sized human

161
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,600
 was just holding her down five minutes ago and smelt like Asciiir and grunted like Asciiir

162
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:03,480
 and had all the mannerisms that an Asciiir had, but in a ski mask.

163
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,540
 Assuming she's a total idiot and she doesn't pick up on any of that.

164
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,400
 And then an Asciiir-shaped person who is actually Asciiir runs into the room and goes, "Well,

165
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,440
 I just passed a guy shaped exactly like me on the way out.

166
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
 What happened?"

167
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,840
 And she falls in love with him.

168
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,760
 He's going, that's a supervillain's plan.

169
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,520
 I've never read a comic book or a cartoon or a movie where the good guy comes up with

170
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
 that plan.

171
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,800
 Superman's not like, you know, the way that we can defeat Lex Luthor is, I'm going to

172
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,080
 break into Wonder Woman's house.

173
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,920
 Like, that's never, that's not a good guy's plan.

174
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,480
 But even if it went off without a hitch, he's going to spend the rest of his life knowing

175
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,920
 that he committed this horrible crime and put his loved one into a state of fear and it

176
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,600
 worked, but he'll have to live with that guilt.

177
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
 I just thought of this.

178
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,520
 What is he going to resolve every fight like that in the future?

179
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,200
 Well, she's like, you need to stay home with the kid.

180
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,240
 And he's like, but I have a video game tournament tonight.

181
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,640
 She's like, no, you need to stay home.

182
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,560
 And he like looks to the closet where he keeps the scheme asking and he like breaks in.

183
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,080
 He's like, let him go to the video game tournament and then Asciiir runs in.

184
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
 What did he say?

185
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,840
 So, I mean, like, it just, it doesn't work on its head.

186
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,160
 It just doesn't work.

187
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
 It's a stupid plan.

188
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,880
 So of course it doesn't work in real life.

189
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,720
 So he breaks into the house because he wasn't living there anymore.

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,560
 And from the beginning of the plan, it just goes sideways.

191
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,640
 He breaks into the house and he's like, okay, step one, I'm going to jump out and I'm going

192
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
 to grab Christina.

193
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,800
 And then he realizes that he got there like 10 hours too early.

194
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,500
 So he hides in her closet.

195
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,440
 She comes home with her boyfriend.

196
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,800
 They fall asleep and he's just a big old creep dude in the closet.

197
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
 Just stand in there.

198
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,900
 Now he got there way too early for the plan to work.

199
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,200
 So he's just stuck in the closet all night long.

200
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,280
 At a certain point, he ends up leaving the closet in the middle of the night and going,

201
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,080
 like walking around the house a bit, getting some water.

202
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,320
 I can imagine him like watching television.

203
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,040
 But anyways, then he goes back in the closet.

204
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,400
 So in the morning, the boyfriend leaves and now Christina Scar is home alone and Asciiir

205
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,000
 jumps out of the closet wearing all black, black ski mask, attacks her from behind.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,840
 And the second part of his plan goes wrong because she fights back like a monster.

207
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,460
 Like he thought he was going to simply overpower her and she was just fighting back too hard

208
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,300
 to the point so he had to start beating her up, which wasn't part of the plan.

209
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,420
 So he's like, really, now they're basically boxing in this bedroom.

210
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,140
 So it was eventually though overpower her because he's a bigger guy.

211
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,420
 But again, that wasn't part of the plan.

212
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:39,660
 I think he just thought that she would acquiesce to his powerful figure and his raw masculine

213
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
 energy.

214
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,280
 Like saying, OK, now I'm going to duct tape your head and duct tape, this little criminal

215
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,760
 tip doesn't stick super well to hair.

216
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,560
 Duct tape doesn't stick super well.

217
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,440
 Like you can sweat through it.

218
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,680
 It's not the best implement for kidnapping people, but you see it in movies so people

219
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
 think it actually works.

220
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,040
 So he starts duct taping her head because you just can't put it over someone's mouth.

221
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
 They'll just bite through it.

222
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
 So you have to like wrap it around their head a couple of times.

223
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,960
 And as he's wrapping it, sticking to the hair, he begins cutting her hair so it doesn't stick

224
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
 as much.

225
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,160
 I mean, he should have just abandoned the plan at that point.

226
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,580
 He's duct taping her more and more.

227
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,580
 She's still resisting it.

228
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,020
 So now, so now he throws her onto the bed.

229
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,980
 He chokes her until she passes out.

230
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,100
 She comes to.

231
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,620
 He chokes her until she passes out again.

232
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:27,380
 Now the problem is, other than this idiot choking out this woman is, and I'll also say

233
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,300
 this, when I talk about serial killers, he attacked her from behind.

234
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,740
 And again, this I'll go on and on how what coward killers are.

235
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,700
 This guy has to attack this woman from behind and then just beat her up.

236
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,400
 But anyway, he didn't just hop out of the closet and say, let's go.

237
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,600
 Like it had to be the surprise attack, even though she was much smaller than him.

238
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,320
 He duct tapes her, chokes her, leaves, and now it's time to do his next part of the plan

239
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,040
 where he's going to take off his costume, take off his disguise.

240
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,920
 I imagine he had a big old timey fake mustache as well.

241
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,440
 And to run back into the house and be like, Christina, Christina, I'm here to save you.

242
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
 Conveniently.

243
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,560
 I'm the only, I just happen to walk into your house that I don't live in anymore.

244
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,240
 He walks back into the house.

245
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
 She's dead.

246
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,460
 He basically pretty much restricted her airways with the duct tape so she couldn't breathe

247
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:16,060
 enough and then being choked out twice was enough that she couldn't regain the oxygen

248
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,260
 that she was losing.

249
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
 So she died.

250
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,340
 Now he's stuck with the body of this woman that he reportedly loved.

251
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,580
 His fingerprints are everywhere.

252
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,500
 He's in this house with his dead body and he's like, oh man.

253
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,980
 This plan is not working out the way that I thought it was going to.

254
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
 Aha.

255
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,180
 I got it.

256
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:41,000
 He can cocks a plan on the spot that a woman broke into the house, killed Christina and

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 fought him.

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 They, they boxed.

259
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,120
 He, but he did like a flying jump kick and knocked her through the mirror.

260
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,000
 Not like through the mirror, like in a magical portal, but like crack the mirror.

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,600
 But he's like, okay, so this is my plan.

262
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,880
 A woman broke into the house and killed her and I walked in on the murder and the woman

263
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,800
 wearing all black, we got enough tussle and she ran out and he goes, well, there's only

264
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,860
 one way I can really sell that story.

265
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,980
 He then pulls a gun out, shoots himself in the foot.

266
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
 No joke.

267
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,480
 Literally shoots himself in the foot.

268
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,380
 Uh, my foot, my foot calls the cops and says, oh my God, I'm at Christina's house.

269
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
 She's dead.

270
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,380
 She's dead.

271
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,940
 And this woman who I can barely identify shot me in the foot.

272
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,860
 Cop show up, take him to hospital, start investigating and they're looking around and they're like,

273
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,020
 it doesn't look like this house was like broken into.

274
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,340
 I guess there was a burglar bar on the back door.

275
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,800
 I think Askear probably had a key to get in, but they're like, it doesn't look like anyone

276
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
 broke in.

277
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
 We have this body of this woman.

278
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,080
 We have this guy with a shot foot.

279
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,760
 You know, let's start working on this.

280
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,400
 And the way that Naskier pretty much got away with it, the way that he got, I'm sure he was

281
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,440
 on the police radar, but the way that Askear ended up getting arrested was apparently he

282
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,040
 was talking to his lawyer on the phone and his sister overheard it, which is interesting.

283
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,340
 The sister overheard her brother talking on the phone about the details of the murder.

284
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,420
 The sister went to the father and the father's like, listen, I love my son, but if he did

285
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,700
 this, he did this, we have to do something about it.

286
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,340
 Sister and the father go to the police and the police arrest Askear.

287
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,700
 Now his defense, and this is going to be interesting, his defense is that testimony was attorney

288
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,220
 client privilege.

289
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,860
 That testimony should be inadmissible because he was talking to his lawyer.

290
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,780
 The fact that somebody else overheard it is irrelevant.

291
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,260
 It was a conversation that was a privileged conversation.

292
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,260
 So we'll see where that goes.

293
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,040
 This just happened in April.

294
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,360
 So they'll be carrying on these motions for a while and things like that.

295
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,920
 But we'll see where it goes legally.

296
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,720
 But just from like a logical standpoint, this guy's an idiot.

297
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,840
 Like even if his plan had worked, he was a villain.

298
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
 It never works.

299
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,120
 Even in television shows where these plans are set up, they always fail.

300
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,200
 I've never seen this plot work.

301
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:55,060
 What made this 26 year old guy think that this scare tactic was going to lead to a lifetime

302
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
 of love?

303
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,900
 Maybe he just wanted to have a one night stand with her?

304
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
 Who knows?

305
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,620
 Wait a second, you know what I just realized?

306
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,540
 Okay, so his motive for the crime was a cliche and so was the way he got caught.

307
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,940
 How many times in sitcoms do you see like two people having a conversation in one room

308
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,140
 and then, you know, Michelle Tanner walks by and over here's a conversation and then

309
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,000
 looks at the camera and goes dun, dun, dun, and then the commercial break.

310
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,640
 He got caught in the most sitcom kind of way.

311
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:31,440
 Maybe he is the event horizon for how ridiculously pop culture society has become.

312
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,360
 All of our crimes from now are going to be based on cliches and stories and they will

313
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,600
 also get caught by equally ridiculous cliches.

314
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,040
 That is the future of law enforcement in the world.

315
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,640
 Okay, so we're going to go ahead and move on to our next story.

316
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,100
 It's also a bit criminal, a little bit crimey.

317
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,980
 I thought it was another interesting one.

318
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,140
 This one actually, we're going to look at a couple different events that happen in the

319
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,980
 country of Jolly Old England.

320
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,700
 We got the Carpentercopter back from Iran.

321
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,620
 I actually was able to track down the type of helicopter it was.

322
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
 I don't have it in front of me now, but it's a helicopter.

323
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,300
 No joke, it's a helicopter.

324
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,300
 It has wings and the wings like rotate.

325
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,340
 Only the Carpentercopter could be that dope.

326
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,500
 Only the Carpentercopter is a helicopter with wings.

327
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,080
 I think they're decommissioned, so we got it on sale.

328
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
 That's why we're having it.

329
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,040
 So the Carpentercopter is all tricked out.

330
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
 We're going to hop in it.

331
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,600
 We're like saying goodbye to Asker.

332
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,120
 So we're going to hop in the Carpentercopter.

333
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,200
 I'm taking it over to Jolly Old England.

334
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,320
 Now, luckily we're in Florida because we're actually going to have to fly through the

335
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 Bermuda Triangle.

336
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,360
 Oh no, the instruments are going off.

337
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,560
 Because we have to go back in time too.

338
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,640
 A couple times actually, but we're not going to double back to Bermuda Triangle each time.

339
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,880
 We go through a time warp in the Bermuda Triangle and to save on fuel it actually teleports

340
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
 us to England.

341
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
 Why not?

342
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,740
 So anyways, now we're in England in the years 1938.

343
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,340
 And we are in the town of Halifax, or city, one of the two, we're in the, we'll say city,

344
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,460
 city of Halifax in England.

345
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:02,980
 For one week, the city was on the edge of terror, or grip of terror, whatever the phrase is.

346
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,580
 They're in something of terror.

347
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:10,460
 There was a man known as the Halifax Slasher.

348
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
 Interesting story.

349
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,820
 He didn't start off slashing people.

350
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:20,120
 So anyways, on one day, two women run to the police and say, "Oh my god, oh my god.

351
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:27,480
 I was just attacked by a man with a mallet and bright buckles on his shoes."

352
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,800
 So after ruling out all leprechauns in the area, the police are like, "We're baffled.

353
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,360
 We don't know who this guy with this mallet is."

354
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,440
 The next time the bright buckled man used a knife or a razor blade, so they're like,

355
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,860
 "Oh, okay, now we'll call him the Halifax Slasher."

356
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,820
 As opposed to the Halifax Mashher, if he had kept using a mallet, but now he's the

357
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,860
 Halifax Slasher, because he stabbed another woman, or slashed another woman in the buttocks.

358
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,900
 This goes on for a week, and people are like, "Oh my god, ouch, someone poked me in the

359
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
 butt."

360
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
 Go to the cops.

361
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,420
 Vigilante squads form up.

362
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,900
 We all learn through this story that England's really big on their vigilantes.

363
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,400
 Sexy squads form up, begin rowing the city looking for the Halifax Slasher.

364
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,640
 A couple of people got beat up because they were assumed to be the Halifax Slasher.

365
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,680
 They started to be reports in nearby cities, "Oh no, I got slashed too.

366
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,080
 I'm a butt."

367
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,200
 Eight victims in a week.

368
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
 In one week.

369
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,400
 And again, back then, eight people was a lot of people, because there was only like 20,000

370
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,600
 people world population.

371
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,840
 So eight people slashed in one week, in one town.

372
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,160
 Everyone was totally freaking out.

373
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,460
 Couple days later, couple days after it all started, this dude walks into a police station

374
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,860
 and said, "I never got attacked.

375
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,860
 I made it up.

376
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
 Never got attacked."

377
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
 Cops are like, "What?"

378
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,540
 They started investigating the other people, and they have people like, "Yeah, I didn't

379
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,780
 get attacked either.

380
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,340
 I totally made it up.

381
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,340
 Totally made it up."

382
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,780
 Out of the eight people who were attacked, five of them recanted and said, "No, that

383
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,780
 never happened to me."

384
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,780
 Four of them went to prison for like misreporting a crime.

385
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,180
 They take stuff pretty seriously over there.

386
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,340
 And they're like, it was just mass hysteria.

387
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:10,560
 Now the first two may have actually been legit with the mallet, but out of the eight, five

388
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,240
 people recanted their stories.

389
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,680
 Now it was funny because when they were investigating the crime, they go in Halifax and they said,

390
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,840
 "Well, you know, back in 1927, there was a slasher in Halifax."

391
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,360
 So maybe it's the same guy.

392
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,760
 In 1927, James Leonard was convicted of stalking and slashing at women, slashing at their

393
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,340
 clothes mostly with a slasher, with a razor blade, but he was sentenced to six months

394
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,340
 for it.

395
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,860
 So when the police were investigating the slashing allegations 11 years later, they

396
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,740
 go, "Maybe it's James Leonard."

397
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,660
 And then the thing is, is that they look at the description and they're like, "Okay,

398
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,660
 bright buckles.

399
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,340
 No, it doesn't have bright buckles."

400
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,980
 But James Leonard had a huge nose.

401
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,060
 His nose apparently was so big that the cops are like, "Can't be this new guy.

402
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,760
 Can't be this new guy because no one talks about how big his nose is.

403
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,080
 They're more concerned about how bright his buckles are on his shoes."

404
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:15,080
 How big does your nose have to be that if you're walking down the street with a razor

405
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,280
 blade, the first thing people are going to see is your nose?

406
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,560
 But you're thinking, "Okay, Jason, yeah, a guy walking around with a mallet, bright

407
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,680
 buckles on his shoes.

408
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
 They or may not have a big nose."

409
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
 Okay, so what?

410
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,240
 Now we're going to go back to the year of 1788.

411
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,380
 And this is the year of the London Monster for two years.

412
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,060
 50 women got their butts cut.

413
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,180
 It's super bizarre.

414
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,660
 So there is a fetish called "peakerism."

415
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,660
 Pikerism?

416
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,660
 Pikerism.

417
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
 One of the two.

418
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,180
 I'm going to call it "peakerism" because I imagine it's like peek-a-boo.

419
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,500
 But so, "peakerism."

420
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 "Peakerism" or maybe it's "pickerism."

421
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,140
 Okay, well, "pickerism."

422
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,140
 We'll say "pickerism."

423
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,660
 "Pickerism" is a sexual...

424
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,700
 I'm reading this description from Wikipedia.

425
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,760
 So if I sound robotic, that's why.

426
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,040
 "Pickerism is a sexual interest in penetrating the skin of another person with sharp objects,

427
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,680
 such as pins, razors, knives, etc."

428
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
 That's actually...

429
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,920
 You'll see it pop up in news reports even today, because it's a fetish.

430
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,240
 Go back to the description.

431
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,320
 "Sometimes this is serious enough to cause extreme injuries or even death.

432
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,040
 Pickerism is a paraffilia as well as a form of sadism.

433
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,560
 The most frequently targeted areas of the body are the breasts, buttocks, and groin."

434
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
 Ow.

435
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
 Breasts and buttocks.

436
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
 I mean, it hurt.

437
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,180
 How do you surprise someone in the groin?

438
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,140
 I guess not all of the people who are into "pickerism" jump out of the bushes, but...

439
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,540
 Anyways, so in 1788, they had the London Monster.

440
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,700
 So for over two years, or around two years, 50 women fell prey to this guy.

441
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,820
 He was this big guy who would walk down the street and yell at them, yell obscenities

442
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
 at them.

443
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,500
 So like back then, he's probably like, "You, Kerr!"

444
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,780
 And they'd be like, "Oh my God, did he say that in public?"

445
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,340
 And then he'd stab them in the butt.

446
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,940
 I find the details of this story hilarious.

447
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,520
 Like the actual event, not so much.

448
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
 So anyways, one of the tricks.

449
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,200
 So they said that he would follow them down the street and yell obscenities at them and

450
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,840
 then poke them in the butt.

451
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,840
 Another trick he would use...

452
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,000
 I didn't know these existed, but I guess it's a thing.

453
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,920
 This shows how juvenile I am.

454
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,120
 Another trick he used was he would walk up to them and he would get them to smell his

455
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,880
 nose gay.

456
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,120
 So a nose gay is another term for a small bouquet of flowers.

457
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,500
 Now I get why they're called nose gay because you smell the flowers and it makes your nose

458
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
 happy.

459
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
 But I just...

460
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,000
 I mean, I...

461
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,300
 I think that yes, it is very juvenile for me to laugh at something called a nose gay.

462
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,660
 But I'm gonna do it anyways.

463
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,380
 I will have to say though, that is an awesome name for a band.

464
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,860
 The nose gays.

465
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,840
 Tell me, tell me you would not buy an album from a band called the nose gays.

466
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,580
 And then people would either laugh at just the absurdity of the name or they'd be like,

467
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,960
 "Actually, that is an old timey English word for a bouquet of small bouquet of flowers."

468
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,000
 It's been related to the London Monster.

469
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,400
 So he walked around and he would walk up to women and say, "Smell my nose gay."

470
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,280
 And then nobody was like, "What'd you say?"

471
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,600
 They'd be like, "Oh, that's a beautiful nose gay.

472
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,400
 Let me put your nose gay next to my nose and let's see if it makes my nose gay."

473
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
 Ha ha ha.

474
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
 Men?

475
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,000
 This is another detail I thought was so funny.

476
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,220
 So the city, the cities on the edge of the grip of terror last two years, men were like,

477
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,740
 "Well, I'm not the monster.

478
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,140
 I am no London Monster."

479
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,620
 They formed, men in the city formed a club.

480
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,260
 And part of the things they would do is they would wear pins on their shirt of like a picture

481
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
 of a club.

482
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,020
 I don't know if it's like a Captain Caveman club or a club from a deck of cards.

483
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,780
 It just said a club.

484
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,960
 Now if people were being accused of poking people in the butt, the last thing they would

485
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,680
 want to wear is a pin on my shirt.

486
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,080
 But anyway, so men in the town of London were like, "Well, I'm no monster.

487
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,560
 Look, I have a pin."

488
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:07,040
 And these guys, these guys who said they weren't monsters, they were not the London Monster,

489
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,160
 they named their group.

490
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,080
 No monster club.

491
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,440
 What?

492
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,240
 That is the worst name possible.

493
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,180
 It's like, okay, a bunch of kids came up with the name Monster Squad because they hunted

494
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
 monsters.

495
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:26,260
 You are saying you're not a monster and instead of like the league against the monster or

496
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,060
 anything other than so, so what's that pin mean?

497
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,740
 You're like, "Oh, I'm in the no monster."

498
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
 These are adults.

499
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,260
 These are adults' name on the stuff.

500
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,980
 Anyways, people are saying, "Do I have a nosegay on me?

501
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,420
 Look, I'm in no monster club."

502
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:47,480
 And then armed patrols of vigilantes patrolling the streets of London, women started wearing

503
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,960
 copper pans over their petticoats so they were like being armored.

504
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
 They'd have like a pan hanging off their backs so they couldn't get poked.

505
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
 They'd go, "Ding!"

506
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,680
 And he'd be like foiled and he'd run away.

507
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,240
 Eventually this guy was arrested in 1790.

508
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,040
 Reineck Williams was arrested and the people were so, like the people of London were so

509
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,000
 pissed off at any of this happen.

510
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,860
 The trial got jammed packed full of spectators and I use the term spectators because when

511
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:19,700
 the prosecutor would make a good point, the audience would cheer and be like, "Yeah, yeah!"

512
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,340
 And then when the defense made a point, the audience began booing.

513
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
 They were literal spectators.

514
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,340
 I like a sport.

515
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,020
 Eventually the judge was like, "This is not a fair trial.

516
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,780
 They had to try him again."

517
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,220
 He ended up getting sentenced to six years and the charge that he got sentenced with

518
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,180
 was robbery and then the little specification because you're like robbery.

519
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,180
 He didn't steal anything.

520
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,380
 But robbery had a special qualification.

521
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:49,000
 It was assault with intent to spoil clothing and that actually carried a bigger charge

522
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,260
 than attempted murder at the time.

523
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,500
 So if you were assaulting someone with your main motivation being to ruin their clothes,

524
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,700
 it was worse than attempted murder.

525
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
 So that's what he got charged with.

526
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
 He did six years.

527
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,260
 So you're thinking, "Oh, Jason, that was awesome.

528
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,540
 No nose gaze and no monster club and people saying, "I don't poke someone.

529
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,940
 Look at this pin on my shirt."

530
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
 The absurdity.

531
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,420
 How can you top that?"

532
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,660
 Now we're going back 70 some odd years.

533
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,860
 We're still in England.

534
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:24,020
 We're going to a place called Hackney, England where a man named Thomas Wallace puts both

535
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,820
 those previous guys to shame.

536
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:31,540
 So what happened was you had a period from October 10th to December 1st.

537
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:39,140
 So a longer reign of terror than Halifax Slasher, but not as impressive as London Monster.

538
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,740
 But in that time period from October 10th to December 1st, he attacked 70 women.

539
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:50,580
 His weapon of choice was a giant stick because see now we're going farther back in time.

540
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,420
 They're like, "We don't even have knives.

541
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
 It's 1712.

542
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,900
 We don't even have knives.

543
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,300
 We barely have clothes."

544
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,940
 He all he had was a giant rod of birch and he would jump out of the bushes or walk down

545
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,220
 the street and sneak them on these women and just beat them with this stick.

546
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,980
 And his name was Whipping Tom.

547
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,340
 That was basically like, you know, he had the Joker and Green Goblin.

548
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,420
 Back then he was Whipping Tom.

549
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,860
 And it's funny if you think about it, that's the evolution of the evil names.

550
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,260
 You go from Halifax Slasher, which you could hear today, to London Monster, which is a

551
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,700
 little old time, he'd just, "Oh, that's just Whipping Tom."

552
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,500
 And the cops are like, "We don't know what to do.

553
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,300
 We can't catch this guy or anything like that."

554
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:38,140
 They eventually, though, do capture him and his plan was just absolutely bizarre.

555
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,820
 So it wasn't just, the Halifax Slasher was a myth.

556
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,780
 Most likely it didn't happen except for maybe one or two attacks in the beginning.

557
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,220
 The London Monster was this voyeuristic thing.

558
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,140
 So why was Whipping Tom jumping out of bushes or chasing women down the street with a big

559
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
 old stick?

560
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:59,100
 When they asked Wallace why he was doing it after they arrested him, he said, and I'm

561
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,140
 going to read this quote from, like, the confession in its old timey, so it's all weird.

562
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:10,060
 He was resolved to be revenged on all the women he could come at after that manner, for the

563
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:15,340
 sake of one perjured female who had been barboulessly false to him.

564
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,500
 So basically a woman lied to him.

565
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:24,580
 Either a woman besmirched his name or perjured him in the old county square or got his mom,

566
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,220
 or he told a lie and he got locked up in the stocks or some other old timey punishment.

567
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,700
 So old timey punishment requires old timey revenge, which is just a big old stick running

568
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,340
 down the road with a big old stick.

569
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,060
 His plan was this.

570
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,020
 Basically this was his diehard with the vengeance plan.

571
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,500
 This was his master goal as a super criminal.

572
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,100
 He was going to attack 100 women before Christmas, so he was getting up there.

573
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,700
 He had attacked 70 women between October and December 1st.

574
00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:00,460
 He was going to attack 100 women before Christmas, take a break off for the 12 days of Christmas.

575
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,140
 He was going to take a break off for the 12 days of Christmas and then going to start

576
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,180
 the attacks again in the new year.

577
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,900
 So basically he wanted to whip 100 women with this big old stick.

578
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,860
 Then he wanted to get like a partridge in a paratrore and be like, "12 maids are milking.

579
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,580
 5 golden rings."

580
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,300
 And then like after, not after the song was done, but after the literal 12 days of Christmas,

581
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,540
 he was going to be like, "Woo, what was I doing?

582
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,380
 Oh yeah, assaulting women."

583
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,500
 He grabs his stick that I assume now is like festive with like red and green tassel wrapped

584
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
 around it.

585
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,100
 He's going out there with his big stick.

586
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
 That didn't happen.

587
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,100
 He ended up getting arrested.

588
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,540
 And the weirdest part of all of this, of the whipping Tom story, if you could top any

589
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,500
 of that nonsense, he wasn't even the first whipping Tom.

590
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,140
 About a hundred years earlier in England, there was another guy who went by the name

591
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,780
 whipping Tom who was jumping out of bushes whipping people with sticks.

592
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,460
 I mean, I'm sure there's weirdos like this all over the planet.

593
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,140
 Actually, I 100% for sure there's weirdos like that all over the planet, but it's just

594
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:01,220
 because I found the, I was looking up the Halifax slasher because I was like, "Oh, mass hysteria."

595
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,380
 I like doing stories about how the mind works and how like people can get panicked to make

596
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,380
 other people panic.

597
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,780
 But as I was researching it, it was like, "Oh, if you're interested in this, also look at

598
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,780
 the London Monster."

599
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,780
 I was like, "How can I pass that up?"

600
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
 And clicked on that.

601
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,380
 I'm like, "Oh my God, this is even funnier."

602
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,300
 And then it's like, "If you love the London Monster, try this link, whipping Tom."

603
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,860
 So I kind of got sucked into it.

604
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,860
 But that's why it's not like, it's not like England has a high population of assaulting

605
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,060
 weirdos or any higher than the rest of the world.

606
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,800
 But I think they probably are just better at keeping old-timey records so we can go back

607
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,740
 and look at the stuff and be like, "Look at wood carvings of like a chick running down

608
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,860
 the street and a guy chasing her with a stick."

609
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
 Well, that is good.

610
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,700
 You're like, "Jason, did you just make fun of a guy beating women with a stick for 20

611
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,700
 minutes?"

612
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,700
 That wasn't the intent.

613
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,420
 It was the old-timey ridiculousness of it all that I was laughing at, not the fact that

614
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,640
 this guy is wailing on women.

615
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,900
 So that's it.

616
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
 That is it.

617
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,020
 We had a bunch of sexual perverts running around this episode.

618
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
 I hope you guys enjoyed it.

619
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,780
 I don't know where that came from.

620
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,340
 That sounded totally wrong.

621
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,940
 That is it for the day.
