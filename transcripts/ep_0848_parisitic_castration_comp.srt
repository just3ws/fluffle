1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 In Ohio, there's a young man who has a job at picking up roadkill.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:15,000
 But when he sees the same corpse over and over and over again, it leads him into a troubling

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,120
 mystery.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,320
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy that the modern world is not created by humans,

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:38,640
 but by the parasites that have attached themselves to our genitals.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:01:04,680
 To an other episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I hope you

7
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,680
 are watching this video.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:36,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I hope you are watching this video.

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,280
 Hey guys, full disclosure man, I just woke up from like a 3-4 hour nap.

10
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:56,280
 Sorry guys, I've just been so tired but I'm really excited to share these stories with

11
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
 you.

12
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:20,960
 I'm

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:39,720
 the

14
00:02:39,720 --> 00:03:05,560
 guy who's been

15
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:16,560
 driving this truck down the road.

16
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,880
 He's driving this truck down the road and he sees like a dead possum and he's like "okay."

17
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,960
 He jumps out of his truck and he gets his shovel, throws it in the back of the truck.

18
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,560
 I'm sure it was more sanitary than that, but I don't think he was driving around a fort,

19
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,960
 everyone 50 that was just covered in the grime and gore of a thousand dead roadkill.

20
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,440
 Maybe he put it in a bag.

21
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,880
 He throws the possum in a bag, throws it in the back, the bag immediately rips, guts

22
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:46,120
 everywhere, drives down the road a little bit farther and he sees a deer and he's like

23
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,840
 "oh this is what we call a two shovel job."

24
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,200
 So he gets two shovels and he lifts the deer, throws that one in the back cause there's

25
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
 no bag big enough.

26
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
 Driving on the road.

27
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
 Then he sees an opossum.

28
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,560
 I don't know what the difference is, but I don't know what the difference is between

29
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
 the two animals.

30
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
 The same thing.

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,480
 Scoops the opossum into the truck.

32
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,600
 And he did this job often enough that he began to see a pattern.

33
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,720
 Not that animal life was very fragile and not faster than vehicles.

34
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,280
 Every Wednesday he would come across a dead coyote.

35
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,040
 He goes "Jayson you know it's wilderness.

36
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
 Oh I was just one barren state.

37
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,640
 It's one county and it's all run by animal wildlife."

38
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,760
 And of course he's going to run into a coyote.

39
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,360
 Maybe it's weird that it's every Wednesday he sees a coyote, but has he seen coyotes

40
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,920
 on different days as well?

41
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,240
 Every Wednesday he would see a dead coyote.

42
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,200
 It was always a brand new coyote corpse.

43
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,800
 And it was always in the same location.

44
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,080
 Outside of this veterinarian office there would be a dead coyote.

45
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,360
 His bloated corpse sitting there in the Ohio sunshine.

46
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,020
 And he said it was weird because I'd always seem to see it around the same time.

47
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,360
 So it wasn't just like every Wednesday he would see this, but every Wednesday around,

48
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,720
 let's say he didn't give the exact time, but every Wednesday around 5pm when he was finishing

49
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,920
 off his rounds, he would come across the dead coyote sitting outside this veterinarian

50
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,400
 office.

51
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,040
 And he'd get up and he'd scoop it up, throw it in the back of his truck and drive off.

52
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,120
 And it would probably take a couple Wednesdays before you even noticed that this was a pattern.

53
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,920
 But he starts noticing every Wednesday around the same time outside this veterinarian office

54
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,680
 there's a dead coyote.

55
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,760
 And he's going here enough he starts to realize another pattern.

56
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,520
 At this veterinarian's office, there's never any cars in the parking lot.

57
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,320
 If he'd pull up in his truck he'd see this freshly killed coyote corpse.

58
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,920
 This seemingly empty veterinarian office.

59
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,560
 Because not only is there no cars in the parking lot, he said I never saw anyone inside.

60
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,160
 I mean I don't think people would want to show up to work if there's a dead coyote out there.

61
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,280
 Like, "Ah, have him clean it up and then we'll go in."

62
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,760
 But he goes this veterinarian office that never had any cars in the parking lot.

63
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,000
 Never had anyone inside.

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,920
 The only business they seemed to have was me picking up a coyote corpse every Wednesday.

65
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:30,080
 And one day a man after my own heart, right, a paranoid freak, he goes it was Boss.

66
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,640
 And he goes, "Hey, you know, I'm really enjoying the animal-innered business.

67
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,400
 I'm hoping I can eventually work my way up the ladder to chef.

68
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,600
 I'd love to start cooking these things and open my own restaurant.

69
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,320
 But right now, I'm happy scooping up warm guts."

70
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,120
 But Boss, this is really weird.

71
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,560
 Every Wednesday around the same time there's a fresh coyote corpse.

72
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,080
 Outside of that veterinarian office.

73
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,480
 What's even weirder is no one's ever at the veterinarian office.

74
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:07,080
 And he said his Boss seriously, seriously advised him to stop talking about this.

75
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,600
 Don't ask any more questions.

76
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,520
 Just do what we pay you for.

77
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,800
 Scooping up warm animal intestines.

78
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,840
 I don't want to hear any more about this veterinarian office or this coyote or nothing.

79
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,480
 And I would like to impress on you one more time.

80
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
 Drop it.

81
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,640
 You know the coyote corpse that you're loading into the truck?

82
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:36,640
 This investigation or this line of questioning you have, it's done.

83
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,920
 Boss goes back to filling out some paperwork.

84
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,400
 Tony leaves the office.

85
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,200
 This statement by his Boss to just stop looking into this seriously, do not ask any more questions

86
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,360
 about this.

87
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
 Hit home.

88
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,760
 He actually said I never looked into it.

89
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,000
 I absolutely did drop it.

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,920
 And we can only assume to this day this man is still picking up corpses.

91
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
 No.

92
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,320
 I think what the assumption we can take from the story is he did continue to still do

93
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,320
 the job and did continue to still pick up a coyote corpse every week from there.

94
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,400
 But he no longer verbally or no longer out loud spoke of this weird mystery that was

95
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,680
 going on in his town.

96
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,120
 Short story, right?

97
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,680
 That's all we have.

98
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,040
 I love local stories like this.

99
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,440
 Absolutely love stuff like this, right?

100
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,600
 Because it's again, it's so small, literally so small town in this story, right?

101
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,160
 Has no giant implications.

102
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,880
 It's not these huge machinations moving across the planet.

103
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,240
 It's a small town that has a mystery that someone probably did look into before.

104
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,880
 Someone probably did ask too many questions.

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,720
 And the Boss remembers what happened when someone continued their line of questioning

106
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,920
 on this matter, right?

107
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,840
 Boss said just drop it.

108
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,960
 As Tony leaves the Boss turns and he's eating coyote guts, he's like num num num num num

109
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,760
 and I'll throw the remains outside of the veterinarian office.

110
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,040
 It's a mystery.

111
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,280
 It's such a local mystery and it's one of the great things about the internet.

112
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,120
 I mean, like global trade and all of this stuff.

113
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,160
 It's the fact that we can have these local mysteries spread.

114
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,400
 I mean, this one's super obscure.

115
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,520
 The thread that it was on is already gone.

116
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
 I archived it.

117
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,200
 You can look through it and look at all the other cool things on there.

118
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
 But yeah, I love this story.

119
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,760
 And what would you do, right?

120
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,960
 If your boss was like, don't ask any more questions about this.

121
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,380
 Would you, I would be curious about it still, but if my, and it would depend on like my

122
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,520
 relationship with my boss and how adamant he was, like if he's beating me up, he's

123
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
 beating me up.

124
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,280
 He's dressing me up as a coyote and he's like, you're next.

125
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,360
 Then I definitely would drop that line of questioning, but it's such a weird mystery.

126
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,240
 You'd still want to find out more, but if someone was like, no, I just love it, right?

127
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,680
 It doesn't have any high stakes.

128
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,520
 There's another one I have like that that I've never, I've always wanted to find a place

129
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
 to talk about it.

130
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,840
 So we'll talk about it now.

131
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,880
 There, someone posted a long time ago on Reddit.

132
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,440
 They said, what are some Reddit questions or Reddit posts people have made?

133
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,960
 And then they never posted it again after that.

134
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,120
 Like are there any sort of times that a Redditor brought up a mystery or said something was

135
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,200
 going on and then the account just disappeared.

136
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,280
 And one of, it's interesting because we covered someone like that before where they believed

137
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,120
 that aliens were going to invade last year.

138
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,920
 They made a prophecy like seven years ago.

139
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,720
 And then as we were getting closer to the date, I'll put the edit episode and there's

140
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,160
 two episodes on it in the show notes.

141
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,840
 That was the same time that the federal government said they were going to release their files

142
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
 on the UFOs.

143
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,420
 So it seemed to collide together, right?

144
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,520
 And that was great mystery.

145
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,240
 But then the Redditor showed back up, the Redditor showed back up and said that they

146
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,320
 were in love with some great alien and it is totally, they blew their own mythology,

147
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
 right?

148
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
 They should have never returned.

149
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,520
 They kind of blew that.

150
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:06,240
 But I did find this one again, just such a weird mystery or mental illness.

151
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,680
 This one, this one has a little less evidence than a coyote corpse each week.

152
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,960
 The person asking, the person posting this thread on Reddit, they went by the name MBTA

153
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
 whole.

154
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,040
 One of their examples, they go, this is what I'm kind of looking for.

155
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,200
 They go, there used to be this Redditor who went by the name Bang Song Lee.

156
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,000
 And Bang Song Lee posted this thing on Reddit and they were truly disturbed by this story,

157
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,520
 but eventually they stopped posting and they apparently deleted their account.

158
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,320
 There's no, I couldn't find this thread anywhere.

159
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,960
 But Bang Song Lee, we'll call him Lee for short, Lee was going to his local university

160
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,200
 and he was posting on Reddit because he believed that the school administration had placed some

161
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,840
 sort of tracking device on him.

162
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,040
 Classic paranoid delusion, right?

163
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,960
 He said the reason why he knew, for a fact, I guess this does have evidence is just as

164
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,840
 much evidence as the rotting coyote corpse.

165
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,640
 He goes, the reason why I knew they were tracking me was because I would often go to the student

166
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,440
 lounge on campus.

167
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,560
 You have your little food court and your little dining area and you can just sit there and

168
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,800
 people watching eat your food and read the school newspaper and all that stuff.

169
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,840
 He said every time I'd go to the student lounge, I would order my favorite drink.

170
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,640
 An Arnold Palmer, what is that, like half lemonade, half iced tea.

171
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:32,160
 He'd go and he would order an Arnold Palmer and every single time he did this, he'd go

172
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,680
 one Arnold Palmer, please, the dean of the school would appear.

173
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,560
 It was like he's being summoned, like he's Betelgeuse or something.

174
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,240
 He would order an Arnold Palmer and apparently out of nowhere, he didn't mystically appear,

175
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,080
 but he'd walk from around the corner or he would be standing in line behind Lee or there's

176
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,000
 a strategically placed bush that the dean was hiding behind.

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,800
 Whenever Lee asked for an Arnold Palmer, the dean of the school would pop out of nowhere

178
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,400
 and say, "What a twist!"

179
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,200
 And then walk away.

180
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,600
 And Lee said this happened every single time I asked for an Arnold Palmer.

181
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,440
 Sometimes I imagine like the bartender turns around to get it and when he turns back it's

182
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,960
 the dean and the bartender's closed.

183
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,880
 What a twist!

184
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,640
 Maybe sometimes Lee would try to throw him off and say, "I'd like a Palmer Arnold, please."

185
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,040
 The dean still appears, he's in the vent, the heating vent, what a twist!

186
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:35,360
 He said every single time he ordered an Arnold Palmer from the student lounge, the dean would

187
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,440
 appear in some fashion and say, "What a twist!"

188
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,160
 And Lee posted this on Reddit and then never replied to any comments and then never posted

189
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
 again.

190
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,960
 And that username is no longer in the Reddit database.

191
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,560
 That's a weird local mystery.

192
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,000
 Again, this one he might have been mentally insane.

193
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,640
 I don't know if the dean was actually omnipotent and had the ability to appear out of nowhere

194
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,200
 when he asked for an Arnold Palmer, but one of those weird mysteries that you would never

195
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,360
 know of outside of someone posting it on the internet.

196
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,360
 People who knew Lee, he probably talked to them about it all the time, right?

197
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,000
 Because he's trying to make sense of it.

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
 And maybe the story got weird enough that people in the college were kind of mentioning

199
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
 it.

200
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,280
 And Lee, who always says the dean follows him and the dean standing there and he's like,

201
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,640
 "I know, where do you get that impression?"

202
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,480
 This is Eiser shifting from side to side, trying to listen for what his order is.

203
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,280
 Just a weird mystery.

204
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,000
 It's a little less grim than the Coyote one.

205
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,160
 Like the Coyote one, I think on the paranormal side we think maybe there was some vampire

206
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,960
 cult there or they were doing some sort of sacrifice?

207
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
 Maybe?

208
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,040
 But it could have also been that the veterinary office was like a mob front or a place they

209
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,920
 moved money through.

210
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,480
 It could have been something a little more mundane than paranormal.

211
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,680
 This guy, he could have uncovered a college plot where the dean had a compulsion.

212
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,880
 It was the dean's mental illness that was causing this.

213
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,640
 Or it could have been Lee's mental illness and he was hallucinating the whole thing.

214
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,000
 But just these local mysteries, I love this type of stuff.

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,920
 It doesn't always have to be doom and gloom, world-ending stuff.

216
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,480
 Sometimes these ones are the ones that stick with you.

217
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,920
 That Arnold Palmer, I've had that in my notes for months.

218
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,140
 I've been trying to figure out a way to talk about it and I'm actually glad it really

219
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
 coincided with this one.

220
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,640
 Just those weird local mysteries.

221
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,440
 I love them.

222
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,080
 Joaquin Stick, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

223
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
 We're leaving behind Ohio.

224
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,080
 We got an Arnold Palmer in each hand and a Coyote jerky in our pockets.

225
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,720
 We're leaving behind Ohio.

226
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:39,600
 We're headed all the way out to Big City, USA.

227
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,320
 Joaquin Stick, I want you to land on this skyscraper.

228
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,960
 Not one of the pointy ones because then the carboner copter will wobble off.

229
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,880
 One of the skyscrapers with the flat roofs.

230
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,480
 So we're obviously, Jason, we're not going to try to land on the entire state building.

231
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,920
 I will land on a building that has a flat roof.

232
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,840
 We're walking around, just making sure we're walking.

233
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,520
 We're walking around and I'm standing there on the edge of this building.

234
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,800
 I go look down at humanity below us.

235
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 See all those people down there?

236
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 Why?

237
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
 We can't see anyone.

238
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,480
 I was like, okay, let's take the elevator down a couple floors.

239
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,440
 Now we're about seven stories up and we go to a window and I'm like, look down at the

240
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:19,600
 people below us and you see humanity walking back and forth down the street, shopping,

241
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,280
 driving cars, riding bicycles, everything like that.

242
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,640
 And I go, this is the ultimate testament to mankind, the big city.

243
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,760
 The fact that we're able to reshape the planet earth into this network of steel and concrete.

244
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,800
 This is the perfect representation of man's power over nature.

245
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,680
 We're in these buildings.

246
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,840
 We're looking down at the people.

247
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,560
 But we have to remember, even though we've advanced so far, by the way, we reshape things.

248
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,880
 We are still animals.

249
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,120
 We still have monkey bodies with reptile brains.

250
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:08,560
 We're still held to our base passions, like love and hate, envy and lust.

251
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:17,960
 Even though we're in this advanced modern age of humanity, we're still just beasts.

252
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,240
 And that begs the question as to who are we?

253
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
 Who are we?

254
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:30,040
 I did an episode recently when I was mentioning a lot of our desires, like our food desires,

255
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,760
 what we think makes us us, is from the gut, from the gut biome.

256
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,840
 Whether or not you're really into sugary snacks or you like more of a savory meat, that has

257
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,440
 a lot to do with your gut biome.

258
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
 I would say almost completely to do with your gut biome.

259
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,720
 That if you're somehow, let's say that you really love sweets, if you're somehow able

260
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,840
 to transfer your soul into someone else's body, like we covered in yesterday's episode,

261
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,240
 you wouldn't like sweets anymore.

262
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,000
 You'd actually be working on a totally different stomach biome.

263
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,240
 If you lived for the taste of chocolate covering your tongue, but we put you in a body that

264
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,000
 had a completely different gut biome, you would be like, "I'm not a big sweets person."

265
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,800
 So that's not really part of our personality.

266
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,760
 Eating is a huge part of what we do and what we choose to eat.

267
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,480
 We may not even have that much control over what we choose to want to eat.

268
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,840
 I find it very interesting, humans are the only animal that will starve itself rather

269
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,480
 than eat the same thing every single day.

270
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,120
 If you gave a man his favorite food, pot roast with a side of potatoes, and you gave it to

271
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,360
 him three times a day every single day within a month, he would be like, "I'm not eating.

272
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,520
 I refuse to eat this stuff again."

273
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,280
 Every other animal, you can give a squirrel a nut every single day or give him a mouse

274
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,200
 a cookie every single day and they will eat that same thing every single day.

275
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,920
 You'll never have a squirrel that's like, "Ah, you know, and acorns are all cool and

276
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,800
 stuff like that, but I've had my fill.

277
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
 I need something else."

278
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,280
 No, they'll eat acorns until they die.

279
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,640
 For me, corn poisoning.

280
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,160
 Humans are the only people who, for whatever reason, it's a super weird quirk of our biology.

281
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
 They will refuse to eat.

282
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,520
 They will say no.

283
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,080
 They need food variety.

284
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,200
 I found that out because I was writing a book about how to survive nuclear winter or something

285
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,000
 like that a long time ago.

286
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,840
 Y2K, I was writing a book about Y2K a long time ago.

287
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,960
 And that was one of the tips.

288
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,320
 When you're building your shelter, you have to have a diverse amount of food.

289
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,440
 Because if you just get pork and beans, you will starve to death.

290
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
 Why?

291
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
 You know.

292
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
 Who's making that decision?

293
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,640
 Obviously, you want to survive.

294
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,040
 People eat disgusting things all the time to survive.

295
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,280
 But you won't eat horse testicles every single day for the rest of your life.

296
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,920
 You may eat them if you get trapped out on a horse farm for three weeks.

297
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
 So who are we?

298
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,480
 Who actually makes the determination of who we are?

299
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,680
 I think a big part of it is biology.

300
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,760
 The way the electrons travel across your brain, your physical brain, the way your gut biome

301
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,400
 interacts with your brain.

302
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
 So some people have addictive personalities and some people don't.

303
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,480
 Some people can do heroin and be like, "Yeah, that ain't for me."

304
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,640
 Other people can do heroin and it's for them and it completely ruins their life.

305
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
 Weird.

306
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,880
 It's weird quirk because we know that heroin is addictive and some people don't get addicted

307
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
 to it.

308
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,080
 Why?

309
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
 And I think we always default back to the soul, right?

310
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,880
 Or the personality of the person.

311
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,120
 He just doesn't have an addictive personality.

312
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,440
 But is there something biological going on there?

313
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:42,200
 What I'm headed towards is that I recently found out about a thing called parasitic castration.

314
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,120
 Parasitic castration is exactly what it sounds like.

315
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,200
 It's a parasite that castrates its host.

316
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,200
 And what's weird is there's not a lot of normie street level information on parasitic castration.

317
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,160
 Because a lot of people don't read about this for fun.

318
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,520
 When I looked into this, I was reading the Wikipedia page and I went to go do additional

319
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
 research.

320
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,960
 All scientific journal stuff, the stuff that you have to pay for.

321
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,440
 And even if it was free, I wouldn't understand it.

322
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,600
 But parasitic castration is one of the six major forms of parasites.

323
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,600
 It's one of the biggies.

324
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,640
 But it's not something a lot of people know about.

325
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,880
 Generally, parasitic castration we see on smaller creatures.

326
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
 Like snails.

327
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
 Like crustaceans.

328
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,080
 Just little things.

329
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,120
 Tiny little things.

330
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,720
 And what they do is they latch on to the sexual organs of the creature.

331
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,520
 They will get right up in there and they will feed off of the ovaries or the gonads of their

332
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,000
 host.

333
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,360
 It's like a slurpee in there.

334
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,000
 It's like a constant slurpee machine going on.

335
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,920
 And these creatures are just getting raw resources.

336
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
 Right from the source.

337
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,360
 Right from the balls, right?

338
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,560
 And your sex organs are constantly producing more juice.

339
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,440
 More energy.

340
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,880
 And your sex organs are constantly functioning.

341
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,600
 They're constantly producing more yummy yummy goodness.

342
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,600
 So a parasite that does this has a huge amount of resources to eat.

343
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,680
 Seemingly unlimited.

344
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,960
 Right?

345
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,320
 And what's interesting is not only does this parasite attach onto the sexual organs.

346
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,040
 It radically changes the organism's behaviors.

347
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,840
 Because if this, let's take a frog for example.

348
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,840
 If this frog had working sex organs, it is going to do all the things that someone with

349
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,400
 working sex organs does.

350
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,920
 It's going to mate.

351
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,080
 It's going to try to have children.

352
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,040
 It's going to try to fight other members of its species to impress the lovely little

353
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,920
 lady frog on the lily pad.

354
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,680
 Competition, care for offspring, mate seeking behavior is all shut down when these parasites

355
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
 are on board.

356
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,920
 I mean it is kind of hard to go to the prom when you have a giant monster attached to

357
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
 your nuts.

358
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,960
 But you don't even want to go to the prom, right?

359
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,440
 You're just fine staying at home.

360
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,120
 You're just fine staying at home with your pants off as this thing with these huge needles

361
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,280
 stuck in there.

362
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,000
 And all of this behavior is gone, right?

363
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,320
 So a lot of the energy that's put into looking more beautiful to attract mates are getting

364
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,360
 stronger to fight off potential rivals.

365
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,280
 All of that biological energy is now being, all of that biological energy is being suppressed.

366
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,040
 It's actually giving the parasite more nutrients to feed off of.

367
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,120
 Because your body's saying, well if I'm not going to try to grow a bigger shell and bigger

368
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,720
 snappers to fight these other crabs, I guess I'm just going to sit here.

369
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,880
 And all the food that I eat is going to go towards the thing that my body's definitely

370
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,760
 needing, more sexual resources because it's constantly getting drained.

371
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,960
 One of the things is because it's still taking in its daily calorie count, this little crab

372
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,600
 is still eating the same amount of food it normally would if it did have working sexual

373
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,160
 organs.

374
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,880
 Since it's not using it to become a better mate, a lot of these creatures will have

375
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,760
 gigantism because the body doesn't know what to do with all of these extra nutrients, so

376
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,240
 they just start to get really big.

377
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,400
 They also live longer because they're not fighting in the wild.

378
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,320
 They're not going out there.

379
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,240
 They're not putting themselves out there for either predators or for rivals.

380
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:44,680
 They sit there and they just consume and grow big and sit there.

381
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,800
 And consume and grow big and sit there.

382
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:55,360
 And the whole time this parasite is attached to the sexual organs, feeding constantly.

383
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,720
 There's another benefit to having these things.

384
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,720
 They actually protect you from getting other parasites.

385
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,920
 So you can see there's a benefit in a way.

386
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,040
 Definitely the negative is having this monster attached to your body, especially in that

387
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
 region, but you live longer.

388
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,440
 You're not going to get other parasites.

389
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,120
 It protects you from that.

390
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,920
 And you just kind of chill.

391
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,600
 You just sit there and enjoy life.

392
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,160
 As much life as a crab can enjoy, as much life as a crab can enjoy while this giant

393
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,000
 thing is attached to its body.

394
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,080
 I read that and I go, "This is really interesting."

395
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,000
 And of course, because I'm a conspiracy theorist, I started thinking of it like this.

396
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,160
 Is there something like this in the human body?

397
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,200
 Now you can say Jason, obviously not.

398
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,200
 You can look down and there's nothing attached to your sexual organs.

399
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,600
 But sometimes it's on the inside.

400
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,040
 I probably should have said that earlier.

401
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,800
 It's not always this thing locked on down there.

402
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,600
 Sometimes it's inside eating the eggs or eating the sperm, eating the stuff right out of the

403
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
 gonads.

404
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:02,440
 I started thinking, is there a human comparison to this?

405
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
 Because we think...

406
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
 Here's the thing.

407
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,280
 I've made the decision not to have kids, not out of any sort of ecological thing or social

408
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
 thing.

409
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,600
 Kid, the idea of having a child absolutely terrifies me.

410
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,600
 I can take care of myself just fine, but the idea of having to worry about having this

411
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,520
 little three-month-old and that it could choke at any time and then the kids three and they

412
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,920
 can still choke at any time.

413
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,520
 And now they're 33 and I'm like, "Oh, I hope he's chewing his food okay."

414
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,240
 I would be paranoid all the time and I hear they're from parents.

415
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,640
 They go, "Yeah, yeah, it is pretty scary.

416
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,960
 Like, there's a lot of good stuff."

417
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,800
 I always tune out once they agree with me that it's scary.

418
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,920
 But I go, "I don't want to have kids."

419
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,520
 What if that's not my choice?

420
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,160
 What if there's millions of people across the planet who are choosing not to have children

421
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:55,840
 and we think it's our choice and it's not a parasite attached itself to us at some point

422
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,440
 and it's spreading?

423
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,680
 Now I don't have a kid, so that means the other night I was able to go see the Batman.

424
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,600
 I didn't have to make plans with nothing, right?

425
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,480
 I didn't have to get a babysitter.

426
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,800
 I do what I want.

427
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,960
 And then yesterday, I was walking and I went to Walmart to find myself a Batman hot wheel

428
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,160
 just in the middle of the day.

429
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,560
 I bought that in a six pack of Dipepsi.

430
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,960
 Middle of the day.

431
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,040
 I do what I want.

432
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
 I do what I want.

433
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,440
 I don't have kids.

434
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,920
 If I had kids, I wouldn't be able to engage in all of the stuff that I want to do at the

435
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,440
 drop of, I definitely wouldn't be able to do a podcast every day, right?

436
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,400
 And I see all these things as plus, I see all these things as positives.

437
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,280
 But what if I never had an option?

438
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,880
 What if all these people who tell you, "You know, I'm not into having kids?"

439
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,960
 That's not their decision.

440
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,440
 There are chemicals being released into their bloodstream that's traveling to their brains,

441
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,920
 telling them, "You don't want kids.

442
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
 You don't want kids.

443
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
 You don't want offspring."

444
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,640
 Because it's going to take resources from your body that you're now going to have to

445
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,120
 use to raise your child.

446
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,320
 You're not going to be able to eat as much.

447
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,400
 You're not going to be able to have the diet you want.

448
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,760
 You don't have kids.

449
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,040
 This is really, really interesting.

450
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:20,160
 This might sound ridiculous, but it's definitely within the realm of possibility that a key

451
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:31,480
 decision, choosing not to have offspring is biologically odd.

452
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,120
 It's something that humans do.

453
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,200
 And I don't think any other species go.

454
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,120
 I don't think there's ever a cat being like, "You know what?

455
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,920
 There's enough kittens in the world.

456
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,040
 I'm good."

457
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,760
 We have to neuter them or spay them.

458
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:52,360
 We have to physically remove that as an option and changes their personality, doesn't it?

459
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,120
 Changes the way they eat, changes the way they function.

460
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,200
 And then we go, "But I'm making my own decisions.

461
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,480
 No one spayed me.

462
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:10,120
 I'm choosing to break an evolutionary cycle that has existed since the beginning of life."

463
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,800
 And I'm not talking about people who want kids and can't have them for a biological reason

464
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,680
 or they want kids, but they're afraid a genetic disease may follow them.

465
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,240
 I don't want kids.

466
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
 Kids are totally fine.

467
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
 I don't have a problem with kids.

468
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,200
 I don't have a problem with kids at all, but I don't want them.

469
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,720
 I don't see them as...

470
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,640
 I think it's too risky.

471
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,800
 My kids might be total dorks, right?

472
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,760
 That would be upsetting as well.

473
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
 I just...

474
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
 I don't...

475
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
 And I've never been like that.

476
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,080
 I've never been thinking...

477
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,200
 At no point in my life did I stop wanting kids.

478
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,400
 I just was like, "Yeah, I'm good.

479
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
 I don't need that."

480
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
 What if that's not my decision?

481
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,480
 And I know a lot of people are saying that.

482
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
 They don't want kids.

483
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
 Again, some people...

484
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,080
 I know people are like, "I have horrible genetic disease right in my family line.

485
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,760
 I don't want to take the risk."

486
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,120
 But they would want to have kids.

487
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
 That's different.

488
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
 It's tragic, and that's different.

489
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,360
 A lot of times they adopt, and that's awesome.

490
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:15,040
 I'm wondering if there is a parasite in humans that is making us not want kids and indulge

491
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,320
 in our own desires.

492
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,320
 I'm wondering if that's out there.

493
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,720
 And it would be something that if you said it, people would think you were a fool.

494
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,720
 And if you said it to a scientist, they'd probably go, "Yeah, that's not here.

495
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,360
 And the reason why we know this, because we can test for all this stuff.

496
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,800
 We can test for parasites."

497
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,400
 But if the parasite is just part of human life at this point, and it does basically

498
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,760
 take 20% of society and say, "You don't want kids."

499
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,960
 We're infected with this parasite and it makes us not want children.

500
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,240
 It can't have children, not want to have children.

501
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
 Which is biologically super weird.

502
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,880
 Because that is one of the main drives.

503
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,160
 Now what's interesting is I still engage in mate attracting behavior, right?

504
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
 I'm still dating.

505
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,640
 I'm still sleeping with women.

506
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,320
 So it hasn't completely shut off that part of it, fighting rivals and things like that.

507
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,160
 But the idea, once you have offspring, your resources has diminished that you can spend

508
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
 on yourself.

509
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
 Now you have to do that.

510
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,480
 I wonder if that's out there.

511
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,000
 This is kind of an open-ended question.

512
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,080
 I know it's kind of a weird way to end an episode, but I wonder if this is out there.

513
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,480
 I wonder if there is a parasite infecting the human body.

514
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,720
 Not all of them, right?

515
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,400
 Some bodies fight it off, right?

516
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,120
 Some bodies are less susceptible.

517
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,520
 Could have a whole host of factors of why one person carries this parasite and one person

518
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,440
 doesn't.

519
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,640
 But is there something out there that is making humans not want children?

520
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,720
 I always figured it was my decision, but how many of the decisions I make daily are my

521
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,720
 decisions?

522
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,720
 I'm sure a lot of them are.

523
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,760
 But when I'm walking down the road and I really want that Wachama Colet Bar, I haven't had

524
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,040
 a Wachama Colet Bar in a long time.

525
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,120
 I really, really want a Wachama Colet Bar.

526
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,760
 Those cravings will pop up after I've eaten bread like a day or two before.

527
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,400
 Those are, I don't want a Wachama Colet Bar.

528
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
 I love Wachama Colet Bars.

529
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
 Don't get me wrong.

530
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,240
 I'm not going to sponsor this episode, I'm down.

531
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,800
 The cravings come.

532
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,680
 The cravings when I'm walking down the street and I'm going to decide which route to take

533
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
 home.

534
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,360
 Which one will take me close to Sturga Station so I can buy a Wachama Colet Bar.

535
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
 That's not Jason.

536
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,680
 That's my gut biome dying off because I gave it bread a while back.

537
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,600
 I was eating all those carbs and now it wants more and it knows how much that I love Wachama

538
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
 Colet Bars.

539
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,040
 But do I?

540
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
 So weird.

541
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:52,960
 I find the idea that we are half, we talked about this on yesterday's episode, that we

542
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:01,640
 are half eternal soul and half biological waste factory meat shield that carries us

543
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:08,560
 from one location to another engaging in our most base desires daily.

544
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,440
 Eating food that's not nutritious but just tastes good.

545
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,120
 You know what stupid sitcoms just for background noise as our eyes glaze over or just refreshing

546
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,040
 the same internet page over and over again like a rat pressing a button getting a hit

547
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,200
 of cocaine.

548
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,680
 All this stuff, all this stuff that you can actually, we think that we are this all knowing

549
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,680
 or at least all learning.

550
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,720
 We may not know everything but we're constantly learning this divine spark inside of us but

551
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,080
 somebody can sit down and they can invent an app that 2 out of 10 people who play it

552
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,040
 won't put it down for a month.

553
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,560
 If we were simply the divine spark inside a walking skeleton surrounded by wet-blooding

554
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:04,360
 muscle you would never be able to do that because the divine sparks are limitless and

555
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,800
 they're from the everlasting.

556
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,600
 They existed before stars exploded, right?

557
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,860
 The reason why they're able to create things that are addictive because they're appealing

558
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,160
 to the biological.

559
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,760
 How brains work, how eyes work, how dopamine works.

560
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,040
 How much of us is the meat and how much of us is the soul?

561
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,080
 And then what about all the other life forms on this planet?

562
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:37,640
 Not talking squirrels or coyotes, the parasites, the microbes in our guts, they also have this

563
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,040
 huge pull on us.

564
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,360
 This is something that I've been recently thinking about a lot after I've found this

565
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:53,200
 article and I'm not willing to say that it's 100% true but I'm wondering if there is something

566
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,000
 that people are carrying that is making them not want to reproduce.

567
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,080
 They just have shut down that part of their body.

568
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,720
 People always go "I'm sure you'll want kids one day."

569
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
 No.

570
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,320
 And is that my decision?

571
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,440
 Is that decision Jason's making because I like the life I live?

572
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:20,000
 Or is there something in my body making me think I'm making that decision?

573
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,760
 Making me think I have enough agency that I can choose to override billions of years

574
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,040
 of evolution by sitting here and going "I don't want kids."

575
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,200
 Even though every life form on the planet, that's what they're designed for.

576
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:42,040
 To be born, to eat, to procreate, and die.

577
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,000
 And there's two types of life forms that do not follow that pattern.

578
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:01,760
 Humans and creatures who have parasitic castrators attached to their body.

579
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:15,440
 The other type of life forms are the ones that are not allowed to be born.

580
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:33,720
 That's all for today.

581
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:42,600
 Have a great one guys.

582
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,180
 (upbeat music)
