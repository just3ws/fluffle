1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 A young boy out camping with his friends and family tells them a bizarre story of a past life.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,160
 And then we travel back to the year 1971 and visit a movie theater in San Francisco.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,400
 A man has made a movie and it is premiering tonight. But the movie wasn't made to entertain people.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,320
 It was made to catch a serial killer today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,760
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I just ate a bag of Halloween candy.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,080
 My tummy hurts. I got a little bit of sugar in me. I got a lot of sugar in me. I'm all

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,200
 super bloated now. Anyway I'm just like laying there like pearl from Blade. I'm in just in front

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,240
 of a bank of computers right now. I'm just hitting buttons lazily. And while I'm doing that one of

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,800
 our legacy patreons happens to walk and he's like why is it so dark in here? Why is it so spooky?

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,080
 What happened to you? Alexander Nesticoe. Alexander Nesticoe one of our legacy patreons.

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,680
 He's like can I turn on the light? Yeah yeah just it's blinding. It blinds me.

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,760
 Ugh I feel so bloated. Alexander has the privilege of pushing me around in a wheelbarrow for the

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,800
 rest of this episode. He is going to be our captain, our pilot, and our wheelbarrow pusher this episode.

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,640
 If he can't support the patreon I totally get it. Just help spread the word about the show.

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,000
 That also really helps out a lot. Alexander, whom you got your back brace on? Push me, push me young

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,800
 man into the Dead Rabbit Row vote. Then prepare to row me across the Pacific Ocean. We are headed

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:56,320
 to Russia. I'm just laying there and we're rowing out. We're headed to Volgograd, Russia,

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,600
 and it's the year 1996. And we walk into this maternity ward and there's a little baby in a

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,000
 box. Not a box that's grim. A little baby in like a little crib. You know like they have lines of

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,840
 cribs in maternity ward. You've seen them in movies or maybe you've been in one. We've all

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,840
 been in them actually but we were babies. But maybe you've been in one recently. I don't know.

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,200
 Anyways, the point is that we're in a maternity ward and we see a little baby dude just kind of

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,120
 going me making baby noises. And we look at him and we're like that's an interesting looking kid.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,280
 Like I figured that kid, I figured that kid has something to do with this story obviously because

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,040
 I'm talking about it. And we follow the kid home. This sounds grim but it's not. We follow the kid

27
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,520
 home. His name is Boris Kipri Yovanovich and he's only been alive for two weeks. That's crazy dude.

28
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,320
 A little baby. He's been alive on this planet for 14 days. I mean that happens all the time.

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,520
 So that's not so amazing but it's actually pretty amazing when you look at a baby you're like dude

30
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,960
 you just, you like just came out of a human and now you're like chilling here. Like babies are

31
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,560
 trippy. Babies are super weird. But this whole segment is not about how weird I think babies are

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,840
 because I just find them so bizarre. Little baby people. This baby is weird for other reasons.

33
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,840
 So we're hanging out in this dude's house and we see this little two-year-old Boris and he's

34
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,360
 just sitting there and his head is perfectly stable. Now you're like Jason where are you going with

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,400
 this? My head's perfectly stable. Everyone's head is perfectly stable. And you're right. However,

36
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,640
 not when you're two weeks old. Normally it takes a baby two to four months to be able to develop

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,680
 the neck muscles so it's perfectly stable. But little Boris here, his neck, he's looking around.

38
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,720
 He's scanning the room. And that's weird. That's a whole story. Okay so our next story. I was joking.

39
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,840
 He's this little dude. He can hold up his head. His mom realizes there's something odd about him

40
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,040
 because that's not normal. By the time he was 18 months old he could read and draw. So he's like

41
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,680
 drawing pictures of stuff. They don't say how good of an artist he is. You have sucked. You've

42
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,520
 been terrible at it. They're like oh that's really cool. He can draw. Are you going to hang this up

43
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,560
 in your fridge? No, this is awful. This is horrible. But it's cool that he can draw. Not that he can

44
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,880
 draw well, but he can read. He's reading Dr. Seuss books and stuff like that. But wait, how could

45
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,480
 he talk? Could he talk at 18 months? Is that when babies talk? Anyways, the point is is that I

46
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,040
 guess you're not supposed to be able to read or draw at 18 months. They also notice as he was

47
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,920
 getting older he would know a lot about stars and star systems and constellations even though

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,680
 they never really told him anything about that. He's like me draw you a picture. They're like

49
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
 don't draw us a picture. We know what you're talking about. He's like but I like drawing. They're

50
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,960
 like hiding the crowns from him. He draws these abominations. So when Boris is around the age of

51
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,840
 seven, his family and family friends, they all go camping. They go on this little camping trip.

52
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,080
 Boris is sitting there throwing pine cones into the fire. Everyone's just kind of sitting around

53
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,720
 having a good time. Boris tells this story to the people closest to him. A little seven-year-old boy

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:10,000
 turns to his left with a super strong neck, turns to his right 180 degrees perfectly, and goes now

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,760
 that you have all gathered here, my friends and family, I want to tell you who I really am.

56
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:23,600
 I'm from Mars. Well, I used to be from Mars. He's throwing another pine cone into the fire for

57
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:33,760
 dramatic effect. He tells them this story thousands of years ago. Mars was once populated by an

58
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:43,200
 advanced civilization. Boris is flying a little space car, leaving behind one gilded city for the

59
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,520
 next. The entire planet was beautiful with civilized cities popping up here and there across the

60
00:05:49,520 --> 00:06:00,800
 landscape. Boris was only 14 years old when he was trained in the art of warfare. Boris looks to

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,600
 his left with his alien neck, looks to his right. He's flying with a fleet of Martian jet fighters.

62
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:16,880
 He said that Martians would live to be incredibly old, but they only looked as old as a 35-year-old

63
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,280
 human. The way he's describing it is not like they were great aliens or anything like that.

64
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,920
 They appeared to be humanoid, however they had one big difference between humans and Martians.

65
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,200
 But everything else, he didn't talk so much about alien biology. They're very, very human-like.

66
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,200
 They had these vast cities. They would age to about the age 35, and then they would stop aging,

67
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,360
 but they would live much longer than that. They had mastered the way to stop aging because they

68
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,520
 didn't breathe in as much oxygen as we do. A lot of times their vehicles had a tube inside of them

69
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:59,440
 that you would get in, and it was pure carbon dioxide. You would breathe it in and then expel

70
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,520
 oxygen, or maybe you didn't have any oxygen. Maybe they just loved carbon dioxide so much they just

71
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,880
 went, "Oh!" and they held their breath for the next 500 years. But I don't think they even had much

72
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,160
 oxygen on Mars even back then. They would breathe in primarily carbon dioxide, and that's what kept

73
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,800
 them young and long-lived. He turns to the people next to him at the fire, and he goes, "You see,

74
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,120
 oxygen is poison. That's what actually causes humans on earth to get old and die. It's oxygen."

75
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,480
 On Mars, we didn't have that problem. He said that the Martian race had actually mastered

76
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,760
 interstellar travel. They used portals to go through these things. However, they had two

77
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,480
 types of vehicles they could also use to fly around. One was the flying saucer. That was used to

78
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:53,280
 travel from planet to planet and from star system to star system. But the triangle UFOs people see,

79
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,680
 those are scout ships, small distance ships, Mars to the moon, moon to earth, things like that.

80
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,200
 You never see a triangle in deep space. But he wasn't really skilled in either of those things.

81
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,240
 He was trained as a jet fighter, as a Martian fighter pilot.

82
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:22,640
 He's still flying over the vast landscape of Mars with a battalion headed towards an unknown target.

83
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,520
 He said that even though they appeared to be human, the one trait that they had different

84
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,160
 were that their fingers were incredibly long. They had actually evolved to be able to use their

85
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:40,080
 spacecraft more efficiently. Now, let me pause the story for a second. That's not how that works,

86
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,280
 right? Generally, you would build a vehicle. We don't build space shuttles and be like,

87
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,080
 "Hope you're an octopus, dude." They're like, "What?" They're like, "Yeah, you wouldn't be able to pilot

88
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,880
 the shuttle way better if you were an octopus." "But I'm not an octopus." "Yeah, but if you were,

89
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,840
 maybe you'll evolve at some point while you're flying the space shuttle. Maybe that'll work."

90
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,520
 But whatever. Whatever. I mean, he's already reincarnated from Mars. I thought that was out of

91
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,200
 everything the most unbelievable part of the story. But anyways, they were normally humanoid people.

92
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,640
 They just had really long fingers. Pushing all these buttons and stuff like that. They were able

93
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,640
 to do that. They could have just built one with no buttons, voice command, but they did it because

94
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,440
 they're Martians. So why is this advanced society that has mastered interstellar travel that is

95
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,000
 far older than anything on Earth? All of this would have happened when I said thousands of ago.

96
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,960
 I'm talking like 10,000 years ago, long before humanity was even thinking that there were other

97
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:47,280
 planets out there. They just saw twinkling lights. The jet fighter battalion is flying through ridge.

98
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:56,000
 It crests the mountaintop and sees their rival country in their crosshairs. Boris, 14-year-old

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,560
 Martian, flips on his weapon systems and opens fire on the city. People are running up. All the

100
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,360
 babies are holding their neck up looking. These ships are flying over the city. They're coming

101
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,520
 back for another run. Martian alarms go off. They sound just like Earth alarms, but they're

102
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:22,480
 backwards. There's a bunch of wolves running around too. That city's Martian fighters are

103
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,320
 getting up in their ships. They're getting blown up while they're even trying to take off their

104
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,520
 runway. Extra long fingers just flying all over the place from people getting blown up.

105
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:39,680
 Boris and his battalion struck a devastating blow into their rivals territory. They head back

106
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,440
 for victorious celebration. But all wars have to come to an end. They either end with peace treaties

107
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:55,600
 or the fact that there's no life visible on Mars today. It ended like this. The rival city states

108
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:04,080
 of Mars had amassed their own nuclear weapons. And Boris, all of his friends, all of his family,

109
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:12,560
 all of his countrymen died in the nuclear holocaust before we even fashioned the first spear here on

110
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:20,560
 Earth. Boris is sitting around the campfire poking at it with a stick. He tells this story to his

111
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,360
 friends and family. I find this very fascinating because on the one hand we've talked about people

112
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
 who say they reincarnated. I always talk about that guy who said he's from Atlantis and things like

113
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,400
 that. This is an interesting story because he tells this to his friends and family. He's not

114
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:43,280
 telling it to a reporter. He's telling it to people he trusts. And people laugh at him at the campfire.

115
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,040
 He's a seven-year-old boy telling the story of this great Martian war. He's also telling this story

116
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,800
 in 2003. So talking about triangles and saucers, obviously those UFOs have been seen for decades.

117
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,840
 And by 2003 the Iron Curtain had fallen and we started to get a lot of UFO reports coming out of

118
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,600
 the Eastern Europe and they started getting our reports as well. But for a seven-year-old to

119
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,560
 know that stuff, it's not impossible. Now there also is a thing we have to look at of retconning,

120
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,720
 is that someone could easily tell the story today and say, "I was seven years old when that first

121
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,240
 happened." So it could be completely made up. It could 100% be completely made up. But

122
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,040
 continuing with the narrative, he tells this story to his friends and family. People are kind

123
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,840
 of chuckling at it. They don't really believe him. It is unbelievable. And that should have been the

124
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,240
 end of it. But what happened was when they go, when the vacation's over and they go back to town,

125
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,240
 people start making fun of him in town. The friends and the family who probably should have just kept

126
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,720
 it to themselves, they thought it was kind of wacky. It's not like they went back to town and go,

127
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,200
 "Hey, this kid told us this weird story. They were actively making fun of this kid

128
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,960
 for weaving such a bizarre story." And so for a while, he didn't want that mockery. Nowadays,

129
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,640
 like there are photos of him. He was born in 1996. So what would that make him right now?

130
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,760
 That'd make him only about 24 years old. So still, that's right. That's not,

131
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,480
 math is right, right? I'm not from Mars. I'm not really good at math. But

132
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,280
 he's only about 24 years old. Now again, he could be retconning it. He could obviously have come

133
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,640
 up with the story two years ago and built this whole backstory. But I think it's an interesting

134
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,000
 setup. We take the narrative at face value where he wasn't out to get any publicity. He was just

135
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,040
 kind of felt comfortable to share this story. That's not even the end of it. There's a couple

136
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,600
 key interesting factors here. One, he said that there's a way for us to avoid the same fate as

137
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,680
 the Martians. He said that the Sphinx, I know this is where it starts to get kind of goofy again,

138
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,960
 right? That story in and of itself, the reincarnated Martian story, I find fascinating. But then he

139
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,640
 says, the Sphinx has some sort of super secret tech in it. And there's a lever behind one of its ears.

140
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,320
 He doesn't, and this is where it starts to get interesting again, right? You kind of lost me

141
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,720
 when you introduced the Egyptian mythological part because that's so tropish. That's so generic. But

142
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,960
 anyways, he said that behind one of the Sphinx ears, there's a lever or a mechanism that if you press

143
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:19,120
 it, this thing will open up and it will help us from destroying ourselves. And he also said the

144
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,280
 Great Pyramid of Giza has something in it as well that will help us, but he doesn't know how to get

145
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,320
 that one. So the question you would ask, and the question people have asked them, so what's in the

146
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,080
 Sphinx, bro? Like, you know how to access it. What's in there? And he goes, I don't know. I just know

147
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,040
 like there's a button behind its ear or something like that. I'm like, what? So wait, you know there's

148
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,160
 a button there, but you don't know what's in it. He's like, no, I don't know what's in it. I just know

149
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,880
 that there's something to do with it. And they go, okay, what's in the Great Pyramid of Giza? He's

150
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,720
 like, I don't know. I have no idea. Now this is interesting because I've used this before as well,

151
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,640
 and it could be a crutch. I'm not for sure, but if you're making it up, the answer would be simply

152
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,960
 easy to make up. I actually have more respect for people who go, so you're reincarnated from

153
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,600
 Atlantis. What was the monetary system like there? Do you remember that? And that guy who says he's

154
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,040
 half Atlantean or from Atlantis or whatever, if he went, uh, I don't remember. I don't remember

155
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,960
 ever spending money. I was a really young kid. Like, do you remember how money worked when you were

156
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,920
 seven? If you died when you were seven, that got dark quick. And someone from the future asked you,

157
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,720
 how was money in the 21st century? You'd be like, what? I was seven. But there's always an answer.

158
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,840
 Oh no, monetary, there was no money. Everything was perfect. Everything was super good. And you

159
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,840
 just got up and like seashells fell into your lap and you ate seashells and everything was built

160
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,160
 out of seashells and da-da-da-da. When people are making it up, they have an answer for everything.

161
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,080
 If you took someone, if you took someone who was seven years old, or he was 14 when all this,

162
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,880
 when he died in Mars, but if you took someone who was 14 years old now and teleported him 10,000

163
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,920
 years in the future, and they asked him, hey, so who won the election? He's like, there was an election?

164
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,440
 What are you talking about? I don't even know what you're talking about. I'm seven years old. Ask me

165
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,320
 about Fortnite. They're like, what? What's Fortnite? So you would be limited to the information you'd

166
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,400
 have access to. I think it's more interesting when people who weave these tales say, I don't know.

167
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,760
 I don't have an answer to that question. But there's also two other interesting things coming

168
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,360
 from this. This is going a lot longer than I thought it was going to go, but one, he says that

169
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,440
 he's a reincarnated alien. So that opens up a whole host of things, because you almost want to think

170
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,720
 like reincarnation, if it exists, is a localized phenomenon. Like I may die and become a grass

171
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,720
 hopper and then become a cow and then become like a lily pad. But it's weird to think that I may die

172
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,720
 and become a cow on some alien planet a billion miles away. Or you die and then you're reincarnated

173
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,520
 as an amoeba on a meteorite floating around in the middle of nowhere. It's weird to think of

174
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,840
 reincarnation past the bounds of Earth. So that even opens up a can of worms. Like is reincarnation

175
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:08,480
 geographically based? Is Mars close enough that if you died on Mars you'd get reincarnated on Earth?

176
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,880
 There's a whole bunch of interesting questions there. But then oxygen is poison. Now again,

177
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,040
 he's seven years old. If we take the story of face value and he told his story when he was seven

178
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,200
 years old, oxygen is poison is actually on the conspiracy theory iceberg. It's been around for

179
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,600
 a while that people believe oxygen actually kills you. Alexander, grab that wheelbarrow and then

180
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,080
 call in that carbonicopter. You're gonna push me onto that carbonicopter, come heller high water.

181
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:44,960
 I am now on board. We are headed out to the underground. Helicopter's flying. Alexander,

182
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,920
 I'm taking up the whole thing. Everyone's pressed up against the window. Alexander though is able

183
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,680
 to fly us away from Mars and he sees this cave in the middle of a mountainside back on Earth.

184
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:03,120
 Helicopter's flying through this cave system. We land in the middle of this cave and we see

185
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,000
 a bunch of people walking around. A bunch of young, healthy, fit people. And then there's us.

186
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,040
 And then there's us. The world's most sugary man pushed inside of a carbonicopter. Roll me out like

187
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,680
 Violet from Willy Wonka. And then the rest of you just get off with free will and legs that work.

188
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,160
 Everyone jumps back off the carbonicopter and we're looking at all these people. They're super

189
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,720
 fit. The dudes are wearing tank tops and shorts and the girls are wearing tank tops and shorts.

190
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,280
 It's a beautiful society. Everyone's super healthy. And then one of these people walk up to us and

191
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,640
 they just they're beautiful and they go, "Whoa, what are you guys doing here? You guys look like

192
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,320
 a bunch of circus freaks as opposed to us. Look how great we look." And I'm like, "Hey,

193
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,080
 don't talk to my buddies like that." Secondly, how do you look so good? And they go, "The secret is..."

194
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:01,200
 And then we realize it's probably been about, I don't know, 45 seconds a minute. And there's no

195
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,560
 oxygen in this cave. Yet somehow we're able to survive. We are in the headquarters of

196
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:16,880
 undergroundwellness.com. And they are one of the supporters of the belief that oxygen is poison.

197
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,120
 It's on the conspiracy theory iceberg. We'll save this Zodiac Killer story for tomorrow because I

198
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,360
 want to spend some time on this. I didn't know that last segment was going to run so long. So if

199
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,920
 you're a huge fan of the Zodiac Killer, shame on you because he's a lame serial killer. They're all

200
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:36,000
 lame. But he's one of the lamest. We'll get into that tomorrow. But let us breathe in this pure

201
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:47,200
 carbon dioxide and we feel ourselves getting stronger. We feel our bodies becoming healthier.

202
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,240
 Our vision clears up. And then all of a sudden we're standing there and overclosure gone now.

203
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,960
 We're wearing shorts and tank tops. We're like, "What? This is weird." Oxygen is poison. Goes like this.

204
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,680
 95% of the oxygen we breathe in goes to the mitochondria. That's the powerhouse of the cell.

205
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:12,240
 So you've got a little cell inside you and inside the cell is the mitochondria. So when you breathe

206
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:25,200
 in, you're fueling the mitochondria in your body. But only 95% of the oxygen you breathe

207
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,600
 actually goes to fuel the mitochondria. The other 5% becomes this thing known as free radicals.

208
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,160
 There are little dudes inside your body, little mohawks, little pierce steers and they're walking

209
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,000
 around and they've got little bats and they're beating up the apple stands in your body. They

210
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,080
 float around in your liver. They're like, "Hey, nice liver here. It would be horrible if I started

211
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,640
 bashing stuff up." And they're like, "No, please. It's the purple dragon gang. They're back." And

212
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,400
 they're kicking over stuff in your liver. 5% of all the oxygen you breathe and you breathe a lot of it

213
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,200
 becomes free radicals and they just float around in your body and they start beating you up from

214
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,240
 the inside. The free radical, again, I'm not saying, this is the last time I'm going to say this,

215
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,680
 but everything from here forward, I don't believe is true. So the free radicals in this theory,

216
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,360
 they're walking around, they're pushing over old ladies inside your body, and that's what causes

217
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:26,160
 parts of your body to go haywire. It gums up your system, damages your DNA and can be one of the

218
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,960
 causes of cancer. It can actually also burn through your membranes to cause Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,

219
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,800
 Lou Gehrig's disease, stuff like that. So this is what the underground wellness

220
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:44,800
 oxygen is poison conspiracy people believe, that 5% of all the oxygen you breathe is actually doing

221
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,640
 damage to you. They also say, one of their theories is this, one of their theories is this, when someone

222
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,840
 is completely deprived of oxygen, let's say you're completely deprived of oxygen, whatever scenario

223
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,320
 it takes, your body's there, your head's not chopped off or anything like that, but you've suffocated,

224
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,200
 you have no oxygen in you. What they do is they take you to the hospital and they give you oxygen

225
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,760
 and brings you back to life. Now generally, if you've been without oxygen for three minutes,

226
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,360
 it starts to cause brain damage and you can become brain dead. Everything else is fine,

227
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,760
 but your brain is dead. People who believe oxygen is poison believes that brain death is caused by

228
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,200
 giving you oxygen. So if you have no oxygen and you're turning blue, instead of putting a mask

229
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:33,120
 on somebody and spraying a bunch of oxygen in their face, you need to slowly, slowly give them

230
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,280
 a little bit of oxygen. And they said, if you slowly raise the oxygen level, they'll turn out fine.

231
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,360
 So you could be three to four minutes with no oxygen and super blue and stuff, and then you give them

232
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,680
 a little bit of oxygen, give them a little bit of sweet sweet oxygen, you'll be fine. They also say

233
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,680
 that breathing can make it harder for you to breathe. This is an interesting one. Oxygen makes it

234
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,480
 harder for you to breathe. I remember looking at that and I was like, what? When you have COPD,

235
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,400
 what happens is the membranes, little bubbles inside your lungs, they fill up with air and then

236
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,040
 they deflate and that helps filter out air and it just kind of helps you breathe in general.

237
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,720
 COPD is where the sacs in your lungs, they're a little tiny bubble sacs in your lungs

238
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,880
 start to get distorted, they start to get big and puffy. It's like a balloon. If you blow a balloon

239
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,600
 up and then you open the little hole nozzle thingy, all the air will rush out. But you know how if you

240
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,040
 take a bigger balloon and you blow it up and you let it out, the bag will hang and there'll still be

241
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:41,280
 some air in the bottom of the balloon. Does that make sense? Like if you have a little balloon,

242
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,480
 it'll all immediately go out, but the bigger the balloon, you blow it up, it'll sag down

243
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,800
 like clam chowder in a paper bag and there will still be some left. That's what COPD is.

244
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,800
 Your little sacs in your lungs don't completely deflate anymore. They're bigger and so only some

245
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:06,160
 of the air comes out. If you get enough of those semi-inflated bags in your lungs that are technically

246
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,600
 still full of oxygen, it makes it harder for you to breathe. There's less lung capacity in there

247
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:20,800
 because more of it's taken up by all of these little bags. Yes, you can make the claim oxygen

248
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:27,040
 makes it harder for you to breathe, but you see all those steps in the middle there? Oxygen itself

249
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:34,400
 does not cause the sacs to expand and distort and get grody and not work. That's not oxygen doing

250
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:41,040
 that. Those are other things going on in your body because otherwise then everyone would have COPD.

251
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,120
 But it's not. So you can make the claim oxygen makes it harder for you to breathe, oxygen causes

252
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,920
 cancer, but that's you're missing so many steps in the middle. It's the same thing as saying walking

253
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:01,520
 causes you to fall off cliffs. Yes, I would say probably 99% of all the people falling off cliffs

254
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:08,640
 were walking at some point and they fell off the cliff, but then you can't say well walking kills

255
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,120
 you because most people who die were walking at some point right before they died. That's the same

256
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,960
 logic there. Watch now there'll be a conspiracy theory about everybody who walks. It's the same,

257
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,320
 it's the exact same thing. Doing A causes X, but there's so many steps missing there, but there's

258
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,480
 a huge group of people who believe this. Now we're in the underground caves because when I read that

259
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,680
 this was on a website called undergroundwellness.com it's just one website. There's tons of people who

260
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,400
 believe this. I imagine I was like oh dude these people believe this so much they're actually

261
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,960
 hiding underground in giant oxygen depleted cities. No, it meant underground wellness like

262
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,120
 these are the medical tips. Your doctor doesn't want you to know. You're that doctor, he just

263
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,280
 wants you to become brain dead and blue. He's a big fan of the Smurfs. He's a big fan of Eiffel

264
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,800
 65. He wants you to get blue bro, but here at underground wellness we teach you the stuff

265
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:13,600
 that they don't want you to know. Like oxygen kills you. Another weird thing they always say,

266
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,680
 because I read a couple sites on this, they always make a statement similar to this.

267
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,840
 How does oxygen kill? The same way metal rusts and a half eating apple turns brown

268
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:32,160
 by a process termed oxidation or oxidative stress. Yes, oxygen turns steel brown,

269
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:42,000
 steel can survive 1400 degrees Fahrenheit, I'm not steel. And I understand like there are things

270
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,680
 steel can do that I can't and there are things that I can do that steel can't and I can do a

271
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,440
 way a lot more than a half eating apple. I understand in the mind they're thinking whoa

272
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,520
 if oxygen can destroy something as hard as steel, imagine what it could do to me because I'm soft

273
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:07,520
 and fleshy. That's not the way that it works. It's observational science, but it's based on

274
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:17,360
 a bad observation. It's a bizarre comparison between the two. But this theory is very popular.

275
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,600
 It's one of those things like sun gazing. I will say this, these people don't

276
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,960
 seem to be saying well that's it, no oxygen for me. This is a weird one because there's no

277
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,920
 fix for it. People who believe in sun gazing are like yeah you look at the sun for like

278
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,760
 what was it like 10 seconds the first week and then 15 seconds then don't do that by the way,

279
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,040
 but they have this thing. It's supposed to open your third eye and all that stuff. Ormus where

280
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,560
 you like pee in a cup and you separate the gold out of your urine. I covered that one a long time ago.

281
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,400
 You drink it for health benefits. Like you're not healthy, but if you drink the ormus that'll

282
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:00,160
 make you healthy. There's no fix to this oxygen thing. I guess you could probably hang out in a

283
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:07,360
 chamber like a Michael Jackson S. Khyperbaric chamber that might help you, but there's really

284
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,880
 no fix for this one. It's like telling someone you're going to die from breathing and then people

285
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,040
 go what can I do to stop that and they're like well you stop breathing but that's just going to kill

286
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,000
 you quicker. This is a weird one because they're telling you something's going on, but as far as

287
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,960
 I could tell there's no long-term fix for it. I think it's just limit your oxygen exposure.

288
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,760
 This sounds fake, right? This sounds like something someone made up in 1952 was a joke. The world's

289
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,320
 first troll. The world's first. I'm going to make up a conspiracy theory and see how many people can

290
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,000
 buy it. So he makes up the idea that oxygen is poison, but people still talk about it today.

291
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:53,120
 But what is so weird about this whole combination of things is I've heard oxygen is poison for the

292
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,160
 longest time. It's actually not hard to research. I didn't cover it on the conspiracy theory iceberg

293
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,800
 because it wasn't obscure at all. I'd been hearing it in and out of the conspiracy theory

294
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:08,720
 circles for a long time, but I researched this stuff and I researched this stuff for fun.

295
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,960
 How in the world did a 7-year-old boy in Russia know about this conspiracy theory? It's not impossible

296
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,360
 that in 2003 when this kid told this story, it's not impossible that he'd come across us at some

297
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:31,680
 point, but it's so it's such a bizarre detail in his story of Martian colonies and it's almost a

298
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:41,040
 throwaway line. It's not even integral to the plot of the story. I was born on Mars, there was this

299
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,720
 great Martian war. We want, I forgot to, one of the things was like we're here. Some of the Martians

300
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,080
 have been reincarnated on Earth to prevent Earth from having a nuclear holocaust. We're here to

301
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,760
 help change the world and stuff like that. So you have this narrative thread and then just in the

302
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,800
 middle of it, oh by the way oxygen's poison, that's how we are able to live so long. We would limit

303
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,440
 our oxygen as much as possible and we actually, when we were traveling long distances, we'd be in

304
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,240
 only carbon dioxide environments. It's weird that this boy crafting this story throws in an element

305
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,960
 from a hippy-dippy underground wellness conspiracy theory. They didn't invent the conspiracy theory,

306
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:28,560
 but it's in that holistic realm. Oxygen is poison. That this boy in Russia telling the story

307
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:34,960
 plucks that detail out of the ether and puts it in to explain why Martians live so long. Now I

308
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,880
 don't think oxygen is poisonous. I do think, I don't want to be controversial or anything,

309
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,840
 but I do think oxygen is required for a life on this planet. Please, please don't unsubscribe. I

310
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,480
 know it's going to piss a lot of people off, but I do believe that you need to breathe in oxygen

311
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,760
 and expel carbon dioxide to live, but there are a lot of people who would disagree with me on that

312
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,920
 or would disagree with me at least on how much oxygen we actually need. And that's fine, we can

313
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,600
 have those disagreements. We can have those disagreements until you're blue in the face,

314
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:15,280
 but all that aside, I find it so fascinating that it's also a part of this boy's Martian story.

315
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,360
 I guess we will actually know the truth someday on this one. Just buy a couple tickets,

316
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,920
 fly out to Egypt, get an incredibly long ladder, and start digging around on the Sphinx's ear.

317
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:35,200
 According to Boris, what's in that Sphinx will save the world. Now he believed that he was one of

318
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,480
 the people who would usher in a new age, but who knows? That person may be you if you find that

319
00:31:42,480 --> 00:32:03,920
 switch behind the Sphinx's ear.

320
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:17,360
 Bye guys!
