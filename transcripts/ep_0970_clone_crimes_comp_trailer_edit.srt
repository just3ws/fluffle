1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 Today's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio contains content that is highly disturbing.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,840
 Listener discretion is advised.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,640
 A horrific ghost story forces us to ask the question, "Is it possible that the spirits

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,120
 of the damned are left to walk the earth until justice is finally served?"

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,200
 And then we travel to Fresno, California to take a look at a terrifying and brutal story

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,720
 about a man who believed that he was a clone.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:42,000
 He was so lost in the world of conspiracy theories that he ended up doing the unthinkable.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,760
 It's a couple more days till Halloween and it's a couple more days until I don't do

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,280
 a ghost story every single day.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,040
 I... this has gone on way too long.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,960
 I'm surprised I was even able to do it this long.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,280
 And yet here we are, a ghost story every single day.

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
 I'm never doing this again.

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,680
 I'm never doing this again.

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,480
 I miss my alien bros.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
 I miss my big foots.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,600
 We've been doing a lot of ghost stuff and I love the ghost stuff we've been doing.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,760
 But I think Dead Rabbit Radio needs to keep mixing stuff up and someone who's always helping

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,320
 me mix it up walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy patreons.

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,440
 Everyone give it up for Ultrasound 700.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
 Woohoo!

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
 Yeah!

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
 Come on in buddy.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
 Come on in with your mixer.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,440
 I guess that's what you're known for.

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,080
 Blend them stuff up.

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,000
 Ultrasound 700 you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,720
 If you guys can't support the Patreon I totally understand.

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,680
 If you guys have supported the Patreon for a long time, you're not able to continue to

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
 do it in the future.

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,040
 I get it too man.

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,320
 People's money situation changes.

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,560
 But can't support the Patreon just spread the word about the show.

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,600
 That really, really really helps out a lot.

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,440
 Now Ultrasound 700 let's go ahead and tashi the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,200
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,800
 Drive us all the way out to High Lea, Florida.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
 We're in High Lea, Florida.

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,040
 Specifically I want you to drive us on out to High Lea Senior High School in Florida.

45
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,760
 So let's put on our Letterman's Jackets.

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,080
 We're going to walk on to High Lea Senior High School grounds.

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,720
 We're magically once again teenagers.

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,960
 The year is 1999.

49
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,520
 We're here to check out a haunted bathroom.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,120
 There's so many of these things.

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,800
 And you could go Jason you've covered so many haunted bathrooms just in the past two weeks.

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,360
 How could this one be any different?

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,160
 Well it's slightly different.

54
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
 It's slightly different.

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,280
 You're like Jason we've established through the course of what 970 episodes you have some

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,360
 super bizarre fetishes.

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,840
 And you have this fascination with public restrooms.

58
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,360
 You have this fascination with restrooms.

59
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,680
 You're always talking about public restrooms.

60
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,640
 They're scary just by default.

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
 You can listen to the past episodes.

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,280
 I think they're spooky.

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
 I'll be honest with you guys.

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,800
 I'm not typing in bathroom ghosts.

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,000
 Okay that one time last week I did.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,640
 I typed in bathroom ghosts and I found like the five creepiest public restrooms in England.

67
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,320
 That was an episode we did earlier this week.

68
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,480
 There was only one I covered.

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,680
 But there was four more.

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,720
 That weren't good enough for a dead rabbit radio.

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,520
 See even though I keep covering bathroom ghosts I try to find the best of the best.

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,760
 It's just not any old bathroom for me.

73
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,000
 I want to find terrifying ghosts in bathrooms.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,880
 I'm not even looking for them in bathrooms.

75
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,160
 I just happen to find ghosts in bathrooms all the time.

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,640
 Okay there was at one time I googled public bathrooms.

77
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
 Haunted public bathrooms.

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,840
 But not this time.

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
 We're in Hylia, Florida.

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,200
 The year is 1999.

81
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,280
 And the story goes like this.

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,280
 One day during school it was third period.

83
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,200
 And a freshman girl goes to the restroom that is next to the auditorium.

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,800
 She goes in the girls restroom at the auditorium.

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,280
 And she is followed into the restroom by a group of five boys.

86
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,120
 They assault her.

87
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,800
 These five boys assault this young woman in the bathroom.

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,120
 And they beat her so badly.

89
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,520
 She is seriously bleeding by the time they're done with their assault.

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,560
 And the boys just leave her like that.

91
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,320
 After the assault is finished and she's heavily bleeding they leave.

92
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,480
 So it's not until after school.

93
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,920
 A couple hours later when the janitor is doing his rounds, making sure that all the bathrooms

94
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,240
 are clean and everything like that.

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,600
 He goes into the girls restroom next to the auditorium.

96
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,320
 She's dead.

97
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,640
 She bled to death.

98
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,440
 They say to this day when you go into the girls restroom next to the auditorium at Hylia

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:17,240
 senior high school that you may catch a glimpse of this girl or the ghost of her anyways.

100
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,280
 Sitting in the corner of the bathroom.

101
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,040
 Sitting in a puddle of her own blood.

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,840
 She's sitting down her knees drawn close to her body.

103
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,040
 Her arms wrapped around her legs.

104
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,280
 And she's rocking back and forth.

105
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,240
 Rocking back and forth in this puddle of blood.

106
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,960
 Slowly saying.

107
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,440
 When will they die?

108
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,200
 When will they die?

109
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:58,840
 When will they die?

110
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,360
 There's other reports in this restroom.

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,560
 We have that visual of the haunting right?

112
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,360
 We have the visual of that ghost.

113
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,640
 There are other reports of this restroom that there are also noises in the restroom.

114
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,960
 When you walk in the restroom sometimes you'll hear something.

115
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,080
 It's not a fart.

116
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,200
 It's not the toilet flushing.

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,080
 It's a noise you wouldn't expect to hear in a bathroom.

118
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
 They didn't specify what it was.

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,080
 They didn't say it was a loud scream or anything like that.

120
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,320
 They just said when you're in that restroom sometimes you'll just hear noises.

121
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,880
 And you even see reports.

122
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,920
 The boys restroom, you know, shares a wall with the girls restroom.

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,280
 That's pretty common in public restroom areas.

124
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,160
 The police have also said, "Well, you know, we're not in the girls restroom, but when

125
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,320
 we're in the boys restroom we can hear noises coming from the other side of the wall."

126
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,280
 What's interesting is a lot of these reports on honderplaces.org where they allow people

127
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,320
 to review a haunted spot, they'll say when you see reports about coming from the boys

128
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,040
 room about what might be going on in the girls room, they'll say, "I hear noises coming

129
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,360
 from the other side of the wall, but it's probably the pipes."

130
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
 I actually heard that a lot.

131
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,720
 A lot of people were self skeptics.

132
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,840
 They'd hear these noises, but they'd go, "Maybe it was the pipes, maybe it was something

133
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
 else."

134
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,760
 But we also have visual sightings of this ghost.

135
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,200
 This is one of these stories that again I hope isn't true, right?

136
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,480
 I hope it's an urban legend because nobody should be assaulted really anywhere, but I

137
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
 mean it's just a horrifying story.

138
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
 She's assaulted in the restroom.

139
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
 No one's there to find her.

140
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
 She dies.

141
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,680
 Her spirit is trapped there until the five young men who killed her die.

142
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,760
 Like her soul is being held in this place until justice is served.

143
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,400
 But when I try to look up any history of this place, did a girl actually get assaulted in

144
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
 this bath?

145
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,640
 There was no record of this crime.

146
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
 This is a crime that's so brutal.

147
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,360
 We would see news articles about.

148
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,840
 Now again it happened in 1999 and sometimes it's hard to find archives from back then,

149
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
 but still that's such a brutal crime.

150
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,880
 There's no, and so let's look at it this way.

151
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,680
 There was no story that I could find in the media about this.

152
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,040
 You think we would have found something?

153
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,920
 Then you have to ask yourself, how do we know there were five perpetrators to this?

154
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,080
 Because did one of the boys talk?

155
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
 There's no record of this.

156
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,400
 So I would ask the question like, who were the five boys?

157
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,360
 How did we know there was five boys?

158
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,400
 Is there any record of these kids being adjudicated in the judicial system?

159
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,800
 We don't have records of any of that.

160
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,000
 Also I saw a lot of references.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,600
 I wasn't able to verify this either, but a lot of people reference this as bathroom.

162
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,720
 They said on the bathroom itself, the bathroom number is 666, which that doesn't make any

163
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
 sense at all.

164
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,440
 I mean, maybe it is actually 666, but does that mean there's another 665 bathrooms out

165
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
 there?

166
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
 Is this in building six?

167
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,400
 Is this the 66th bathroom?

168
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 Is it in building 66?

169
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
 And it's the sixth bathroom.

170
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:03,400
 I find it odd that any school would have a classroom or bathroom or even a broom closet

171
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,600
 with a number 666 because you're kind of inviting this kind of urban legend.

172
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,120
 But it's a terrifying story.

173
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,400
 Like again, we always have to look at this in two different ways.

174
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,400
 Is the ghost story real and is the crime that supposedly started the haunting real?

175
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,920
 It's possible that the ghost Israel and the crime has been made up.

176
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,440
 It's possible if you go into this restroom, you may see this specter in a puddle of her

177
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,920
 own blood wondering when will they die, when will they die, when will they die.

178
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
 Or it's possible the whole thing is made up, right?

179
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
 That it's just an urban legend around the school.

180
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
 We don't know.

181
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
 Unless we have on the ground investigations, we don't know.

182
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,760
 Didn't I tell you guys, didn't I ask you guys recently to start local ghost hunting

183
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
 groups?

184
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
 That would be awesome.

185
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,160
 You'd be doing me a big favor.

186
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
 And you guys would be meeting a good group of friends.

187
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,600
 And now I'm going to specify this, if you're in Halea area, you definitely should start

188
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,400
 a local ghost hunting group.

189
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,240
 Although now that I think about it, you still have to give permission to go on a campus.

190
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,280
 This is a terrifying ghost story.

191
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,880
 Not only is it a horrifying visual, a ghost in a puddle of their own blood.

192
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,280
 We don't often see that.

193
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,280
 Then most ghosts are caused by death obviously.

194
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,640
 And then some of them are the form of their death.

195
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,600
 Yesterday the kid was walking around with a funnel who got burned alive.

196
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,440
 Today we have this girl in a puddle of her own blood.

197
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,200
 But then there's a lot of ghosts just kind of walking around.

198
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,400
 They jumped off cliffs or they got hit by trains, shot themselves in the face with a pistol.

199
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
 And then they're fine.

200
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
 They're just kind of chilling.

201
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,280
 They're not all blooding and stuff like that.

202
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:42,600
 So I don't understand why some ghosts have this horror element to it and some don't.

203
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,880
 But this again, as far as a bathroom goes, as far as a bathroom goes, I rate this five

204
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,840
 toilets out of five.

205
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,040
 This would be terrifying to see.

206
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,720
 To see a girl, because the suffering's still there.

207
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,880
 I think that's the one thing we all hope that no matter what happens after you die, whether

208
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,400
 you go to paradise or you're a ghost walking around, or even if you just disappear, right?

209
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,880
 If your soul just obliterates itself.

210
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,440
 That there's some sense of peace in the afterlife.

211
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,080
 Whenever we encounter ghosts that are still being tortured by something they did or something

212
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,160
 someone did to them in life, that's always the creepier element to it.

213
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,800
 If all ghosts were friendly, it might make for a boring podcast, but it would sure be

214
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 uplifting.

215
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,600
 You want to be so scared of dying, right?

216
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,000
 But every show, often we come across these ghosts, which again could be an urban legend.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,480
 But these type of ghosts, we do have stories of ghosts in these gory situations.

218
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,440
 And then again, the fact that she's wondering, when will they die?

219
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
 When will they die?

220
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,600
 Is she trapped here until they die?

221
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
 Until they pass away?

222
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,480
 Did she, as the assault was going on, was she wishing so much that they would just die

223
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,560
 that that's the psychic mark she left?

224
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
 Right?

225
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,680
 Is that wish?

226
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,560
 And you know, again, it's not like I hope they surface justice.

227
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,680
 I hope they get caught and are put in prison for the rest of their lives.

228
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,000
 It almost seems like she's trapped here until these five young men die.

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
 But who knows?

230
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,720
 And that would be a horrible thing as well, because then they're all like the healthiest

231
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 men alive.

232
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
 They're like, "Oh, what?

233
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,560
 We're going to upload our consciousnesses into this computer.

234
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
 We'll never die."

235
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,520
 And she's like, "No."

236
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,800
 Like it's such a weird request.

237
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 It's creepy.

238
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
 It's terrifying.

239
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,720
 Five out of five out of five toilets from Dead Rabbit Radio.

240
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,320
 A creepy ghost story in one of the creepiest places around.

241
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,800
 Ultrasound 700, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter we are leaving

242
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,240
 behind Dead Rabbit Command.

243
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,960
 Fly us all the way out to Fresno, California.

244
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:52,080
 While we're headed out there, I want to do a really quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

245
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,640
 Now, I talk a lot about the movies I watch on this podcast, because I love movies.

246
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,200
 I talked a lot about the movie Smile.

247
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
 I went to go see it.

248
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
 I really liked it.

249
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,080
 Was it a Dead Rabbit Recommends?

250
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
 No.

251
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,840
 But I try to save Dead Rabbit Recommends for those truly unique, like you have to watch

252
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
 this movie.

253
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
 Smile.

254
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,840
 I really liked it.

255
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,840
 Had some really cool psychotropic hallucinatory stuff in it.

256
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,340
 Is enjoyable.

257
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,440
 But is it a Dead Rabbit Recommends?

258
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
 No.

259
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,320
 Top Gun Maverick.

260
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,400
 Top Gun Maverick was probably my favorite movie that I've seen this year.

261
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
 Loved it.

262
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 Saw it twice at the theater.

263
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
 Is it a Dead Rabbit Recommends?

264
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
 No.

265
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,920
 Love it though.

266
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
 Really enjoy it.

267
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,000
 I think you should go see Top Gun.

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
 I think you should go see Smile.

269
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,960
 I saved Dead Rabbit Recommends for those truly unique movies and I want to share a movie with

270
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:48,200
 you that against all odds, it should have been absolutely terrible.

271
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,320
 It should have been awful.

272
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
 But it's not.

273
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
 It's amazing.

274
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,440
 It's called He's Watching.

275
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
 He's Watching.

276
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:07,600
 It is a movie filmed during the pandemic, starring the children of the director and it's found

277
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,400
 footage.

278
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,200
 All three of those should have collided into an unwatchable car wreck.

279
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,720
 But He's Watching is fantastic.

280
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:30,720
 The whole movie is a teenage sister and her preteen brother in a house during a worldwide

281
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,280
 pandemic.

282
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,520
 Their parents are in the hospital.

283
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,960
 Their neighbors are masked up with doors locked.

284
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,160
 There's a man walking from door to door in full hazmat gear holding up a sign "Do not

285
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,640
 leave your house for any reason."

286
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,680
 He holds that outside your window and then he goes to the next door and you see him holding

287
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
 that outside the window.

288
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,000
 So these two young kids are in their house.

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,920
 Their parents are at the hospital.

290
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,480
 And then they discover that not only are they alone in the face of this worldwide pandemic

291
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
 that's killing people in the street.

292
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,800
 Like they can see people falling out of their cars and just laying dead on the street.

293
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:15,080
 Just when you thought things were going to get worse, a demon enters the house.

294
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,720
 It's really good.

295
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,400
 It's a really good movie because you have both this sci-fi, well we face it in the real

296
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,920
 world, but a sci-fi version of a pandemic where people are just dropping dead in the

297
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
 middle of the street.

298
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,560
 Hospitals are on fire.

299
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,200
 Military helicopters flying overhead.

300
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,920
 Delivering supplies or escaping the area we don't know.

301
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,920
 You have that element to it and then we have the purely demonic supernatural force that's

302
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,640
 hunting the kids in this house.

303
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,240
 Now this isn't a low budget film.

304
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,400
 This is a no budget film.

305
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,600
 And when you look at the reviews people are like, "What?

306
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,800
 That demon was just a guy with red face paint."

307
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
 You're right.

308
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,600
 It was just a guy with a red face paint.

309
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
 It was.

310
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,040
 Super, super low, no budget, right?

311
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,000
 They filmed it in this house using props from previous movies that this dad had filmed.

312
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,960
 It shouldn't have worked.

313
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,880
 It shouldn't have worked, but it's super creepy.

314
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,240
 And it has both jump scares and just that really creepy tension that's building.

315
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,440
 And these kids are trapped.

316
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,160
 There's one scene where the boy wakes up in the middle of the night and he hears something.

317
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,000
 He hears something in the house.

318
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 He starts walking through the house.

319
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,080
 Now it's found footage, but sometimes the footage is just coming from their eyeballs.

320
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,920
 Sometimes it switches between technology like a camera quarter or a camera phone and sometimes

321
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,320
 we're just seeing it from the child's point of view.

322
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,400
 But here's a weird sound.

323
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,840
 He doesn't recognize he's walking through the house and he's getting closer to the

324
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,160
 bathroom, the creepiest place.

325
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,600
 He walks into the bathroom and they're rocking back and forth in the bathtub.

326
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,480
 It's a hammer.

327
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,840
 Just any old hammer you could buy at a hardware store, it's balancing on its head and it's

328
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,320
 just rocking.

329
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:10,800
 It shouldn't work, but it's done so well that you're left wondering, you know what

330
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,120
 why the hammer's there.

331
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:20,080
 This demon is trying to get these kids to kill each other.

332
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,760
 And the boy knows why the hammer's there.

333
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,840
 The boy sees it.

334
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,080
 This is in the middle of the movie.

335
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
 It's not really a spoiler.

336
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:32,320
 It's not the climatic hammer scene, but he knows what the demon's trying to tell him.

337
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,320
 The boy sees the hammer, goes back to bed.

338
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,560
 It's just so perfectly set up.

339
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
 Super low budget.

340
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,680
 It shouldn't have worked.

341
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,640
 The fact that you just have a hammer rocking back and forth, you're like, "What?

342
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
 That's not creepy at all."

343
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,880
 But the way it's shot, the sound design, everything, it's one of the only movies I've ever seen

344
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,040
 that has jump scares in the credits.

345
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,080
 In the ending credits, there's more jump scares and it's super well done.

346
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,240
 I love low budget and no budget films.

347
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,840
 Resolution, Coherence, Rewind, Raccoon Valley.

348
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,640
 There's a ton of these movies out there that against all odds have succeeded.

349
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,080
 And one of them is this movie.

350
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
 He's watching.

351
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
 It's on streaming.

352
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
 Check it out.

353
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,000
 Dead Rapper recommends the truly creepy and haunting movie he's watching.

354
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Hey, Mom.

355
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Hey, Dad.

356
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,960
 We decided to make a video diary for you while you're away.

357
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,600
 So get well soon, please, because we don't like being alone.

358
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:42,600
 We're going after some exercise.

359
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 This street took pretty much everything, other than stuff like this.

360
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:04,600
 Hey, Lucas.

361
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:13,480
 Why do you record me sleeping in the middle of the night?

362
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,600
 She thinks I'm playing a prank on her, which I'm not.

363
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
 Mom?

364
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:29,600
 Dad, what the hell is the closet creeper?

365
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,600
 It's scary when it's dark.

366
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 Iris is not funny.

367
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 I think we have to leave the house.

368
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:56,600
 It's May 2nd, 2022.

369
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
 We're in Fresno, California.

370
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,000
 We're walking around the sunny, sunny streets, grabbing a slurpee from the local AMPM, kicking

371
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,120
 back enjoying the California sunshine.

372
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,280
 We see a man sitting in his car.

373
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,280
 He seemed kind of fidget with his phone, putting it on the dash.

374
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,240
 He's just trying to get it just right.

375
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,280
 We can tell this guy's about to shoot a video.

376
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,280
 He'll shoot a video in his car.

377
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,400
 It's a pretty common place to shoot videos.

378
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,960
 You can control the environment.

379
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,280
 You don't have to worry about anyone interrupting you, barking dogs.

380
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,200
 It depends on your neighborhood, but it's generally a lot quieter to film something in your car

381
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,120
 than it may be in your house.

382
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,760
 So that's very common.

383
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,160
 People shoot these videos in their car.

384
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,720
 They also would shoot a video in their car if what they're saying is so insane.

385
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,520
 They don't want anyone else to hear it.

386
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,640
 Well, anyone else but their audience to hear it.

387
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,400
 Because their audience is just some random people on YouTube.

388
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,840
 Had Robert Hurtado recorded this video in his living room, things may have turned out

389
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,320
 differently.

390
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,320
 This video is entitled "Here We Go."

391
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,480
 I'm spilling everything now.

392
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,960
 Cloning Center and my new lease on life.

393
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,120
 Thanks a lot.

394
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:35,400
 And Robert Hurtado begins to tell us a story that he now knows why everybody treats him

395
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,600
 differently.

396
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,880
 He could never really figure it out why people were awkward around him.

397
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:50,120
 He could never figure it out why people seem to not really connect with him.

398
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,760
 But recently these memories have been flooding back into his head.

399
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:03,400
 He was starting to remember why he was different and why people treated him differently.

400
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,560
 He remembered everything.

401
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,880
 Let's go back a few years to the year 2017.

402
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,680
 And Robert Hurtado is hanging out at a local hookah bar in Fresno, California.

403
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,920
 They got the little puffy pipes with the big giant thing in the middle and they put a little

404
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,160
 bit of tobacco on it.

405
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,160
 I used to go to hookah bars all the time.

406
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
 Smoking it.

407
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
 Actually I miss going to hookah bars.

408
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
 I don't know anything about it.

409
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,360
 Robert Hurtado is hanging out at this hookah bar.

410
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,320
 He's smoking this flavored nicotine.

411
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,520
 And all of a sudden he notices everyone else on the hookah bar is like "Oh my god can

412
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
 you believe that?

413
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
 Who's that?

414
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
 Oh my goodness.

415
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
 Look at that."

416
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
 Huh?

417
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
 Who's that?

418
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
 Robert's thinking what's everybody looking at?

419
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,160
 What's they bringing some new type of hook?

420
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:57,920
 And he looks over and walking in to the hookah bar is Millie Bobby Brown.

421
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
 The star.

422
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,160
 I never watched the show.

423
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,760
 I know she's on it.

424
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,600
 The person, one of many actors on the hit show, Stranger Things.

425
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,100
 What?

426
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,320
 In our little hookah bar?

427
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,080
 This is crazy.

428
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,320
 Millie Bobby Brown walking in to the hookah bar.

429
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,840
 Now I know what you're thinking.

430
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,880
 You're a hardcore Hawkins head.

431
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,080
 You know everything about Stranger Things.

432
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
 You go wait a second.

433
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,320
 This doesn't make any sense.

434
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,400
 Millie Bobby Brown was 13 years old in 2017.

435
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,160
 How was she able to walk into this hookah bar?

436
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
 Let me tell you this.

437
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,440
 That's probably the most sensible thing about this story.

438
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,880
 I figure a celebrity can probably go wherever they want, especially on a hit television

439
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
 show.

440
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 None of this story.

441
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,240
 None of this story makes sense, okay?

442
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,160
 But Millie Bobby Brown, 13 year old girl, walks into this hookah bar in Fresno.

443
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:59,120
 Also walking into this hookah bar was a young man named Jake Bongiovi.

444
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,640
 Who is the son of John Bonjovey.

445
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,960
 So John Bonjovey has a son named Jake Bongiovi.

446
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,440
 So is that John Bonjovey's real name?

447
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,800
 Again, I don't know why I'm questioning that.

448
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,080
 Because at the time, this dude was also like 13 years old.

449
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,840
 They weren't even dating back then.

450
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,440
 They weren't even dating back then.

451
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:37,160
 But anyways, according to Robert, Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Bongiovi came into this hookah

452
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,800
 bar and then kidnapped him.

453
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:49,440
 They kidnapped him and they took him to a cloning center where they murdered him over

454
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,840
 and over and over and over and over again.

455
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,520
 These are the memories that he has remembered.

456
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,200
 These are the memories that came flooding back.

457
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,080
 And what he begins to do in his video is he begins to poke his face and say, "I'm not

458
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,280
 real.

459
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,560
 I'm really not real.

460
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
 Plastic."

461
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,760
 He's poking his face.

462
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,840
 He then begins to slap himself and he says, "This really doesn't hurt."

463
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,080
 Because he's a clone.

464
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,560
 He is not Robert Hurtado.

465
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,600
 He says that he's this clone.

466
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,840
 He's this clone.

467
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,200
 He says that Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Bongiovi also made him do stuff.

468
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,720
 He's not really clear on what that stuff is.

469
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,760
 He says that they made him do stuff.

470
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,920
 He just can't go on.

471
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
 He can't go on.

472
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
 He knows he's a clone.

473
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,840
 He's been murdered several times.

474
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,200
 He wants to kill himself.

475
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,440
 Wants to just end it all.

476
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,760
 Because he's just a clone, right?

477
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,560
 It doesn't matter if he dies, but he also realizes that if he dies, because he's a

478
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,880
 clone, he'll simply be replaced.

479
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,480
 So that's not gonna work.

480
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,600
 I kill myself to end my suffering because I know I'm not real.

481
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,840
 Another one of me will pop out of a pot and then I'll be back to square one.

482
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,880
 I might not even remember coming to the realization that I was a clone.

483
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,560
 I'd have to start this whole process over again.

484
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
 So that's not gonna work.

485
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,320
 He said in this video, I always think it's so interesting when these people say they

486
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,280
 made me do stuff and we don't know what this stuff is.

487
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,920
 Obviously we think the worst, right?

488
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,520
 Obviously we can just imagine what someone in the grip of madness like this could do

489
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,080
 to another human being.

490
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,320
 And then when they realize what they've done, they go, "I'm sorry.

491
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
 I'm sorry.

492
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,240
 I brought that agony upon you.

493
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,280
 Millie Bobby Brown made me do it."

494
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
 Fake statements.

495
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,000
 We see a lot of these in this type of confession, for lack of a better word, right?

496
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 They made me do stuff.

497
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,520
 We heard Isaac Cappy also say stuff like, "I crossed the line.

498
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
 I crossed the line."

499
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
 What does that mean?

500
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,520
 "I crossed the line."

501
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
 Like, he wouldn't specify what he did.

502
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 We can only imagine what type of thing he may have done.

503
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,000
 And then he did end up killing himself.

504
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,720
 I know there's a lot of controversy about that.

505
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,000
 People think that Tom Hanks pushed him off an overpass, but we've done episodes on him

506
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 before.

507
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,360
 I'll put them in the show notes.

508
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,240
 He says that not only did they make him do stuff.

509
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,840
 He says that they made him, quote, "say the words," but he didn't mean it.

510
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,680
 They made him, quote, "say the words," but he didn't mean it.

511
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,120
 He's also very vague on that.

512
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,840
 I can imagine that's something that was blasphemous.

513
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,560
 I'm sure that was something that he felt was blasphemous, betraying Jesus, speaking out

514
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,320
 against God, something like that.

515
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,320
 You know, it's so funny because I'm kind of analyzing it like that.

516
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,360
 I don't think anyone made him do this.

517
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,600
 I think there's obviously some sort of mental illness going on, whether he's hearing voices

518
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,720
 or he's having a psychotic break or whatever.

519
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,200
 But he said something that he felt he was compelled to say, but he didn't mean it.

520
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,480
 He didn't mean it in his heart.

521
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,680
 But we don't know what that was.

522
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:10,720
 He mentions someone known as Bradford the Master.

523
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,720
 Again, no clarification on that.

524
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,080
 He is tossing these comments out as if the people listening to this video, and really,

525
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,360
 I think right now it may just be up to a couple thousand views at the time he had maybe like

526
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,440
 44 subscribers before what we're getting to happened.

527
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,240
 This video is still up as of recording this episode.

528
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,960
 Surprise YouTube hasn't taken it down.

529
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,160
 Talks about someone known as Bradford the Master.

530
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,000
 He says, "Anyone can be a victim of this cloning technology.

531
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 You don't have to be a celebrity."

532
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 He was a nobody.

533
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
 He was sitting at a hookah bar.

534
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,880
 He was picked out of the crowd to be sent to this cloning facility so anyone can become

535
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,240
 a target of these guys.

536
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,200
 He does mention that one day he realized, like one day he had this epiphany because he woke

537
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,640
 up and he looked like a robot.

538
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,920
 He realized he didn't look like a human being anymore.

539
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,720
 That's when he realized that there's something wrong.

540
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,680
 That's when he had to start going on this journey to figure out why am I a robot now?

541
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,480
 That's another clinical delusion.

542
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,800
 Generally, it's that you look dead.

543
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,000
 We did another episode on that.

544
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,880
 It's a syndrome that makes you think you're dead, that you're actually dying inside.

545
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,760
 This is kind of a sci-fi twist on that.

546
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,560
 Not that you're dead and rotting and you're a zombie.

547
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,760
 I'll put that episode on the show notes, but that he's not alive in another way.

548
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,280
 He's a robot in another way.

549
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:41,680
 He also mentioned another person who's involved in this conspiracy named Sarah Paulson, who

550
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,200
 apparently is a celebrity.

551
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,440
 It's very, very interesting because this guy is picking, I mean, no insult to Jake Bangeovi

552
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
 and Sarah Paulson.

553
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,760
 I'm sure you guys are wonderful people.

554
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,960
 I mean, other than the cloning facility, you're kidnapping people and taking them too, but

555
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
 it's weird.

556
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,120
 He seems to just picking these names out at random.

557
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,440
 Bradford the Master, Sarah Paulson, Jake Bangeovi.

558
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,320
 I mean, obviously, I'm not saying, obviously Millie Bobby Brown, but I get that she's super

559
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,200
 famous at the time, why he would fixate on her.

560
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:19,760
 He does though mention somebody that, in my opinion, played a pivotal part in all of this.

561
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,400
 And when you are a conspiracy theorist, you really have to question how much are you exposing

562
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,120
 the world to the truth?

563
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:35,920
 And how much are you just being a grifter and spreading human misery for money or fame?

564
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,080
 He mentions that Donald Marshall was right.

565
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,760
 Donald Marshall was right about everything.

566
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:49,840
 He's this guy who believes that he wrote all the hit songs in the world and he's a famed

567
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,700
 gladiator combatant.

568
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,000
 He talks about these cloning pits, he talks about reptilians being able to interhuman

569
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,800
 minds and replace the soul of a human with the soul of a reptilian invader.

570
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,640
 He talks about his childhood since the age of five.

571
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,560
 He got cloned and murdered, cloned and murdered, cloned and murdered until he became the best

572
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,860
 fighter on the planet.

573
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:20,180
 He fought other clones, other celebrity clones in this gladiator pit somewhere deep in some

574
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,680
 military base.

575
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,660
 And the story's hilarious, actually when I was looking this up and I was watching this

576
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,700
 video I go, "Who's this Donald Marshall guy?"

577
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,460
 I totally forgot I did a whole episode on him.

578
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,660
 Long time ago I put in the show notes, "Luckily you guys are awesome."

579
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:41,020
 I was talking about Donald Marshall before I started recording an episode about him this

580
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
 week.

581
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:47,260
 I was talking about it on the live Patreon show and Rudy Jazz said, "Hey, I think you

582
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,140
 already did that episode."

583
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,980
 The gladiator guy who knows all the songs in the world.

584
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,200
 I find this guy so entertaining I almost accidentally did an entirely new episode on him.

585
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,600
 He's a fascinating character.

586
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,280
 I also think that he's complicit in what is about to happen.

587
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,120
 Because here you have a guy who has believed everything Donald Marshall has told him about

588
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:20,320
 cloning and about reptilians and about society and how we are all victims of this reptilian

589
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,980
 cloning facility.

590
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,380
 And would Robert Hurtado do what's about to come?

591
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,500
 Would he have ever done anything had he not bought into the BS that Donald Marshall was

592
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,620
 selling?

593
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,100
 Donald Marshall is right about everything.

594
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,420
 Robert Hurtado knew something had to change.

595
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,660
 He knew he couldn't kill himself because just a new clone would come out.

596
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,300
 So what he decided was he needed to destroy the entire system.

597
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,120
 He needed to expose the reptilians, expose the clone conspiracy.

598
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,080
 He had to let the world know what was really going on.

599
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,580
 He had to put the "they live sunglasses" on society and we would finally see the truth.

600
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,820
 But how does a man who's recording a video in his car with less than 100 subscribers

601
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:17,380
 on YouTube let the world know what's really going on?

602
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,260
 He recorded that video on May 2nd, 2022.

603
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:27,020
 Later that month, later that same month of May, just this year.

604
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:32,580
 Robert, whose real name is Philly Mon Hurtado, he's a 29 year old man.

605
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:39,500
 Philly Mon/Robert lived with his sister and her two children.

606
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,020
 They all lived in this house together.

607
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:55,780
 His sister, him, and Katalaya Hurtado, 18 months old, and Kallix Hurtado, 5 months old.

608
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,580
 His only motive for this crime I'm about to describe to you, and this is from his words,

609
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,700
 he told the investigators this, his only reason for doing this.

610
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,500
 So he could bring attention to the cloning centers.

611
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:15,940
 The only reason, the only reason he did this was because he believed Donald Marshall was

612
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,700
 right.

613
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:23,340
 When the two infants were in their mother's bedroom, Robert stood there at the open bedroom

614
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,740
 door looking at these two infants laying in bed.

615
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:34,820
 He took a gas can he was holding and began to pour it into the bedroom.

616
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:40,960
 He then lit a match and a fire erupted.

617
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:49,260
 He stood there and watched these two infants choke on the thick billowing smoke.

618
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,060
 He stood there and watched until his sister came to see what was going on.

619
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,860
 Now he said that she was very nonchalant.

620
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,460
 She acted like nothing was wrong.

621
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,460
 Almost like a robot, right?

622
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,900
 Almost like a clone.

623
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,180
 Now, was she really like that?

624
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,700
 Was that part of his mental illness?

625
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,220
 He's actually hallucinating visual hallucinations now?

626
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,220
 Who knows?

627
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,900
 I mean, I doubt, I'm sure that it was hallucination, right?

628
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,460
 I doubt she was just not caring about what was going on because what we have having nexus,

629
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,860
 she tries to get past him.

630
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,940
 She tries to get into the room to save her children.

631
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:37,900
 He pushes her to the ground, pours gasoline on her, lights her on fire.

632
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:43,660
 He then runs out of the house, but he doesn't leave the area.

633
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,660
 He's not on the run.

634
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:51,020
 He's not trying to get away because if he gets away, how's he going to tell his story?

635
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:57,460
 The only reason he did this was to wake us up.

636
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,180
 When the firefighters came and they began putting the fire out and then fire investigator

637
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,220
 begins talking to him, "Hey, what happened?

638
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,220
 You ran out of that house.

639
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,220
 Do you have any idea what caused the fire?"

640
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,900
 Oh, I did.

641
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,300
 I caused the fire.

642
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,220
 Why did you light the house on fire?

643
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:26,620
 Because I knew that the only way to expose this celebrity human trafficking and cloning

644
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:36,500
 ring, the only way the media would ever listen to me was if I did the unthinkable.

645
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:42,300
 Now he has never once stated that the children were clones.

646
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,660
 He knew they weren't.

647
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,260
 He knew they weren't clones because if they were just clones, then there would just be

648
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,860
 new babies the next day, right?

649
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,980
 No one would know the difference.

650
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,340
 New babies would ship in.

651
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,900
 He knew they weren't clones.

652
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,200
 He knew they weren't part of the conspiracy theory.

653
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,540
 He killed them so we would listen to him.

654
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,660
 He killed two children.

655
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,700
 So we would know that Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Banjie Ovi are kidnapping people from

656
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,900
 hookah bars and cloning them.

657
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,860
 The two children did die.

658
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:21,420
 The mother lived, but she was severely burned.

659
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,180
 And Robert was asked, "Do you regret doing this?"

660
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,520
 His answer?

661
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,760
 "No.

662
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,920
 This task is much bigger than myself."

663
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,840
 It's a terrifying story.

664
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,200
 Last week we talked about some guy believing that fluoride was dangerous because it was

665
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,360
 coming from China.

666
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,880
 And listen, in that episode, he even said, "I don't know.

667
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
 Maybe it is.

668
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
 Maybe it is."

669
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,560
 Robert did a unilateral move.

670
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,640
 This guy in this town said, "I don't want fluoride in my water anymore."

671
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,760
 Actually, he didn't even live in that town.

672
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,360
 He was just elected to be the water superintendent.

673
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,480
 And he made a change without telling anybody.

674
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,440
 And I said, "Can you imagine if a conspiracy theorist in your local government decides to

675
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,000
 make these changes based on some theory they have?"

676
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,880
 And on the fluoride one, I was honest.

677
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,760
 I go, "There are some questions about what's coming over.

678
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,320
 We get all of our fluoride from China."

679
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,040
 And other cities have said, "This stuff is bad for the water supply."

680
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,600
 But they've actually had debates about it.

681
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,120
 And they let the people know we're not going to use it anymore.

682
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,720
 This guy just said, "I read some stuff online, so I stopped putting it in your water."

683
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,160
 And I said, "Well, man, could you imagine having a judge who's a conspiracy theorist or

684
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,000
 your pilot believes in flat earth and stuff like that?"

685
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,800
 This is the thing that I'm the most worried about.

686
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,760
 Like when I did that story, I was just thinking, "Oh, this is kind of a fun one."

687
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
 Cavities, right?

688
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
 Kids are getting cavities.

689
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,040
 This guy believed in these conspiracy theories, in these lunatic conspiracy theories that

690
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,680
 we spent a whole hour making fun of a couple years ago.

691
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,120
 This guy thought it was real.

692
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,040
 This guy believes that Donald Marshall is real.

693
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,440
 Donald Marshall is a lunatic.

694
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,760
 Well, there's two options.

695
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,760
 One, he has a mental illness, or two, he's a grifter.

696
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,120
 Because we know it's not true.

697
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:19,560
 We know that he did not fight in underground gladiator pits where he was getting stabbed

698
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,280
 in some Scottish man with a broadsword, split him in half, and then he woke up.

699
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,840
 Literally, all of his clone stories go, it all starts when I fall asleep late at night.

700
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,560
 I fall asleep late at night, and then I wake up, I'm in a gladiator arena.

701
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,240
 That's called a dream, dude.

702
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
 You should be ashamed of yourself.

703
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,880
 It's really what I'm getting at.

704
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,880
 Maybe you're a clone.

705
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
 Maybe you're a clone.

706
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,840
 You don't have human feelings.

707
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,400
 But you were, maybe not legally.

708
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,760
 Maybe not legally, but morally.

709
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,680
 I think Donald was complicit in the murder of these kids.

710
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,600
 He fed them a lie.

711
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,560
 He fed them a fantasy.

712
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,360
 He never told them it was all made up.

713
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,520
 Donald kept this charade going.

714
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
 Got these kids killed.

715
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:11,960
 It got these kids killed to expose the lie that Donald Marshall created.

716
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
 It's insane.

717
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,280
 I mean, it's a definition of insane.

718
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,720
 And it's what happens when multiple insane people get together.

719
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:26,480
 Now again, Donald Marshall is either nuts, or he knows he's making it up.

720
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,000
 But either way, I think he's complicit.

721
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,040
 Again, not legally, but morally.

722
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,360
 I know we joke and laugh about conspiracy theories, and we're going to keep doing it

723
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,680
 on the show because it's honestly kind of hilarious.

724
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,320
 But this is what happens on the opposite side sometimes.

725
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,560
 I'm not saying all conspiracy theorists are child killers.

726
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,400
 Obviously not.

727
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
 I'd say the minority of them are.

728
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:59,240
 It's a super, super small group of very, very dangerous people who enjoy conspiracy

729
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,280
 theory content.

730
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:06,760
 But the number's not zero.

731
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
 Terrifying story.

732
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,880
 Really is a terrifying story when people take these lies and believe them as truths.

733
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,120
 And it's sad.

734
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,280
 This guy someday he's going to get treated for his mental illness, most likely behind

735
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
 bars.

736
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,360
 And he's going to be faced with the fact.

737
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:35,760
 He's going to have to sit there in a cell or in a hospital bed.

738
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,960
 He's going to sit there in one day.

739
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,280
 And then one day, one day he's going to have another epiphany.

740
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,000
 He's going to be sitting there.

741
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,120
 And he's going to realize Donald Marshall was wrong.

742
00:41:53,120 --> 00:42:03,480
 But he realized it far too late.

743
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:18,320
 He's going to realize Donald Marshall was wrong.

744
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:35,680
 He's going to realize Donald Marshall was wrong.

745
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:52,320
 He's going to realize Donald Marshall was wrong.
