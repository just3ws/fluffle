1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Today we meet the unluckiest pervert in the world probably.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,200
 I mean, I'm sure there's a lot to choose from.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,700
 This guy's pretty unlucky.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,200
 And then we travel back to the iceberg to take a look at a terrifying conspiracy theory.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:19,200
 Are aliens using humans to get high today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,700
 [music]

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I'm your host Jason Carvener.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,300
 We've got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna hop right into it.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,300
 We are gonna start off by giving a shout out to our newest Patreon,

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,800
 Sister Celestine.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,600
 Sister Celestine, thank you so much for supporting the show.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,100
 You are going to be our pilot, our captain.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,700
 Whatever vehicle we use today, you're gonna be in charge.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,700
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine as well.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,400
 Just help get the word out about the show really, really helps out.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,800
 Sister Celestine, let's go ahead and hop into Jason Jalopy.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,900
 Let's take a ride all the way out to New Jersey.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,000
 Specifically, we're going to Haddonfield, New Jersey.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,300
 Isn't that where Halloween took place?

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,400
 Not like it was not like it was a real event.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,200
 Isn't that where that documentary took place?

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,300
 H2O, the one where the documentary where Cooleo got his guts ripped out.

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,100
 Sister Celestine, we're driving over to New Jersey.

27
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,900
 It's summer 2015.

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,400
 We're going to meet a man named John Michael Moosebock.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
 He's 31 years old.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,700
 Now, we're not going to meet him because he's a big old disgusting pervo.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,300
 This is a true crime story.

32
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,200
 So technically, I'll say allegedly, but he already pled guilty to one of the crimes we're going to talk about.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,000
 So John Michael Moosebock, 31 years old.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,800
 He begins chatting with a 13-year-old girl from New York.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,300
 So gross, right?

36
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:54,700
 And of course, it turns into sexting and then exchanging explicit photos.

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,100
 So her parents find out and they call the cops and the cops call the cops in New Jersey.

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,900
 That whole thing goes on, right?

39
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,500
 But that's not even the interesting part of the story.

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,100
 Unfortunately, that type of disgustingness happens all the time.

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,100
 People do it.

42
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,400
 Hopefully, they get caught.

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
 Sometimes they don't.

44
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,100
 Sometimes it takes them a couple of times to get caught.

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,900
 It's gross, but that's not what we're here for.

46
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,000
 Because then that's just a news story, unfortunately.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,100
 That's not a weird news story.

48
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,600
 This is the weird part of the news story.

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,700
 So he's arrested in March 2016.

50
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,500
 On October 2017, he pleads guilty to child endangerment.

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,400
 So he's talking to the judge.

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,900
 He's like, "Listen, judge, I know it was super gross.

53
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,200
 I'm sorry and I'll never do it again."

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,500
 He crosses his fingers behind his back.

55
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,400
 The judge is like, "Uh, Bayliff, can you make sure that the defendant's fingers are not crossed?

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,900
 That's a normal thing they have to do in court.

57
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,500
 That's why they handcuff you so you can't cross your fingers behind your back.

58
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,700
 Uh, it's crossing my toes, Your Honor.

59
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,800
 I'm a total perv.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
 I'll do whatever I want."

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,300
 He basically tells the judge, "Yeah, I plead guilty."

62
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,000
 She doesn't do that.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,300
 This was a full-on sexting and exchanging pictures and stuff like that.

64
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,800
 He had pictures of her on his computer.

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,900
 It's super gross.

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,600
 Two years suspended prison sentence.

67
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,700
 That's all he got.

68
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,900
 And a lifetime of parole.

69
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,600
 So is that the weird part of the story?

70
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,000
 Sister Celestine says as we're driving around New Jersey.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
 I go, "No, no, no, no, no."

72
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,700
 That, unfortunately, again, is something that often happens in these cases.

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,800
 People get arrested.

74
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,600
 They get charged or something heavy.

75
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
 They plead down.

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,800
 The prosecutors don't want to waste the time.

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,100
 Maybe the family doesn't want to have a long trial, whatever.

78
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,800
 So they give them a lesser sentence.

79
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,100
 It should have been way more than that.

80
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,400
 Just getting the pictures from the girl and him sending the pictures of the girl.

81
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
 Could have been doing some serious time.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,300
 But two years suspended sentence.

83
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,700
 Probably had a good lawyer.

84
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,300
 Prosecutor probably didn't want to deal with it.

85
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,600
 All that stuff.

86
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
 That's totally normal.

87
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,300
 This is where the story gets weird.

88
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,200
 This is where the story becomes dead rabbit radio worthy and gave me a quite a good chuckle.

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,000
 So in 2019, there was this informant, this confidential informant working with the Department of Homeland Security

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 on a completely unrelated thing.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,800
 I could just imagine the CI and Department of Homeland Security

92
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,400
 and having lunch one day and the CI is like, "Oh, you know what?

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
 This has nothing to do with what we're talking about, right?

94
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
 Like, I'm helping you do this thing.

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
 But you want to hear something super funny?

96
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,600
 You want to hear a hilarious story?

97
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,700
 Homeland Security is like, "Yeah, who doesn't want to hear a hilarious story?"

98
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,100
 So this is what happened.

99
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,500
 This John Michael Moosebock was arrested in 2016, March 2016.

100
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 In October 2017, he plead guilty and again, he got a slap on the wrist.

101
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,000
 But in between that, in May 2016, he think he's big brain here.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
 "You know what I need to do?

103
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,300
 You know what I need to do to make this whole thing disappear?"

104
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,800
 Where there's tons of physical evidence.

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,600
 There's tons of like photos and texts of us talking.

106
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,000
 You know what?

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
 I would really help me if I had the girl murdered.

108
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,700
 If I like killed this 13 year old girl, that would totally make this whole case go away.

109
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,100
 No one would find that suspicious, right?

110
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
 The 13 year old girl just disappears.

111
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,700
 That's never in the news, right?

112
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,900
 So he hires a hitman online.

113
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,200
 He finds this hitman online.

114
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,800
 Probably deep web, but maybe not.

115
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,200
 He finds a hitman online and they negotiate a sale.

116
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,300
 He goes, "So listen, I want this girl, she's 14 at this point.

117
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,100
 I want this girl killed, she's 14 years old.

118
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,500
 Is that too young?

119
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,000
 Can you do that?"

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,600
 And the hitman's like, "Oh, no, no, no, that's totally fine.

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,000
 We actually give you a discount for that.

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,900
 We have to use less ammo because they're tinier."

123
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,100
 He's like, "Yeah, I didn't know that."

124
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,900
 "$20,000 please and I will send a hitman out.

125
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,100
 Post haste to kill a 14 year old girl."

126
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,200
 So this dude had, I don't have $20,000.

127
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,100
 I don't think I've ever had $20,000, right?

128
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,300
 This dude flips the dude a couple of bitcoins worth $20,000

129
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,700
 and then starts emailing this hitman going,

130
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,100
 "Hey dude, when are you gonna do it?

131
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,900
 Hey dude, she's still alive, man.

132
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
 Like, when are you gonna do it?"

133
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,300
 Email, regarding 14 year old murder.

134
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,100
 When are you gonna kill this 14 year old?

135
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,900
 He keeps constantly harassing this hitman,

136
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,800
 which you don't want to do out of all the people

137
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,500
 to not harass the professional killer, right?

138
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,700
 Like, that's just common knowledge.

139
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,000
 Don't harass the assassin.

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,100
 Anyways, eventually the hitman is like,

141
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,700
 "Oh, dang it, getting alerts on his phone late at night.

142
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,300
 He's getting ready to like shoot,

143
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,200
 shoot some politician to phones, eat buzzard in his pocket."

144
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,800
 Accidentally kills like some secretary.

145
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,200
 He's like, "Ah, hitman goes, listen, the original person,

146
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,500
 I'm not the original hitman.

147
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,000
 The original hitman who originally got this job,

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
 got busted for cocaine possession."

149
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,100
 So that hitman is out of commission.

150
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,900
 I will take over, but I require an extra $5,000.

151
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,600
 See, I cost more.

152
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
 I cost $25,000.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,700
 I already got $20,000 from this dude

154
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,500
 because it's like this weird hitman thing.

155
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,600
 I need an extra $5,000.

156
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,800
 So at this point, he goes, "Well, no,

157
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
 I'm not gonna pay an extra $5,000.

158
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
 It took you guys too long.

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,200
 I've been waiting to see this 14-year-old girl get murdered.

160
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,800
 All this time, guys, I want my money back."

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,500
 That's another thing you probably don't want to ask an assassin for, right?

162
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,200
 You have a refund.

163
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,100
 He kills people for a living and he does coke, right?

164
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,700
 This bad combination.

165
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,800
 Very, very excitable man says,

166
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
 "Listen, I want my money back.

167
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
 The girl's still alive.

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,100
 I want my money back."

169
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,900
 And at this point, to just top everything off, right?

170
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
 This guy who was committing sex crimes

171
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,100
 with a 13-year-old girl via the Internet,

172
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,800
 then hires a hitman, then pesters the hitman,

173
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,700
 asking, "When's it gonna be done?

174
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,700
 When's it gonna be done?"

175
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,600
 And then asks for a refund of said hitman.

176
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
 The hitman then tells him,

177
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,500
 "Hey, bro, I hate to break it to you.

178
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,800
 I'm not a hitman.

179
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,600
 This is a scam."

180
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,500
 So you're not getting your money back.

181
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,400
 You're keeping your $20,000.

182
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,500
 And if you email me one more time,

183
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,700
 I'm gonna call the police.

184
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,100
 So at that point, John goes,

185
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,600
 "Uh, okay, okay, I won't...

186
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,300
 That to him was scarier

187
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,800
 than if the hitman said, "I'm coming after you."

188
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 When he thought it was an actual assassin,

189
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,400
 he let loose to murder a 14-year-old girl.

190
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,500
 Oh, he was on him every day.

191
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 "Hey, dude, how's it going?

192
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
 Hey, you know, I hate to be a bug,

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,600
 but you know, have you murdered that person yet?

194
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,100
 See you later."

195
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,100
 But when it came, it was all scam.

196
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,700
 It was basically someone had set up a website

197
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,800
 saying, "I will murder people for $20,000,"

198
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 and was not murdering anybody.

199
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,200
 And so John just goes,

200
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,400
 "Well, lesson learned.

201
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,800
 That's what I get for trying to hire an assassin."

202
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,300
 But then, so that all happened like mid-2016.

203
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,200
 He hired this dude in 2016

204
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,900
 and found that it was a scam.

205
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,500
 Lost $20,000.

206
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,200
 October 2017, he gets nothing.

207
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,400
 Two years suspended sentence.

208
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,600
 And a lifetime of parole.

209
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,500
 It's nothing.

210
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,000
 That's nothing for that level of a crime.

211
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,700
 But he's on the clear.

212
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,500
 It must have been like,

213
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,600
 "Good thing I didn't have that 14-year-old murdered.

214
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,300
 I really wish I had that $20,000 back.

215
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,100
 But hey, what are you gonna do?"

216
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
 In 2019, though,

217
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,300
 when a confidential informant's having lunch

218
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,800
 with a Department of Homeland Security officer

219
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,200
 and goes, "You want to hear a funny story?

220
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,500
 That is the story that he told."

221
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,000
 He goes, "Yes, so here's the thing.

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,800
 This dude tried hiring someone to murder some 14-year-old girl.

223
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,400
 Homeland Security looked into it,

224
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,900
 started digging through emails that was being sent,

225
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,800
 was able to track his username to this,

226
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
 and da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,700
 Boop!

228
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,900
 Kicked in his door and got him.

229
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,100
 So that is the saga of the unluckiest pervert in the world.

230
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,100
 Only did he get scammed by a fake hitman.

231
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,400
 He eventually got turned in years later for that.

232
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,500
 It would be one thing if this all happened at the same time,

233
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 but at this point, you know, two years just passed.

234
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,000
 He's probably like, "Oh, you know,

235
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,600
 Sherlock Fool is trying to have that 14-year-old girl murdered,

236
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,500
 but everything worked out in the end."

237
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,000
 And then he's like, "I wonder who that is?

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,500
 Maybe it's someone giving me back $20,000.

239
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 Maybe it is a special prize."

240
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,800
 Homeland Security kicks in his door.

241
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,100
 "Sister Celestein, let's hop in that carbon helicopter.

242
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
 We are leaving behind New Jersey.

243
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,900
 We are headed out to the iceberg."

244
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,100
 Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

245
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,400
 Helicopter's flying out.

246
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,400
 I want to give a shout-out again to some weirdo on Twitter,

247
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,100
 aka Jack, for creating the Excel spreadsheet.

248
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,000
 It makes it so easy to look at these conspiracy theories.

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 This is one that I came across before I saw the iceberg,

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,500
 but in a different medium.

251
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,000
 The conspiracy theory is aliens are using humans as drugs.

252
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,400
 Conspiracy theory, iceberg, really dates back to late 2016, early 2017, mid-2017, around there.

253
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,500
 But back in 2009, there was a television show called Torchwood,

254
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,000
 and it featured everyone's favorite bisexual, immortal superhero, Captain Jack.

255
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 That's something I don't remember his last name, but it's great.

256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 If you don't watch Torchwood, if you never watched Torchwood,

257
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 it's a British show, it was a spinoff of Doctor Who.

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,500
 Imagine X-Files or Supernaturals if every ending was super depressing.

259
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,000
 Super Dark Show, very, very well done show.

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,500
 So they came out with a show called Children of Men in 2009.

261
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,000
 It was basically a five episode mini-series.

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And spoiler alert for this one, all the children on Earth freeze whether they're doing it or they just stop.

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Hopefully one of them wasn't flying a plane, all the kids just freeze and they all go, "We, we, we."

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And then they just start playing again.

265
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Now Torchwood is this government group that has to investigate paranormal activity.

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And so people are like, "Dude, what's going on with that?"

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,500
 And Captain Jack, who's like super just like morally, he's has some issues.

268
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,500
 He's like this immortal dude, and he's like, "I don't know, I don't know what that was."

269
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
 He's the hero of this show, by the way.

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 A couple hours later, all the kids freeze and they go, "We are. We are. We are."

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,500
 He's like, "What is going on? Politicians are trying to figure this out.

272
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,500
 Scientists all over the world. Captain Jack's kind of his eyes are shifting side to side."

273
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 Next time, kids go, "We are coming. We are coming. We are coming."

274
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,000
 So everyone, it's some sort of message being broadcasted using the children.

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And Captain Jack's like, "It's a mystery, right? Nobody knows who this is."

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And then the big thing, I remember watching this on television, I was like, "Oh no!"

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 The kids go, "We are coming. Back. We are coming. Back."

278
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 What it turns out was back in the 40s.

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 These aliens came down and made a deal with the British government.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,500
 Give us 42 human children or we're going to destroy England.

281
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,500
 And Captain Jack was like, "That's fair."

282
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,500
 The show, it's super dark because he will constantly make the decision for the greater good.

283
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,500
 There was an episode where these fairies said, "We're going to destroy England if you don't kidnap that little girl from her mom."

284
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
 She's really half-fairy. She shouldn't be here.

285
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
 If you don't kidnap that little girl from her mom or going to destroy England,

286
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,500
 the hero of the show basically kidnaps the little girl and throws her into the fairy realm to save England.

287
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,500
 So back in the 1940s, Captain Jack was like, "Okay, yeah, sure."

288
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,000
 So they load a bunch of kids up on a bus and they get abducted by aliens.

289
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,500
 And he's like, "Yeah, you know, I had to do it, right?"

290
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,000
 So now we're in the modern time. We're in like the year 2009 on this show.

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,500
 The aliens are coming back and they go, "We need more kids."

292
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,000
 There's 42 kids. They are good, but we want more of them.

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 We want like 10% of the kids of the world.

294
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,500
 It's a really, really good show and it really goes into all the political ramifications

295
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,000
 that the government is trying to figure out. Like, do we do this? Do we not?

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 And all the stuff that's going on, 2009, we're watching this, they show the aliens show up.

297
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,500
 And the aliens wearing this canister on its back.

298
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:54,000
 And in the canister is one of the kids from the bus, completely unaged, sitting in the back.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,500
 It's like this breathing tube and it's in this fluid.

300
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 It hasn't aged a day. So for the past 40 years, it's been a little kid in this container, in this alien's back.

301
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,000
 It explained what these kids were for and why they want 10% of them.

302
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 They use them as drugs.

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,500
 They go, "The human body contains a drug that gets us high. It's recreational."

304
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
 It's like not even for their species. It's not to keep them alive.

305
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,000
 They like token on humans. They like smoking that sweet, sweet homo sapien.

306
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And I remember watching that and it's a great science fiction show and it's brilliant.

307
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,500
 If you haven't seen "Torchwood," I recommend checking it out.

308
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,000
 The idea that one, you have the person not aging, so they're stuck in that perpetual hell.

309
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,500
 You can't even hope to eventually just become an old man.

310
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,000
 You should become an old man and break out of the container.

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 So I thought that was a very, very terrifying premise.

312
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,500
 So when I saw on the conspiracy theory, Iceberg, one of the first things that popped up, you know, a couple years ago, when I looked at it,

313
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,500
 aliens used humans to drugs. I went, "I know where that came from. That came from that episode of "Torchwood."

314
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,500
 Some of these do seem to have origins like that.

315
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:06,000
 Even one of the first episodes we covered, "Aiglis Travel," really came out of fiction or quasi-fiction, a fake narrative.

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,500
 But I found that and so I was aware of that for years.

317
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
 I was like, "Oh, that one's on there when I started doing the show."

318
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,000
 I was like, "I'm not really going to do that one. It's based on a television show. It's exciting."

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I would love to talk to my friends about "Torchwood," but, you know, I got other stuff to cover.

320
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I found an earlier story that may show this is a little more than a work of fiction.

321
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Sister Celestine, let's hop in that carbonic optor. We are flying out to Navar, Florida.

322
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,500
 [Splash]

323
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,000
 Leaving behind the iceberg. It's dark. It's April, 1990.

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,500
 Here's a woman or husband and her son are walking along an empty beach.

325
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 Just having fun.

326
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 Skipping stones. Skipping stones, just like Splinter.

327
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
 And then a green light appears in the water.

328
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,500
 [Splash]

329
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 And starts to lift up out of the sea.

330
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,000
 At that point, a yellow-white light appears around the woman. Let's call her Margaret.

331
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 A yellow-white light appears around Margaret.

332
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,500
 And she sees six to seven alien humanoids standing around her.

333
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 Now, this was reported by George Avery with MUFON, with the Mutual UFO Network.

334
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,000
 But even he was said, "We don't have a description of these aliens."

335
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 She just said there was like six to seven beings around me all of a sudden.

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,500
 She goes, "My son, who was right next to me, is now gone."

337
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,500
 And I could see my husband at the edge of the yellow light that had encircled me.

338
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,500
 She starts to scream, but her voice is stifled. There's nothing coming out.

339
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:47,500
 And one of the aliens walks towards her and says, "Calm down. You know it is useless to fight."

340
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,000
 It's interesting because the statement, "You know it's useless to fight,"

341
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,500
 implies that this isn't her first encounter with these things.

342
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 In fact, she said, she doesn't really know how this happened, but she recognized one of these aliens.

343
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,000
 "Calm down. You know it is useless to fight."

344
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,500
 She feels herself being taken to the green light in the water.

345
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,000
 And instantly she's in a room filled with fog.

346
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,500
 She's standing on a shiny metal floor, completely naked.

347
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,000
 She hears a noise behind her.

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 It's the noise of a man sobbing, screaming hysterically.

349
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 She turns around and there's two naked men standing behind her.

350
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,500
 One of them is just flipping out. I don't know if the other one was totally like, "It's Tuesday night.

351
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,000
 It's abduction Tuesday." But one of them was sobbing hysterically.

352
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Then she sees what she defines as a, quote, "human doctor."

353
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 So I don't know if that means that there was something about it that seemed like it was a imitation of a human,

354
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 or looked human, but didn't seem human to her, but she said it was a human doctor.

355
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 She described it with pale skin and freckles everywhere, reddish hair,

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,500
 wearing glasses, and a green set of scrubs that was covered in blood stains.

357
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 Next to him was a gray alien. So this one is actually defined as a typical gray alien.

358
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,500
 This gray alien standing next to the doctor and he's holding a canister.

359
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 And there's a tube going from the canister into the gray alien's neck.

360
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 Now at this point she said she was forced to look at the canister.

361
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,000
 She looks down. In the canister is a human baby.

362
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,500
 With tubes coming out of the baby, out of the canister, and into the gray alien.

363
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,500
 She said it was a baby had a big head, but its arms and legs were completely atrophied.

364
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 They were like pencils. This little baby floating around in this canister.

365
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,000
 Next thing she knew, she's on a table. And there's tables next to her.

366
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,500
 There's other people there. She can see other humans in this room.

367
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,000
 Something is covering her head. It wasn't like it was placed directly covering her view.

368
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It was like a shield above her. So she's laying there.

369
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Her legs are spread open, knees up. Typical pose that you would see a woman

370
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 in for a gynecological exam or giving birth.

371
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 There's a white blanket covering her legs so she can't see exactly what's going on.

372
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 But she sees standing between her open legs is that gray alien holding an empty canister.

373
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,500
 The alien speaks to her telepathically. "Don't fight it. Go with the pain. Go with the pain."

374
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
 Next thing she knows, she's just on the beach.

375
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,000
 Her husband and her son are just standing there. Cool night sky whipping around them.

376
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,500
 So that story took place in 1990. I think the question is when was it reported to Greg Avery?

377
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:02,000
 I can't find any record of that. It's possible that this story was reported after the episode of Torchwood.

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Some woman in Florida is like, "Oh, I have great fanfic about that. I'm going to insert myself as an original character."

379
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 So it could have been inspired by that show. We will put on our conspiracy caps and assume that the story is true, which we often do.

380
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,500
 Let's take a look at it. I think the idea, again, what's creepy about it.

381
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 I mean, that's hard to pick out, right? Being kidnapped in front of witnesses is always terrifying.

382
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:33,000
 But the baby in the canister. Again, the fact that it's arms and legs are atrophied makes me think it's been alive for so long.

383
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Right? It's just a baby. If it was a healthy baby in there, you're like, "I just popped out yesterday."

384
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,500
 But the fact that it was a baby, but it's muscles that it should be using are atrophied makes you think it's been in there for a while.

385
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 And the tube coming out of the baby into the gray alien. Now, you could argue maybe the gray alien is feeding the baby drugs or something like that,

386
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:59,500
 but there's just a sinisterness to it. It's not like they're like a cabbage patch doll that the alien's cradling.

387
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,500
 It's carrying it around and the woman is forced to look at the canister.

388
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 And then to see that same canister being used later as her legs are in that birthing position.

389
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 You could argue that the alien was putting the baby inside of her, but again, with the atrophied legs and things like that,

390
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,500
 also the baby's been pumped full of alien neck fluid. I don't know if it would be the healthiest baby, but you could argue that as well.

391
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 But I think it's a perfect story about are aliens using humans for drugs?

392
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,500
 Some people, that's where the adrenal chrome story has come from. That's where the adrenal chrome stories come from.

393
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 That reptilians are using human adrenal fluid, i.e. adrenal chrome, to get high.

394
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,500
 So it's not that you can just do it yourself. You have to be a shape-shifting reptilian for it to really work.

395
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:53,500
 So that's also a level of that. I think it's a creepy conspiracy theory because you've often seen the thing like we're just cattle to the aliens.

396
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:00,500
 Or they feed off of our souls or in the whole loosh idea and the archons and all this stuff.

397
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,500
 Or we're just meat to them. They're reptilians and they're fattening us up so they can eat us.

398
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,500
 Allah V, which is a great television show if you haven't seen that. You have all that stuff.

399
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,500
 But this one is even more, I think, insulting to humanity.

400
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 It's not that our souls are delicious, that we've lived these good lives or these lives full of pain and it's fattening up our souls.

401
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,500
 It's that we're just to get high, which I don't know. Apparently I just went through puberty, but we're just to get high.

402
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,500
 We're less than sustenance. We're just a drug to them.

403
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,500
 Which I find infinitely more creepy because that's just nothing.

404
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:45,500
 It would be like imagine, I remember once a long time ago I had this stoner thought that this shows you Jason's stoner thoughts.

405
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 I go, "Dude, what if all of..." This is the most stoner thing I've probably ever said and definitely the most stoner thing I've ever admitted to.

406
00:22:53,500 --> 00:23:00,500
 What if all of reality, so the universe is created and everything that happens on every single planet,

407
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 every speck of dust being blown across an alien landscape, every flower blossoming,

408
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:13,500
 every first kiss after the wedding vows are completed, every teardrop standing next to your dying grandfather,

409
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 every single part of human reality, not even human reality, every single part of reality is just one big nug.

410
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:30,500
 One big nug of weed, right? And when the universe, the Big Bang is created and it has all of these infinite experiences

411
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 and then it becomes back to before the Big Bang and then God, God, takes this big old nug, dude,

412
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 and he loads it into his pipe, one of those little cheap glass pipes.

413
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:53,500
 It's all rainbow colored and he puts that nug of reality in and he experiences every moment ever with that hit and he's like,

414
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 "Oh, dude, that was some good, good reality, man."

415
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 Yo, yo, Michael hit this and we're like, "No, no way, God, no way, dude, last time I spoke some of your weed, dude.

416
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 I was lit for like 10 eons." He's like, "I know, it's good stuff, huh?"

417
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 And then creates another Big Bang. A whole new set of experiences, a whole new set, a whole new set of memories.

418
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 Everything we experience is just to get God high.

419
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 Every success, every failure, everything we go through.

420
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:38,500
 Dude, this is some good reality right here, man. You gotta take this. No way, dude.

421
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,500
 The last person who smoked some of his stuff, he became Lucifer. He threw him in hell.

422
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 He's like, "Oh, yeah, dude, that hell thing was pretty dope, dude.

423
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 He gave me some nightmares when I smoked that nug."

424
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 That idea to me is far creepier than just being cold by aliens or even alien invasion,

425
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 where we're fighting against the aliens to think that we are so small on the intergalactic totem pole

426
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 that we're basically hits of acid.

427
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 If it was up to me, I'd much rather fight off a militarized alien invasion force

428
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 that uses tactics that has goals, that's trying to secure resources, supply lines,

429
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,500
 versus a bunch of alien junkies, because they're unpredictable.

430
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 They just want to get high, and you're the drug. That's the case.

431
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,500
 You can't win a war of attrition against a junkie. You can't outlast them.

432
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
 They want you to get high.

433
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 Warlords eventually get tired. Seages eventually end, one way or the other.

434
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,500
 A drug addict never stops until they get their drug, and an alien drug addict will never stop.

435
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,500
 They want nothing but a future where all the humans that are too old to be used as drugs are disposed of,

436
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,500
 those that could produce children to create more drugs are kept.

437
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 And you have babies being born into a world where a tube is shunted into the back of their neck.

438
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:08,500
 They're locked in a canister that will keep them alive, barely conscious, floating there,

439
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 looking out at a sea of gray aliens, each one with a canister.

440
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 Each one containing a piece of what was once the mighty human race,

441
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,500
 but which is now a prisoner of an alien's addiction.
