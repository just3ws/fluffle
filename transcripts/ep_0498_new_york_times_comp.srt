1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,900
 Can an everyday game we play with babies teach us something about ourselves?

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,640
 And then we dig into the New York Times articles about UFO disclosure.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,000
 Are they revealing a truth that UFOs have crash landed on Earth?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Or is something more bizarre going on today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 This is the start of the weekend. I hope you guys have an awesome weekend.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 If you want it to be exciting, let it be exciting.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 If you want it to be just laid back, it shall be laid back.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 There you have my blessing either way. Hopefully it's whatever you want it to be.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest supporter of the show, Nick Viano.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Nick, thank you so much for supporting the show. It really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 You're going to be El Capitan this episode.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Really, really helps out a lot. Talk about it in person or online or astral project.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 And just haunt people right on their bathroom mirrors, Dead Rabbit Radio.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 That would actually be quite the marketing scheme.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Nick, let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We're going to take a little drive around. I have a science lab here in town.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I don't think I told any of you guys that.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 So we're driving.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Apparently the car sounds like a bomb falling in World War II, but it's not.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 It's just a regular old car, I think.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 We get to my scientific laboratory. We're putting on our lab coats.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And we're going to put on some special goggles and little masks.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 We walk into one of those rooms and it's like, "psssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 First off, how long has that baby been in a box? And secondly, there's air holes in that, right?

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I'll breathe, baby, breathe.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 It's all...

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 So anyways, now you guys are very worried.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 You're like, "Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Peek-a-boo! I close it back up. Peek-a-boo! Close it back up.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 This goes on for about an hour and a half, two hours at this point.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And you're just like, "Ah, couldn't you put chairs in your secret laboratory?"

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I'm like, "No, it's more scientific for standing up."

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 We're doing it for like two hours. The baby never gets bored.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And this is a phenomenon we're all familiar with.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 We've all had encounters with babies where you can do peek-a-boo.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 They never get bored of it. They love the game.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I was actually looking into this. It was really interesting, the idea of peek-a-boo and babies.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So peek-a-boo is a game that cuts across all cultures.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Every culture has some variation of peek-a-boo, which I always find fascinating.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Doesn't matter where you're at on the globe, how far your culture goes back.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 At some level, there is a game similar to peek-a-boo.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And the way that it works, because they've...

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And because it's such a social thing, since everyone...

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 It's almost like a part of just being human at this point.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 There have been tons of studies done on why babies like peek-a-boo.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Why do adults think it's super lame and get bored of it after a couple of minutes?

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 For a baby, they don't know what to expect.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Their brain is still building those pathways.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So when you cover your face up...

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Can you hear me? See you hear my voice?

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Peek-a-boo!

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 They are shocked each time and it makes them laugh.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And what happens is it's teaching them that just because something is not visible doesn't mean it's gone.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And they see your face, you cover it up, you uncover it, and you go peek-a-boo or whatever you're saying.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I wonder if you just do it stone-faced if you just went...

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I wonder if the kid would still find it funny, but kids like it.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Because it's reassuring, it's teaching their brain that just because something is unseen,

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 when your parent leaves the room and the kid starts crying, it's because they, as far as they know, the parent has ceased to exist.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 They can't see their parent. It's terrifying.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 It's teaching them, like, "Oh, things don't disappear forever.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Things don't fall into the shapeless void just because they went to Starbucks."

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 It takes them a while to build this pathway.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 They also find it hilarious because comedy is really based on expectation and subversion of expectation.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So they expect your face to be there, but then their brain is telling them,

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 "Oh, dude, that guy's disappeared forever."

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And then it reappears again, and they're like, "Oh, I love this joke."

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 They've actually tried variations of this. This would be hilarious.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I would love to just be a scientist just so I could constantly be like, "Test 85."

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 We have another baby in a box. We're going to run this test.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 What they did was they'd have one person, like, interact with a baby,

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 and then duck down behind a wall or obscure themselves in some way.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And the baby would be, like, excited and kind of scared.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And then somebody else would pop up and go, "Peek-a-boo!"

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And the baby didn't like that.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Like, the baby would be like, "Okay, like, I guess I'm supposed to laugh?"

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Because they get the setup. First, they'd have the person jump down and jump up.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 "Ha ha ha ha!" Baby would find that hilarious.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And then the person would do that a couple of times.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 The person then would jump down and then another person would jump up.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And it's funny because as adults, that would be funny.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 That would be shocking because that's a complete subversion of what we expect

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 when the baby's brain is still developing.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 They'll say, "Whoa, whoa, dude! This is way too trippy for me!"

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Like, I barely can hold my head up with the muscles in my neck.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And now when people are shape-shifting in front of me, hold up, scientist man.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So, peek-a-boo is interesting because it's a tool that builds those pathways.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And it's almost, I think because it is across all cultures,

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I wonder if it's something that's just innate in our species.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I wonder, because you know, like animals play and stuff like that.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I wonder if bears have an equivalent of that.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Like, they stick their head in a beehive.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Okay, I know bears. I know beehives, one. You can't do that.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 It's not a Winnie the Pooh cartoon.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 But let's say like a bear hides in the cave and the baby bear's like,

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 "What, mom? No, I'm gonna starve to death.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 You still need to teach me how to forge for food."

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And the mom walks out and the baby bear's like, "Ha ha ha ha ha!"

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Okay, and again, I know bears are actually cartoon characters

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 that have knees they can slap if you heard that sound effect.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But I wonder if all animals do this on something,

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 because animals do play and animals also have to learn like that.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I also wanted to talk about this baby thing, one,

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 because I rented out this cool scientific room and got this baby.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I also wanted to talk about the peek-a-boo story because I had an odd thought the other day.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 We're gonna leave behind the baby babies.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 I know, let me out of the park.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 All of a sudden, it develops the ability to speak.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 At six months, it's like banging on the...

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Dude, dude, no, no, no, no, no, we're like, "Oh, sorry, bro. Sorry."

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 We're gonna get a little baby carrier, like the thing that's on strap to your body.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 So now I got the whole baby with me and we're walking.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 We've adopted this kid. We've adopted this kid. His name is Mungo Jr.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 It's really weird. You know, a lot of times when you're out in public,

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 people bring their babies and the babies are kind of looking around.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It's just absorbing information. It's like, "Whoa, what's that?

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 That's that color purple I've been hearing about."

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Whoa, it's super purple. Whoa, look at that.

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's a butterfly. I know all these terms. I just don't know what they are.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 They're absorbing information really for the first time.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Like when a baby sees you, that might be the first time they've ever seen someone who even closely resembles you.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 They're taking in everything. They're just, "Ugh."

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 They can't focus because their brain is basically like, "Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom,"

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 on all the visual stimuli and auditory stimuli and all that.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Babies are constantly reading the room.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And that's how we learn how to develop being able to read people's faces,

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 being able to tell if someone's mad or pretending to be mad,

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 able to tell if someone's laughing what laughter is, what laughter looks like.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 All of these things that they're eventually going to start mimicking.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 So when they're an adult, I'm an expert at reading faces.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 That's why I don't really like interacting online.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Like online dating has always sucked for me.

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I'm actually quite shy online.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 In person, I'll walk up to a random stranger because I can look at you

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 and I can tell the exact moment that I've started to annoy you.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I can tell everything about you and your body language and your...

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I know exactly when that conversation's over and it's time to walk away.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Always leave about five seconds earlier than you're supposed to.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 All that stuff. I'm an expert at reading faces and body language.

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And I've developed that skill from reading faces, growing up.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 I met Walmart the other day. Everyone was wearing a mask.

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 There was a little baby, I don't know, less than a year old maybe.

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Baby's looking around and I'm... and people are smiling at the baby,

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 but the eyes just slightly crinkle when you're smiling through a mask.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 You don't see the broad smile. You don't see the teeth.

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Babies who are developing during this time period are going to have

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 one hell of a hard time understanding human emotions, right?

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Because so much of it is displayed by our face to the point that

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 even an animal can read a human's facial expression.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 These babies that are growing up during this whole time,

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 they're going to have such a hard time, this six month window.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Now at home they may be getting all of this facial recognition and stuff like that,

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 but we got it everywhere.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 And when... I was talking to Sabine about it and she goes,

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 "We're going to have a whole generation of kids who miss that vital window of reading."

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Right? There's that time period where you start picking up books yourselves

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 and you're going to the library and you're kind of looking around,

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 or you have a teacher who's giving you books and things like that

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 and talking to your peers about certain books.

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 She said, "We're going to have this whole time period where kids are going to miss out.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 We're going to have a generation of kids who aren't readers."

167
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 It's really weird. Like, those are...

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Yesterday I talked about the COVID lockdowns and things like that

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 and the side effect with the depression and suicide,

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 but it's even more wide ranging than that.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 This isn't a criticism. I'm not saying that COVID-19 is false or it's fake or none of that stuff.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I'm just saying it's interesting because now that it's gone on for so long,

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 we can start to really think about the long-term ramifications.

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 These kids who are six months to a year right now or younger,

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 how are they going to be when they're 25?

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Because they missed out on crucial brain-building skills by looking at people's faces.

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 When you have a whole generation of people who just can't tell when you're mad at them

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 or when you're having a good time with them and they're looking at your face

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 and they just can't tell the difference.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 So when you're saying, "Hey, no, I really need some space right now, buddy.

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I don't know what you're doing there. They don't know how to read faces."

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 I mean, I guess they can still hear.

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 They're like, "Oh, you're telling me you want to hug?"

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 You're like, "No, no!" I guess they can still understand the language.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 But you know what I mean. You know what I mean. There's a lot of stuff going on here.

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Nick, let's fire up that carbonicopter.

187
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 We're going to put little baby, Mongo Junior.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 He's going to play in the back of the carbonicopter.

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 We're going to put little child-proof doors on the side.

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I always imagine the carbonicopter had like huge bay doors that are open

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 and all the listeners are just hanging with their feet hanging out or something.

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Everyone, it is your job to protect this baby.

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Little Mongo Junior is having a ball.

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 We are flying out to New York City.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 This has been the big new story for the month

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 and it's funny because this story popped up right before I went on vacation

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 and then, like I could have predicted, just disappeared, right?

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Have you heard about it recently?

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Have you heard about it recently?

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 In our circles, maybe.

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 But when it first popped out, like, Fox News was covering it.

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 New York Times was the first people to cover it, but Fox News was covering it.

203
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 You had, I saw it pop up all over the internet.

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I don't know if I ever specifically saw it on CNN.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 I do believe they mentioned it a couple times.

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 But New York Times was kind of headlining this.

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 I saw it, I believe, like in The Guardian.

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 I go to a new website called News, which is a news aggregator.

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Judge Report was running with it, all that stuff.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 So what happened was, Pentagon's like, "We don't believe anything about all this UFO nonsense."

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Like, we've looked into it and yeah, there's like 5% or 1% or something.

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And we can't explain, but we're not going to waste our time working with this stuff anymore.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Nerds and the Pentagon is like, they took their ball and they went home, basically.

214
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Because we can all investigate UFOs on some level,

215
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 but the highest military level of the United States was like, shops closed.

216
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Recently, a Senate committee was doing a report that was outlining,

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 and spinning on intelligence agencies.

218
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And you know, with report, a lot of times you have the flashy reporters

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 that are like knocking on the president's door and getting scoops and stuff like that.

220
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 But really, most reporters, because that was my major, was journalism.

221
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 That's what made degrees.

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And you'd have cool reporters who did the police beat,

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 and then you had LAMO reporters who did the city council beat.

224
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And you had to go to all the meetings.

225
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I've had to cover a couple of those, and you're just like, "Ugh, just sleeping there."

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 That's how this story broke.

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Someone was sitting at a Senate committee for spinning on intelligence agencies,

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 and it turned out that when the Pentagon stopped covering this,

229
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 so maybe a couple years past, the Office of Naval Intelligence opened a program

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 called the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force.

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 It was not announced.

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 This was not announced at all. It was something they did.

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And then someone just saw it was on a sheet of money that was being spent.

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So like those old-timey movies, the reporter ran to the pay phone, put a quarter in,

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 and then goes, "Wait a second, I have a cell phone."

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 He walks out and tries to get his quarter back, pulls out a cell phone.

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 "Hey, boss, you won't believe this."

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And then the headline spin and...

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 New York Times newspaper has this article, "No longer in shadows,

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Pentagon's UFO unit will make some findings public."

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 This was written by Ralph Blumenthal and Leslie Keane.

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 This article came out July 23, 2020.

243
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It's an interesting read, but it's basically policy-wunk stuff.

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 It's basically like it used to do this, and now it's with this place,

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 and the Pentagon's saying it's shuffling.

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 This became a huge story because really the end of the story was this.

247
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 This was what you saw get quoted a lot.

248
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Out of context. We're going to talk about this.

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Oh, and let me say this too before I read this quote.

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 The Pentagon shut down their program, but they were still working on it.

251
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 They said they had shut it down, but then they took their ball,

252
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 they went home, and then they're just playing with the ball

253
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 in the Pentagon where no one can see.

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 So they did say they shut it down, but that's going to turn out not to be true.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Let me read you this quote.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 "Eric W. Davis, an astrophysicist who worked as a subcontractor

257
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 and then a consultant for the Pentagon UFO program since 2007,

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 said that in some cases, examination of the materials

259
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 had so far failed to determine their source

260
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 and led him to conclude we couldn't make it ourselves."

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Here's another quote from that same article.

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 "Mr. Davis, who now works for Aerospace Corporation,

263
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 a defense contractor, said he gave a classified briefing

264
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 to a Defense Department agency as recently as March 2020,

265
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 as recently as March about retrievals from, quote,

266
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 'off-world vehicles not made on this Earth.'"

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 That was what was thrown all over the Internet.

268
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 The New York Times reports crashed UFO materials found.

269
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 The headline was much shorter than that, but you know what I mean?

270
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 New York Times reports we have recovered UFO activity.

271
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 That's not really what this article says.

272
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 That's what he says.

273
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Now, he says this, and the article, by repeating it, is saying it,

274
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 we run into this a lot.

275
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I am always looking through paranormal subreddits.

276
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I see this all over the place.

277
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 People will go, "CIA acknowledges truth of astral projection."

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 That's referring to what's-- I see that all the time.

279
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 That's referring to a specific story.

280
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 The CIA did have a document that was classified for a long time.

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 They declassified it about a guy who astrally traveled back in time

282
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 to Mars and was going-- it was just reams and reams and reams

283
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 of documents, how he's floating around on Mars,

284
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 seeing this ancient civilization.

285
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 The CIA has copies of this podcast.

286
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 The CIA has copies of every article of every newspaper published.

287
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 CIA's have copies of almost all mass media, and they dig through it.

288
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And so what happens is, let's say, 50 years from now,

289
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 they're like, "Let's declassify lot J."

290
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And it's basically everything they've ever correlated

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 on people with the name starting with J.

292
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 They just were like, "We don't need to declassify this stuff anymore."

293
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And then someone goes, "A dead rabbit radio must have been speaking the full truth

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 because the CIA confirmed it."

295
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 We did the story a long time ago, actually.

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 There's a UFO in Antarctica that was attacking the KGB

297
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 and it turned a bunch of them into concrete pillars.

298
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 It was absolutely ridiculous.

299
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And people were saying, "CIA confirms this is real because the CIA had that article."

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Because they're like, "What?"

301
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 So they take it, they classify it, they read it, and they go, "That's dumb."

302
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 But they're not going to immediately declassify it.

303
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 They have a process.

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 So that's what that is.

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 So just because this stuff is coming out, or somebody is saying this stuff,

306
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 one, it doesn't mean that the Pentagon is confirming it.

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Definitely it doesn't mean they're denying it either.

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 It doesn't even mean that the New York Times is saying,

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 "Well, we confirm that alien craft have crashed."

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 When I read this article, I go, "Oh, okay, some guy who's probably a hundred times smarter than I am,

311
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 who's worked in an industry that's very, very specific to this, is making that statement."

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 That's fair, and that's fine, and that's awesome that he feels comfortable coming out and saying that.

313
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 We look at all the ridicule, we've talked about UFO disclosure brought about before.

314
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 That's great, great job.

315
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 But it doesn't mean the New York Times is reporting that.

316
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 What the New York Times is reporting is one person saying this.

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I would have left it at that, but if the New York Times is almost like they were reading my mind,

318
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 they had a follow-up article which didn't get pressed.

319
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 It was about five days later, July 28th, 2020.

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 This article to me is infinitely more interesting than the first article,

321
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 because it's been a long time people have been making claims about crashed UFOs.

322
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 These stories have been reported in the media.

323
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Five days later, we have this article from the New York Times.

324
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 This is written by the same two people, Ralph Blumenfall and Leslie Keane.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 This is this article.

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Do we believe in UFOs?

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 That's the wrong question.

328
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Let me read you a little bit of this article.

329
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 This is the beginning of the article.

330
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 This is actually from a section called Times Insider.

331
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 These are the reporters talking about the story behind the stories.

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Very, very fascinating.

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Here's this beginning quote.

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 "We're often asked by well-meaning associates and readers, do you believe in UFOs?"

335
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 "The question sets us aback as being inappropriately personal.

336
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Times reporters are particularly averse to revealing opinions that could imply possible reporting bias.

337
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 But in this case, we have no problem responding.

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 No, we do not believe in UFOs."

339
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Wait for it.

340
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Next sentence.

341
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 "As we see it, their existence or non-existence is not a matter of belief."

342
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 That's interesting.

343
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 "You have my attention, Arthur.

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 What do you mean by that?"

345
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 They then quote Margaret Mead, who was this famous anthropologist.

346
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 She was asked the same question back in 1974.

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Here's her quote.

348
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 "Belief has to do with matters of faith.

349
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It has nothing to do with the kind of knowledge that is based on scientific inquiry.

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Do people believe in the sun or the moon or the changing seasons or the chairs they're sitting on?

351
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 When we want to understand something strange, something previously unknown to anyone,

352
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 we have to begin with an entirely different set of questions.

353
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 What is it?

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 How does it work?"

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 They're making the claim to say, "Do I believe in UFOs?"

356
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 and Margaret Mead is saying the same thing, is almost a misworded question.

357
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Because you believe in that door that's sitting in front of you, right?

358
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 You believe in the clothes that are on your body or the skin on your body if you're naked.

359
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 We believe in it.

360
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 If someone walked in and says, "Do you believe in the floor?"

361
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 You'd be like, "What?"

362
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Because you know it's there.

363
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 So they're saying, "New York Times is basically saying that's the wrong question.

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 We are not asking whether or not UFOs are real.

365
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 We have to start looking at them as they are real.

366
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 How do they work?

367
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 What do they do?

368
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Where do they come from?"

369
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 That's a very bold statement to come from the New York Times.

370
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 That is not some guy giving a presentation.

371
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 This is the New York Times.

372
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 These are these two authors.

373
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And these articles go through massive revisions.

374
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 The editors have to look at everything.

375
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 It goes through all different levels.

376
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 This is the New York Times through these two authors saying the question of whether or not they exist isn't even a...

377
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 It's kind of a dumb question at this point.

378
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Does the sun exist?

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Yes.

380
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 How does the sun work?

381
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Why does heat come from the sun?

382
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 So on and so forth.

383
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Those are the type of questions we're asking.

384
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 They then show in this article, and it's interesting they didn't show it in the first article.

385
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Again, this is almost like a double down.

386
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 They then show an unclassified slide from a group known as the AATIP group.

387
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 That was actually the group in the Pentagon that was looking at anomalous aerial vehicles and stuff like that.

388
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 So here's this slide that was published in New York Times.

389
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Twofold nature of threat.

390
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 First one is current threat.

391
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Advanced aerospace vehicles, or AAV phenomenon of foreign derivation, including off-world being globally deployed, tested, including in the continental United States.

392
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Number two is future threat.

393
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Potential terrestrial adversaries achieving significant breakthroughs in the development of game-changing disruptive technologies based on evaluations of AAV phenomenon

394
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 from sensor data or crashed and retrieved materials.

395
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Just because this was presented to the Pentagon doesn't mean the Pentagon totally agrees with it, right?

396
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 You could go and do a presentation saying strawberry ice cream is the best ice cream ever.

397
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Everyone disagrees.

398
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 You get boot out of there.

399
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 The slide gets the classified.

400
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It gets published in the New York Times.

401
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Just because this is at a Pentagon meeting does not mean that the Pentagon agrees with it.

402
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 But that is that language that they're talking about foreign vehicles, including off-world is the specific term used in that.

403
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And then the future threat of another country just based on sensor data being able to figure out what these things are.

404
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Not whether or not they exist, but what they are, where they're from.

405
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 And more importantly, how they work.

406
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Government doesn't care if it's from the bottom of the ocean, from the moon, or from Kansas.

407
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 They want to know why it's beating all of their fighter jets.

408
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 They want to know how it's able to fly over military bases undetected.

409
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 They really don't care.

410
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Obviously it'd be more exciting if it came from the moon than from Kansas.

411
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 But at the end of the day, they want to know how they work.

412
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 The article ends with this.

413
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 This is that second article ends with this.

414
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Quote, "Our sources," which are unnamed, "Our sources tell us that AAV does not refer to vehicles made in any country."

415
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Not Russian or Chinese.

416
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 "But is used to mean technology in the realm of the truly unexplained."

417
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 "They also assure us that their briefings are based on facts, not belief."

418
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Unquote.

419
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 So this isn't an issue of someone going, "I believe that these things are doing this."

420
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 It's that I believe that an adversary could use sensor data or crash materials to get an upper hand on us.

421
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 They're saying, "This is happening."

422
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 So we're walking out of the New York Times.

423
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 It's a bright, sunny New York day.

424
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Little Mungo Jr. is going to go order some hot dogs for us.

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I mean a hot dog.

426
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 I don't know what you eat.

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Mungo got you whatever food you like to eat.

428
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 He's also a genie now.

429
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Little Mungo Jr. is a gin.

430
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 We're sitting.

431
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 It's a beautiful day in New York City.

432
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 We're sitting on a bench.

433
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 You turn to me and you go, "Hey, Jason."

434
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 You said you had something interesting.

435
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I mean this segment was very interesting.

436
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 You just want to guess it's so good.

437
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I mean I just got to tell you that and I'm flushing.

438
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Aw.

439
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 You're like, "But you kept saying you had something interesting to say about that."

440
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Something that was kind of different than the articles.

441
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 You read us the articles.

442
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 So what else do you have to add to this thing?

443
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second.

444
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Let's look back at the original articles.

445
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Some quotes here.

446
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 "Mr. Davis, who now works for the Aerospace Corporation Defense Contractor,

447
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 said he gave a classified briefing to a Defense Department agency as recently as March

448
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 about retrievals from off-world vehicles not made on this Earth."

449
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 There's another passage here later in the article.

450
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 "Mr. Elizondo is among..."

451
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 It's referring to Luis Elizondo.

452
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 He also worked with the Pentagon's program.

453
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 It was the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.

454
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 That's what AATIP meant that I was referencing earlier.

455
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 "Mr. Elizondo is among a small group of former government officials and scientists

456
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 with security clearance, who, without presenting physical proof, say they are convinced

457
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 that objects of undetermined origin have crashed on Earth with materials retrieved for study."

458
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Those are both very bold statements, obviously.

459
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 But there's something that I picked up on because I'm a journalism nerd.

460
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 "New York Times has a style guide."

461
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Really, all newspapers have a style guide.

462
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 A lot of them use the AP style guide, Associated Press style guide.

463
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It's basically how things are formatted, how things are worded, capitalization, punctuation, things like that.

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I have a style guide for my podcast every episode.

465
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 EP, number of episodes, space dash, space title.

466
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 That's a style guide I've developed.

467
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Every episode has that same format.

468
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Each letter of the word of the title is capitalized.

469
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 That's a style guide I decided on episode one.

470
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Because I'm a journalism nerd.

471
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 So when I was setting all that stuff up, you need to have consistency.

472
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 You need to have a reason why you capitalize this word, don't capitalize that word,

473
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 why you use this type of stuff.

474
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 "New York Times style guide, it says that the Earth, Moon, and Sun generally are lowercase.

475
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 However, you capitalize when used as the proper noun of the planet."

476
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Lowercase, Moon, and Sun in all references.

477
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 That's what it says in the New York Times style guide.

478
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 "Both times, off-world vehicles not made of this Earth, lowercase e.

479
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Undetermined origin have crashed on Earth, lowercase e.

480
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 That's not a coincidence.

481
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 That's not a coincidence.

482
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 They lowercase that e for a reason.

483
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Earth means one of two things.

484
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 The planet, or dirt, not made on this dirt, not made on this soil.

485
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Objects of undetermined origin have crashed on soil, on dirt.

486
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 They did not capitalize Earth as a proper noun for a reason.

487
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 What is that reason?

488
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 I don't know.

489
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 But I think it's a bit of a clue as to where I'm going with this.

490
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 CIA, when you do put this in your library, don't arrest me if this is actually true.

491
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Conspiracy cap fully on.

492
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 This article came out.

493
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 He got a bunch of clicks.

494
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 These type of articles come out every so often, right?

495
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 And people are like, the world goes, "Oh, that's interesting."

496
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And then they go back to the normal life.

497
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And then UFO researchers go, "Whoa, that's phenomenal."

498
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And they continue to carry the torch until the next big breakthrough.

499
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 So these articles aren't rare.

500
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 The fact that it's coming from the New York Times, the fact that people are being quoted at fairly high levels,

501
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 and the fact that they did a follow-up saying, "Oh, no, no, no.

502
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 The question whether or not we believe in UFOs is almost insulting.

503
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 You believe in a religion.

504
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Physical matter is a fact."

505
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 It's a totally different set of questions.

506
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 This is my hypothesis, ladies and gentlemen.

507
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 These articles were not meant for us.

508
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 They were put out publicly.

509
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 We were able to read to them and have a good time reading them.

510
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 This article was a warning for three people.

511
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 The governments of the United States, Russia, and China.

512
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 An advanced aerospace vehicle has crashed somewhere on this planet,

513
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 but not in any of their territories.

514
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 That's always the thing, right?

515
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 I mean, I guess it's because all the movies come out of Hollywood,

516
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 but the idea of the Roswell crash or UFOs meeting the president

517
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 or UFOs invading the United States,

518
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 why couldn't it crash in Brazil where they did have a UFO crash recently?

519
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Crash in Bolivia, in Mexico, in Lithuania, Somalia, Libya, Madagascar.

520
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 I mean, why not?

521
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 It's a big planet.

522
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 It's not including anywhere in the ocean.

523
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Game-changing technology.

524
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 You could say, "Well, what if ISIS found a crashed UFO?"

525
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 There you go. There's your idea for your science fiction novel you can write

526
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 during your fall break.

527
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 But any government that this crashed in front of

528
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 would automatically become a superpower.

529
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Even if you could barely figure it out, you're a superpower.

530
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Even if you're only able to reverse engineer 10% of an off-world vehicle,

531
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 you're a superpower now.

532
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 You can't even get even more of it if you can really dig into it

533
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 and figure out how it works.

534
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 You're the superpower.

535
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 You would redefine the term superpower on this planet.

536
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 You would be the only power on this planet.

537
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 See, we always have stories about, "Oh, the United States has reversed engineered this vehicle,"

538
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 but we never see any proof of it.

539
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 And when asked for proof, people go, "Well, the government's hiding that proof."

540
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Well, I believe these articles are coming out now

541
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 because it either recently happened or a government,

542
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 not of those three, has recently figured out more than we know.

543
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 This is the way that subterfuge works, right?

544
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 This is the way this type of stuff works.

545
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 You have in the old days, back when you had the Berlin Wall and stuff like that,

546
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 I'm sure they still do it today, spy, spy art, whatever it is, spy fare, something like that.

547
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 You put classified ads in newspapers, people look at it, people know what the code is.

548
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 All this stuff that crazy people in the '60s are like, "Oh, my God, look at this. I can see this pattern."

549
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 People are like, "No, you're crazy." They would actually do stuff like that.

550
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 They'd put stuff on internet forums that you would never think to go.

551
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 If you're not going to go to a Buffy fan forum in 2020, you might.

552
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 It was a pretty good show.

553
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 But you could have one set up and it looks like you're talking about Buffy stuff

554
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 and it's really two agents discussing where they're going to have to drop off this USB drive.

555
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 They have all sorts of these codes.

556
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 That's what Tor was originally invented for, was to allow me to go into a coffee shop in Istanbul

557
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 and send a message to my handler in Berlin and it could never get traced back to me.

558
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Tor was invented by the US government to be able to pass spy secrets.

559
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 You can go to an internet coffee shop in any country and send documents.

560
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 It would just be super slow. It would be almost like dial-up speed.

561
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 All that stuff was invented for. Spycraft.

562
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 And then you have more spectacular Spycraft, which I don't...

563
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Spycraft might be the wrong term for what this article is doing, but I think this article...

564
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 This information is being put out very, very selectively.

565
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And instead of sending someone over to Russia, and they may have...

566
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 America may have sent someone over to Russia and be like, "Hey, we think something's going on."

567
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 "We think something's going on in Panama."

568
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 "We think they retrieve something."

569
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Put this article out.

570
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And it's for all of us to consume, but it's for a small group of people to really perk their ears up and go...

571
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 "That's not good. That is not good."

572
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 I don't believe Blumenfall and Keen are masterminds of some plot.

573
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 I don't believe the people that I quoted in the article are masterminds of some plot.

574
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I think that the fact that this information is being put out in such a public and splashy way is very curious.

575
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Now, that was with conspiracy caps fully on.

576
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 There is some interesting details in that.

577
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 The timing is weird. The fact that they didn't capitalize. The earth thing is weird.

578
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 But could have been an editorial error twice.

579
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 You could have changed their style guide and then not updated it in where I got it.

580
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Right? That's the more logical explanation.

581
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 The more logical explanation... This is the most logical explanation, actually.

582
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 New York Times, some reporter was sitting at a Senate hearing, half asleep, and got wind of a story, published it.

583
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 They got a ton of clicks and they go, "Hey, man, in for a penny."

584
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And they republished a new article about the same subject with a little more new information.

585
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 You got more clicks. That's the most logical explanation, right? It was just clickbait.

586
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 But I just think everything, when we're taken into the whole of things, it's a little more interesting, a little more fascinating than that.

587
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 We always see these sci-fi stories of alien ships coming down, of humanity waging a valiant war against them.

588
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Sometimes they lose in the story, sometimes they win.

589
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 It's always a bloody struggle. Mankind united against an invader.

590
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 But there's another story that's not as often discussed.

591
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Now it pops to my head where UFO does crash on planet Earth, and a small, almost unnoticed country comes in possession of it.

592
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 While trying to reverse engineer the craft, you have CIA agents trying to infiltrate the ranks.

593
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 You have KGB agents trying to assassinate scientists, trying to get to the vehicle themselves.

594
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 They're able to thwart both of them and successfully reverse engineer the alien technology.

595
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 In this scenario, it wouldn't be a threat from outer space.

596
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 This was a one in a million, one in a trillion chance.

597
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 A UFO flying through the galaxy, crashes on Earth.

598
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 It's a crap shoe that we'd land on soil versus going deep inside the ocean.

599
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 In this story, the threat, while starting from outer space, is from our own species.

600
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 A technologically dominant, almost magical force suddenly appears.

601
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 We could try to fight them off. Combined, our combined might, humanity may be able to fight off a nation with alien technology.

602
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Or we may not. We may be conquered within a matter of weeks.

603
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 By a country previously you couldn't even find on a map. It's now the capital of the planet.

604
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 We like to think about lizard man shapeshifters and gray aliens experimenting on people.

605
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 But humans with alien technology might be the most dangerous foe humanity will ever face.

606
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
