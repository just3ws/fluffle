1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
 It's been one day, so of course now we have more conspiracies about the death of a young

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,280
 rapper.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,040
 Why listening to an anonymous poster on 4chan could ruin your life?

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,000
 And US fighter pilots have a close encounter of the churned kind today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,200
 Oh you have no idea how many times I recorded that intro.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,800
 My name is Jason Carpenter, this is Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,320
 You know this is one of those days where it's like "hey what do you want to do for a hobby?"

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
 "Oh I'm gonna do a podcast."

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,120
 "When do you want to start it?"

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
 "June."

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,600
 You know you can't run any fans or have any sort of air conditioning units while you're

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
 recording.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,120
 Oh yeah yeah and I know, I know.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,760
 It's 91 degrees.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,360
 It's 10 o'clock at night.

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,840
 I'm sweating.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,640
 It's like recording in a swamp.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,080
 But you know, what are you gonna do?

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
 It could be worse.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,520
 I could still be in California.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,240
 I'm up in the ever so docile yet stunningly dark town of Hood River.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,120
 It's very creepy here.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,120
 I think I might have to dedicate a whole week to episodes about Hood River.

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,680
 It's something off here.

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,960
 You can always tell there's something bad in a neighborhood or in a town when there's

26
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,440
 a lot of churches.

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,260
 There's a lot of churches in Hood River.

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:43,800
 We have a population of about 10,000 people and just off the top of my head there's maybe

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,560
 10 churches.

30
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,080
 And there was a pause there because it's just, I mean that's a church for every thousand

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
 people.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,200
 I lived in Sacramento when I was in California.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,920
 Millions of people live there.

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,640
 There was a ton of churches but when you have millions of people you're gonna have tons

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
 of churches.

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,800
 Some churches are going to have 10 members.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,380
 10 churches are going to have, you know, five, six hundred members.

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,940
 I think Crystal Cathedral was down there, something like that.

39
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,340
 Hood River has, I'd say about 10 churches and you have like the Latter-day Saints and

40
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:23,300
 you have the Jehovah's Witness Temple and then you have, you know, the Protestant breakaways,

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,780
 the Seventh-day Adventists and the Baptist and so on and so on.

42
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,140
 We have three Mason lodges all within about two blocks of each other.

43
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,760
 That's weird.

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,400
 So yeah, it's just weird.

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,240
 I always say that if you have, if you go to a town there's a lot of churches there.

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,280
 That means people have a need to repent more.

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,480
 I don't know, I'm rambling now.

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,960
 The heat's getting to me.

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,640
 The heat's getting to me.

50
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,400
 So we're gonna try to get this going quickly.

51
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,720
 So let's go ahead and start off with the story about, again, a young rapper whose name I'm

52
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,920
 sure I mispronouncing, extension on.

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,340
 Of course, it's only been a little bit over 24 hours.

54
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,500
 We're already getting more conspiracy theories about the death of extension.

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,540
 It's coming out, you know, of course the Drake theory seems to be the leading one.

56
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,260
 That photo I talked about the last episode with Drake engaged in a homosexual act, oral

57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,260
 copulation with another man, that picture has been getting more traction and when I

58
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,820
 saw it, it was cropped kind of a, kind of suggestively when extension put it on his

59
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,520
 Twitter, it was kind of cropped and now I've seen kind of the full photo and there is a

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,600
 dick in this young man's mouth.

61
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,520
 I don't know if it's Drake or what, but it looks like Drake.

62
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,880
 Anyways, so this is the other, and this is the thing I've always found that's interesting

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
 with conspiracy theories.

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,000
 You'll have an event, an event that happens.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,880
 And some people, a weird thing with conspiracy theories is now people have started debating

66
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,600
 whether or not the event has happened in the first place.

67
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,700
 Or an event happens and then you have an initial conspiracy theory come out about it and then

68
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,060
 the conspiracy theories get odder and odder as time goes on.

69
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,740
 So for example JFK gets shot, that's an incident that has actually absolutely happened.

70
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:15,540
 The first conspiracy theories were things like it was Russia who was behind it.

71
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,980
 And then as you start to bring, as you start to pull back through time, you start to get

72
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,980
 stuff where no, it was the mafia.

73
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,920
 That wasn't an initial, that wasn't one of the initial big theories.

74
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
 You had to give it a little bit of a distance there.

75
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,400
 And as time has gone on even further, even further, you start having stuff like, "Oh

76
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,320
 no, he got killed because he was going to reveal the existence of aliens."

77
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,720
 So the conspiracy theories tend to start off fairly close to home.

78
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,560
 And then as time goes on, they spread out.

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,720
 9/11, the initial conspiracy theories was, it was an inside job.

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,860
 It was controlled demolition because of the way that the towers fell.

81
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,900
 And then give it, and about six months a year after that, it became hologram, the planes

82
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,220
 are holograms and they were destroyed by a laser from space.

83
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,020
 If that was the first conspiracy theory that had gained traction with 9/11, people would

84
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,420
 have dismissed it outright.

85
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,540
 It's almost like the slippery slope of arguments for conspiracy theories.

86
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,620
 The first ones are always relatively plausible.

87
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:23,800
 So let's say that it is plausible that X, I'm just going to call him X now, X tweeted

88
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,080
 that thing about Drake and then Drake killed him.

89
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,260
 That's a plausible conspiracy.

90
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,960
 It's still a conspiracy, but that's a plausible one.

91
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
 It's been one day.

92
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,320
 And you know, to go back to my thing, the cycle has sped up because conspiracy theories have

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,480
 become so mainstream now.

94
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
 The cycle has sped up.

95
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,160
 When it used to take months or years for the conspiracy theories to get wacky, they've

96
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,420
 definitely sped up.

97
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,660
 I came across this post today.

98
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,420
 The headline is "Extension was killed by demons."

99
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,260
 I'm almost certain, this is not my words, this is what he's saying, I'm almost certain

100
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:12,980
 Extension was killed by the Grand Pontiff of Hell, Balbarath, or Ba-- I don't think it's

101
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,240
 Balbarath, Ba-- Barath or Bulfry.

102
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,200
 And then it says, "Barath is a demon who grants material success, turns base metals

103
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,800
 into gold, and enhances musical performance, but is also a notorious liar and trickster.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,200
 He also shapeshifts."

105
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,400
 No, no, no citation for this.

106
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,720
 I don't know why I'm surprised there's no citation for this, that I can't actually look

107
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,440
 this up.

108
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,320
 He grants material success, turns base metals into gold.

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,840
 That's kind of redundant.

110
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,780
 But anyways, and here's his evidence.

111
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,380
 He actually entitles this next passage some evidence.

112
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,180
 "Barath appears wearing red.

113
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,900
 Exes killers were alleged to have been wearing red masks.

114
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,980
 On a horse, the killing was a drive-by.

115
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,060
 Barath is the most powerful Monday evening at night.

116
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,620
 Ex was killed on a Monday afternoon."

117
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,340
 I don't know how that plays because he's the most powerful evening at night.

118
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,880
 "During the month of June, according to Christian lore, Barath is associated with murder and

119
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
 blasphemy."

120
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:22,280
 I-- We're past the looking glass, people.

121
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,000
 We have entered a reality where some people are going to take this seriously.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,560
 And I guess we've always been there.

123
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,800
 But because of the internet, this stuff's going to fly around incredibly fast.

124
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,900
 I believe that this post here-- This is the way conspiracy theories didn't really work.

125
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,300
 This post is going to go up.

126
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,920
 It's going to disappear probably in the next 24 or 48 hours.

127
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,260
 And then maybe two, three weeks from now, you're going to start seeing more and more

128
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,520
 people talking about this.

129
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,820
 He was killed by the occult.

130
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,820
 He was killed by a demon.

131
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,020
 It's almost like you throw the seed out there and then it just kind of disappears at first

132
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,820
 and then other people take root because here's the thing.

133
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,420
 When you post it, people are going to look at it and go, "That's in it.

134
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,740
 That doesn't make any sense."

135
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,640
 So it disappears and then people start talking about it.

136
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,720
 And they-- Every time-- Every time you talk about it, the details change a bit.

137
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,080
 So then what will happen is six weeks from now, someone will go, "Oh, yeah, you know,

138
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:21,040
 I think-- I read this thing a while back that said that X was killed by a demon because

139
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,720
 this demon only operates during the June afternoons."

140
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,480
 And he was killed during June afternoon.

141
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,240
 People go, "Oh, man, that is a weird coincidence."

142
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,180
 Like the same demon who's known for being-- bringing about rap success only operates

143
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,180
 in June afternoons.

144
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,620
 And they're like, "Oh, yeah, that-- See how the information changes?"

145
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,420
 He-- The information this person norm-- norm first puts off enhanced musical performance

146
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
 during the nights, during June.

147
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,780
 All that stuff will get changed.

148
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,300
 And I've seen it with almost every conspiracy theory.

149
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,740
 I've seen it with almost every conspiracy theory.

150
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,040
 The initial conspiracy is put out and then the information is changed.

151
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,200
 So generally that's what happens.

152
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,400
 Someone spouts off a conspiracy theory that's half-assed and over time it becomes even more

153
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,320
 half-assed when people start adding into leading things that coa-- you know, work better with

154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,640
 the theory.

155
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,280
 That's generally how these things work.

156
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,960
 They grow over time.

157
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,640
 They're fairly organic because they don't rely on a core set of facts.

158
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,740
 The core set of facts is X got killed on June 18th.

159
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,500
 That's the fact.

160
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,260
 Everything else you can kind of throw in there.

161
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,180
 "Oh, they're wearing--" You know, okay, here's one.

162
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,180
 They said it was a car and it was like riding a horse watch.

163
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:42,100
 The car will turn into a Mustang or the car will have some sort of Mustang decal or it

164
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,620
 will tie it in closer to that horse imagery.

165
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,860
 We'll see these conspiracies grow over-- around this.

166
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,960
 So I mean, that's one of the things that I think is fascinating about conspiracy theories.

167
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,640
 It is very like-- you can watch them evolve over time.

168
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,480
 I think they're fairly dangerous.

169
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,680
 And that's what's going to lead us into our next segment.

170
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,200
 Now I did an episode a couple-- I know we're on episode nine, but it was, I think episode

171
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,720
 five or six where I was talking about the anti-Trump resistance rap with the little

172
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,600
 girls and was garbage.

173
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,560
 Now in the sake of fairness-- and I blasted them because they were using it so merchandise--

174
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,140
 in the sake of fairness, I came across this article the other day and this is an unfortunate

175
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,900
 story and it shows the problem and this happens on both sides of the divide.

176
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,420
 But it's particularly interesting with this.

177
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:39,300
 So there, if you're familiar with 4chan at all, there is currently a poster on 4chan

178
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,380
 called Q or QAnon, but it's Q is what he goes by, or she.

179
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,840
 This to be a top level-- actually doesn't really claim much, just kind of leaks out

180
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
 information.

181
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,000
 Q is a top secret, like a really high-secret security clearance.

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,080
 People have postulated that Q is Baron Trump or Jared Kushner or Steve Bannon or Trump

183
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,680
 himself, but whoever this person is has dropped hints and basically said that Robert Moller

184
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,180
 is working with Donald Trump to drain the swamp, that this whole investigation is a

185
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:20,440
 way for him to get into the FBI's files and root out all of this stuff because if Trump

186
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,320
 tried investigating Hillary Clinton and Locker up and all of that stuff, he'd be stymied.

187
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,240
 So what they do is they created this controlled opposition.

188
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,640
 So Robert Moller is like, "I'm going to get you Trump.

189
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,080
 FBI, give me all your files so I can pin Trump."

190
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
 And they're like, "Yeah, sure."

191
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,880
 And then he's going through them and he's like, "Hillary Clinton did this wrong, Obama

192
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,240
 did this wrong, Loretta Lynch did this wrong, Comey did this wrong."

193
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,660
 And then there's these mass arrests.

194
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,420
 I go back to what I said yesterday.

195
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,380
 Sometimes it's nice to live in this world.

196
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,740
 Yesterday I was talking about sci-fi world, but you live in this world where it's good

197
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,780
 versus evil and there's clear battle lines and the bad guys live in a smoking volcano.

198
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,620
 They're good guys wear shining armor and in the end the good guys win and the bad guys

199
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,620
 are punished.

200
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,300
 That's not really the way the world works.

201
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,460
 The bad guys don't live in a smoking volcano.

202
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,720
 Everyone is on a sliding scale.

203
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,320
 But these people want to believe this Q story because it just, one, it takes away the fear

204
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,960
 of, "Oh crap, Robert Moller is digging hard on Trump."

205
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,320
 And if you dig hard enough on anyone, you're going to find something.

206
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,840
 And then someone goes, "Don't be afraid though.

207
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,000
 Robert Moller's on our side.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,960
 See, don't be afraid.

209
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
 He's with us."

210
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,360
 So it takes away that stress of reading the newspaper, assuming they read the newspaper,

211
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,580
 but reading the newspaper and being like, "Oh man, you know, Manafort got caught and, you

212
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,340
 know, all this stuff."

213
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,900
 So it gives a nice narrative.

214
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,580
 It's basically saying, "Shh, you know, don't be afraid.

215
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
 Don't be afraid."

216
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,580
 It's a nice narrative.

217
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,780
 It's a nice narrative to think that the people who you perceive are the bad guys will be

218
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,940
 thrown in jail and the good guys will be thrown in jail.

219
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,620
 Disregarding what an absolute chaos that would send America into if a bunch of political

220
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,940
 opponents were jailed, it wouldn't work out.

221
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,800
 I almost think that even if Hillary Clinton and Obama had done a bunch of illegal stuff,

222
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,000
 it wouldn't be worth it to throw them in jail.

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,200
 But anyways, I'm getting off topic because Q has been going on saying this, and it's

224
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:27,480
 gone to the point where the inspector general had a report coming out, and Trump was of

225
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,520
 course chiming in, and he's like, "Do you better not water down that report."

226
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,620
 And you know, the worry was that Q was right, that this inspector general's report was

227
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,100
 going to come out, and it was going to prove that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were

228
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,720
 totally crooked and all of this stuff was going on.

229
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,600
 So why is this, why am I talking about this obviously super political issue on this podcast?

230
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,060
 It's because what happens is when people post stuff online, just like the resistance movement,

231
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,280
 but both of them, but I'm talking specifically about the resistance of light one, the one

232
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,240
 we were talking about yesterday, sucks people in, it sucks people in, and people do stupid

233
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,520
 stuff when they think they're on the right side.

234
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,360
 So this young man, and I'm saying young, he's 30, he's younger than me.

235
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:23,560
 He goes to the Hoover Dam, he's driving an armored vehicle, he parks sideways, so completely

236
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,520
 blocks traffic.

237
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,980
 He holds up a sign that says, "Release the OIG report," which is the office of the inspector

238
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,900
 general.

239
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:42,620
 He's holding the sign up, he's doing that for about an hour, and what's odd is that

240
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,780
 the report was already released.

241
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:51,140
 So this person was most likely under the belief that it was the watered down report, that

242
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,580
 the one that Q had predicted.

243
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,740
 The true report was still out here.

244
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,960
 And this man was going to do the right thing.

245
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,000
 I'm sure as he was planning this, he was daydreaming.

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,560
 He was daydreaming the fact that he's going to block traffic and he's going to hold the

247
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,160
 sign up, and America's going to look and go, "What's the OIG report?"

248
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:16,600
 There's going to be FBI agents rubbing their hands together going, "How do we defeat him?

249
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,720
 How we can't let the sheep will know about the OIG report, but here is this American

250
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,740
 hero, and he's out there for days, and celebrities are like, "Yes, yes, yes," like they're chanting

251
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
 his name.

252
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,240
 He's daydreaming all of this.

253
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,680
 All of the people now recognizing this young man finally as the hero that he knows he is.

254
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,200
 And the report is released.

255
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,480
 And Obama and Clinton and all of the rest are thrown in jail because he got the true

256
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,020
 OIG report released.

257
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,540
 He's a celebrity now.

258
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
 No.

259
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,200
 He's a national hero.

260
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,680
 And so you get those thoughts spinning in your head.

261
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,080
 First you kind of get the seed in your head, and then you start daydreaming about it, and

262
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,280
 then you go do it.

263
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,760
 He's sitting in jail right now.

264
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:14,160
 He was charged with terrorist acts, which is 10 years, just right off the bat if he

265
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
 gets found guilty.

266
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,520
 Terrorist acts, unlawful flight from law enforcement, because what happened was after

267
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,900
 about an hour he took off.

268
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,460
 He crossed state lines.

269
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,460
 That's not good.

270
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:30,140
 Hoover Dam, I believe, is federally controlled, so that he's going to get federal charges

271
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,140
 with that.

272
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,260
 But anyways, unlawful flight from law enforcement, carrying a weapon in the commission of a felony.

273
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,540
 He had a gun and a shotgun, and misconduct involving weapons.

274
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,700
 He also faces a misdemeanor charge of blocking a highway.

275
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,740
 That's the least of his worries.

276
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,640
 This young man is the way I always say, he's taken off the game board.

277
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,800
 He's taken off the game board.

278
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,980
 You have people who are politically active on both sides.

279
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,720
 They get riled up by their leaders who care nothing for them.

280
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,320
 Their only motive is making profit and perpetuating their own power.

281
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,840
 We see this on both sides.

282
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
 Some of them, sure.

283
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:12,360
 Some of them feel, some of them are like, "Yeah, no, I'm doing the right thing."

284
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,540
 And most of them, this is just a way for them to make a buck.

285
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,780
 But anyways, so this young man, he's taken off the game board.

286
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,540
 And when politics, when I say taken off the game board, what you do is you vote.

287
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,040
 You can run for office.

288
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
 You can be political.

289
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,380
 You can be active in the political process.

290
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
 That's done for him.

291
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,960
 And you have that on the other side, too.

292
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,780
 People who are very, very political, getting in fights, and a member of Antifa gets in

293
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,940
 a fight, gets charged with a felony, loses their right to vote.

294
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,940
 They're taken off the game board.

295
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,800
 They're not going to be able to engage in the political process anymore.

296
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 Because this changed nothing.

297
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,400
 Punching someone in the face, it changes nothing.

298
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,640
 I think this is tragic, though, because this young man was going to 4chan or wherever he

299
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,840
 was reading it, most likely 4chan, he's getting his head filled with these ideas from somebody

300
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,460
 who nobody knows if Q is even real, if Q is even one person.

301
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,840
 What we do know is what Q predicted has not come true.

302
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,480
 So my advice to you in that, and I think this is kind of advice going forward, there's very

303
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,280
 few conspiracy theories that I actually believe are true.

304
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,960
 That I'm like, nope, that one's absolutely true.

305
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
 I've researched it.

306
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,080
 I've researched it.

307
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
 That one's true.

308
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,680
 But even the ones I think are true, I'm not like, and now I have to take action.

309
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,760
 Because you can take, you don't have to block a freeway.

310
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,500
 You know, it's done.

311
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 This guy's done.

312
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,620
 And honestly, he'll get persecuted for the fullest extent of the law.

313
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,740
 And 30 years old, he'll probably be in jail for about 10, 12 years.

314
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,540
 Going to have a hard life getting out, getting readjusted.

315
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
 For what?

316
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,100
 Because he thought he was right.

317
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,100
 He thought he was right.

318
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,460
 He didn't have all the information.

319
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
 Sucks.

320
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,960
 Quickly, I think I've gone on too long, but I didn't want to talk about this.

321
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,560
 So I know the other day I was kind of poo-pooing the idea of UFOs.

322
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,000
 And again, I do believe there's unidentified flying objects.

323
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,320
 I do believe there's quote, unquote, alien space vehicles.

324
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,760
 My idea is that I don't think they're from another planet.

325
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,360
 I think they're either from Earth or they're from another dimension.

326
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,060
 So I'm not like, oh no, I'm totally sceptic.

327
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,500
 I have to see everything and believe it and blah, blah, blah.

328
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,180
 I think they're either from Earth and they're a more advanced species than us.

329
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:47,040
 I think they're either from Earth and they are humans, but they have just a certain level

330
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,940
 of technology above us.

331
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,860
 Or that it's from something so remotely alien as in another dimension that we can't interact

332
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,900
 with them in any sort of meaningful way.

333
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:05,280
 I think those three scenarios are far more likely than something on another planet that

334
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,200
 has none of our similar DNA that is completely alien to us in both biology and chemistry

335
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,160
 and mental capacity, building something that we could even recognize as a vehicle.

336
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,520
 Building a box, putting things in that box and moving that box from point A to point B

337
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,640
 is an earthly concept.

338
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
 We do it.

339
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,460
 That is something that is done on Earth.

340
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,100
 The only reason we do it is because we had massive oceans.

341
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,820
 If you lived on a planet that was mostly rivers that you could bridge across, the idea of

342
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,940
 building a box and sending it from point A to point B over a vast distance, that's a

343
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,980
 very, very human thing.

344
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,500
 We do it and do it.

345
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,860
 It's an Earth concept.

346
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,540
 So the fact that you are expecting something that has evolved along a totally different

347
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:02,400
 evolutionary platform to have that same concept, to me, is more ridiculous than something on

348
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,780
 this planet from under the ocean or in the cave system or something like that, who is

349
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,840
 connected to our DNA, is connected to our planet going, "Hey, you know what we need

350
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
 to do?

351
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,680
 We need to build a box and move it from point A to point B."

352
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,400
 That's far more realistic to me.

353
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,280
 So I was reading these articles the other day and it's not super old.

354
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,800
 It's from May.

355
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:29,740
 I found it interesting because we're starting to get these disclosure incidents from the

356
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,740
 -- what was it?

357
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,340
 The U.S. Navy.

358
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,180
 We're finding -- it was the Tic Tac UFO.

359
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,500
 And I'm going to include the link because the video is amazing.

360
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,180
 And generally, when people talk about UFO sightings, we tend to give more credibility

361
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:50,860
 to Air Force pilots, military personnel, police officers for a reason.

362
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,480
 And they tend to, one, be out in weird areas.

363
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,280
 They generally aren't allowed to drink on the job, so a lot of times -- especially airline

364
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,800
 pilots, hopefully not, but -- so their sightings are more credible because they have no substances

365
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,120
 in their system and they're flying all the time.

366
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,520
 They're looking up all the time.

367
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,480
 They're patrolling all the time, so when they see something out of the ordinary and they

368
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,920
 can't explain it, it's more than me going into the woods for the first time in eight

369
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,220
 years and seeing a big thing move by and me going, "Oh, it's a big foot, and it's really

370
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,220
 just a black bear."

371
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,220
 Because I never see him.

372
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,020
 Anyways, so we're starting to get these videos of these fighter pilots chasing these little

373
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,740
 Tic Tac shapes, which is cool enough.

374
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,420
 But when I was reading the article -- and this is where the churned -- time -- the close

375
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,260
 encounters of the churned kind, it took me a while to come up with that.

376
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:49,080
 So this one fighter pilot is chasing this Tic Tac and flying over the ocean.

377
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,880
 And what I thought was amazing was that the fighter pilot's flying over the ocean, he's

378
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,080
 chasing the Tic Tac.

379
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:05,720
 He starts to lose visual on the Tic Tac, and he looks down and he sees in the ocean.

380
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,200
 So the ocean underneath him, the water is churning.

381
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:15,860
 It's just this massive -- it was described as, "Okay, so pilots reported a large disturbance

382
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:21,300
 just under the surface of the ocean, round and hundred yards across.

383
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,860
 It appears if the Tic Tac was rendezvous with the underwater object."

384
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:31,480
 And then it said, "So it's just like this huge churning of water, like the size of a

385
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,780
 football field, just moving through the water."

386
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,220
 And when the pilot came back around, it was -- because it looked like something was submerging,

387
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,480
 the way the water kind of just turns white and bubbles up.

388
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,920
 And the pilot says, "You know, I fly over the ocean all the time."

389
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:52,280
 It was also similar to how shoals, like coral may look, is water -- like, you know, it's

390
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
 kind of sticking up in the water and the water's in it.

391
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,320
 He goes, "But when I came back around, there was nothing there."

392
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,820
 Like he expected to come back around and see that same whiteness and go, "Well, it must

393
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,600
 just be the shoals, but they were gone."

394
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,720
 And our submarine said, "There's nothing there."

395
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,640
 So yeah, and you know, our submarines weren't picking up anything.

396
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,880
 The term "cloaking" was used a couple times in the article.

397
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,320
 So it was just kind of an interesting idea.

398
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,240
 I guess this footage is from back in 2009, and they were saying, "Yeah, in 2009."

399
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,020
 And of course, it was seven F-18 pilots who were part of the statements, as well as radar

400
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,020
 operators on the ships.

401
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,420
 And then it said, "Despite the seriousness of the encounter, the pilots faced ridicule

402
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,980
 after their encounters.

403
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,420
 The Navy's initial report was buried, but not forwarded to command.

404
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,260
 It was decided the AAV, which is the Anonymous Aerial Vehicle, was not a threat."

405
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,660
 So it's another term they're using instead of UFO because it has such a bad meaning to

406
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,860
 it.

407
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,860
 So that's the thing.

408
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,640
 It's like, "Oh man, I was flying, and I saw this tic-tac, and people are going to make

409
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,920
 fun of you, and then they watch the footage, and they're just like, 'Ah, let's just bury

410
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
 it.'

411
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
 It sucks."

412
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,000
 You know, because people do see this stuff, and it makes people not want to come forward,

413
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,720
 and that's always been the big thing, is the government is trying to hide that information

414
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,920
 from us all.

415
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,560
 But again, I think this points more to my theory that if something's underwater, if

416
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,160
 the tic-tac is going to meet up with something underwater, that what's here is from this planet.

417
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,220
 I think that's more likely, and I think the interdimensional thing is second.

418
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,100
 I don't think it's less likely, but it's definitely more likely than, again, aliens coming from

419
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,340
 another planet that's just ridiculous.

420
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:43,060
 It all can be considered ridiculous, but the distances are so great, the idea of them

421
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:49,180
 building to even have ships, they would need to have propulsion systems to develop propulsion

422
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
 systems.

423
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:55,320
 They would have some sort of state of warfare to develop dynamite and explosives, and so

424
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,160
 those are all things that humans have done, and to assume that the same pattern would

425
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,360
 take place on a planet even within the spitting distance of us.

426
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,760
 I mean, of course, across the universe, sure, I'm sure there's aliens on another planet,

427
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,840
 I'm denying that.

428
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,680
 The idea of them building ships and flying here, and ever getting here and being even

429
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,240
 in our same galaxy are so infinitesimally small.

430
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,480
 It's nice to think about, incredibly unlikely.

431
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,660
 Before I go, I did watch a movie, it's kind of the same vein called The Alien Code, it

432
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,500
 came out this year.

433
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 I'm going to give it a half-hearted recommendation.

434
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,060
 I had a great concept, a lot of great visuals, the acting was really good.

435
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,700
 It just, the second act got real rough for me.

436
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,700
 A character shows up out of the blue and does an info dump for about 15 minutes, and then

437
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,740
 the movie kind of carries on from that, but it really lost me.

438
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,040
 It's funny because you can watch a movie, you can be totally into it, and then all it

439
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,920
 takes is a chunk to take you out.

440
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,440
 One scene won't take me out of the movie, one line or one bad special effect won't

441
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,760
 take me out of a movie, but I think that they had three leads in the movie.

442
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,880
 One of the leads disappeared and another person showed up and just was sipping tea and gave

443
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,200
 all this exposition, and I totally took me out of the movie.

444
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,480
 It was a super boring scene, and I was thinking the whole time, why didn't they just have

445
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,540
 the third lead deliver this information?

446
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,540
 It would have been much more cohesive.

447
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,940
 It could actually be done quicker because you didn't have to introduce that person.

448
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,740
 You could have that third person go, "These are the files."

449
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:32,820
 The concept is that a young man is hired by this private corporation saying, "We found

450
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:39,140
 a U.S. satellite in orbit, and it's broadcasting a code that we can't break.

451
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,300
 This kid's a cryptographer."

452
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,180
 We found this U.S. satellite in orbit.

453
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,960
 It's broadcasting a code that we can't break.

454
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,400
 We need someone to break the code and tell us what it is.

455
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,960
 The young man goes, "Well, why don't you just ask the U.S. government?"

456
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,300
 They sent it up, and she goes, "Well, they didn't send it up."

457
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,740
 The young man goes, "What do you mean they didn't send it up?

458
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,340
 You said it was U.S. satellite."

459
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,740
 She said, "Yeah, it is a U.S. satellite.

460
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,980
 We haven't sent it up yet.

461
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,380
 We believe it's from the future."

462
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,020
 That's a cool way to start a movie off.

463
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,260
 The mystery is ready to go.

464
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
 I'm like, "Okay."

465
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,900
 There's actually another mystery that starts a movie off.

466
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,140
 I'm like, "Okay, that's cool.

467
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,060
 We're watching this young man trying to decode this transmission, and the mystery goes on

468
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,060
 from there.

469
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
 Who sent it up?

470
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,620
 Why they sent it up?

471
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,940
 What's happening to the young man?

472
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,300
 What's happening to the other people in the world around them?"

473
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,220
 Very well done movie.

474
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,940
 Just that scene.

475
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,380
 You'll know it because it's kind of the color tone changes.

476
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,980
 The feel of the entire movie changes in the 15 minutes.

477
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,820
 When I had to get back on board for the last act, for the last 20, 30 minutes, actually

478
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,060
 it took me a bit to get on.

479
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,060
 The ending was good.

480
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,900
 I'll take away my half-hearted recommendation.

481
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,780
 I'd recommend watching this movie if you're a fan of sci-fi.

482
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,740
 Maybe you'll watch it and you won't have that same criticism as I did.

483
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,740
 I will have to say it was nice watching a good science fiction movie lately.

484
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,540
 I've been watching a lot of garbage.

485
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,660
 That is going to be it for tonight.

486
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,020
 I have to turn this fan on so bad I am just dripping sweat.

487
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,020
 Dripping dripping sweat.

488
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
 Do I have anything I do?

489
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
 I have some more Diodepepsi.

490
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:22,820
 Here's a sponsored drink for you.

491
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,460
 I wish I could say brought to you today by Diodepepsi, the choice of a generation.

492
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,380
 But I can't, because it didn't sponsor me.

493
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,020
 But I did carry home a 24 pack by myself today.

494
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,380
 And those are heavier than you think.

495
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,860
 I'm going to finish off this Diodepepsi.

496
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
 You have a great day.

497
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,420
 Thanks for listening to Dead Ravver.

498
00:29:39,420 --> 00:30:04,420
 Bye.

499
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:14,420
