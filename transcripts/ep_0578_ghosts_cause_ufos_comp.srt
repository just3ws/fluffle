00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A simple bridge in Africa holds a deadly curse.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And then we travel to Australia to take a look at a bizarre story that may mean UFOs cause ghosts.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon support. Actually, he's not our newest. He bought this for him.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 He gave his brother a shout out on Friday's episode. So let's give him a shout out today.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Nicholas Detorfino. Nicholas, everyone's clapping for Nicholas. He's doing the worm as he's worming his way into the amphitheater here.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Nicholas, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. You can't afford to Patreon, I totally understand.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 But help spread the word about the show. You guys don't understand how much that helps the show grow.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 If you guys can't give money, give your voice. Give your voice to me. I'm Ursula from the Little Mermaid.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Just talk about the show online to your friends. It really helps out a lot.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Nicholas, we got a ton of stuff to cover. So first off, let's get you in the Dead Rabbit Robo.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We're going to take a little rowing trip all the way from America. It's a long trip. Hope you brought a lot of provisions.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 We're headed out to Zimbabwe. Oh, splash. Oh, splash. I'm yelling as I'm consuming your voices.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Oh, come to me. Nicholas finally captains the boat all the way to Zimbabwe. We also went back in time.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 It's the 1970s and we're in Guandetown in Zimbabwe.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And running through Guandetown is the Mitshebu River.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And going over, this is a geography podcast, all of a sudden going over the river, is the Machabi's Bridge.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Back in the 1970s, this bridge had a bit of a problem. This is a really interesting story. There's a school nearby.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And I can't, this is kind of shocking. I guess I'm just kind of ignorant, but this school back in the 1970s had no water.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I can't imagine going to a school with no water. They shut down the school when the toilet stopped working when I was in high school.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So this nearby school in Guandetown would send out male pupils to go down to the river and get buckets of water, bring it back to school.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And that had been normal for years, but what was happening now was kids were going out to get water. They weren't coming back.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And you would find a kid floating down the river dead. And so that's tragic, obviously. People kind of figured out, they figured the kids were probably just playing in the water

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 or they fell in the water or something like that. And they died. But what happened was eventually you had kids, not every kid who went to school wasn't like,

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 "Well, we'll just keep sending them out. We'll just keep sending them out. We need that water." Not every kid disappeared.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 A lot of kids went down there, got the water, and it was no big deal. But sometimes they wouldn't come back.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Eventually you started having students run back to the school and they're like, "Oh man, you won't believe what just happened."

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I was down at the river. You literally won't believe this because it's so insane. I was down at the river, I was getting some water, and I saw a kid look side to side, a little nervous.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 I saw a fish in the river. The teacher was like, "Have you not taken science class yet? That's where fish live." He's like, "No, no, no, no, no. It wasn't like a trout or something like that."

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 It was a fish. It was something like medicine, almost like some sort of monster fish. The teachers are like, "You're right. We don't believe that. That sounds absolutely ridiculous."

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 But what happened was they started getting these kids running back from the river saying they almost died and it had something to do with a fish in the river, and then the drowning stopped.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Now we jump ahead to the year 2020. This is super bizarre. This is such a weird story. I'm going to wait to share this with you guys. I just read this the other day. We're in the year 2020 now.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Adult men use this river to bathe in, and there's also guys, which sounds pretty fun. I've never taken a bath in the river. I imagine it'd be super cold.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Guys, adult men would go down there to bathe in the river, and then other dudes would use the river to pan gold in, which would be super awkward if you're looking for riches and fame.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And you look over and there's a naked guy going, "Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo." He's sprinkling gold dust on his head. He's like, "Oh, this is my favorite shampoo." You're like, "No, I should have been upstream from him."

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Guys use it to gold pan or to bathe, or people go and say, "Hey honey, I'm going to go gold pan today," and then they're walking out with the bars to open a towel. They're like, "Hmm, that's suspicious."

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 He never brings home gold, but he's always ivory spring clean when he comes back. He just really likes bathing.

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Adult men have begun drowning in this river, and the story is, whatever was here in the 1970s is back.

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 There's something that's laid dormant for what? Almost 50 years now. That's back. And it's claiming the lives of people in Guantatown.

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But see, what's weird about this is that it's not people. It's only men. It was boys in the 1970s. It's adult men today.

44
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And that river, even at its deepest, you shouldn't be able to drown in it.

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 When people in the town are going, "Maybe you can figure kids drowning in it because kids are kind of dumb, but adult men drowning in it, that's weird."

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 That's really, really weird. And the other show we have, the fact that only men are dying, the fact that this river is quite shallow.

47
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I mean, it's not a puddle, but you shouldn't be able to drown in it. And they said, "This is normally how it happens."

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 One person dies in the river, and then in rapid succession, a bunch of dudes die. That's what happened back in the 1970s.

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 You had one kid die first, then you had a whole slew of them. Now, because this story takes place since in Bobway, it's funny.

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I got all the information I could get on this story, but there's a lot of stuff that I feel is left out.

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 We don't know how many kids died in the 1970s, although all the articles that I read all agreed that that was a problem.

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And that's why they're looking at this as being a supernatural thing nowadays.

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 They all agree, like, I couldn't find a lot of hard numbers because it took place a long time ago, that initial thing, in another country.

54
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 But now it's happening today. It's gotten to the point now where people, these are the theories that are going on.

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 A lot of the locals are saying, "Mermaid, mermaid attacks." You know what happens? That happens, right?

56
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 A mermaid, because the victims are all men, a mermaid must be in the river. She's enchanting people into the river and drowning them.

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Which is typical, like, in mermaid lore, that's like a siren. They love to kill dudes. It fits. It fits.

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Other people in the community go, "That doesn't sound very mermaid-like. That honestly doesn't sound right because we're finding the bodies."

59
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So all these people are going to the river and completely disappearing, which would be... they're both scary, but that one would be ten times scarier.

60
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 They go, "We're finding the bodies and mermaids, again, if you look at the lore, it's not like they let the body go.

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 They either consume it or they take it to their underwater kingdom in a really shallow river."

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 You can see them on the riverbank. You see, like, Ariel's little castle down there. You see him having a little dance.

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 So there's a debate there about whether or not mermaids are responsible.

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 The other theory, which I found more fascinating, I mean, mermaids, but this other theory is scary.

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Like, I could hang out with a mermaid. I wouldn't want to hang out with this other theory.

66
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 The other working theory is that somebody is practicing black magic.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 But not just any black magic. We're talking straight old Illuminati-style stuff, where they believe that somebody made a deal with the dark forces back in the 70s

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 for fortune, and so they created some sort of creature. They invoked something and placed it in the river.

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And to get that fame and success, he had to sacrifice people to the creature.

70
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So he's not down there actively pushing people in, but by allowing this dark entity to come into our realm and feast off humans,

71
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 this person, this unknown person, is getting power from it.

72
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And then for whatever reason, it's been invoked again. Either it's on some sort of weird hunger cycle, like Pennywise,

73
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 popping up out of the river, or this person needed more money.

74
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 This is like his ATM. He's like, "Dun dun dun dun dun!"

75
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Walking down the river, he's putting in the Cthulhu's baby. He's like, "Okay, there's my $2,000. I should ask for more,

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 but I'm very short-sighted. I hope I don't have to do this again."

77
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So that's the other theory, which is a lot scarier.

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 So it's gotten so bad that the locals have actually called in the prophet Muley Moyo to come out to town.

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Now, we don't know who prophet Muley Moyo is, but apparently in the area, this dude is dope.

80
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I honestly wish we knew who this guy was. This guy needs his own Netflix series. I actually found him on Facebook.

81
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 I'll talk about that in a second. I'll talk about that in a second.

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 But prophet Muley Moyo comes out. He has a big reputation. This way, he needs to have a Netflix show.

83
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 He has a big reputation of taking down paranormal menaces. This is his resume.

84
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 There's much of goblins at a local school that prophet Moyo showed up and was like, "Get out, get out, get out!"

85
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 and chased the goblins away. I mean, you know, standard stuff, I guess.

86
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 When I read that, I was like, "Oh, you know, goblins could be..."

87
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I don't know if it was actually like little green dudes with like armor on and stuff like that, little swords, little one-hit D&D characters.

88
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 I don't know if goblins is a term for poltergeists in Zimbabwe. I was like, "Oh, you know, doors opening and closing by themselves, cups levitating."

89
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 He was like, "Jace, that's so terrifying. You're acting like it's nothing."

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 But you know what I mean? It could be stuff that could be natural, could be normal, and prophet Moyo comes out.

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 He comes out, he does a ritual, and then the activity stops. So basic exorcism stuff, right?

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 So I was like, "Okay." His second thing that they said was he actually had to do this before.

93
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 There was a giant snake near a local dam, and people were drowning in that river too, and he caught the snake.

94
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 He pulled the snake. How does this guy not have a television series? I want to see him wrestling the snake.

95
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 But, but I'm reading these. I'm reading these. You know, goblins. Oh, a pretty big snake.

96
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 People drowning. I don't know. Was the snake pulling people in the river, I guess? Was it supernatural snake?

97
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Does he still have the snake? I have all these questions, and then I found this. This should be on every paranormal investigator's resume.

98
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I'm kind of ashamed. It's not on mine. And other feet of his. He went to the Matandaweema Primary School in Gwanda.

99
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 He's already been called out to take care of a snake that's drowning people. He's already been called out to run off a bunch of goblins.

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 This one... I don't even know why they called this guy. How long did this go on for?

101
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 First one, paranormal. Definitely goblins. The second one, you had people drowning. The big snake probably paranormal,

102
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 because I don't think snakes normally drown people. I think people were drowning due to some sort of paranormal thing.

103
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And he found a big snake, or the snake was a cursed thing, like in the story we're currently covering.

104
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 This next story, this one in this elementary school, there's just a baboon.

105
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 There's a totally real baboon. Not paranormal. He's not a ghost baboon. There is a baboon loose in the school.

106
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 For what I imagine is weeks, because this guy is on call, but he's a minister. He has other stuff to do.

107
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 There's a baboon loose. I mean, and it's tearing the school up. It says that it terrorized the staff and the students.

108
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So I don't think it was like one day a baboon showed up, and Prophet Moyo was also like animal control in the area.

109
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 This baboon was imitating teachers. He's sending kids to the principal's office. They go there.

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 The principal is now disguised as a baboon. He's beating them up.

111
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Kids are like, "That's a really convoluted way to beat me up." This baboon was terrorizing the school for an unknown amount of time, but it was not an afternoon.

112
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Prophet Moyo showed up to take down a baboon. It's terrifying. You've never seen the ghost hunters fight even a stray dog, let alone a baboon in an elementary school.

113
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 All those hiding spots. Little baboon eyes looking out from the cubby hole.

114
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Nuts, dude. Anyways, I'm a little disappointed I've never fought a baboon, nor will I ever.

115
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Prophet Moyo taking down goblins, taking down a giant snake and a baboon in elementary school. He needs his own Netflix series.

116
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 He's being brought out to take care of this one.

117
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So we'll see what happens. I found him on Facebook, and I think I did.

118
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I found a guy with the same name who lives in Gwanda in Zimbabwe, and the reason why I'm a little hesitant is because I didn't put his Facebook in the show notes because he looks very young.

119
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 He looks like he's maybe like 18, 20 years old in the photos, so maybe he just ages really well.

120
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And none of his posts talked about him beating the poop out of a baboon, which would be every Facebook I'd ever post ever had I done that.

121
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 So I will keep you guys updated on that story. I emailed him at about 5 in the morning last night and he said, "Hey, are you the same guy who's going to that bridge to take care of that curse?"

122
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 I don't know if it's the same person. Imagine getting an email from someone from another country at 3 in the morning saying, "Hey, you don't know me, but are you the prophet who's trying to get rid of the ghost under the bridge?"

123
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 I'll let you know if he's the right guy. I really want to know about that baboon story. That's fascinating.

124
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 The bridge thing is fascinating too, definitely, and we'll keep an eye on that, but if you live in Zimbabwe, don't go to that river.

125
00:13:47,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I think that's kind of the moral of that story. I'm really curious because if the second theory is correct, if someone created some sort of tulpa or invoked some sort of dark bean and it's sitting in there and it's eating people,

126
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 it means there's probably a lot of paranormal time bombs out there. This type of thing would answer stuff like missing 411 where we have these people disappearing in national woods and stuff like that.

127
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 If you're a practitioner of the dark arts, you want to sacrifice souls, it doesn't have to be Katy Perry jabbing a knife into someone right after the AMAs.

128
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 It could be Katy Perry back when she was 16, 17 years old and she really wanted to be a musician, creating some sort of twisted portal out in the wilderness somewhere and leaving it there and every time a soul walks by it,

129
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 they disappear, they die mysteriously, or just die of accidents. All these drownings in any other place in the world would probably just be brushed off as death by misadventure.

130
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So many in a certain area, maybe that's the way you actually sacrifice people. Maybe it's not this Hollywood way of, you know, a bunch of people standing around with a knife and Tom Hanks being like, "No, Steven Spielberg, I call you by your full name, today's my turn to sacrifice this person."

131
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Maybe it's not that, maybe it's Tom Hanks out in the middle of nowhere creating a portal, being like, "Oh yes, the Burbs was predictive programming. I was the villain all along."

132
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Tom Hanks is actually considered like a main villain nowadays in Adrenal Chrome conspiracy theory. I think a lot of you guys are aware of that.

133
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 He was, remember back when he was head COVID in Greenland or New Zealand, that was it? He got the Adrenal Chrome treatment or the bad Adrenal Chrome treatment.

134
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 He's considered one of like the main bad guys in the Adrenal Chrome conspiracy theory, which I find, I know why. It has to do with Isaac Cappy and Tom Hanks took a couple pictures of a shoe.

135
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Tom Hanks was taking pictures of shoes and one of the shoes was related to Isaac Cappy, who was a guy who was accusing Seth Green of pedophilia.

136
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Now this is an Isaac Cappy segment. Nicholas, go ahead and fire up that Jason Jump Jet. We're gonna get here real quick, 'cause this is a quick story.

137
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I didn't plan on doing this. I'll have to find show notes for it, but apparently as Nicholas is flying us out in the Jason Jump Jet, here's the story super fast.

138
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Isaac Cappy was this guy. A lot of you guys have recommended it over the years, but Isaac Cappy is this guy. He's a Hollywood actor.

139
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 He started accusing people of basic pizza gate style conspiracy things. Seth Green once made a joke. He was walking around Seth Green's house and Seth Green pointed at the door and goes, "Yeah, that's where we keep the kids."

140
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And Isaac Cappy freaked out and thought there were actually kids behind the door. I mean, it's a dumb joke. It's a dumb joke and then it's an even worse joke in front of someone who may be suffering from mental issues.

141
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And so Isaac Cappy was this actor who started going out and making YouTube videos or Instagram or whatever these videos and saying all of this stuff about the Hollywood elite, the pedophile ring.

142
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 This is all stuff we've heard 100 times before and there are pedophiles in Hollywood 100%, 200%. So that part is real, but whether or not Seth Green and Tom Hanks and all that stuff is involved in it.

143
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Look at the producers that are making some of these television shows and stuff like that. Those are the people you really gotta look out for.

144
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 But Isaac Cappy started going on and then he committed suicide tragically. He committed suicide.

145
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And one of his final posts was something like, "Now I have become one of them." So that's made a lot of people question his, like, did he engage in this activity and couldn't comprehend it and then killed himself?

146
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Or what does that even mean? Like, he was obviously in a state of mental distress. If you don't want to say he was flat out insane, towards the end he was in a state of mental distress.

147
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 He jumped off an overpass, I believe. I didn't prepare to do this segment.

148
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And then a couple days later, or maybe a day or two before, it was around the same time, Tom Hanks has this weird thing. He likes to take photos of shoes, like abandoned shoes, which is just creepy.

149
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Okay? It is creepy, but I guess he took a photo of a shoe that was like either throwing off an overpass or sitting on the road.

150
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And that was supposed to be somehow related to Isaac Cappy's suicide.

151
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 So that's how Tom Hanks got on the rave. You don't know why Tom Hanks is so tied into pizza gate theory now. It's because of that.

152
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 It's because there had been accusations thrown out about him, I believe, I'm not 100%, because again, I'm going off memory, but most of the accusations are like Katy Perry, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Ellen, Hillary Clinton, stuff like that.

153
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And then while everyone's looking at that stuff, they're escorting a producer out of the back of Nickelodeon. They're like, "Don't ever come back here, dude. You're lucky we're not calling the cops. We should."

154
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 While everyone's looking over at this stuff, there's real stuff going on. There's real stuff going on.

155
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Anyways, Nicholas, we're going to have to get this going real quick. We're all going to bail out of the Jason Jump Jet. That was not a planned story.

156
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And while we're flying through the air, Nicholas expertly flies that Carpentercopter and he scoops all of us up. This episode's more exciting than the episode he bought for his brother on Friday.

157
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Carpentercopter is flying out to Australia. Let's get started here, because I don't have a ton of time, but again, I find this story fascinating.

158
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Seems small at first, but let's get going here. We're going back to the year 1983 and we're in Runeemede that's in Tasmania, Australia. It's nine o'clock at night.

159
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Carpentercopter's flying through the black starry sky. Two people are driving down the road. We're going to call them Bart and Judy. Bart and Judy. Bart and Judy is the worst.

160
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Anyways, Bart and Judy are driving. They're driving from Bechano to Hobart. So if you live in the area, you can mimic this drive. Probably don't want to.

161
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 But driving in the road, they start to see a light in the sky. A UFO. They can't identify what this thing is in the sky, so they stop at Bust Me Gal Hill. Bart happens to have binoculars on him.

162
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 He pulls out these binoculars and he looks at the light and they're now pulled over to the side of the road and they're up on this hill. And it's a triangle shaped craft.

163
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And it's hovering below the cloud line and they're watching this thing for about ten minutes just kind of hover there.

164
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And then they start to see a set of headlights come down the highway. Now, I would say they're in the middle of nowhere, but it's kind of a given they're in Australia, but they are in the middle of nowhere.

165
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 It's kind of weird to be seeing another car coming out down this highway, but not unexpected. They're not Mad Max. There's other people that exist in the country.

166
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 But they're seeing this pair of headlights come down the road. It does make them kind of question it because they're thinking, "Did this car see what we're seeing?" Because it's coming from the direction of this triangle.

167
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 So obviously, they must have also seen it as well. So maybe we can kind of walk down this hill. Maybe they'll see us and they'll pull over and we can confirm that we are all seeing this absolutely bizarre thing.

168
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 So they start moving down the hill. These two headlights are coming down the freeway. And as it gets closer, they hear the sound of an incredibly loud motorcycle.

169
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Probably the same one that drives by my place every time I'm trying to record a podcast, which I'm sure you guys have heard multiple times. You can always hear it when it does and I can't edit it out.

170
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 They hear this really loud motorcycle coming down the road. They kind of look at each other and they're like, "Wait a second. There's two headlights, but we hear a motorcycle. Two motorcycles? Could it be two motorcycles running sign by sign?"

171
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And as the two headlights get closer, they start to merge into one headlight. And then when things are going to get weirder, they're hearing this loud roar of, "What it now has to be a motorcycle has one headlight on it.

172
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Sounds like a motorcycle. It's coming closer and closer down the road. And as it drives past them, it is absolutely a motorcycle. But the rider of the bike has no head. Bart and Judy took off and they left the area.

173
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 A simple story. That's it. That's the whole story. But it actually opens up a really bizarre form of thought. People talk about this before. Paranormal researchers talk about a term called "high strangeness," which generally means an area that has UFO sightings, tends to have bigfoot sightings, tends to have paranormal activity.

174
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Nobody has really been able to put together why that happened. Some people believe that you can understand like ghost sightings and bigfoot sightings in the same area because that's more of a paranormal thing, but aliens are generally considered to be a biological visiting thing.

175
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It could be the same thing if you had in South America stories of cryptids, ghost, and then a bunch of conquistadors showed up, which at the time they did go, "Oh, these guys must have come from the heavens." Because they're dressed up in all this armor and they have these loud guns and stuff like that.

176
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 But that wasn't the case. The conquistadors were not. Well, they weren't from the heavens and there's definitely another paranormal about them. They were just humans outfitted in armor.

177
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 The idea of aliens being interdimensional, there are people who believe that. Jacques Valais, he was just on the Joe Rogan show, he's probably the most famous person who believes in interdimensional aliens. I'm more of a believer in interdimensional aliens than biological aliens.

178
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 But, all that put aside, generally aliens are considered, I still believe there's some sort of biological entity. I just don't know where they're coming from.

179
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 So the fact that we have stories of paranormal stuff and cryptids all happening in the same area makes sense, because they're all kind of related, even Bigfoot's kind of related, it's this kind of quasi-real thing that you just can't track down.

180
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Aliens, you imagine, have some sort of like, at the very least they have some sort of like, organization, they have jobs, they just don't fly around in the UFOs all day long, unless that's their job.

181
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 So imagine aliens have a race, a species, much like ourselves. They have different levers of government and you would have people who are born, they'd get raised in the society, they would die, you'd have people who are artisans, you'd have people who just wanted to spend the whole time being a dentist.

182
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 So it's a bit different in that phenomenon, it's about different in the way we look at things, but this is a clear cut case of a UFO being seen in an area and then a ghost, at the same time.

183
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And not only a ghost, this is what's so interesting about it, not only a ghost, but a classic highway ghost.

184
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 The woman standing by the side of the road, you pick her up, she's trying to get home from the prom, you take her to her house, you look back, there's a wet jacket, you're like, "Thanks."

185
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 You have a whole collection of wet jackets at home, because this girl, you always got to pick her up. Classic American highway ghost story, and you'll hear La Lorna, the woman in white, the wailing woman in white at the river, those are all over the world as well.

186
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 The headless rider, originally it was the headless horseman, which I know was fiction, so I said that, I saw documentary ones about a man named Mikovat Krain.

187
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 The headless rider though is an old motif, that is a very, very classic ghost story, and then the other most classic ghost story is my kid's kids, just kids, just kids, every child he knows it goes, you know, kids pushing your car, cry baby bridge, stuff like that.

188
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Those are classic motifs around the world, so not only do you have a very classic shaped UFO, it's nothing mind boggling, it's a triangle shaped craft, but then you have a good old classic ghost showing up.

189
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 What does any of this mean? I don't know, like again, it's just one more piece in the puzzle of high strangeness.

190
00:25:42,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Do alien crafts actually, maybe it's a byproduct of their technology. So it's not so much that aliens are causing ghost things, no more that when you're driving your car around, you're putting out exhaust.

191
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 So maybe it's some sort of a fissure going to sound really weird, but as they're warping in and out, let's say that they are space bound aliens, they're not even interdimensional, because then interdimensional one answers it right away, but let's say they're just what people normally consider aliens.

192
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 They're warp technology, they're camouflage technology, or just running their engine idle as they're reading a magazine. It's causing some sort of wobble in our reality, and it's allowing these things to pass through.

193
00:26:38,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 But again, what I find so fascinating is it's not just a ghost, it's a classic ghost. Dude, what if, what if, okay, sure, take that theory, but what if this is a way, like what if this isn't an accidental byproduct, what if they're causing ghost sightings on purpose for some other means, psychological testing, to scare people?

194
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 They really like to scare people, they really, really love it, to cover up their activity that way if people go, "Oh, I saw ghosts," people are going to be like, "What? No, I don't believe you."

195
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 "Oh, I saw a triangle floating in the sky, they probably won't believe you then either, but the ghost is less realistic to a lot of people."

196
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Maybe they're doing this on purpose, maybe it's not, oh, maybe it's the scoop, maybe aliens are the true Scooby-Doo villains of the world, that they cause these ghost sightings.

197
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Because again, it's not just, I keep saying ghost sighting, but I want to hammer this in, it's not just a ghost walking around your house, which is terrifying, don't get me wrong, but it's a stereotypical ghost.

198
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 It's basically like a pre-programmed in hologram, it couldn't be any more cliche than to have a dude with no head writing down a lonely highway, that is such a classic ghost story.

199
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 So it's almost like as this UFO is flying around, they're like, "Okay, we got to drop some people off, go grab some kangaroo meat, go probe a couple dudes."

200
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 "Let's run program X9 and then a motorcycle is coming down the road."

201
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 They could have easily hit program 1280 and then Bloody Mary would have appeared and just stood on the roadside.

202
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And look at the alien's truck, what am I supposed to do down here, there's not even a mirror.

203
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 They have all these programmed classic ghost stories, it's Christmas Day, you're like, "Oh, you're being confronted by the ghost and Christmas future as a ship is floating over your house."

204
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 I'm wondering if there's something there, it's funny because originally I was thinking, did it cause it accidentally, but because it's so cliche, it almost feels like it's real.

205
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 I think the thing to take away from this story is this.

206
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Paranormal researchers are not Bigfoot hunters and Bigfoot hunters are not UFO investigators.

207
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 They have their own set of skills, an EVP meter is not going to help you much in the middle of the forest when an 8 foot tall hairy man picks you up and rips you in half.

208
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 And your little shortwave radio that you're using to listen to alien tech isn't going to help you when...

209
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Well, this won't help you in any situation except when you're trying to eavesdrop in on ET, it's not going to help you if like a stiff breeze knocks over your equipment.

210
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 They don't have the same skill set, so what's really terrifying about this is, let's go this, let's end it like this.

211
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Ghost hunting is fun, it's so fun to go out and do these things.

212
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 But you gotta be safe, I'm always worried about hobos and dogs and then ghosts.

213
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 You know, I'm there to see the ghosts, those two things are the ones I'm the most concerned about.

214
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 But I never thought about the fact that while we're out looking for ghosts, something else may be looking for us.

215
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 These typical ghost stories may be a way to attract us to this area.

216
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 It's the perfect experiment, seeing who are the most curious of mankind or the most gollible.

217
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 So while you're walking through the creepy woods at the edge of your town or the abandoned cemetery,

218
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 or creaking open the door of that haunted house that you've heard so much about since you were a kid,

219
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 be a little more prepared than your EVP meter, your cell phone camera.

220
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Because while you're entering what you think is a ghostly abode,

221
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 it may actually be the doorway to a sci-fi hell.

222
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 You may have hoped to catch a blurry photo of a ghost walking down a staircase.

223
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Instead, the last photo you take is of a three-fingered gray hand reaching out from the darkness.

224
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 And you're never seen again.

225
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
