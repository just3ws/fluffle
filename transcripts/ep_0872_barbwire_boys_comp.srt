00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
 A recent study shows that our new AI overlords may be more trustworthy than our flesh and blood brothers and sisters.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:17,500
 And then we travel to Baltimore, Maryland to take a look at the story known as the Boys and the Barb Wire Cage.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:29,500
 When two neighborhood youths go ghost hunting, they have no idea they're about to step foot into a house full of madness today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:42,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenteror. I'm having a great day.

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing what you're doing.

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,500
 I hope you guys got some good plans for the weekend coming up. It's gonna be sunny. If you live where I live, I can't guarantee the weather where you're at.

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,500
 But, Brainershine, someone who's always been a longtime supporter of this show, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 Everyone give it up for Veezel Horne. Wooo, everyone give a big round of applause. Veezel Horne comes walking in. Yeah, dude.

9
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 I don't know why that sounded weird. That sounded a little pervy.

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
 Veezel Horne, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

11
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,500
 Just help spread the word about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

12
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 Veezel Horne, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider. We're gonna jump off the tallest point of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
 We're gonna glide right into the metaverse.

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 [Exhales]

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 So the metaverse is this supposed new, beautiful computer playground we're gonna be in.

16
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 I almost feel like they're forcing it a bit. I don't think people really want to check their email, like, by putting on VR headsets and stuff like that.

17
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 And they have to digitally walk to the post office, little avatars waving at you.

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,500
 I just want to click a button and check the email. I know Facebook or Meta is what they go by now, but they've been making this big push for the metaverse.

19
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 But the beauty of social networks is I pull my phone out, I go to my TikTok at Dead Rabbit Radio, and I look at stuff, right?

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 And then I'm done. If I had to put on goggles and gloves to go to TikTok, I'm not gonna go to TikTok.

21
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 If I have to do anything other than pick my phone up and press a button, imagine doing Farmville, but you actually have to walk across the farm.

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 You're on old school Facebook, and you're like actually having to virtually pick up turnips. It's just not gonna work.

23
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 I really think it's a fool's errand. But the metaverse is coming, whether we like it or not.

24
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 I mean, we don't have to use it and it could collapse. It could be a huge flop.

25
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,500
 But coming out of the metaverse, we're having all of these thought pieces. And I read this really interesting one.

26
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 This actually, metaverse or not, this article has really, really profound implications for the world going forward.

27
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 We're in the metaverse, we got our digital avatars, but even if we're not in the metaverse, this is some crazy stuff.

28
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,500
 There's a website called VentureBeat, and there's an article written by Lewis Rosenberg.

29
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,500
 He wrote an article called "Get Ready for Your Evil Twin."

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,500
 Really, really interesting piece. Thank you, Lewis, for writing this.

31
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 What he points out is that earlier this year, there was a study done that showed that AI technology has become so advanced

32
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 that they did a study where they were showing people photos of real people and then photos of AI-generated people.

33
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 And showing enough of these photos, they discovered a couple things. The study discovered a couple things.

34
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 One, people can't tell a difference anymore. Between a very, very well-refined AI-generated, this person does not exist type of photo.

35
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 Which we've talked about that website before. And when you're looking at this photo, this person never existed.

36
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 Now, every so often there's a glitch, there's a hideous glitch sometimes in this thing.

37
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 But for the most part, I could use these photos as avatars for social networks, and you would never know that this person did not exist.

38
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 It's just a face.

39
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 And this kind of skips over the whole uncanny valley effect, because with the uncanny valley effect, that usually works with things that are in motion.

40
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,500
 You notice something's wrong with the way the lips move, you notice something is wrong with the way the eyes work,

41
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,500
 and it makes you go, "Oh, that's so realistic, but it's too realistic. It's making me sick to my stomach."

42
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:36,500
 That's the uncanny valley effect. But as far as a still photograph, they did this big study,

43
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 and people cannot tell the difference between the photograph of a real person and the photograph of an AI person.

44
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:49,500
 And that's not a huge problem, right? We have had issues of people having social accounts, like social network accounts,

45
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 using fake photos, and people thinking that they're real, but, you know, that's like identity theft type stuff.

46
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 It's harmful, but it's not game-changing. However, this study also showed that this is weird. No one expected this.

47
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:12,500
 The participants in the study were asked to rate the trustworthiness of the people in the photos.

48
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:23,500
 And by a significant margin, the AI-generated photos were rated as more trustworthy than the photos of real people.

49
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 Now, that's dangerous. That's dangerous if they couldn't tell the difference, but something in someone's mind goes,

50
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 "Ah, but I don't trust that. I don't know why I don't trust that picture, but I don't."

51
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,500
 And that turned out to be the AI picture. That would mean there was something in our monkey brain that was still detecting something's wrong.

52
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 But it's the opposite. People are viewing the AI photos as more trustworthy.

53
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,500
 And what Lewis Rosenberg is saying is that he said this in a previous article.

54
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,500
 He goes, "You are going to see, as we now have the still photographs that look just like real people."

55
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 And you can't tell the difference. He goes, "You'll eventually start to be able to manipulate those in a way that skips over the Uncanny Valley effect

56
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 so you can have the movement, and people won't be able to tell that's a digital person."

57
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,500
 He goes, "That's coming." And he goes, "This is what ad agencies are going to do."

58
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 Even before this study came out, he predicted that ad companies are going to start doing commercials with digital people

59
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,500
 because you won't be able to tell the difference and they're super cheap, right?

60
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 You don't actually have to pay an actor. You'd have to get a voice actor.

61
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 You're going to have like some Rosie the Robot voice come in by more detergent.

62
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:42,500
 You'd have to have a voice actor, but it's cheaper, it's faster, and now with this study, these ads would be more trustworthy.

63
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 Now, why they're finding the AI people more trustworthy?

64
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 They weren't able to really come to a determination on that, why they do.

65
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 But I think if you... I actually couldn't... I've been thinking about that too for the past couple of days.

66
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,500
 Like, is it because when you're creating an AI picture, you're creating a perfect person?

67
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 But these people don't look like angels, right? They don't look like these divine beings.

68
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 They just look like normal people, but for whatever reason, we see...

69
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 Maybe, actually, here's the theory, if they're on our conspiracy caps, maybe because when we look at other humans,

70
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,500
 we know humans are prone to sinning or doing things wrong or having malicious intent.

71
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:26,500
 But when you see an AI who was just breathed into life digitally, they never existed before the moment that photo was printed,

72
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,500
 maybe something in our brain goes, "That person's never sinned."

73
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,500
 Because they didn't. We don't realize that's not a real person, but we know something about them is Buddha-like.

74
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,500
 They've never sinned, they've never wanted, they've never lusted, they've never done any of these things.

75
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:49,500
 That's my own theory that I just came up with about a minute or two ago, but I haven't been thinking about a while why that would be.

76
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,500
 But anyways, he goes, "You're gonna see advertising with digital actors."

77
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
 Because why not? It's gonna be super cheap and you can make the actor look...

78
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,500
 You can make the actor look exactly like the audience you're going for instead of having to cast people,

79
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 and you go, "Well, he's not really the right fit, but he's cheap."

80
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 "He's just ironing his bones off the street to sell Cheetos."

81
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 So he predicted that was coming down the pipe, but he goes, "Now that you have this steady show and they're more trustworthy,"

82
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 and then it's just gonna accelerate that. Ad campaigns are gonna wanna go for this,

83
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,500
 but he's talking specifically about getting ready to meet your evil twin.

84
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 He said, "As we move..." This is fascinating. He goes, "As we move into the metaverse,

85
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
 everyone's going to have an avatar."

86
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 And what happens is you're going to be used to having a certain digital meeting space for your company's meetings.

87
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 So you walk in and you're sitting... I mean, again, it sounds so such a nightmarish world.

88
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 I'm gonna put on headsets and gloves and walk into a room and then just sit down and drink digital coffee

89
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 and listen to my boss drawing on and on about sales reports and stuff like that.

90
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 Or, I mean, just imagine we're all sitting around the table drinking real coffee,

91
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 but we have on headsets and gloves and the boss is actually saying that,

92
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,500
 but in the digital world, he's a zebra or something like that.

93
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 He goes, "What's gonna happen is you're gonna have AI imitate people you know."

94
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 He goes, "As the AI has become more complex,

95
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 you're basically gonna have bad actors disguising themselves as avatars that you know of."

96
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
 He says, "The reason why it's gonna be worse online is for a couple different reasons."

97
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,500
 He goes, "One, what's gonna happen online, the people who market to you online already know everything about you.

98
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,500
 They know all of your wants and desires. They know your Google search history.

99
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 They know your phone's constantly picking up conversations and creating buzzwords and everything like that.

100
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 And we give them permission to do this because we want access to their free services.

101
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
 They're constantly spying on us and they use that information to market to us.

102
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 Now, imagine you have that coupled with a digital salesperson appear online.

103
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 Let's keep and keep it without, like, the identity theft.

104
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
 We'll get to that in a second, but let's say you're gonna go buy a car.

105
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 You won't be talking to just a blank screen.

106
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,500
 You'll be talking to a digital representation of a salesperson.

107
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 And because he's an AI, the AI will simply look like a more trusting person.

108
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,500
 The image of that avatar will be designed to be someone that we would trust

109
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,500
 because it would be able to scan all the information about you

110
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 and develop an avatar that looks like someone you would trust.

111
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 And they said, "We'll get to the point where your webcam will probably have to be on for some of these services."

112
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 Most of them, I assume, they'll just start putting in the thing, "You gotta use your webcam."

113
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 As you're sitting there, as a salesperson's talking to you and you're like, "Hmm..."

114
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
 and you're kind of changing your expression when they say a certain phrase,

115
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 your eyes kind of go to the side and you're thinking, "Oh, that doesn't sound too good."

116
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
 The AI would say, "Adjust the conversation."

117
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 Like, it is on-the-fly human manipulation.

118
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,500
 And using the webcam will be able to tell how successful the sale is going so far.

119
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 And once you start to lose interest or once you start to look away, the salesman will change tactics.

120
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 That is insane. It will be able to present itself as the perfect person you trust,

121
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 and it will be able to use the arguments you need to hear to buy the product.

122
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 And Lewis goes, "That's coming down the pipe."

123
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
 And he goes, "We haven't even gotten to the identity theft thing."

124
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 He goes, "You're gonna see bad actors going back to the boardroom example."

125
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 He goes, "You're gonna see bad actors impersonating other people's avatars

126
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 that they know you interact with because they have access to all the same information the marketing teams do.

127
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
 They're gonna know that your boss is a zebra.

128
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,500
 They're gonna know--not literally, not literally, but they're gonna know that your boss is an avatar of a zebra.

129
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 They're gonna know what your boardroom looks like and they're going to imitate a digital representation of your boardroom.

130
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,500
 They're gonna imitate a digital representation of your boss.

131
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,500
 And they can say, "Hey, tell us how the quarterly reports are," and you start talking about all this information.

132
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
 It's corporate espionage.

133
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 You would never be able to tell the difference. That's something you couldn't do in real life.

134
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,500
 You wouldn't be like, "Well, I normally take a left on 82nd Street to get to work,

135
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 but this guy is telling me to go right, and this building is like a ramshackle house,

136
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,500
 but when I walk in the office room looks exactly the same, and then my boss is wearing his e-bra outfit."

137
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 So those two things click. Like, you would know that.

138
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,500
 He goes, "You'll see people doing digital representations of banks."

139
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,500
 You go to the bank. In the metaverse, you end up going to the wrong bank.

140
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 This is so weird and it's almost kind of--you think about it, and you're like,

141
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 "Dude, this is lawnmower man, Johnny Mnemonic, high sci-fi weirdness, right?

142
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 This isn't gonna happen." But it will. It will.

143
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,500
 Whether or not we engage with it quickly or slowly, this is where it's going.

144
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
 I'm anti-wearing the goggles and the gloves just to check my e-mail.

145
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
 But what will happen is they'll make you, right?

146
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 If you want to check your e-mail through a given service, you'll have to be part of this metaverse nonsense and everything like that.

147
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,500
 And the more you go into it, the more that you'll have the legit elements, like the marketing groups,

148
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 accessing all this information and becoming perfect salespeople to you,

149
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
 and then you'll also have bad actors.

150
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
 And he says, "This is something you need to clamp down on right away."

151
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 He goes, "As the metaverse is rolling out, you are going to see identity theft

152
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 and criminals flood into it to take advantage of it."

153
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,500
 And he goes, "If they do not clamp it down right away, people will just have the reputation."

154
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
 "Oh yeah, metaverse is where a bunch of scams are."

155
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,500
 There's still a lot of people who do not like spending money online.

156
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500
 Because they remember in the early days, you'd always hear about people's credit cards getting stolen,

157
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,500
 or people purchasing stuff and not getting it.

158
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 You had eBay come out, and you had PayPal come out, and you had all of this stuff,

159
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,500
 and then you had these banking protections, and even now, 40 years after the internet became mainstream,

160
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,500
 there's still a lot of older people saying, "I don't buy stuff online. It's too risky."

161
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,500
 I whip my card out all the time. I'm constantly buying stuff online.

162
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
 Because I trust the mechanisms that there are.

163
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
 But I understand why people don't.

164
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,500
 So, will the metaverse become a place, a den of scum and villainy?

165
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 Will it just become a place of a different kind of scum?

166
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:05,500
 The marketing executives who can perfectly match the voice and the image and the argument

167
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,500
 they need to get you to buy something, even if it's something you don't want.

168
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,500
 Because instead of showing a commercial that appeals to everyone,

169
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 it's supposed to appeal to everyone, but only maybe 10% listen to that commercial.

170
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 If I am flipping through my phone and there's an attractive girl show up in a tennis outfit,

171
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,500
 if I'm flipping through a TikTok and that image appears, I stop and I watch that video.

172
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,500
 And if she turns to me and goes, "Have you thought about refinancing your mortgage?"

173
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
 Well, see, that's the thing. That would be a waste of time because I don't have a mortgage.

174
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 But she could go, "Jason, have you ever thought about buying new shoes?"

175
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,500
 And of course I have. Of course I have magical tennis woman.

176
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 And then they would tell me where to get the shoes.

177
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 And I'd be like, "I don't know. Those shoes are kind of expensive."

178
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 But Jason, she's all doing this sexy dance. You know that I love those shoes.

179
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
 Oh, fine. I'll buy the shoes. That's the future.

180
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,500
 Like, you're almost... We always worried about the AI declaring war on humanity,

181
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 but it might just be a monetary war.

182
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 It might just be AI getting us to buy stuff.

183
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 Not this huge Terminator 2 future, but this kind of mundane world

184
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 where whenever these perfect marketing bots show up, crazy world.

185
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
 And again, I never even thought about any of this stuff.

186
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 So thank you, Lewis. That was a great article. Really, really enjoyed it.

187
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,500
 And I wanted to segue into this really, really quickly.

188
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 It's a fascinating story. I've been following it for about two years now.

189
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
 And I'm going to try to cram it into just a few minutes.

190
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 The Hollywood reporters done a really good... That's a website, a magazine.

191
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,500
 They've done a really good job on reporting this, and I'm going to try to sum it up a bit.

192
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 And it's a great segue for where we're going.

193
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,500
 "Veaselhorn, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalapie.

194
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
 We're leaving behind the metaverse. We're leaving this digital realm.

195
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 We're headed all the way out to Indonesia."

196
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
 [imitates car horn]

197
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,500
 This... The article... I really recommend reading the article.

198
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 They're going to go in a lot of detail, but it can be summed up pretty quickly.

199
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,500
 For about five years, there was this super interesting scam

200
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 that targeted people in the movie industry.

201
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,500
 And this is so... This shows how the technology, as of now...

202
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
 Really, this started back in 2015.

203
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,500
 Just using the technology of scrolling through social networks can change people's lives.

204
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 What would happen was you would have stuntmen, you would have makeup artists.

205
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,500
 What would happen to this affected writers and actors and photographers

206
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 and all these different trades within the Hollywood machine.

207
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
 And it was usually people who weren't just starting out their career.

208
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
 They were kind of about like in the medium realm.

209
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
 These weren't like people who were trying to break into Hollywood.

210
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
 These are people who already had some access in the industry,

211
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
 but they weren't top tier talent either.

212
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 What happened was you would have someone, you would have, take for example, a stuntman.

213
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 A stunt worker, a stunt coordinator would be the term.

214
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,500
 You would get an email from Amy Pascal.

215
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 She was the head of Sony. Sony films for a while.

216
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
 She was the one who was green lighting all the Spider-Man stuff

217
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 and Men in Black and the Ghostbusters reboot and all that stuff.

218
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
 You get an email from Amy Pascal.

219
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
 Very, very powerful person in Hollywood.

220
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
 And they would say, "Hey, I really like your work. I've seen some of your stuff."

221
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,500
 "I would like you to work as a stunt coordinator on a Marvel movie.

222
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 We're going to be shooting in Indonesia."

223
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
 Would you be willing to do that?

224
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 Sure, but you think that although this is Amy Pascal's name

225
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,500
 and you would know who this was, you think it might be a scam, right?

226
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
 But these emails have a phone number listed on them.

227
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 And you call the phone number and Amy picks up.

228
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
 You talk to her and she's like, "Yeah, I want you to be a stunt coordinator

229
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 for this movie we're shooting."

230
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 And you would fly out to Indonesia and you would start doing the work there.

231
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 The stunt coordinator was told to travel around these parts of Indonesia,

232
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 look at the location, see what they could do there.

233
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 And they were told to use specific services like,

234
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 "Oh yeah, when you get there use this taxi cab service."

235
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,500
 And then you might need a charter, a private helicopter to get there,

236
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 use this place and use this place and use this place.

237
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,500
 And the way it works is that you pay for everything up front,

238
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 but you'll be reimbursed for this.

239
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
 Now you're talking on the phone to Amy Pascal.

240
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,500
 And her email looks legit, her website looks legit, everything seems normal.

241
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 So you fly out there and you're spending money up to,

242
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
 this one guy got taken for like $70,000.

243
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 Spoiler alert, it wasn't Amy Pascal.

244
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,500
 And this person also imitated Kathleen Kennedy and the boss of Paramount at the time,

245
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
 Paramount Sherri Lansing.

246
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,500
 And this person would imitate very powerful women and known women in the movie industry

247
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 and reach these medium level artists and have them fly out there,

248
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
 spend tens of thousands of dollars, they're gonna get reimbursed,

249
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 and then all contact ceases.

250
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,500
 And the feds had been working on this case for years.

251
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 Because obviously they'd go and they'd talk to Kathleen Kennedy.

252
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,500
 Kathleen Kennedy's like, "I have no idea what you're talking about.

253
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
 I'm not sending people out to Indonesia to do this stuff."

254
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,500
 This goes on and on and on until finally, in 2020,

255
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 the police arrest Har Gobind, Tala Ramanani, a 41 year old Indonesian man.

256
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 Imitate these women's voices.

257
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
 People actually thought they were talking to these powerful women in Hollywood.

258
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
 And when you get ripped off like that, a lot of people are super embarrassed.

259
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
 They don't really disclose it right away, but enough of them are going to the police.

260
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
 Police opened this investigation.

261
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,500
 And the reason why he knew to target these people was because he just followed them on Instagram.

262
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 He would look for stunt coordinators, he would go on Facebook and look for people who are Hollywood makeup artists.

263
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,500
 He'd go to IMDB pages and find these people and find the perfect targets and then shoot them an email.

264
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
 And this guy made hundreds of thousands of dollars doing this.

265
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,500
 The people on the ground, the people running the taxi companies and the private companies, they weren't part of it.

266
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 He was running all of these scams and it was this dude, he's 41 years old.

267
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
 He had a history of writing like bad checks.

268
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
 He did some prison time for embezzlement.

269
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 But then he came up with this huge identity theft scam.

270
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:28,500
 And he did that with email and phone and him trudging through IMDB pages.

271
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:35,500
 One dude for about five years ran this scam that had Hollywood honestly a little on edge.

272
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
 Because then you don't really know who you're talking to.

273
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 You'd want to make it like let's put on a VR headsets.

274
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 I need to see you in that zebra suit, Kathleen, to know it's you.

275
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
 If one dude can do that for five years and get away with it, it was weird.

276
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
 At some point he was having phone sex.

277
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 At one point some of the people was like, yeah, it was really weird.

278
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,500
 Kathleen Kennedy started talking real sexy to me late at night and I was like, this is a little odd.

279
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 But if one guy can do that, can trick all of these people just with that basic amount of information.

280
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,500
 Imagine what an AI could do who knew everything about you.

281
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,500
 And would know when you were about like you start Googling identity theft.

282
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 You start Googling stuff like, can I get my money back from a fraud?

283
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,500
 And then that's when the bot could show back up and be like, hey, I know that, you know, I haven't talked to you in a while,

284
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 but we got a brand new thing.

285
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
 Here's a couple thousand dollars.

286
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
 Sorry, I haven't.

287
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 And you could keep the scam going because it has access to when you're Googling.

288
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:36,500
 Imagine as you're Googling contact number for FBI fraud unit, your phone rings.

289
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 And you look over and the caller IDs Kathleen Kennedy and you pick it up because the AI,

290
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,500
 if an AI was running the scam, it would know what you were searching for.

291
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
 You it owes you $10,000.

292
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 It gives you $2,000 as a, oh, I'm sorry.

293
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
 Yeah, but here I'll just send $2,000 right now because it's all stolen money.

294
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 Anyways, the AI version of this scam would be unstoppable.

295
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
 Terrifying world terrifying world.

296
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
 And I've talked about this on early episodes.

297
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 I really do like how I'm really fascinated by technology and true crime and how the police use technology

298
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,500
 and how the criminals have to keep upping the game technologically wise.

299
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
 That's not a word, but it is now because I said it and it just that advancement.

300
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:25,500
 Will the police start using AI of their own to troll the internet looking for crimes before they happen?

301
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
 Fascinating stuff.

302
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
 Fascinating stuff.

303
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
 Zebra avatars all around.

304
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 Don't trust them.

305
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
 Never trust them.

306
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
 Zebras.

307
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
 Vizolhorn.

308
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 Let's go ahead and fire up the carbon or copter.

309
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
 We're leaving behind Indonesia.

310
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
 They actually arrested that dude in Britain, but he was traveling all over.

311
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,500
 He ended up having his own like Instagram foodie channel where he's like, look at all this delicious food.

312
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 Look at all this delicious food I can afford.

313
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 He was using stolen money to buy it.

314
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
 We're leaving behind Indonesia.

315
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 We're headed all the way out to Baltimore, Maryland.

316
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 [imitates car engine]

317
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 I want to give a shout out to, there's a subreddit called the church of Charles Fort.

318
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 They post a lot of really weird obscure stuff.

319
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 And that's where I've never heard of the story before.

320
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:14,500
 I heard about it on the church of Charles Fort, so I want to give a shout out to them if you're into obscure stuff, obscure paranormal stuff.

321
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
 I'm sure you'd be a fan of that.

322
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,500
 I'm a mod over there, but don't tell anyone.

323
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 I don't do anything.

324
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 I don't do anything.

325
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
 They're getting ready to kick me off as a mod, probably.

326
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
 Because I don't mod anything.

327
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 I just signed up for it and then I don't even post stuff on there.

328
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
 But I do read it.

329
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 If they remove me as a mod, that's fine.

330
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
 But yeah, go ahead and check it out.

331
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
 It's a really cool subreddit.

332
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 And so this is interesting.

333
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 So I've never heard of this story before.

334
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,500
 And one of the first things I do when I find a story this sensational is I try to find other sources of it.

335
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,500
 Because the subreddit, the church of Charles Fort, linked to a website called Journal of the Bazaar, which is a great website.

336
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 We've covered them before.

337
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
 It's a really, really cool website.

338
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 But as I'm reading the story, I kept looking for any other mention of this story outside of the Journal of the Bazaar.

339
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 And there's only one.

340
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,500
 And it's the source that Journal of the Bazaar quotes for this.

341
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 There is an issue of the San Francisco Examiner newspaper from November 4th, 1906, that is the only source for this story.

342
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,500
 Every other word, keyword I've tried putting in.

343
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
 No one else is reporting this.

344
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,500
 And I don't know why.

345
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 It makes me really suspicious that it's a story, like a fictional story, because we've seen those before as well.

346
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 But it's in the newspaper.

347
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
 It was in the newspaper.

348
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 And there's a photograph attached to it, but you can't reverse image search.

349
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 I mean, nothing comes up.

350
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
 It's weird.

351
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,500
 I don't know why the story is not more popular, because it is crazy.

352
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
 It's 1906.

353
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 We're in Baltimore, Maryland.

354
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 And there's two young boys in town.

355
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 Hey, look at me, everybody.

356
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 I'm Clarence Lagar.

357
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
 And then he gets nudged out of the way.

358
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
 Well, I'm Charles Lagar.

359
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 And they're doing a little pose.

360
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 They do a little back-to-back pose.

361
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
 They're standing together.

362
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 These kids are well-known in the neighborhood.

363
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,500
 Clarence is not-- I don't know if they introduce themselves like that all the time.

364
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 I don't know if their life is a little rascal show, but Clarence is nine.

365
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
 And Charles is seven.

366
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 And they have two other siblings, but, you know, they're lame.

367
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,500
 Clarence and Charles are who are going to be following in this story.

368
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,500
 And they're brothers who love exploring dark and spooky places.

369
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 Like, who doesn't, right?

370
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 Like, part of the fear is fun.

371
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
 Part of the creepiness is fun.

372
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 And then everyone knows how brave you are.

373
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 Yo, it's C and C.

374
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
 The Ligari brothers.

375
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,500
 I don't know why I've given them all of these monikers.

376
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 It's just two boys in the neighborhood.

377
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 But apparently they did run with a crew of other neighborhood kids.

378
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,500
 And like all good neighborhoods, you have a lot of kids hanging out,

379
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 doing kid stuff, having fun, learning about life.

380
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,500
 And then you have a dilapidated spooky mansion in the neighborhood.

381
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
 And in this place, it was called the Baldwin House.

382
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,500
 It had been abandoned for God knows how long.

383
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 It was on 28th Street in Baltimore, Maryland.

384
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 I don't think it's there anymore.

385
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
 I'm pretty sure after this story it was destroyed.

386
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 But even among the adults in town, it had a reputation of being haunted.

387
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,500
 People claimed, even though the house was empty, you could hear noises.

388
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 Eminate from the house.

389
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 Squink, squink.

390
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
 Squink, squink.

391
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 The floorboard said, "Ugh."

392
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
 "Ugh."

393
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,500
 It was the sound of a door being opened by no one.

394
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
 And then what's another sound a house can make?

395
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
 "Ugh."

396
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,500
 That's the sound of a haunted house when it sets down a heavy load.

397
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
 So people heard noises.

398
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
 I don't know if they specifically heard those noises.

399
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
 The point is people heard noises from the house.

400
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
 They're probably rats scurrying around, right?

401
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,500
 But then you also see lights move around in the house.

402
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,500
 I wish often someone would look out and see a light move around the house.

403
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,500
 Well, maybe that's an intrepid ghost hunter with a flashlight.

404
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
 It's 1906.

405
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 Maybe that's an intrepid ghost hunter holding a candle.

406
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
 Going, "Ugh."

407
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,500
 Going, "Oh, I just carried this big thing upstairs. Uugh."

408
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,500
 But then occasionally, like those two things could be explained, right?

409
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
 Weird lights in the house, someone's walking around with a candle.

410
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
 Weird noises in the house, someone's walking around with a candle.

411
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
 Burning themselves.

412
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,500
 But occasionally, so this is, so I'll be honest with you guys,

413
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,500
 I wasn't able to read the actual article from the San Francisco Examiner.

414
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
 It would have cost me like 20 bucks.

415
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,500
 And I don't have 20 bucks to pay to read an old, timey newspaper article.

416
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,500
 So I'm really, I, here's the thing which I think is so funny.

417
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,500
 I was only able to find the two sources for this story.

418
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
 One of them I couldn't read.

419
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
 One of them I saw like a picture of and it was like,

420
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 "If you want to read this whole thing, it's like 20 bucks a month."

421
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
 And then I'm reading the Journal of the Bazaar.

422
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
 So I'm sure that the elements in the story are true.

423
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,500
 I don't know if the San Francisco Examiner said this part.

424
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
 Because this is a totally different story at this point.

425
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
 Housemaking spooky noises, fine.

426
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,500
 Lights being seen in the house, that standard ghost 101.

427
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
 And according to Journal of the Bazaar,

428
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 occasionally when people looked into this house,

429
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:20,500
 they saw this deformed freak sitting inside, just staring outside of a window.

430
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 If I saw mysterious lights in a house, I could probably rationalize that.

431
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:30,500
 If I saw a my, if I as an adult man saw a monster looking at me through a window,

432
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 a deformed freak, not just a deformed man, or not just a freak,

433
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,500
 but a deformed freak, the worst kind of freaks, you would go in.

434
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 You would go in, you'd call the police, you'd go in with a bunch of cops.

435
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
 You'd find the freak, right?

436
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 So I don't know if the San Francisco Examiner, this newspaper is like,

437
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 "And then on lonely nights, sometimes you peered up and saw a freak."

438
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 I don't know if they had that detail, which I find interesting, but maybe they did.

439
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,500
 Maybe if you have $20, you can let me know.

440
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,500
 But the deformed freak lights in the house sounds.

441
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 Neighborhood legends, most likely, right?

442
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,500
 But to the Ligari boys, and really to all the kids in the neighborhood,

443
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 this was the ultimate test of how brave you were.

444
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,500
 So one day the Ligari boys with a bunch of other neighborhood kids meet up outside the house.

445
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,500
 Clarence and Charles goes, "Ah, you guys are suckas,

446
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,500
 but me and my brother here, the CCs, we..."

447
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
 She sounded like a bunch of CCs.

448
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
 She was like, "Okay, forget that nickname.

449
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,500
 Me and my brother here, I'm Charles in charge, and this guy's...

450
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
 this little dude is his name, Clarence.

451
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
 What's his name?

452
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
 He turns and says, "Brother, what's your name?"

453
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,500
 He's like, "Oh, you're my big brother. You don't remember my name?"

454
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
 We're the brave ones.

455
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,500
 We're going to go in this house and we're going to show all you where the bees' knees.

456
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 So they walk into the house.

457
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 So here's an actual quote from the San Francisco Examiner.

458
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,500
 We actually did talk about a monster if this is the kind of quote they're having.

459
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
 Here's a quote from the San Francisco Examiner.

460
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:16,500
 "A few moments later, when the children rushed out of the house with a wild, terrified look,

461
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
 they were dumb.

462
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,500
 So far as appreciating what was said to them."

463
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,500
 Never mind.

464
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
 This...

465
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 This quote's more trouble than it's worth.

466
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 This is what happened.

467
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
 I'll put this in normal human words.

468
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,500
 The two Ligari boys walked into the house and they were in there for a couple of moments

469
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:39,500
 and then they ran out, making guttural zombie noises.

470
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,500
 And the kids freak out.

471
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,500
 These two boys who, up until just a couple of moments ago, were totally fine.

472
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,500
 Walk out, their eyes are rolling around, they're making these horrible sounds.

473
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
 They're idiots.

474
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,500
 They've become mouth-breathing idiots over the course of just a few minutes.

475
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,500
 And they said they looked crazed, like there was no other way...

476
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
 They looked like they had become animalistic.

477
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,500
 When you looked into their eyes, they looked like they weren't human anymore.

478
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
 The neighborhood kids ran away.

479
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,500
 So now there are these two little boys, ones nine and one seven,

480
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,500
 "Ahhhhhhhhh."

481
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,500
 They're walking down the street, just moaning and lost in their own mind.

482
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
 Something's definitely gone wrong with these kids.

483
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 Nobody helps these kids.

484
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
 People are sitting there hanging up the laundry.

485
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
 They're like, "There go them Ligari boys."

486
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,500
 They look a little more idiotic than normal, but I'm sure they'll find their way home.

487
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 They get home and they walk into the kitchen, "Ahhhhhhhhh."

488
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,500
 And the mom looks at them and hears them and she faints.

489
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
 It's like the most terrifying thing.

490
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
 Oh wait, never mind.

491
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
 Let me check my notes here.

492
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,500
 She turned and looked at them and she almost fainted.

493
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
 That's even in faints.

494
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
 She almost fainted.

495
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
 She looks, "Oh my stars and garters!

496
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 I think if I was standing there and my two kids came home and they were dumb idiots,

497
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
 I would faint."

498
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
 I wouldn't be like, "Oh good thing I didn't faint.

499
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
 Good thing I didn't faint all the way."

500
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
 That wasn't completely shocking to me.

501
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 The children come home, there's obviously something physiologically wrong with them

502
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
 and mentally wrong with them.

503
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
 It's not like they're just pretending.

504
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
 She almost faints.

505
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 And what happens at this point is they end up calling the doctor,

506
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
 "Hey, I don't know what's wrong with my kids.

507
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
 They're just wandering around.

508
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 They're just wandering around the house."

509
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,500
 They can't understand anything we're saying.

510
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
 We can't understand anything they're saying.

511
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
 There's something wrong with them.

512
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,500
 Like you look in their eyes and there's actually something not right with them.

513
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,500
 So over the next couple weeks, these kids, Clarence and Charles,

514
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,500
 just continue to kind of like walk around the house and they're incredibly violent.

515
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
 They're like smashing stuff.

516
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 Clarence, Clarence, don't put that down.

517
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
 They're like grabbing vases.

518
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,500
 She's like, "Oh no, I'm probably going to borrow my boss's Ming vase collection this week."

519
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
 They're constantly destroying something in the house.

520
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,500
 These kids are just tearing up the house and they're visited by a bunch of doctors.

521
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,500
 And the doctors are all like, "We have no idea what's causing this.

522
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,500
 We don't know why your kids are acting crazy."

523
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,500
 But at this point, everyone in this area of town has heard of that they had gone into the Baldwin house.

524
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,500
 Because there was a bunch of other kids being like, "I swear on me life, Governor."

525
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 They were totally normal until they walked into the Baldwin house.

526
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,500
 And the doctors are like, "Okay, thank you, Street Urchin."

527
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,500
 They figure out, the doctors diagnosed, this is awesome.

528
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 I wish doctors were like this today.

529
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,500
 The doctor, multiple doctors diagnosed them with,

530
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,500
 they must have went into that house and seen something so scary, they went crazy.

531
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
 Like Cthulhu level cosmic horror.

532
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,500
 These kids must have seen something so disturbing they've gone mad.

533
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,500
 Now, that does sound, that is cool, right?

534
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
 But you would definitely want a second opinion, right?

535
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
 You're like, "Okay, thank you."

536
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
 But multiple doctors like, I guess they saw something so spooky.

537
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:11,500
 And the kids, so now it's been a couple weeks, and the kids are just destroying the house and they keep trying to run away.

538
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,500
 So, remember they have siblings, they have a mom and a dad,

539
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:21,500
 they're constantly having to go and grab Clarence or grab Charles and drag them back home.

540
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,500
 But then you catch them from running away and then they're just destroying the house.

541
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
 You're like, "Ugh."

542
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,500
 So eventually, this was an ongoing issue, eventually the police get involved

543
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,500
 and they're like, "Listen, these kids are super dangerous to you guys and to themselves,

544
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
 but they're too young to go to jail."

545
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,500
 And they go, "Can we put them in like some sort of mental hospital or something like that?"

546
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,500
 And that's when the Baltimore Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children got involved.

547
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
 And they said, "No."

548
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
 They were hiding behind the bush the whole time, they waited until someone said that.

549
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,500
 They pop out, they go, "No. They're too young to go to a mental asylum. You have to keep them here."

550
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,500
 And the family's looking around at their busted house, they're like,

551
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,500
 "Ugh, we keep trying to play dominoes and they've eaten all the dominoes."

552
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 They come up with this plan so they can't have them in the house anymore.

553
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
 They're trash in this house.

554
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 So they put them in the backyard and they wrap barbed wire around the yard.

555
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,500
 They actually wrap barbed wire, they say all around the entire house.

556
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
 But I don't know if that's true.

557
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,500
 I don't know if the dad's like, "I'm off to work, honey."

558
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,500
 And he's like walking over barbed wire as he's driving to work.

559
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
 He's like, "Oh, his crotch is all blood."

560
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,500
 He's like, "Sorry, I was late for work, boss. I got an infection again."

561
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
 Boss is like, "Oh, man, clean that up.

562
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,500
 Every day you come to work when more barbed wire cuts on your balls."

563
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,500
 I don't think... I'm sure they had easy passage for the rest of the family.

564
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
 The kids are like, "I can't go to school today."

565
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,500
 There's barbed wire in the way and the mom's like throwing them over the barbed wire.

566
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
 You go to school, young man. You're not crazy.

567
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 But Charles and Clarence were crazy and they're in the backyard and they kept climbing the barbed wire.

568
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
 So they're all bloody.

569
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
 This isn't like a neighborhood.

570
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
 This isn't in the boonies out on the edge of town.

571
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
 This isn't a neighborhood.

572
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,500
 So like you, like your property value is plummeting, right?

573
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,500
 You're the neighbor to these freaks and you're like, "Ah, nice time off work.

574
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
 I'm going to drink my sarsaparilla and then you look out the window.

575
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,500
 There's like a bloody... there's a bloody kid climbing up the barbed wire."

576
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
 You're like, "Oh, man, totally ruined my day."

577
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,500
 So they keep climbing up the barbed wire and they keep throwing.

578
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
 Like, it's so funny.

579
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
 I hope this story is true, right?

580
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,500
 I would love... I don't want to say I want to see kids go insane just so we're clear.

581
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,500
 I don't want to see bloody kids climbing over barbed wire.

582
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,500
 But what happens is, according to this article, as people were walking by,

583
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,500
 the kids were throwing rocks at them from the backyard.

584
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,500
 And people were getting pelted by rocks so the cops keep coming out there.

585
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
 And the cops are like, "You need to do something about this."

586
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,500
 Because your kids are bloody and they're climbing the barbed wire and they're throwing rocks at people.

587
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,500
 And the article also says they were throwing bottles at people?

588
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,500
 I'm like, "I read that and go, 'Where are they getting the bottles?'"

589
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,500
 I mean, maybe they might have had one or two, but I don't think like their dad's like, "Oh, kids, you know what?

590
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
 It sure is hard being insane in the backyard.

591
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,500
 Here's some lemonade for you. Here's some bottles of lemonade."

592
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,500
 And then he just leaves them as they're drinking and they're throwing the bottles.

593
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,500
 Apparently there was an endless supply of rocks and bottles in this backyard.

594
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
 And they were climbing the barbed wire.

595
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,500
 So the police go, "This just isn't going to work."

596
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,500
 We can't take them to jail, though.

597
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
 So you have to shackle the kids down.

598
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,500
 We have these giant balls because they're life saloon-y-tune.

599
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,500
 We have these giant metal balls with chains on them and we chain them around the kids' ankles.

600
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
 And so they can't climb up the barbed wire anymore.

601
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,500
 They can't get a good throw. They're kids, right?

602
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,500
 They don't have a really good arm, but if you're above someone off barbed wire,

603
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
 you're just chuck rocks all day long, hit them in the head.

604
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:48,500
 So these kids, there's a photo of these two idiotic kids sitting in a backyard.

605
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,500
 It'd be funny if there's like a bottle flying out the camera.

606
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,500
 It's like the cameraman died shortly after taking this photo.

607
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
 There's a photo of these two kids all, "Ugh."

608
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:02,500
 In the backyard, and apparently these kids were locked up for about a year

609
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,500
 and the parents eventually got a divorce, right?

610
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:10,500
 I could imagine having two insane, rock-wielding, bloody children

611
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,500
 and would put some pressure on your marriage.

612
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,500
 The article said that the wife left the husband,

613
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,500
 the mother left the father because he was being abusive towards the kids.

614
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
 I mean, I don't know. I'm not part of their private life,

615
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,500
 but I would say she's like, "Why do my kids have all these mysterious scratches on their body?"

616
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,500
 And he's like, "Duh, the barbed wire? I had nothing to do with it?"

617
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
 The cops told us to put the barbed wire up.

618
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,500
 But anyways, she left him. That's crazy enough, right?

619
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
 But again, that could put stress on your marriage.

620
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
 But then she remarried.

621
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
 And I'm thinking, I don't know what this woman looked like,

622
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,500
 but she was the hottest woman in Baltimore because I'm telling you,

623
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,500
 most men will not marry a woman who has four kids

624
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
 and two of them are insane.

625
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
 Two of them are certifiably insane.

626
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,500
 He's like, "Oh, our first date. He's like getting pelted with rocks."

627
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,500
 He's like, "Ah, ah, she better be the hottest woman ever."

628
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:08,500
 She would have had to be, right, to have two insane barbed wire-engaged children

629
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,500
 and be like, "I can make this work. I can make this work."

630
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,500
 So apparently, she got remarried and they moved away, all four of them.

631
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
 Well, all six of them.

632
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,500
 You had the mom and the new boyfriend, the new husband,

633
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
 and then you had the four kids, including Clarence and Charles.

634
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,500
 They moved away to Towson, Maryland.

635
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
 And we don't know what happened after that.

636
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
 Like, we have no idea.

637
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
 It's like, "Here's your new home, kids."

638
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,500
 It's like this beautiful glen that's covered in thorny bushes.

639
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
 We don't know. That's kind of the end of that story.

640
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,500
 What's interesting is the Journal of the Bazaar tries to put this rational spin on it.

641
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,500
 And they said, "People since then have kind of thought that what caused this was

642
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,500
 the dad was a painter and back then paint had arsenic and lead in it

643
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,500
 and their symptoms are actually in line with people who get poisoned from arsenic or lead."

644
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:06,500
 And that's a fine theory, but there's a lot of problems wrong with it.

645
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,500
 First off, no one else in the family was insane. Just those two kids, right?

646
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,500
 And it could be that those two kids just really loved eating paint,

647
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:21,500
 but it would be weird if they really loved eating paint and then they walk into a haunted house

648
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,500
 and they're like, "Now it's time to indulge in our favorite treat."

649
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,500
 This is the real reason why we wanted to come to this house.

650
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,500
 They're eating the paint in the house because remember, that's what triggered this.

651
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,500
 If other people in the house were going insane and they hadn't gone into the haunted house,

652
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,500
 then you could say, "Yeah, it's probably access to all of the chemicals."

653
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,500
 And you can very quickly get the brain damage from this arsenic and lead in this paint,

654
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,500
 but why would the haunted house have triggered it? Why would no one else have this?

655
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
 But sure, skeptical answer, I totally understand.

656
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,500
 What's really creepy about this story, and we'll finish it off like this,

657
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,500
 is I left a detail out for suspense.

658
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,500
 I said that the kids were constantly running away, which was true.

659
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:09,500
 But every time they ran away and they were dragged back home,

660
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,500
 they were always headed in the same direction.

661
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,500
 These kids who were maniacs, these rock-wielding maniacs,

662
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:28,500
 were always running away back to the Baldwin house.

663
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:35,500
 Did they see something in that house that day that changed them, that warped them?

664
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,500
 And then after that moment, even though their brains had become numbed,

665
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:54,500
 they lost their voice, they lost their wits, they became idiots that needed to be "encaged" just to contain.

666
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:04,500
 Is it possible that even after all that happened to them, the house called to them every single night?

667
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:12,500
 They may have been deaf to the crying sobs of their mother,

668
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,500
 or the shrieks of pain as passerbires dodged rocks.

669
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:22,500
 They may have been deaf to the well-wishes of their friends and family,

670
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,500
 or to the prayers of the community that they would be healed.

671
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:33,500
 But every night they still heard the voice that cried out from the Baldwin house.

672
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:48,500
 Come back to me. Come back to me. Come home, children. Come back home.
