1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
 When a group of teenagers hop in their car and drive out to visit Twin Chapel Creek in

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,000
 Columbus, Georgia, they have no idea they're about to come face to face with the Creek

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Freak.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,920
 That's an awesome name.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,200
 But isn't an awesome cryptid?

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
 We'll find out.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,920
 We'll find out the Creek Freak.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,520
 And then we travel to a shopping mall to meet a young boy out shopping with his family.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,400
 When he does a dangerous and ill advised stunt, he suffers a horrible injury.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,400
 Or does he?

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,720
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:53,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I'm having a great day.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
 Happy New Year.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,800
 The year is now 2023 and things are going to be dope.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,880
 This is going to be a good year.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
 That is my prediction.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,600
 I have never made a year prediction, but I'm sure this is going to be a good one.

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,280
 But someone who's good no matter what year it is, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,440
 now is one of my Christmas gift givers.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,800
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for Own the Monkeys.

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
 Woohoo!

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
 Yeah!

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 Come on in.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,400
 Come on in with his horde of monkey servants.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,640
 Own the Monkeys, Pwn the Monkeys.

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,840
 I know there's different ways to pronounce it, but I'm going to do Own the Monkeys.

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,040
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,280
 Thank you so much.

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,640
 What happened was Own the Monkeys is a member of the Patreon.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,040
 He's on the Patreon Discord.

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,200
 And recently I did an episode about something called the sympathetic alphabet.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,600
 In short, it was you get some letters tattooed on your skin.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
 You get the whole alphabet tattooed.

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,240
 Not just the vowels.

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,560
 We did this episode where if you got the alphabet tattooed on your skin and I got the alphabet

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,360
 tattooed on my skin and then peeled the skin off.

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,080
 Preferably, preferably.

41
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,960
 There's a doctor involved in this.

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,680
 You're not just trying to do it yourself with a butter knife.

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,480
 We each peel the alphabet off our own skin and then have it attached to the other persons.

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,600
 And then theoretically we could send messages to each other no matter where we're at on

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,280
 the planet.

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,720
 Well, we still don't know if that works.

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,440
 I haven't had any volunteers.

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
 I've had my alphabet tattooed.

49
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,880
 Just waiting for you guys.

50
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,960
 Mason on the Discord found out there was a mysterious book.

51
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,400
 Because I said in the episode, I go, there's no information on this.

52
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,720
 It's very, very, it's a well kept secret.

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
 It's very little information.

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,160
 I thought that could be because the powers that be are trying to hide it from us.

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,720
 I'll put the episode in the show notes.

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,640
 So Mason found out there's a book called The Sympathetic Alphabet by a Barbara Scissorlip.

57
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,080
 This is a chance I mispronounced that last name.

58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
 But maybe not.

59
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,840
 Barbara Scissorlip.

60
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,440
 But we didn't know what the book was.

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,520
 It just showed up on Amazon.

62
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
 There's this book.

63
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,480
 Well, Own the Monkeys bought it for me.

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,240
 And he's like, I don't know what this is.

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,080
 I don't know what this is.

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,200
 It's a book of poetry.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,680
 It's a book of poetry.

68
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,840
 Which is my least favorite of all the trees.

69
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,480
 Let me read this one to you.

70
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
 It's very short.

71
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,160
 That's why I chose it.

72
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,000
 How the poet is raising the sun to be a poet.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,440
 I shine a flashlight in his eyes and say, God.

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,720
 I point to the door and say, sky.

75
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,080
 I point to the sky and say, sheep.

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,080
 Thank you, Own the Monkeys.

77
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,640
 Thanks for buying me a book of nothing.

78
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,440
 I mean, it looks like it was published by a small publisher.

79
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,360
 Mother's Hand Publishing is what it says.

80
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,000
 It was published back in 1975.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,120
 So this book is a year older than me.

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,520
 Thank you so much, Own the Monkeys.

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,000
 You are our captain of this episode.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,200
 If you guys want to buy me books, I've been getting a lot of books lately.

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
 Go ahead.

86
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,800
 But just know that I'm not a huge fan of poetry.

87
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
 I will read this.

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
 I'm kind of curious.

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
 But we'll see how far I get into it.

90
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
 But anyways, that was a long intro.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,160
 Thank you so much for the gift.

92
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
 Own the Monkeys.

93
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,760
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

94
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,320
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

95
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,240
 Fly us all the way out to Columbus, Georgia.

96
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,520
 I'm reading poetry the whole time.

97
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,040
 You're like, "Ah, Jason, not everybody hates poetry as much as you do."

98
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,000
 Anyways, we're headed out to Columbus, Georgia.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I want to give a shout out.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,840
 There's a website called Columbus, Georgia Now, which is a local news website.

101
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,600
 I got a lot of my information from them.

102
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 So thank you guys.

103
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
 Columbus, Georgia.

104
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,400
 If you head out past Whiteville Road, so now you're in North Columbus, you're going

105
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
 to find the Twin Chapel Creek.

106
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,080
 You drive out there at night, though, and these are some of the things you may encounter.

107
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,040
 You're out there late at night.

108
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,200
 You're pulling up.

109
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,320
 And all of a sudden, you hear, "Wing around the rosy pocket full of poems."

110
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,520
 That's the CD you were listening to.

111
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,120
 You're like, "Oh, let me shut this off.

112
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,360
 Let me shut this off."

113
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,640
 And then it's all quiet outside.

114
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,400
 And then you hear some kids just out there talking.

115
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
 They're playing.

116
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,120
 You just get out of your car and you see a group of kids playing in the creek.

117
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,560
 Now it's, you know, 8, 9, 10 o'clock at night.

118
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
 You're in the middle of nowhere.

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,160
 There shouldn't be any kids out here.

120
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,240
 These kids are having a good time.

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,280
 But then they all turn and they look at you and they go, "Hey, you want to see our house?

122
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
 Come over here.

123
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
 We'll show you where we live.

124
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
 Come over here.

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
 Come on.

126
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 Yeah."

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
 All the kids are like, "Yeah, yeah.

128
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
 Come over here.

129
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
 Come over here."

130
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,320
 Well, don't, just don't leave a bunch of kids in the middle of nowhere.

131
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,240
 We're trying to get you out of your car.

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
 I don't advise doing it.

133
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,960
 I don't advise doing it.

134
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,760
 Apparently, that's it.

135
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,440
 There's been no reports of people going with the children, which would make me think one

136
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
 of two things.

137
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,640
 One, the citizens of Columbus, Georgia are smart enough to not get out of their, the

138
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,640
 rule the kids are telling me to.

139
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,040
 These phantom kids in the middle of nowhere.

140
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,920
 People are too smart to get out of their car or they did.

141
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,600
 They got out of the car and went to go see the kids and we never heard from them again.

142
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,880
 That's a big thing with paranormal reports and UFO reports.

143
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,560
 Something to keep in mind is we only hear the survivor stories.

144
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,920
 We only hear the stories of the people who get away.

145
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,240
 We don't know how many times people go off on these paranormal investigations and these

146
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,280
 UFO encounters and we never hear from them again.

147
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,800
 So it does have a survivor bias when we look at stuff like this.

148
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,680
 Apparently, I was reading this and I go, "Oh, that's pretty fascinating.

149
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
 That's kind of spooky."

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,280
 They added this at the end of the paragraph.

151
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,200
 This would be something you'd want to let people know of right away.

152
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,440
 If you stop your car and the kids start going, "Hey, come over here.

153
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
 Come over here."

154
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,160
 You cannot turn your car back on for an hour.

155
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,040
 Like your car won't start.

156
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
 You shouldn't go.

157
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,760
 That should be your very first sentence.

158
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,280
 So people don't do that.

159
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,040
 They're like, "Hey man, let's go out to Twin Creek Chapel.

160
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,120
 I read one sentence on a website.

161
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
 Let's go."

162
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,880
 I mean, maybe people read the whole website before they go out there.

163
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,680
 But so you don't want to shut your car off.

164
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
 You got to keep your car on.

165
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,040
 Kids will be telling you to come with them and then you just drive away.

166
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,720
 It would be the best bet.

167
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,440
 If you shut your car off, then for the next hour you're like, "Oh, then I'd rather get

168
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,360
 sucked into the infinite void than hear these kids keep yelling at me for an hour."

169
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,200
 This next one's a little grimmer than that one.

170
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,480
 I mean, I guess a bunch of dead kids is pretty grim.

171
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
 But this is worse.

172
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,040
 This is actually scarier and sadder.

173
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,600
 If you go a little bit farther down from, you're still in the Twin Chapel Creek area.

174
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,760
 Go down a little bit farther.

175
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
 There's a tunnel.

176
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,080
 And a tunnel or maybe a cave, but it's this opening.

177
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:17,120
 And at night you can hear the sounds of dying slaves.

178
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,320
 So you walk up to it and you hear, "Oh no, help us.

179
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,840
 Oh no."

180
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:30,640
 And it's just like this cacophony of male and female voices screaming out from the darkness.

181
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,840
 Apparently there was a bunch of slaves that were either put into this cave or they were

182
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,320
 hiding in this cave and they died.

183
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,240
 We don't know if it was a collapse.

184
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,080
 We don't know if they were massacred.

185
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,920
 But to this day people said they can still hear the screams and the begging of lives

186
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,240
 coming from this cave.

187
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,960
 So that's a little spooky.

188
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,840
 And then they're asking you to come and they're like, "Hey, come in the cave.

189
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
 Hey, come in the cave.

190
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
 Hang out with us."

191
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,240
 They're tormented until the end of the time.

192
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
 It's always scary.

193
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,960
 But to top it off, man, you thought you were like Jason, dead kids, dead slaves.

194
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
 Can it get worse?

195
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,720
 Well, we're about to meet the Creek Freak, who again, that's an awesome name.

196
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,880
 And I think from now on all cryptids and ghosts should have rhyming names.

197
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
 Creek Freak.

198
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
 How they not made a movie?

199
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
 It doesn't have to be about this guy.

200
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,480
 But it can just make a movie called Creek Freak.

201
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,240
 Anyways, the Creek Freak.

202
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:38,480
 If you are driving down by Twin Chapel Creek, you will see a clown sitting on the banks

203
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,200
 of the creek.

204
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,760
 Now you might obviously be totally scared, right?

205
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,960
 Because clown, I don't find clowns particularly scary.

206
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,320
 But if I saw one in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, sitting next to

207
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,240
 a creek, it's the scariest thing I've ever seen.

208
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,000
 Like a clown hanging out at a coffee shop, whatever, going to a circus.

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
 I'm not going to be scared of him.

210
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,440
 Creepy clown movies have never scared me.

211
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,040
 But a clown sitting in the darkness is terrifying.

212
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:15,520
 However, you shouldn't really be afraid of this clown because he's openly sobbing.

213
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,240
 Which isn't actually kind of creepy here.

214
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,400
 I wasn't scared of clowns until now.

215
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,880
 You walk out here, you drive out here, your car broke down because of stupid kids.

216
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,560
 You got an hour to kill, so now you're just kind of walking around the area.

217
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,160
 You may, they call him the Creek Freak.

218
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,080
 And to be fair, only one person called him.

219
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,400
 I did a ton of research on this.

220
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,280
 And I was like, "Creek Freak, that's awesome!"

221
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,680
 And then as I was doing all this research, I go, "Oh, it's just this one group of people,

222
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
 but we're going to make it stick.

223
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,560
 We're going to call him the Creek Freak as well."

224
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,520
 Normally they just say he's a sad clown.

225
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,120
 But Creek Freak sounds so awesome.

226
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,160
 He's not freaky at all.

227
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,920
 He's like having horrible human emotions right now.

228
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,400
 Anyways, this clown, this Creek Freak, is sitting next to the creek and he's openly sobbing.

229
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:11,400
 [crying]

230
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,920
 Now what's interesting?

231
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,400
 That is terrifying, right?

232
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,480
 There's a difference between seeing a ghost and then seeing a ghost in a state of agony,

233
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,800
 like the slaves, or in a state of eternal mourning, like the Creek Freak.

234
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,440
 But let's go about 17 miles south.

235
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,160
 We're going to be in the Oxbow Meadows area.

236
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,280
 There's reports of along that road late at night.

237
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:41,000
 You'll see a clown riding a bicycle down the road.

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,280
 And then he just disappears.

239
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
 He vanishes.

240
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
 What?

241
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
 Honey, did you see that?

242
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
 Did you see that?

243
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
 Did you see that clown?

244
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,120
 Can you imagine you're driving a car?

245
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,040
 And the guy next to you is like, "Whoa, whoa!

246
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
 Did you see that?

247
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,560
 There was just a clown on a bicycle right next to us.

248
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
 Then he vanished."

249
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
 You're like, "Okay.

250
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
 We're not going to go to the bar tonight.

251
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,000
 I'm taking you to the hospital to get your head checked out."

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,240
 That would be the most unbelievable sighting, but apparently you have this clown riding

253
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,200
 a bicycle down the road.

254
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,840
 And that would be scary, right?

255
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,560
 If you saw that, but the idea of the Creek Freak, this eternally mourning clown, there's

256
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
 something about it.

257
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,960
 The visual is so spooky.

258
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,680
 When I first read this, it's funny because I was reading these articles and they're like,

259
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
 "Listen, this is real.

260
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,480
 I know as ridiculous as this sounds, there's a clown crying at the creek."

261
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,240
 And you'd see other articles and they'd go, "It was interesting because they would also

262
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,240
 go, 'Listen, we know that there's clown sightings all over America right now.

263
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,160
 People are doing that thing where they're standing."

264
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,400
 They go, "This predates that."

265
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,960
 All the websites were like, "This is actually older than that."

266
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,560
 And we actually had a bunch of clowns die.

267
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,840
 We actually had a bunch of clowns die in Columbus, Ohio or really on their way, like pretty close

268
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,520
 to Columbus, Ohio.

269
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,520
 Let's head back to the year 1915, just outside of the city.

270
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,040
 It's November 22nd and a circus train.

271
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
 This is 100% true.

272
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,600
 I was able to verify this happened multiple places.

273
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,760
 A circus train is headed towards Columbus, Georgia and it's just full of freaks and weirdos,

274
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
 right?

275
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,920
 You've got the clowns, you've got bearded ladies, you've got the strong man, gorillas

276
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
 probably, there's probably an elephant probably.

277
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
 That'd be so awesome.

278
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,560
 I'd love to be in the circus.

279
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,120
 You've got all these freaks, all these weirdos, you've got a magician throwing, making the

280
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
 coal disappear.

281
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
 They're like, "We need that.

282
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,760
 We need that to power this train."

283
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,800
 Now, this was a private train owned by the circus company.

284
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,000
 So it was like old.

285
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,240
 Even by 1915 standards, it was mostly wooden.

286
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,560
 I mean, not the engine part.

287
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,240
 It's all burning to pieces.

288
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,200
 They're like, "Oh man, we really didn't think this through."

289
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,240
 But all of the boxes where the passenger cars and stuff like that, all made of wood.

290
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,320
 The opposite direction is a passenger train, a more modern passenger train, which is built

291
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,200
 and forged in American iron.

292
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,600
 There is a switch issue and both trains are now barreling towards each other and nobody

293
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,720
 knows that disaster's about to happen when these two trains hit head on.

294
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:32,160
 The passenger train would have impacts quite a few injuries, but zero deaths.

295
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:39,240
 The circus train, on the other hand, the impact was so powerful and the fire that then engulfed

296
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,600
 the area and was burning these wooden train cars was so bad, they don't know how many

297
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,160
 people died in the circus side.

298
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:54,840
 There was six confirmed deaths and 12 people missing and they believe that they burned

299
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,340
 up.

300
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,680
 The fire just completely eviscerated them.

301
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,560
 The magician's like, "I'm out of here."

302
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,360
 He just probably jumped into his hat and his hat kind of wobbled there and then that

303
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
 burns.

304
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,280
 He's like, "Oh no, this trick has gone wrong."

305
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,720
 You would have a bunch of people getting off the train.

306
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,000
 We see this a lot in old timey disasters where you would have a bunch of people dying there

307
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,440
 like, "We don't know."

308
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,200
 There was that one school that blew up.

309
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,080
 We did that episode not too long ago because they had so many migrant workers.

310
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,780
 You had so many people just kind of moving from job to job.

311
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,520
 You probably had more than 12 people because you just have what are those guys called?

312
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,880
 They're just carnies jumping on board here and there.

313
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,840
 Anyway, six confirmed dead, 12 missing.

314
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,880
 They never found them again.

315
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,320
 It's possible that these clown sightings are related to that and that would make sense.

316
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,320
 If you want to make a clown cry, kill all of his friends and burn his job to the ground.

317
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,840
 I think no matter how cheery or happy you may be, he's going to cry.

318
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,600
 Clowns, you might not know this, but underneath the makeup clowns are people too.

319
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,920
 They also have hopes and dreams.

320
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,400
 So is it possible that these hauntings are real?

321
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:15,320
 Are the urban legends born out of this verifiable train crash?

322
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
 Who knows?

323
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,720
 All I know is that from now on, the Creek Freak will forever live in the heart of every dead

324
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,000
 rabbit radio listener, whether you like it or not, you're now possessed.

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,240
 Creek Freak is in your chest.

326
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
 Own the monkeys.

327
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,000
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

328
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,520
 We are leaving behind Columbus, Georgia.

329
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,400
 Let's fly all the way out to a shopping mall.

330
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,880
 I'm 46 years old and I'm a computer guy.

331
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,200
 So I stare at my computer all the time, reading on the computer, writing on the computer.

332
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,080
 Yesterday, all of my fonts changed.

333
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,720
 I use Notepad to write everything for this show, to just write notes.

334
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,920
 I'm using Audacity to mix this episode.

335
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,280
 The fonts are different.

336
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,360
 They're clearly different.

337
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,640
 And I don't know how that happened.

338
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,320
 It happened in the middle of the day.

339
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,720
 All the fonts are different.

340
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:25,960
 But the longer I look at them, the harder it is for me to tell that they're different.

341
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:32,360
 Just in the matter of 12 hours, they're starting to look like the font used to be.

342
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,040
 But I know the font is different.

343
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,240
 We're in the shopping mall because we're going to meet this guy.

344
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,720
 Online he goes by the name Existing Session.

345
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,120
 But we're going to go ahead and call him Jerry.

346
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,720
 Five, six years ago, Jerry was around the age of eight, eight years old.

347
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,480
 So Jerry's only 14 now.

348
00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:01,600
 Jerry, a couple years ago, went to the mall with his grandma and his great-aunt and his

349
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
 mom.

350
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,520
 Doesn't that sound like a fun day?

351
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,240
 You know that the mom and the grandma and the great-aunt had more fun than Jerry could

352
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,120
 ever have at a mall.

353
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,800
 They probably treasure that memory.

354
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,720
 But that's a good segue because we're going to be talking about memories.

355
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,840
 Jerry is on this mall mission.

356
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,440
 This is the first time he hangs out with his grandma and his great-aunt a lot.

357
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,080
 This isn't even the first time they went to the mall.

358
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,360
 And he's had this thing he does.

359
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,560
 He's at the mall when he's going down the escalator.

360
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,080
 He likes to jump off the escalator, not jump over the sides.

361
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,280
 But before it hits the ground, he's gotten braver over time.

362
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,680
 He now does it when it's a little bit higher, but he jumps from the moving stair and lands

363
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,160
 on the stationary pad on the floor.

364
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,840
 So it's like a straight jump.

365
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,040
 It's like a little like, whew, pop.

366
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,600
 It's dumb.

367
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,480
 Super dumb to do.

368
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
 People die on escalators.

369
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
 I was about to say all the time.

370
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,280
 I don't think it's all the time, but it's a moving staircase.

371
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,560
 They're not made to be fun.

372
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,320
 It's not a setup for some sort of adventure.

373
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,640
 I come across an article maybe once or twice a year about someone dying on an escalator.

374
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,880
 Jumping off an escalator, sliding down the escalator, falling off an escalator.

375
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,880
 So it does happen.

376
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,840
 So you shouldn't be goofing off on one, basically.

377
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,520
 But anyway, so Jerry is on this escalator.

378
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
 Whee!

379
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
 He does this jump.

380
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,120
 And he goes, it's kind of high.

381
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,200
 This isn't the first time he's done it.

382
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,760
 So when they're all close shopping, his mom has left.

383
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,160
 His mom is still at the mall, but she's doing her own shopping right now.

384
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,640
 He's standing there with his great aunt and his grandma, and they're going down this escalator

385
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,520
 and he has done this under times.

386
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,080
 They're going to do it again.

387
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,080
 He jumps and he totally biffs it.

388
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,000
 He falls down so hard right on that stationary pad.

389
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,760
 For whatever reason, the jump didn't work this time.

390
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,080
 But not just that.

391
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:16,040
 When he fell down, he's basically right in that little tiny gap that's designed so no

392
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
 human body part can go in.

393
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:24,040
 But you're not supposed to lay down on it either, where the escalators, the escalator

394
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,800
 stairs disappear into the bottom to begin their trip back up.

395
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,280
 And just the solid metal plate.

396
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,880
 So it's basically like, I don't know, maybe a quarter of an inch, probably smaller, of

397
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,440
 solid unmoving metal.

398
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,560
 And then constantly moving metal with those little teeth on it.

399
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,520
 He lands right in that gap.

400
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:53,720
 And in an instant, it shreds the flesh right off of his right shin.

401
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,120
 Like he just feels it get torn away.

402
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,600
 And he is completely in shock.

403
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,200
 Like the pain level when he first stopped, he was doing the jump, he's probably pretty

404
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
 euphoric.

405
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,520
 He lands and then just that escalator goes shh, just takes the skin right off of his

406
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,280
 leg and he doesn't feel anything.

407
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,640
 Like he's instantly going into shock.

408
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,200
 It's so painful.

409
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,040
 And he's kind of just laying there.

410
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,840
 Hopefully maybe he moved at least a couple inches.

411
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,800
 It's all yum, yum, yum.

412
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,560
 Escalators eating him up.

413
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
 He's laying there.

414
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
 He can't, doesn't know what to do.

415
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,400
 He goes, I didn't feel it at all.

416
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,800
 I just was sitting there and he goes, I started to black out.

417
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,160
 Like it was that bad.

418
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,560
 My vision starts to fade.

419
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,880
 I'm losing my senses.

420
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,680
 He goes, I remember my grandma, my great aunt standing over me.

421
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:55,440
 I remember my mom running out of a store and there's a strange man with her as well.

422
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,720
 Someone, it's the freak freak.

423
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,480
 He's all shopping for Kleenex.

424
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,000
 His mom and the strange man come running towards him and he blacks out.

425
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,520
 But then he wakes up.

426
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:16,400
 He wakes up in bed at home and he figures, you know, like what happened?

427
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,280
 I must have passed out when that horrible thing, like, I mean, sure it was my fault,

428
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,200
 but then it started eating the flesh off my leg.

429
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,800
 I didn't expect that in a million years.

430
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,640
 And he looks down and his right leg, perfectly normal.

431
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
 What?

432
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:38,320
 Just kind of sitting there in bed and he goes, that must have been like the craziest dream

433
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,880
 I've ever had.

434
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,320
 Because there's no physical damage to me.

435
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,200
 I mean, let's think about it.

436
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,120
 I am eight years old, so I do have my brain can process logic.

437
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,400
 I had this horrible event that happened to me and the story started off with him like

438
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,000
 talking about what he ate that morning when they went over to the grandma and the great

439
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,960
 aunt's house and what he ate that morning.

440
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,080
 All this preparation was a super detailed dream.

441
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
 I left it out.

442
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,280
 Honestly, it was kind of boring, but he can tell everything that happened that day.

443
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,520
 He blacks out after the escalator accident.

444
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
 He wakes up.

445
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,160
 His legs perfectly fine.

446
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,960
 So he goes, the message has been like the most detailed vivid dream I've ever had because

447
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,160
 how else would I wake up in my bed with no injury?

448
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,920
 That's the only possibility.

449
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,360
 Well, Jerry developed a fear of escalators.

450
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,520
 If you can imagine that.

451
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:39,800
 Jerry developed a intense phobia of ever being on an escalator again, but they went to the

452
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,680
 mall a lot.

453
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:49,920
 Well, a couple of years later, he's now 10, 11 years old.

454
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,760
 Jerry's at the mall with his mom and they're going to take the escalator to go up.

455
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,160
 He's like, oh no, mom, can we take the stairs?

456
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,440
 The mom turns them and goes, that is weird.

457
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,240
 He normally did not use to mind taking the escalator.

458
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
 You love jumping off.

459
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,640
 We haven't been on an escalator in a while.

460
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,520
 Why do you have such an intense fear of escalators?

461
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,320
 I think this was the first time it dawned on his mom.

462
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,000
 We haven't ridden an escalator in two years.

463
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,640
 Her calves are hella big.

464
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,280
 They've really been working those stairs.

465
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,200
 She goes, why don't you want to ride the escalators anymore?

466
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,400
 Jerry goes, listen, this is going to sound super weird, but a couple of years ago I had

467
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,800
 this super intense dream.

468
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,640
 I had this dream that I was out with you guys and we were coming down the escalator, or

469
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,800
 you were shopping with the Creek Freak, but we were coming down the escalator and I jumped

470
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,920
 off and I fell and it just tore the skin right off of my leg.

471
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,720
 It was a horrible dream.

472
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,840
 It was so vivid.

473
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,520
 I just, I don't want to be on escalators anymore.

474
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,040
 And his mom's looking at Jerry and she goes, that wasn't a dream.

475
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
 What?

476
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,960
 Yeah, Jerry, that happened.

477
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,680
 Me, you and your great aunt, your grandma were out in the mall and you were goofing off.

478
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,360
 And you got the flesh ripped right off of your leg.

479
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 Yeah, no, that happened.

480
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:19,080
 Now remember Jerry woke up and his leg was totally fine.

481
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,240
 Wasn't that it was bandaged up or anything like that?

482
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,560
 Like it was perfectly normal.

483
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,520
 But the injury that he suffered would have taken time to heal.

484
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,360
 You would have this whole thing where it would have been bandaged up.

485
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,200
 You might have gotten medical attention, maybe not if it was just on the surface, but you

486
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 bandaged it up.

487
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,760
 It's going to scab over.

488
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,600
 It's like a long process.

489
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 You're picking up the scab.

490
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,040
 Jerry, quit picking up the scabs.

491
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,360
 And then you just finally let it get back to normal and then your skin's back.

492
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,640
 It's not necessarily that it was going to be heavily scarred, but it's also not going

493
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,960
 to be healed in an hour or two.

494
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,760
 Jerry goes, no, no, no, it was a dream.

495
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,560
 And the mom's like, no, that actually happened.

496
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
 You fell down.

497
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,200
 You really got your leg scraped up.

498
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,360
 So Jerry goes, when did it heal then?

499
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,200
 Because the next thing I know, my leg was totally fine.

500
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,960
 Like if it wasn't a dream, when did my leg heal?

501
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,160
 When did it get totally normal?

502
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:21,080
 And the mom goes, oh, no, Jerry, it, wait, wait.

503
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,720
 You're right.

504
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,440
 Jerry, I don't remember your leg healing either.

505
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,680
 I remember the accident.

506
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:41,760
 Clearly that wasn't a dream, but I don't remember, I don't remember any of the healing process.

507
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,160
 Now you could argue that maybe it was such a surface level scratch that it didn't take

508
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,840
 a bunch of healing.

509
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,240
 But even from the mom's account, it did seem like it was pretty gnarly.

510
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,720
 It'd be the same thing.

511
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,480
 I'm not saying it gouged out muscle.

512
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,960
 I know people who totally just mess up on skateboarding and they have that road rash

513
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,280
 all up their leg or on their arm, and it's there for like a week or more.

514
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,720
 And you can watch it slowly disappear.

515
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,960
 It's not an instant thing.

516
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,080
 I mean, at the very least, I would compare it to a case of road rash.

517
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,800
 It's not that it's necessary.

518
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,920
 He says that it took flesh off.

519
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,880
 It just completely just ate into him.

520
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,160
 But even he's not saying there was muscle tissue missing.

521
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,920
 He needed physical therapy or anything like that.

522
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,640
 It would be like if you totally messed up a skateboard trick, got road rash all down

523
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,240
 the left side of your arm, and then the next day your arm is completely normal.

524
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,720
 That's what he's saying it is.

525
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,480
 And even his mom goes, I don't remember the recovery process at all.

526
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,440
 It's a simple story.

527
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,720
 But it's one of those stories.

528
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,760
 It's one of those paranormal or in this version glitch of the Matrix alternate universe story

529
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,280
 that is fairly inconsequential.

530
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,440
 It's an interesting story.

531
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,960
 We have to look at what mechanism would cause him to do this.

532
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,560
 And when I say cause him, not to jump off the escalator in the first place, but my theory

533
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:18,480
 on this story is that he, because we do see this with quantum, they call it quantum suicide

534
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,200
 or quantum immortality, where he, in that theory, you die and then you shift to a reality

535
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,760
 where you're still alive because you cannot process, you cannot comprehend or process

536
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,320
 information in a universe.

537
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
 You are dead.

538
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,120
 So you just simply exist in another universe.

539
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,720
 That's that theory in a nutshell.

540
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,420
 That's the idea that he, but this isn't, he didn't die.

541
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,420
 This was just an injury.

542
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,560
 He got injured in one universe and then he shifted to another universe where the injury

543
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
 never happened.

544
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,680
 The only thing that's interesting about that is his mom shifted with him because she also

545
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
 remembers it.

546
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
 It would be super interesting.

547
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,640
 I don't know if the grandparent and the great Anna are still alive, but it'd be interesting

548
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:05,640
 to ask them as well if they also remember the event happening.

549
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
 That's the first key.

550
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,840
 Like if they go, "Oh, we don't ever remember you jumping off the escalator."

551
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,680
 Now you've definitely have a conundrum because now you have two people who don't even, it's

552
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,440
 almost like in this universe, the accident never happened.

553
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,240
 So you might have outside observers who go, "I don't remember that.

554
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
 I don't remember you."

555
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,760
 I remember you jumping off the escalator because you did that all the time, but I don't remember

556
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
 you falling down and getting your leg scraped up.

557
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,680
 Now we have people, basically you have a Mandela effect within a family.

558
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:39,880
 But the question is, you know, why would you shift just because your leg got scraped up?

559
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,800
 It seems so minor, but did it have a long term consequences that he not get to ask Susie

560
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,840
 to the prom in high school senior year?

561
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,280
 She's like, "I don't take people who fall off escalators."

562
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
 No way.

563
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
 You suck."

564
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
 And he's like, "No."

565
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
 Like, we don't know.

566
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,200
 If quantum immortality and quantum suicide, there's so many questions that you have to

567
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,680
 ask about that.

568
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,520
 My main one is if you keep shifting into a universe where you didn't die, what happens

569
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,560
 when you're 89 and you have a heart attack?

570
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,120
 Do you shift into the body of you at 89?

571
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,240
 One second before your heart attack and you didn't have it, but now two seconds later

572
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,320
 you have it and then you shift into your body at the same age, right about to have a heart

573
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,440
 attack like, is that the end?

574
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,520
 Or do you shift into a younger version of yourself and no memory?

575
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,880
 Like, there's so many questions about it.

576
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,160
 We don't even know if it's a real phenomenon, but the idea that that would happen.

577
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,400
 But now we're just talking about injuries.

578
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,280
 Shifting into a universe where you didn't suffer an injury.

579
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,400
 I had a buddy a long time ago, worked for this call center.

580
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
 Super nice guy.

581
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:53,040
 We were talking one day and he mentioned that he had broken his neck.

582
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,600
 I was like, "What are you talking about?"

583
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
 He's like, "Yeah, I broke my neck."

584
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
 I was like, "What?"

585
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,600
 And I go, "You're not paralyzed?"

586
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,720
 He's like, "Dude, this is the craziest story."

587
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,960
 He said he was out of the beach with a bunch of his friends and he was showing off and

588
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,880
 there was a big pile of sand.

589
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,440
 And for whatever reason, he thought it would be funny.

590
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
 He was going to show off.

591
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,720
 He goes, "Oh, those guys swim in the water, but I..."

592
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,760
 He called me Earthworm Jim.

593
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,400
 He runs and he jumps into this big sand dune.

594
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
 They're on a beach.

595
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,880
 It's like sandy sand.

596
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,960
 He jumps head first and it's not a sand dune.

597
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,160
 It's a huge rock.

598
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:45,080
 It's a huge rock with a coating of sand over it.

599
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,080
 And he goes, "I jumped into that sand dune head first and my neck broke and I just fell

600
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
 down."

601
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,680
 Like he's just laying on the ground.

602
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,480
 I'm just screaming.

603
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,480
 So they call the paramedics.

604
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
 They're all up first.

605
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,080
 They're like, "Oh, you're faking Earthworm Jim.

606
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
 Come on, dig.

607
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
 Dig through the dirt."

608
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,400
 He's like, "Ah."

609
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,000
 They eventually, after they had their fun and games, they called the medics.

610
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Medics come out.

611
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 They put them in that halo.

612
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,080
 They put them in that thing because they're like, "You cannot move your neck.

613
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,640
 If you move your neck, you just might die.

614
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
 Your neck's broken."

615
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
 So they put them in that halo.

616
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,200
 They stabilize his neck and he's in the hospital room and the doctor's like, "Your neck's broken.

617
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,320
 This is going to take some time to get this fixed, but we believe that we'll make it."

618
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,880
 If we take the halo off, you'll probably die or you'll just become paralyzed because he

619
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,640
 could walk and he could move his arms.

620
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
 Everything was fine.

621
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
 That's what he could...

622
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,320
 When you think of a neck being broken, you think they're paralyzed.

623
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,680
 We're like sitting there and I was like, "Dude, so like what happened next?

624
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,760
 How does the story play out?"

625
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,920
 And he goes, "Well, because my neck was broken, they sent me to a part of the hospital of

626
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,360
 people with broken necks."

627
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,520
 And he goes, "I felt awful."

628
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:01,640
 It was not because the staff and the staff was wonderful.

629
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,080
 He goes, "I go to the broken neck ward.

630
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,280
 I'm going to be here for a couple of weeks.

631
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,520
 I was the only one who could walk."

632
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,640
 He said some of them were paralyzed from the waist down.

633
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,000
 He goes, "Some of them were paralyzed from the neck down."

634
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,200
 He goes, "A lot of them were my age, people who recently broke their neck."

635
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,120
 And he felt like it was like when he first...

636
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,720
 When he's laying there on the ground, he's terrified, right?

637
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,000
 He thinks, "Oh my God, like I know something seriously wrong with me."

638
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,720
 And once the doctor starts explaining he broke your neck, it's a miracle you're not paralyzed.

639
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,960
 His family is joyful and he's joyful.

640
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,440
 And all of this stuff, he's so thankful that even though he broke his neck, he's going

641
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
 to be okay.

642
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,920
 But once he walked into that ward, all those other people around his age who suffered similar

643
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
 injuries.

644
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,040
 He had a big injury, just one a different direction.

645
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:04,400
 I felt so bad that I walked away with really nothing but a scratch.

646
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
 Because he saw...

647
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,040
 I think if he had just been in the hospital by himself, he would have been like, "Hoo!

648
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,540
 Close call."

649
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,460
 But seeing all those other people struggling to just do...

650
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,560
 Some of them couldn't even do basic tasks, right?

651
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,200
 They could talk, they could think, watch television.

652
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,080
 That's when it really hit him.

653
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,160
 I didn't know anything about Mandela effects.

654
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,320
 I didn't know anything about, like, obviously I knew about alternate universes from DC Comics

655
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
 and stuff like that.

656
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,760
 I knew it was like a science fiction thing, but you didn't really think of it back then.

657
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,040
 This would have been really early 2000s.

658
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,960
 But now looking back at that, is it possible that there was another version of him where

659
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,600
 he snapped his neck?

660
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,720
 There's probably multiple versions of him where he snapped his neck.

661
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,160
 And well, he snapped his neck on all of them.

662
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,640
 But, well, some of them, he didn't jump on the rock, but there's versions where he was

663
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,960
 killed on the spot, versions where he was paralyzed from the waist down, from the neck

664
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,160
 down.

665
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,680
 It's such an interesting topic because you wonder...

666
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,120
 There are people who are physically and mentally suffering in our timeline.

667
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,320
 Some of them may be listening to this podcast.

668
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,880
 And you go, "Well, wait a second.

669
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,640
 Why am I in this alternate reality?

670
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,000
 Why am I in this reality?"

671
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,920
 But there's another version of me who's walking around.

672
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,560
 I want to be that guy, not this guy.

673
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,400
 It opens a whole weird can of worms when you go...

674
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,800
 When you understand that human suffering is part of being alive and the human body is

675
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,960
 a system and no system is perfect and things will go wrong.

676
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,240
 When you just look at our reality, we can comprehend stuff.

677
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,680
 You can go, "Why me, God?

678
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
 Why me?"

679
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:52,160
 But at the end of the day, we go, "This is just the order of the universe."

680
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,840
 But once you start to bring the whole multiverse into it, you can ask that question.

681
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,120
 "Why am I in this version?

682
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,920
 Why did this little boy who fell in this escalator just scraped his leg and he moved to a universe

683
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,240
 where he never had that injury?

684
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,120
 But I'm stuck in this universe where both my legs were chopped off in a train accident."

685
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,080
 I crashed into a clown train in the year 2022.

686
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,520
 Can you believe that?

687
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
 Interesting questions.

688
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,120
 It's such an interesting story.

689
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,840
 It's inconsequential, but it really makes you think, "What is the reason why we hop

690
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
 alternate realities?"

691
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
 Or do we?

692
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,920
 You know, again, that's a question in and of itself.

693
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,320
 Is it possible to move between realities?

694
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,720
 Do we do it voluntarily?

695
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
 Are we forced into them?

696
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,600
 Are we?

697
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
 Why not?

698
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,520
 Now, again, one of the things I love about doing paranormal research, you just don't

699
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,160
 know what you're going to find.

700
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,760
 You don't know what dots you're going to connect.

701
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,880
 But they're out there.

702
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,240
 Those dots are out there.

703
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,440
 I do think that things can happen and it seems like they're random.

704
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,760
 And maybe they aren't.

705
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,880
 Maybe this story just happened to this one kid.

706
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:15,280
 Maybe it's not a clue as to the nature of reality jumping or Mandela effects or anything

707
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
 like that.

708
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,600
 Maybe it's just some weird event where a kid scraped his leg and then it never healed

709
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,280
 because it didn't have to.

710
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,160
 Or maybe it's a clue, no matter how small and insignificant at this time.

711
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,320
 Maybe it is a clue that lets us know not only what happens after we die, like quantum immortality,

712
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:43,480
 but even lets us realize what's going on every single day in our lives.

713
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,800
 It could be something as dramatic as dying and then switching to a reality where you

714
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,920
 never died.

715
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:59,720
 It could be something as bizarre as getting a fairly serious leg wound, the very least

716
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,480
 a bad case of road rash, and then it instantly disappearing.

717
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,600
 Nobody knows how it healed up.

718
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:16,280
 Or it could be something as insignificant as the font changing on your computer, almost

719
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,280
 right before your eyes.

720
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:30,480
 If we can figure out what causes people to switch to an alternate reality, not through

721
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,340
 death but through these other bizarre minor events.

722
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:41,200
 If we can figure out that mechanism, then maybe it would be us who makes the determination

723
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,880
 to switch to the other reality, not fate or tragedy.

724
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,080
 It would be us.

725
00:38:50,080 --> 00:39:09,020
 If we can figure out what's causing it, we can control it.

726
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,620
