 What lengths would you go to to eat a hot dog? We take a look at a bizarre
 phenomenon that seems to happen to people with severe dementia right before
 they die and then one day a young man was walking through the forest when he saw
 a deer hiding behind a tree. Or was it? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing. Hopefully not
 eating hot dogs. First off let's give a shout out to one of our legacy
 Patreons coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now. Let's give it up for
 Mikhail Malone. Everyone give a round of applause to Mikhail walking into Dead
 Rabbit Command. Really really appreciate your continued support with Dead Rabbit
 Radio. You guys can't support the Patreon that's fine too. Just help spread the word
 about the show. Really really helps out a lot. Yesterday's Patreon supporter Greg,
 I was looking over an email he sent me earlier back when he first joined the
 Patreon. He found out about this show because of a flyer I put up in Sacramento.
 I put up a flyer at a local grocery store when I was visiting a couple years ago
 and he found it. So that is a great way to attract new listeners. I have flyers
 you can print out in the show notes. Just tell people about the show. Talk about
 it online. If you're embarrassed, if you don't want to talk about it in person,
 talk about it on wherever. Just help get the word out about the show. You have no
 idea how much that helps the show out. Mikhail I'm gonna go ahead and toss you a
 shovel and some coal. Let's hop aboard the Carboner Caboose. We are leaving behind
 Dead Rabbit Command. We are traveling all the way out to India.

 It will make it sound like you are pooping in a cathedral.
 They poop in this hole and then the hole has a trough.
 This is a real invention. They have this trough
 attached to it. So they poop in this hole and then your poop
 goes into it and then goes down the trough and then there is pigs there and they
 eat your poop. It's a win-win really.
 The pigs get a delicious meal.
 You are like, "Dang it Jason." I didn't eat hot dogs
 because you said not to. So I made a delicious bowl of stew.
 You are like, "I can't eat stew or hot dogs."
 These pigs are eating the poop. It's a win-win because the pigs get to eat all sorts of
 spices and delightful tastes and the humans don't have to worry about
 their feces. So it works out for both things. But remember this state
 of India, mostly Hindus, they are vegetarians so they are not worried about it.
 What has happened is that people
 have started moving into this area who aren't vegetarians.
 And so for decades these pig toilets were totally
 fine. But then you'd be sitting there
 and people would be like using the toilet and then they'd be like, "That's weird. It's backed up.
 Why is my old natural toilet backed up?" And they go out there. There's less pigs.
 They're like, "What? There used to be like five pigs in here and now there's only
 like three. So the poop's not getting eaten as quickly."
 And then the other person would be like, "Oh yeah, I'm
 Johnson. I'm Harry Johnson. We just moved in like a couple days ago."
 I saw this though. This is true. There wasn't a getting
 Harry Johnson. This example isn't true. But what was happening to us
 people? That's a horrible name. Harry Johnson.
 People were coming in from around the country who weren't vegetarians
 who saw all these pigs that no one was slaughtering and they began
 killing them and eating them. And these pigs' primary diet
 was human poop. And the people who lived there
 were like, "Don't do that. Please don't do that. First off, that's our
 toilet. You're eating our toilet. We need these. This is our sewage
 system." People didn't care. It was delicious free
 pork. You have all the hot dogs and pork loins
 and everything that you wanted. These big plump pigs.
 But they were fed off of human poop. Now people were saying this is super
 unsanitary. Quit eating the poop pigs. And
 it was unsanitary. It's just disgusting. It's just gross too.
 It's not just unsanitary. Nowadays underground plumbing is far more common
 in the state of Goa. It's not such a big issue. But there are still
 pig toilets there. So if you ever find yourself in the state of Goa and you see some big old
 fat pig walking down the street and it's just begging to be eaten,
 don't eat it. Because that pig is probably full of human feces.
 Also, it's probably not a good idea to just eat pigs
 that are wandering through town. I'm sure it belongs to someone. Whether or not it's fed off of
 poop, I don't think you should just walk around town
 with a fork, a knife, and a bib just chasing after pigs. It will
 end badly for you, no matter what part of the world you're in.
 Mikhail, let's go ahead and leave behind India. Let's call in the
 hair hang glider. Let's hop onto Mikhail's back. And he's going to jump off the tallest cliff
 in India. I'm sure it's some giant mountain. And we are going to glide
 all the way from India to a hospital in the middle
 of America.
 Now technically we didn't have to go all the way back to America.
 This happens in hospitals all over the world, but you know home sweet home.
 We go into the hospital, we're walking around, and hospitals are generally very depressing
 places. Sure, babies are being born and broken
 legs are being fixed, but that's not good stuff it does have in hospitals
 too, but for the most part they're pretty depressing.
 We're walking around the hospital and we see a guy laying in bed and he's like,
 "Betty? Betty? Oh, Betty. Remember when we
 used to play hopscotch together? That was such fun times. Back
 in Herbert Hoover was still president and we're like, "Oh man, this poor
 guy has Alzheimer's and he's like doing the jitterbug and his loved ones are like,
 "Dad, Betty's been dead for three years and Herbert Hoover was
 a terrible president. He was awful. I'm pretty sure the jitterbug wasn't invented
 back then, but it doesn't matter. He's still doing the jitterbug." He's like,
 "And Marty McFly came back and saved the day."
 Before you shut it off. This segment is not me making fun of people with Alzheimer's.
 Okay, before you shut it off. The point of this story, it's actually
 really uplifting. It's funny because the hospital analogy, you would think
 a story about Alzheimer's and dementia would be depressing, but not this one.
 There is this thing called
 terminal lucidity. It's not a conspiracy
 theory, it's something that has been observed for over 100 years.
 Terminal lucidity. What it is is you take people
 who have dementia, who have Alzheimer's, who have like super advanced Parkinson's
 where they can't feed themselves, they don't know where they're at.
 They just, sometimes they're completely in a vegetative state, sometimes they're
 just so discombobulated, they don't know where they're at or who you are or anything like that, and that's
 tragic, but one day you walk into the room and they're like,
 "Billy, hey, what's up, dude? Oh man, you're my bro.
 Hey, oh dude, this has been so crazy, I'm sitting in this bed. And did you know
 poor Betty, she died like 20 years ago and
 Herbert Hoover was a terrible president." And you're like, you're back.
 He's like, "I am, I am, I feel great.
 I know I'm in this hospital and I know it's the year 2021, but
 you look good too. Like, yeah, just everything's going so
 well." What terminal lucidity is, is your
 brain basically fixing itself.
 This has been observed over and over and over again. You'll walk in and someone who the day before
 couldn't feed themselves. They're eating, they're laughing, they're joking.
 They remember everything. They're back to who they were.
 The person you remember, the person that you've watched slowly fall apart
 for the past couple months or a couple years is back to normal.
 But, as beautiful as this moment is,
 the name "terminal lucidity" says it all.
 This happens shortly before they die.
 But, it seems like a gift, doesn't it? You have that
 person back in your life the way they were, the way they should be.
 Had the illness not interfered, this is the person you would be
 talking to. They'd be back to normal. And that seems like a gift. That seems
 like those final memories are good ones.
 It's the person you loved who's back sitting with you
 in their bed having this conversation.
 We don't know why it happens though. The idea, because it's linked to death,
 the idea is as the brain is dying,
 as the brain is basically shutting off, it goes into a fever mode.
 And it actually begins to
 excite dead end parts of the brain.
 It's just to bring those things back to life. Some people say that
 it could be caused by fever, drying up little pockets of water in the brain,
 where they're a little whole. They don't know. But they've seen it so many times,
 they know it is an actual thing. The problem is, we don't see it a lot
 nowadays. So you could easily attribute it to
 some old timing medicine thing, to medical documents written by excited
 doctors and stuff like that. No. The reason why
 this is going back to the sad part, the reason why we don't see it as much today,
 we could start seeing it tomorrow. The reason why we don't see it as much
 today is because our relationship with death has changed,
 and our pharmaceutical answers to death have changed.
 Nowadays when you get to that level, and I'm not judging anyone
 who have had loved ones and they've authorized the doctors to do this, or doctors who have
 done this, but now when people get to that state when they're so close to the end of their
 life, and they're so mentally confused,
 we drug them a lot. And the drugs interfere
 with this process. Because if you're drugged up,
 your brain's not gonna, you're not gonna wake up anyways. You're not gonna pop up the last
 day you're alive and go, "Johnny!" Apparently
 it's super creepy. It's not gonna happen, you're too drugged
 up. So that's why they think we don't see it today. Our pharmaceutical answer is actually
 preventing this. But again, it's not 100% like it's not saying that if your loved
 one wasn't drugged up, they would have popped up and returned to normal.
 A depressing story, but with the silver lining.
 There's no silver lining, and that, they still die in the end. So yes, a depressing
 event, but a beautiful story, I think. Even though it does end
 with the person dying, they get to spend some final hours
 back the way they were. So I think that's
 really, really interesting story. Mikhail, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the
 carbonar copter. We are leaving behind that hospital
 in the United States. We are headed on out to Charlottesville, Virginia.
 The year was 2008. We're actually walking down an old country trail
 with a college student named Tyler. Now Tyler is a pseudonym that I've given this person.
 We don't actually know this person's real name. They've chosen to rename
 Anonymous, but we're walking along this little country area. It's mostly
 Woods. We're headed to a nearby liquor store
 to pick up some cigarettes, but we're taking a little shortcut through the neighborhood.
 It's basically, I've never been to Charlottesville, but the way the story
 makes it sound is that there's civilization dense, wooded
 areas where you don't see another human for miles, and then a liquor store.
 So I don't know how this place is laid out. It's by old Lynchburg Road.
 If you guys are familiar with the area, old Lynchburg Road area
 supposedly is pretty tree-y.
 Jason, I think the word you're looking for is forest.
 The sun is going down. We're still walking along this trail
 with Tyler. It's a normal walk. We get to where we always get.
 There's a little split in the trail. And Tyler's walked this trail before,
 but this is the point where something's a little bit different today.
 All of a sudden Tyler feels really uneasy.
 He starts to hear sounds of movement in the area, huh? What?
 What? He's looking around from side to side. He's looking
 from left to right. And he sees it. He sees the source of
 the noise. Standing behind a tree, almost hiding behind a tree.
 He sees a deer. The deer's just
 kind of staring at Tyler. He's off the trail. He's standing
 underneath the tree, but still a little too close for comfort. Now, normally
 you might be excited to see a deer in the woods. A little, little
 nature's little gerbils. You know, they're not going to do nothing to you. They just kind of walk around.
 You can pet them. You're like, Jason, I really hope you're not
 wild. I really hope you're not trying to pet wild deer. You know what I mean?
 Like, okay, they do have like the big antlers, but for the most
 part they're not going to hurt you. Tyler's staring there and he's looking at this thing and
 he goes, "Something's not right."
 This deer did have antlers. It had a mighty
 rack of antlers. But he said they looked
 wrong. They were thick
 burly antlers. He's staring there and
 he's looking at this deer and he realizes, "Those are moose antlers."
 And as he stood in that forest and the sun slowly
 setting, it's getting darker every moment, he starts to
 realize, "Not only is it impossible for a deer to have moose antlers,
 those aren't even moose antlers. It's
 like a close approximation of what a moose
 antler would look like." And he's looking to have this
 freak, this freak of nature obviously, because a deer can't have antlers like this.
 Maybe it has some sort of disease. Maybe something's going on with it.
 So he starts to continue his way down the trail and the deer begins to walk
 as he's walking. Keeping pace with him but still in the forest.
 Just watching him and following him.
 He starts walking a little bit faster and this deer begins to move faster
 as well. Tyler, at this point he's trying to figure out
 is he being pursued? Is this thing curious? Is it just following him?
 What's going on? But he begins to walk even faster and at this point
 the deer is walking faster. It's keeping pace with him. So he has a
 unique reaction to this. I think if I was there, or if most people were there
 they would continue to run. They'd break out and run because whatever this thing
 was does seem to be pursuing him and it doesn't seem
 normal. You're in the middle of the woods, you're in Charlottesville, Virginia
 and this thing is moving when you move.
 He begins to walk even faster. The deer
 keeps pace with him and then he stops.
 He comes to a dead stop. The deer
 reacts to him completely stopping by running at
 him in a full sprint.
 As this deer is running through the forest, Tyler picks up on some cues
 that maybe he's not just looking at a normal deer with a weird antler
 deformity.
 First up, I guess this is more than just a cue. This is an
 obvious thing. You're facing down something that shouldn't exist. He says
 as it's running towards the forest it was making this very, very bizarre
 motion. He said it was moving towards me at full
 speed but all of its knees were
 bent in the wrong way. And he said the way that it moved
 was like a rocking horse.
 It would rock back and forth on these weird
 deformed knees and it would
 just move closer and closer and closer to him through the forest.
 He's watching this deer move in a way that you shouldn't be able to have any
 locomotion whatsoever. Tyler's like, "Taylor's like, forget that."
 I felt bad for it when I saw the funky horns but I don't have no idea
 I don't feel bad for this now. It's doing something that is, you can't move like that.
 It's breaking laws of physics. He begins running down the trail and this thing
 is fully pursuing him down the trail at this point.
 And he makes a turn. There's a bend in the trail. He's running.
 He turns. He's now out of sight of the deer
 and when he looks down the long stretch of trail in front of him, there is the deer
 standing in the middle of the trail.
 It has somehow cut him off.
 He begins to step backwards and he actually trips over his own feet
 falling to the forest floor. While he's getting himself up off the
 ground, he realizes whatever this is,
 this is not a deer. He said that
 its eyes were facing forward.
 In the sense that generally predators have their
 eyes on the front of their heads and not predators
 or herbivorous things like that have the eyes on the side of their head so they can see
 predators without having to move their head a lot. He said this deer had its eyes
 firmly in the front of its head. When he saw that
 it clicked in his mind. This, whatever this is, it is a predator.
 It was designed to hunt. He said its face
 was more round than a deer and it had jowls
 that just hung there as this creature is staring directly at him
 standing in the middle of the trail. He realizes that
 every single thing about this is wrong. It's not a deer. It's something
 trying to be a deer, but still not being
 able to hide its full lethal predatory nature.
 As he's getting to his feet
 he sees this creature stand up on its hind legs
 and begin to walk towards him.
 He said the very idea of it standing on its hind legs to him
 seemed like some sort of challenge.
 That was the initial reaction. This thing is trying to challenge me. It's trying to show me how powerful
 it is. And he said from hoof to horn
 it was 8 feet tall and towered over him.
 And as he's turning to race back down the trail to get back to
 safety he starts to hear this thing
 chase him again this time chasing him on just
 two legs. He felt that if he turned around
 to look at this thing he was dead. He just
 ran as fast as he could. He got to that split in the trail
 and then almost immediately
 he no longer heard the sounds of being pursued.
 That's an interesting story. The author went on to say that maybe it was some sort of nature spirit
 in the area that his friend who lived in the area believed that
 there were a lot of things in the woods. Old stories he had heard that his
 family had passed on. About stuff that people just couldn't
 explain. That's an interesting story. It could be
 a nature spirit. You would think it would pop up more often
 because this didn't seem like the most remote trail. They didn't really give a lot of good
 description about the area itself. But if it's a trail that's even traveled
 say once a day or once every other day what's this forest spirit
 doing the rest of the time? I'm just reading, just reading, not deer monthly.
 So it's curious if it's a forest spirit what would
 have provoked it when Tyler was in the woods. But let's go ahead and put our
 conspiracy caps on and finish the episode up like this. You know, urban sprawl.
 This story took place in 2008. Who knows if these woods are
 still even there. We have urban sprawl. Anyone
 who's lived any amount of time they can go back to the area they grew up in
 and go "Well I can't believe they put all these houses up here. Look at..." And what happens
 when we pave over this stuff where these
 spirits or these creatures reside?
 Yeah you could say maybe as we're going to start putting down
 parking lots for Walmart's and build tract houses. Maybe
 it'll be like a furry vengeance thing where the animals will unite under the
 guidance of a warlord's spirit and they'll fight the
 vibrant and frazier and push them into a bunch of cement and have a skunk
 fart in his face. That could happen. But think about this.
 What if we do pave over all this stuff? Build up these
 McDonald's and these Arby's and these Taco Bells. We create a burger punk
 society where it's fast food instead of nature.
 Everything is paved over. It's glistening aluminum
 and stucco. Where do these creatures go now?
 If it's in the forest and assumes the form of a forest creature
 if it's in an urban environment it would assume the form
 of the urban environment. You're walking to catch the
 bus one day. Steam is rising out of the manhole cover.
 You're just enjoying your favorite music
 playing through your iPod as you're standing at the bus stop.
 You don't notice the man behind you. You don't
 notice that he walks with an odd gate.
 You don't notice him because he seems to blend in with everything.
 Almost some sort of bizarre camouflage.
 He stands behind you at that bus stop. It's just you too.
 But anyone who drives past only sees one person.
 He's the perfect predator. Five minutes later when the bus
 pulls up there's no one at the bus stop. Thus driver
 doesn't think anything of it. Continues along his route.
 The perfect predator will blend into any
 environment wherever it's at. It will find its prey.
 Whether you're walking through nature, taking a shortcut
 through the woods, or walking up a flight of stairs
 late at night in an apartment complex.
 These creatures for millennia
 have hunted and consumed human flesh.
 It will hide. It will hunt.
 It will kill. It will
 never be caught. And no one could even consider
 it may be a beast from beyond explanation. A creature
 from stories of old that is still hunting humans
 to this very day.
