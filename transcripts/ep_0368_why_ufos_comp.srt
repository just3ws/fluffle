1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 A bizarre conspiracy, involving the Star Wars trilogy.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
 Are there really two Luke Skywalker's?

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,800
 And then the question about UFOs, what are they, where do they come from?

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,000
 Has puzzled people for decades.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,600
 However, a recently declassified document from Britain may have all the answers we need.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:38,600
 [Music]

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
 I'm your host Jason Carvener. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
 Let's talk about two Luke's.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
 I love this conspiracy theory.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,600
 I heard about this conspiracy theory a long time ago.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,600
 And you know, it just kind of gets lost in the maze of my mind to hear about it.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
 I thought it was hilarious.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:07,600
 And then recently I got a notification and email on Twitter from @DruthersCA.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
 And Druthers goes, thank you for the recommendation.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,600
 Druthers goes, have you ever heard of Bigger Luke?

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 And I was like, yes, yes I have.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 A long time ago, he was a good friend.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 Let's explore the world of Bigger Luke.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
 Let's hop on, but you know what? We don't have a space vehicle.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
 Let me think here for a second.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,600
 I'd say Jason Jumper, like jumps in at light speed or high-speed.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,600
 That actually sounds like something a baby would be in.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 Tell you what, you guys come up with a space vehicle for us.

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
 Whoever has the best suggestion, I'll talk about it.

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
 I'll announce it. It'll be totally awesome.

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
 But for now, we're going to break into a US facility.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
 We're going to steal their space shuttle.

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
 Come on, go, go. I'll cover you.

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
 I'm shooting blinks because they are US servicemen.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,600
 They're like, ow, ow. I won't kill you, but I will stop you.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
 And then I accidentally hit one in the head and he's not moving.

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
 He's all bloody. You're like, Jason, you killed him.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
 I'm like, no, I didn't. No, I didn't.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 We go, we get in the space shuttle fly away.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
 Oh, great. Great start to an episode.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 You guys are like, getting ready to hold trial for trees.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,600
 And I'm like, no, before we have my trial, we have to go to Tatooine.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:28,600
 Space shuttle goes to hyperspace and we're now in a galaxy far, far away.

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 I wonder what the official name of the Star Wars galaxy is.

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 I'm sure some nerd knows it is. It's Titanine or something.

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
 There has to be a name for it, like Clydos or something.

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
 But anyways, it doesn't matter.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,600
 Nerds, email me on that too, the name of the Star Wars galaxy.

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,600
 We're now flying over Tatooine.

48
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
 So we're on Tatooine and we're checking out the scene.

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 This theory came about because, you know, there was a time when you would go see a movie,

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
 the movie theater and go, whoa, that was awesome.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 And then you might buy a ticket to go see it again.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
 But once it was out of the theater, you never saw it again.

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
 The movie was gone.

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,600
 But when VCRs came out and then Star Wars was released on VHS in '82,

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 you have the ability to watch the movie over and over and over and over again.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 And some people, shocker, sit down for this news, were obsessed with the movie.

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
 I know, I didn't know that until I started researching this story.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,600
 And so people began watching these movies over and over again.

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
 And they're looking for every detail.

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
 It's funny, I was thinking about doing this.

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
 I saw a movie the other night called Identity Theft of a Cheerleader.

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
 And it was actually, it was compelling enough that I told my little brother about it.

63
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
 You could tell that everyone, it was for a lifetime channel, movie of the week,

64
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,600
 everyone in the movie, behind the scenes and in front of the camera, gave 110%.

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
 But it just had a terrible, it had a really low budget.

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
 And it had that really flat lighting that all like, lifetime channel movies have.

67
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
 But I, I, it was very, it was funny because it was a really, really good movie.

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,600
 It was like watching a marathon runner run with 80 pounds strapped to his back.

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 Because you could tell everyone was really, really trying, but it was just hobbled by the format.

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 And I was thinking, I think I might watch that movie just as a thought experiment.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
 Watch it 30 nights in a row.

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
 And see what I pick up on it.

73
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 Because it's interesting enough and the lead actress, she, it's this 30 year old woman

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
 who pretends to be a cheerleader.

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
 And I think I did a story on that actually.

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
 That's how I found out about this movie.

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
 I did a story about that.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
 And this movie is based on a true story, but in this movie, she's like hitting,

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
 she's killing people with a frying pan as well.

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
 But he had a really hot actress and everything like that.

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,600
 If I watch this movie for 30 days in a row, I think I would have a bigger cheerleader.

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
 I definitely would have some bigger cheerleader, interesting dreams, but it doesn't matter.

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
 It doesn't matter.

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
 Okay, let's get back to the topic.

85
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
 People were watching the movie over and over and over again.

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
 And they started to notice something.

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,600
 In some scenes, Luke is a couple inches taller than he is in other scenes.

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 Not extremely giant, but just oddly tall.

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,600
 And they begin to talk to each other and they go, we know how tall Harrison Ford is normally.

90
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,600
 And then there are some scenes where Luke is standing next to Harrison Ford.

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 He's always shorter than Harrison Ford.

92
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,600
 But sometimes he's a little more shorter than he is in other scenes.

93
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,600
 Now, you figure, maybe he's standing on something different, maybe he's leaning in a different way.

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,600
 But they're able to, this group of people, and again, back then you'd have to like write letters to each other.

95
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
 There was no internet.

96
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,600
 You'd meet people that you knew in the area or you would start writing each other because you were part of some sci-fi club through correspondence.

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:45,600
 People started to say, hey, listen, Luke changes sizes, not every other scene, but it's consistent enough that I think there's two Luke's.

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,600
 Now, some people, and this is where people broke into two different camps.

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:59,600
 Some people say what it is that, yes, there are, he is at different sizes, but sometimes it's a stand-in actor.

100
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
 It's a different actor coming in.

101
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,600
 And the other group says, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we believe there's actually two Luke skywalkers.

102
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,600
 There is a short Luke and a tall Luke.

103
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,600
 And sometimes the short Luke will walk around a corner and then the big Luke comes back.

104
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 So there's actually two Luke skywalkers in the Skywalker movie.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:29,600
 And you're thinking, Jason, that's stupid, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, hold on, hold on, hold on.

106
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,600
 So Luke is on the Millennium Falcon and he's holding a lightsaber.

107
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
 There's a little droid flying.

108
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
 I know some of you guys know exactly where this is going.

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
 This little droid's flying around.

110
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
 Shoot lasers.

111
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
 He's blocking them.

112
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:53,600
 And that's his first time really using the force because he's blindfolded and he puts the lightsaber away and Obi-Wan turns to him and says,

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,600
 you've taken your first step into a larger world.

114
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
 Hmm? Hmm?

115
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:09,600
 He says that when Luke Skywalker first meets Princess Leia, him and Han Solo are addressed as stormtroopers and you guys all know this line.

116
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
 She's laying there in that sexy Princess Leia pose.

117
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 Doors.

118
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
 Comes up.

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,600
 We see two stormtroopers standing there and Leia says, aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?

120
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
 You're like, Jason, come on.

121
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
 Seriously.

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
 Okay, here's the thing.

123
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 Here's the thing.

124
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,600
 The bigger, the bigger, the bigger Luke theory I love so much.

125
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,600
 And to be honest, I don't know if it, they say that it started in 1985.

126
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,600
 I think it's a LARP, I think, which is a live action role playing thing.

127
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,600
 I think it's, I don't know if it really started back in 1985.

128
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:50,600
 It could be a parody of conspiracy theories and people who are obsessed with film because we obviously can't go back and prove that.

129
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:57,600
 And people have talked about maybe this was spread on like AOL chat rooms and Yahoo chat rooms back in the day and all the evidence has been destroyed.

130
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
 And that's when you're getting into weirdo conspiracy beliefs.

131
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:12,600
 I mean, this is weird enough, but whenever you say, oh no, it's totally true, but all the documentation up until this very moment was destroyed, you're really kind of losing me there.

132
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
 But that's not all.

133
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
 That's not all, okay?

134
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,600
 So apparently, I love this so much because you're never going to be able to watch this scene again the same way.

135
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:30,600
 There's a scene on Impressions Back where Lando, who is considered like he's a professional gambler, so he has an eye for things, right?

136
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
 He can really see the details.

137
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
 He can look for the little things, tell someone's bluffing.

138
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 He's walking by and he sees Luke come around the corner and start shooting.

139
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 And Lando doesn't really even react to this because he knows everything's going to hell.

140
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
 Darth Vader's not holding up his side of the bargain.

141
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
 Luke's coming here to rescue his friends.

142
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
 He just kind of looks at Luke.

143
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
 Doesn't really react.

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 But the next time we see Lando look at Luke, Luke's still running around shooting people.

145
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
 Lando has this expression.

146
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,600
 He looks over at Luke and then he kind of goes, hmm?

147
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,600
 Now, even though Luke is doing the exact same thing he was doing just a minute ago, i.e. shooting stormtroopers,

148
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,600
 the second time he sees him, the expression on his face is like, hmm, something's different about him, and then he just walks away.

149
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 So bigger Luke theorists believe that that's what he's responding to.

150
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
 He realizes this guy's a few inches tall and he's like, hmm, interesting.

151
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
 So here we go.

152
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
 Why are there two Luke's?

153
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 Why are there two Luke's?

154
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
 So, of course, you have to have theories.

155
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 One of them is that Luke is creating a force projection.

156
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
 Now, this theory does predate the last Jedi.

157
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 I don't know if it goes all the way back to 1985, but it definitely predates the last Jedi, because I remember reading about it years ago.

158
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
 So it's at least 10 years old, if not more.

159
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,600
 And anyways, the idea is that Luke Skywalker, when Princess Leia says,

160
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:04,600
 "Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper that hurt his feelings?" so he created a holographic version of himself that's bigger, to be in additional scenes.

161
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 That is an okay conspiracy theory, but I love this one even more.

162
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,600
 So R2-D2 learned how to clone throughout the prequels, because he's hanging out on Kamino, he's going on all these adventures,

163
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 especially on the Clone Wars, he's going on seven seasons of adventures.

164
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 He learns how to clone.

165
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,600
 And he's the only guy who remembers really everything from the beginning to the events of Star Wars.

166
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 So he has a cloning facility on Tatooine, and that's why when the ship crashes, or the escape pod crashes,

167
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,600
 R2-D2 goes in one direction, C-3PO goes in the other direction, R2-D2 is like, "No, I gotta go this way. I'm headed to my cloning center."

168
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
 And at that cloning center, he has cloned Bigger Luke.

169
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,600
 What Bigger Luke is, it's if things get really rough, Bigger Luke can show up and kind of fight more?

170
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,600
 And that way if Luke dies, then the clone will just take over.

171
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,600
 And so whenever one of the Luke's is getting in too much trouble, they're instantly teleported back to the cloning facility,

172
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
 and then it's instantaneous too.

173
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 So you'll never know, no one will ever turn around the corner and see it happening.

174
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,600
 Bigger Luke appears, and you go, "That's stupid, Jason." They don't have teleportation in Star Wars.

175
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 They don't ever do, "Up, up." In A New Hope, Luke, they're talking about getting off the planet Tatooine,

176
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,600
 Luke says, "Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock."

177
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 So teleportation does exist in the Star Wars universe.

178
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
 R2-D2 has the key to it.

179
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
 And you go, "Jason, that is genius." Now I didn't come up with that, but that is genius.

180
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,600
 R2-D2 is the key to all of this stuff.

181
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,600
 But it's just people are grabbing a couple lines or thinking this stuff about R2 and all this stuff.

182
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
 Last Jedi promo shot.

183
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 There's a picture of Luke Skywalker standing next to R2-D2.

184
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
 Mark Hamill himself tweets this.

185
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
 There's a picture of him back in 1977 standing next to R2-D2.

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 R2-D2 comes up to his belly button.

187
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,600
 Then the picture of him for the last Jedi promo shot, R2-D2 only comes up to his waist.

188
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 And he tweets, "Have I been growing taller over the years, or has R2-D2 just been shrinking?

189
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,600
 You decide. #largerluketheory."

190
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 Is there really two Luke's?

191
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,600
 Did he actually acknowledge the existence of two Luke's Skywalker?

192
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 He also said that he hated Rian Johnson's take on...

193
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 This has nothing to do with the conspiracy theory. I don't think it's funny.

194
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,600
 He hated Rian Johnson's take on Luke Skywalker in the last Jedi.

195
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
 And so he just called him Jake Skywalker.

196
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
 He played him as a totally different character.

197
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,600
 So now there's even a theory that after the Battle of Indoor, Luke went somewhere and his clone became Jake Skywalker.

198
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 So is there any...

199
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,600
 He eventually apologized for those comments, but is there any truth to the fact that there were two Luke Skywalker?

200
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 So you may have hated the sequel trilogy, but no. That somewhere out there...

201
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,600
 The smaller Luke, the Luke that we really know and love, is out in the galaxy.

202
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,600
 The man who died on the rock because he made his hologram appear in front of his nephew or whatever,

203
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
 who fell off the rock and disappeared.

204
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,600
 He's dead. That was Jake Skywalker.

205
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 Luke Skywalker. The real Skywalker is still out there walking through the sky.

206
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 I love that conspiracy theory though, but that took an awful lot of time.

207
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 So let's return to Earth. We're leaving by Tatooine.

208
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 We see Luke Skywalker. We're like, "Bye, Luke!"

209
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 And he's waving to us and then we see another Luke in the shadows waving at us.

210
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 We're like, "Oh, there is some truth to it."

211
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
 We're back on Earth now.

212
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,600
 We just landed in a shuttle in a parking lot.

213
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
 We're in Britain. We're headed to Britain.

214
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
 This was a really interesting story that I kind of just dumbled across.

215
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,600
 It was on an article from the Washington Examiner.

216
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 It was called, "The Real Reason the U.S. Government is So Secretive About UFOs."

217
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 And it basically boiled down to this.

218
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,600
 We don't know what they are, so we're trying to figure that out.

219
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
 And we don't want to reveal what we already know to the public,

220
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 because whatever this is could be weaponized.

221
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 So we know a little bit more than the public does about this stuff.

222
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 So if we release what we know, then China and Russia are like,

223
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 "Oh, we didn't have those additional pieces of the puzzle."

224
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
 So they're holding on to their pieces of the puzzle,

225
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,600
 and we're holding on to our pieces of the puzzle, and nobody wants to share.

226
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
 And I'm reading this article, I go, "That makes sense. That makes sense."

227
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,600
 I think, and let me start off by saying this, at this point,

228
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 we kind of have to start really making some determinations over what UFOs really are.

229
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:53,600
 From the 1950s to the 1980s, maybe 90s, you could say, "It's space aliens."

230
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,600
 Like, these are crafts from another planet. They're carrying these space aliens and stuff like that.

231
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,600
 But after 50, 60 years, and we don't have any definitive proof,

232
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:11,600
 it's really moving into Bigfoot territory, where really, like, we'll find a footprint,

233
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,600
 like, "Here's Melted Glass," where I saw a spaceship.

234
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 Well, that's an interesting, actually, example.

235
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
 That's the same thing as a Bigfoot footprint at this point.

236
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,600
 Now, UFOs have the added storytelling advantage.

237
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
 I'm not using storytelling facetiously, but it's a storytelling advantage

238
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
 if you have people interacting with the occupants of the UFOs.

239
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,600
 But those are very re-- When we look at UFO stories overall,

240
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
 I avoid those at this point, because they're so commonplace.

241
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,600
 As far as, like, the average, like, looking up in the sky and seeing the bright lights

242
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,600
 and seeing the giant objects in the sky is the equivalent of--

243
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 I saw-- I was walking down a hallway and I saw a shadow at the end of the hallway.

244
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,600
 It's creepy, and it's interesting, but it's-- there's more interesting stuff,

245
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
 especially to talk about on a podcast.

246
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
 That would get super old if I just kept telling you about lights in the sky.

247
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 But at a certain point, from 1945 till now, we have no definitive proof whatsoever

248
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 about what UFOs are any more than we have definitive proof about Bigfoot or even ghosts.

249
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
 I think ghosts are more of a personal, paranormal thing,

250
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,600
 and I think those are far easier to-- I don't want to say dispute, but to explain.

251
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 Even all the ghost stories and demonic stories that I've told,

252
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
 I think probably have a rational explanation that I haven't figured out yet.

253
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 Now, going back to the story, I find this story absolutely fascinating.

254
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
 I'm reading this Washington Examiner article.

255
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,600
 I'm like, "Ah, it's fairly interesting, but is it worth really talking about on the show?"

256
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
 Then they have a link to a document, a document created by the British government.

257
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
 Oh, and I want to give a shout out to the author of the article, Tom Rogan,

258
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 because it really set me on the path and gave me a framework for doing this story.

259
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,600
 I don't want to plagiarize, but I'm going to be quoting quite a lot of stuff and his sources and stuff on this.

260
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,600
 The military-- you know, we did an episode on this a while back where Trump was like,

261
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,600
 "I don't believe in aliens." That was a huge moment for the UFO community.

262
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 It really was, and I know people kind of brushed it off, but to have the president of the United States actively go,

263
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,600
 "Yeah, they've talked to me about it, but I really don't believe in it." That was massive.

264
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 That would be the equivalent of the Pope going, "Yeah, I don't believe in ghosts."

265
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 Like, yeah, angels and demons, but I think when you die, you're in heaven and hell. Ghosts don't exist.

266
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,600
 It would be-- especially Catholics who are into the paranormal would be like,

267
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
 "Oh, that sucks. I kind of have to listen to this dude."

268
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,600
 Trump's not the Pope of UFOs, but you know what I mean?

269
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
 Because that's always been the conspiracy theory.

270
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 Oh, you know, the president goes and he knows he's met with aliens shaking Grey's hands.

271
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
 Trump's like, "Nah, it didn't happen." Now, you can say Trump was lying, he was covering it up,

272
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,600
 but we have to make certain allowances for this stuff.

273
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,600
 So for Trump to even-- I think if-- I don't want to get too much into that side,

274
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,600
 but there was a big moment and a lot of people just kind of buried it, but he's like, "Yeah, I don't believe it."

275
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,600
 So the military, for the most part, just thinks it's something weird that's going on out there.

276
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,600
 They don't actually think that it's alien. Alien craft. It's something.

277
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,600
 So all of that being said, Britain did this big-- every country's done a study on this.

278
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,600
 India's had to look into it. Iran definitely had to look into it. We did an episode about their nuclear power plants and UFOs flying around.

279
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,600
 So any country that has any sort of budget whatsoever is going to look into this stuff.

280
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,600
 Now, Britain looks into this and they wrote up a report and they classified it, as you would with this type of thing.

281
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,600
 But eventually, their report gets declassified and it is fascinating.

282
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,600
 The link is in the show notes. It's actually quite a short report.

283
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:53,600
 It's called the Unidentified Aerial-- that's generally how the United States and Britain will call them.

284
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 They don't call them UFOs. They call them Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon, which is quite different.

285
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,600
 Quite different. It sounds like the same terminology, but what we're going to get into, there's a difference between an object and phenomenon.

286
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 The kite is an object. A phenomenon is some sort of weather event.

287
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,600
 So I'm going to read some quotes from this investigation, from this paper, because it's really fascinating the way they're looking at this stuff.

288
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
 Here's the first quote, talking about foreign governments. Russia and China specifically.

289
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:28,600
 "Russia, former Soviet republics and Chinese authorities have made a coordinated effort to understand the UAP topic.

290
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:35,600
 Several aircraft have been destroyed and at least four pilots have been killed chasing UFOs.

291
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 The importance of the topic has resulted in appointment of astronauts and senior pilots, as well as senior scientists to carry out investigations."

292
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:54,600
 "Russian investigators have measured or at least detected fields, which are reported to have caused human effects when they are located close to the phenomenon."

293
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 The first part is interesting because we have this confirmation that-- and I don't think it surprises anyone that occasionally a pilot dies chasing these unidentified objects,

294
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:13,600
 whether it is collisions or they're simply pushing their engine too hard or whatever, but they're saying that because people have died and because jets have been destroyed,

295
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 that other countries take this as seriously as the West does.

296
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 Now, the second part is what we were talking about. Russia has detected these fields around this phenomenon.

297
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 So as they're flying up on this object, they're able to measure something. Something's coming off of these things.

298
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:41,600
 Now, what is this something? This paper actually thinks that it has the answer for what UFOs are, what the objects on the sky, the bright lights are.

299
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,600
 But we're going to get there in a second. So what they're looking at is where do we tend to see UFOs?

300
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 Where do you tend to see UFOs? What they're picking up on is they go military bases, nuclear power plants, and you're like, "Oh, that's inter-- like, is it because they're monitoring our bases?"

301
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:08,600
 And stuff like that. They go, "Hey, let us finish. Let us finish, dude." Nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, battle fleets out in the ocean, still military.

302
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 Cars in the middle of nowhere, planes 20,000 feet or higher in the air.

303
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 So how do you get the car in the middle of nowhere versus the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean?

304
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:36,600
 Britain thinks that the phenomenon is some sort of plasma charge that is created in the atmosphere around isolated electronic events.

305
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:47,600
 Basically, that's why we see them in the areas we see them, the lone car driving in the middle. That's why you don't see, for the most part, UFOs in downtown Chicago.

306
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:59,600
 But when you have a car driving through the middle of Kentucky at night, the glowing object following the car or appearing off in the distance, whether it's small or big, it's some sort of plasma charge.

307
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,600
 It's not from another dimension. It's not a spacecraft. There's no one on it. It's simply there.

308
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:14,600
 They said the black triangle, which is very common. It has the lights on the end. It's like a triangle, and there's a light on each corner of the triangle.

309
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:23,600
 They say that is a very common...the plasma charge can actually block out light in the middle and make lights appear around it.

310
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:33,600
 So it looks like a massive object, but what you're really seeing is basically three plasma balls that are distorting everything else around it.

311
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
 Can these things be interacted with?

312
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:59,600
 They said when we were looking at it, during their investigation, they said they found 100 unexplained Royal Air Force, which is the British Air Force's Royal Air Force, 100 unexplained Royal Air Force fatal accident reports, 100 planes that crashed, not passenger jets, but like fighter jets and transport planes and stuff like that, that crashed and they have no known reason why.

313
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:15,600
 They said these accidents don't seem like they hit something physical. Maybe, maybe they hit a bird and we detected, maybe it was something so small we didn't detect it, but they go, it could have been flying and it hit plasma.

314
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 It hit this electrical charge in the middle of the sky and the plane goes down and no one can radio for it, no one can report it. The plane crashes completely unexplained.

315
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:38,600
 Now those 100 accidents were over the course of decades, so it wasn't like within the course of a year or anything like that, but just looking back, they had all these unexplained accidents, 100 of them, and they go, maybe it's this phenomenon.

316
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:45,600
 And that would explain too why fighter jets in other countries have been knocked out of the sky by these things as well.

317
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,600
 It'd also be why you can't catch up to them, because it's an electrical phenomenon and you're creating it.

318
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 The UFO doesn't exist unless the plane is in the sky or the aircraft carrier is on the ground.

319
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:10,600
 And going to the whole thing about the Tic Tac UFO flying around that Nimitz battle fleet back in, I think it was 2016, may have been even farther back, and that's just when the story came out.

320
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:26,600
 Imagine the pure electrical field around that battle group. That group had the greatest sensor net ever to exist on the planet. That was, the entire point of that exercise was to test out how that fleet worked together.

321
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:34,600
 And we have never, never in the history of the planet Earth have there been that many tools and high tech things to observe.

322
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 It created a perfect bubble around the fleet. They knew everything that was going on.

323
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,600
 So that's why the theory was that the Tic Tac was either a black ops from the United States or from another government.

324
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 They wanted to see if the object they built could beat the greatest eye ever invented by the human race.

325
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 Or all of that electricity created this phenomenon.

326
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:07,600
 So Russia says that they can measure some sort of field around these plasma objects, right?

327
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:16,600
 And let me go a little bit more into the plasma thing here too to give you a little more idea of this isn't just some magical new electricity they've made up. Let me read you this quote.

328
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:28,600
 The researchers note that plasmas may be formed by more than one set of weather and electrically charged conditions. And then it goes on to say could also be a meteor that's coming into the atmosphere and doesn't burn up completely.

329
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,600
 But basically shoots off this electrical burst and then it continues here.

330
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 These plasma formations are also theorized to have the effect of refracting light between themselves, producing the appearance of black polygonal shape with the lights of the corners caused by self generated plasma coloration.

331
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 So that's going back to the black triangle thing.

332
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 So there has been old studies as well where the government was trying to line up.

333
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:09,600
 They're basically trying to create giant holograms on the sky using plasma. It goes back to the whole project blue beam thing which we did an episode on and they wanted a way to add voices to it so you can make a religious figure appear over a battlefield.

334
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
 Tell people no, no, don't do that. Don't do that.

335
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,600
 The very least freak them out and the most you might end the battle or end the war.

336
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:29,600
 So we've been working with plasma, I'm sure other governments have as well, to direct it as a hologram in the sky and what the British paper is saying is that nature is already doing that for us.

337
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,600
 It's just random. And this is where I was going before I interrupted myself with the Russian effect.

338
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 The Russian was detecting the field around these plasma charges. Here's a continuing of this quote.

339
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,600
 And this is fascinating. They've been able to study this on the ground.

340
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:51,600
 "Local fields of this type" and this is a plasma field and they said they don't know if it's electric, electromagnetic field.

341
00:26:51,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 They said it could be some sort of other unknown type of energy that these plasma charges give off but what we've been able to conclude on Earth experimenting with plasma.

342
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:10,600
 Back to the quote here. "Local fields of this type have been medically proven to cause responses in the temporal lobes of the human brain.

343
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:18,600
 These results in the observer sustaining his or her own vivid but mainly incorrect description of what is experienced.

344
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:30,600
 This is suggested to be a key factor in influencing the more extreme reports found in the media and are clearly believed by the quote unquote victims."

345
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
 What if this is true?

346
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,600
 This could be the biggest discovery. When was this article written?

347
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,600
 So the article Tom Rogan wrote just came out in December 2019.

348
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:57,600
 But the paper that he's talking about came out in 2006. This is possibly the end of all UFOology and possibly even paranormal activity.

349
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,600
 A plasma field is generated and it messes with your head and gives you false memories.

350
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,600
 It would be the greatest weapon of war.

351
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,600
 You don't bleed, no bones are breaking, no one dies but you can change their mind.

352
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,600
 They actually believe stuff that didn't happen.

353
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,600
 Kids playing soccer in Russia see a bunch of robots land in the middle of the park.

354
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
 Hallucination.

355
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:36,600
 Betty and Barney Hill driving down the road and a bright light appears above them and they have this wild tale to tell about being up on a spaceship.

356
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 Hallucination.

357
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:52,600
 A group of paranormal investigators walking in with their electrical equipment or maybe just some flashlights in an abandoned insane asylum and it's electrically charged.

358
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,600
 And plasma is formed and hallucination set it.

359
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,600
 Now to be fair, generally plasma charges don't form that low to the ground.

360
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,600
 So wouldn't it be like you're on the second floor of an insane asylum and on the third floor there's a glowing ball.

361
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:18,600
 But I mean, if there is a phenomenon that is created by man because they're using electricity, they're unleashing this force of nature,

362
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 they're basically, they're the humanity using technology is the flint to ignite something that's already possibly there.

363
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,600
 It explains so much why the UFO phenomenon really took off after we started dropping nukes.

364
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,600
 It wasn't because aliens saw the nukes and wanted to come down and help us out or they were worried about us.

365
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,600
 It's that the sky is more charged now than it ever was.

366
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,600
 All that carbon dating stuff doesn't work after 1945.

367
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
 Because everything is irradiated.

368
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:56,600
 If you want to have metal to build Geiger counters like you have to dig up boats from World War One when Germany scuttled their navy.

369
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
 Because everything else is completely irradiated.

370
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
 Everything's charged.

371
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
 Makes so much sense.

372
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 It makes sense why people see UFOs in the middle of nowhere.

373
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:13,600
 It's because there, there's nothing there and they're charging the area not with any sort of spiritual energy,

374
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,600
 but with actual energy and it's interacting, it's an atmospheric phenomenon that's messing with people's head.

375
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
 This is a game changer.

376
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 If this is true, this is a game changer because it not only explains,

377
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 not only explains UFOs, it explains everything, explains ghosts and Bigfoot and cryptids and all of that stuff.

378
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,600
 Does Bigfoot rustle around in the woods unless there's a human there to observe it?

379
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
 Now you could go back, let's play Devil's Advocate,

380
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:47,600
 the natives who were here and you can go back and there's cryptid stories way, way back, you know, hundreds of years and stuff like that.

381
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,600
 The natives here who had stories of the Yeti and Bigfoot and things like that.

382
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
 They weren't carrying around Walkmans.

383
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
 They didn't have palm pilots on them.

384
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,600
 So, yes, that's true.

385
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,600
 But, also, when you look back at native populations, they weren't talking a lot about UFOs.

386
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,600
 Oh, you can show me some Egyptian hieroglyphic with the helicopter on it, that all that stuff's been debunked.

387
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:19,600
 I know Ancient Aliens is a big show, but I think on my fifth episode, I had a link to a documentary called Ancient Aliens Debunked.

388
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
 It's like six hours long.

389
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
 I recommend all of you guys to watch it.

390
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,600
 It really, really just takes the wind out of all of those theories.

391
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,600
 The Nazca lines explains super in detail, explains all of that stuff.

392
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,600
 The UFO phenomenon, and I recently did an episode on airships, but again, that was kind of like a lot of people think that was yellow journalism.

393
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
 A lot of people think that was newspapers just making up stories, because that's what they did back then.

394
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,600
 That's what they do now.

395
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,600
 So, does this end?

396
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
 Is this the answer to all paranormal questions?

397
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,600
 I don't know.

398
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
 I don't know.

399
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,600
 It may be, they may be onto something, they may be wrong.

400
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,600
 This might be able to explain some UFO encounters and not all of them.

401
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
 It may be able to explain everything.

402
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
 We don't know.

403
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,600
 But the idea of false memories being put in your head is always a scary one.

404
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,600
 The one thing we can cling onto is the reality we've constructed.

405
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,600
 And so, if it can be intruded upon by a natural phenomenon at any point in time,

406
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,600
 what can you believe?

407
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,600
 Maybe it's not the truth is out there when we're looking for aliens.

408
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:44,600
 Maybe the truth is in here, in us, our own brains.

409
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:51,600
 The truth is realizing that this is all a plasma-charged illusion.

410
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,600
 You are the only person who's really there.

411
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:05,600
 This voice, this podcast, it's just an echo that you've created in your own mind.

412
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,600
 And if that is a case, you have a duty to keep on living.

413
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:22,600
 Because once you die, the hallucination is over and the rest of us disappear into nothingness.

414
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,600
 Save us. You're our only hope.
