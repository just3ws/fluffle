1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 Is there any truth to the conspiracy theory that child protective services is not a government

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,840
 organization to protect children?

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,240
 It's actually a front for the shadow people.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,240
 Guess who came up with that theory?

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,760
 And then it's prom night.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,000
 And while at first glance it may look like a standard ghost story, this one may finally

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,280
 answer the question, when you die, do you get to choose where you hunt?

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,720
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,680
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away first off

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,280
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command as one of our Christmas livestream contributors.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,440
 Everyone put on your protective gear because in flies be.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,240
 Woohoo yeah come on, come on be fly.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,680
 It's a Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,280
 Be you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or support the show financially, I totally understand.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,240
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,120
 That's another way you can help the show grow.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,240
 And then let's go ahead and take a look at today's Fan Art Friday submission.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,640
 This is from Micah, Patreon supporter Micah.

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,640
 This image is actually from the original Discord that we had years ago when we shut

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,120
 down because people spammed it with Diary-a-Porn.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,720
 So I talk about that in another episode.

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,120
 I don't remember what episode it was.

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,320
 I think it was like a classics episode.

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,280
 But anyways, if you're like, "Well I want to hear about that story."

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,640
 I'll put it in the show notes.

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,160
 But that was the old.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,800
 Micah wasn't behind that.

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,520
 Micah was like, "What did I get wrangled into that one?"

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,920
 That's why we shut down the old Discord.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,200
 We have a new Discord for Patreon members.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,280
 But anyways, let's spend less time talking about Diary-a-Porn and more time admiring this

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
 awesome artwork.

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
 I love it.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
 I love it so much.

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
 So thank you very much Micah.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,120
 Bee, I'm going to go ahead and toss you a little captain's hat.

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,560
 Let's all hop on board the bunny battleship.

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,880
 We haven't used this one a long time.

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,400
 It might actually be new.

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,240
 It might be a new vehicle.

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,200
 We go ahead and pull this battleship out of Dead Rabbit Command.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,240
 We're going to sail all the way out to a bad neighborhood.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,560
 We've never done a buddy battleship.

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,040
 I was like, "What noise is that?

51
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,840
 What noise does a battleship make?"

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,640
 Blowing stuff up.

53
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,920
 We're headed out to a bad neighborhood.

54
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,720
 We've made it exceedingly worse.

55
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,320
 Methanphetamine use and the shadow people.

56
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,440
 There's such a close relationship between these two.

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,760
 Methpsychosis, they say, actually isn't.

58
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,760
 What do I say they say in the meth head?

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 Say this.

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
 No one else does.

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,240
 But someone who's an aficionado of methamphetamine, they'll go, "Methpsychosis, it actually allows

62
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,560
 you to see through the dimensions."

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,280
 It's not that we've stayed up for three days straight.

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,000
 It's not that we have formaldehyde pumping through our veins.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's a superpower.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
 It's a superpower.

67
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,160
 People actually fight these five cops at once.

68
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,000
 You can see the true reality.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,120
 You can see through reality when you're on methamphetamines.

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,200
 Now, I'm not saying that as a fact.

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
 I'm not saying that as a scientific fact at all.

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,720
 But you will be hard pressed to find a meth veteran.

73
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
 Maybe a newbie.

74
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
 Maybe a newbie.

75
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 He's like, "I don't believe in all that shadow people stuff."

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,200
 And the people around him as they're passing the pipe, they're like, "You will, young man.

77
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
 You will."

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
 You can find accounts of these stories all over.

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,680
 I remember at one point on Reddit, I was subscribed to the meth subreddit.

80
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,160
 Because I thought it was funny.

81
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
 Because I thought it was funny.

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,640
 I was always finding these great stories.

83
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,640
 But I had to unsubscribe because I'm also subscribed to all these paranormal subreddits.

84
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,880
 I lost track of who was talking about what.

85
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,600
 So many people on the meth subreddit talk about things that are just casual paranormal

86
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,280
 activity.

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,120
 Ghost and shadow people and seeing things and paranoia, conspiracy, they're out to get

88
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 you.

89
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,560
 Although in this case, they're not being gangstalked.

90
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,200
 There's actually gangs stalking them and law enforcement trying to crack down on them.

91
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,360
 Well, I came across this one.

92
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,400
 This is a standard title for something in the meth subreddit.

93
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,360
 It goes, "Meth opens a portal to another dimension inhabited by the shadow people."

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,440
 I wonder, it's funny, because I know of paranormal researchers who are like, "Dude, you really

95
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,920
 haven't researched the world around us until you start doing DMT or ayahuasca or drinking

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
 a bunch of cough syrup."

97
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,760
 We're preferably all three at once.

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,760
 I wonder how many, because part about being a paranormal researcher is you're constantly

99
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
 pushing the limits.

100
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,280
 You want to know the unknowable.

101
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,400
 You want to experience that which no man was meant to experience.

102
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,480
 I wonder how many people who started off as paranormal researchers started doing meth.

103
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,120
 Because they're like, "This is just helping with my research, honey.

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,640
 I can stay up for three days straight."

105
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,440
 You know how many articles I can read?

106
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,240
 Plus, I vacuumed the entire house and the neighbor's house.

107
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,760
 Anyways, in response to this statement, and meth opens a portal, and the person who posted

108
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,200
 that said, "I want to hear about your shadow people stories," we're going to meet someone

109
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,640
 who goes by the handle, "Inaire Nadine Raika."

110
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,920
 I'm just going to call you Nadine for short.

111
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,160
 Nadine is posting on the meth form, and here's the thing.

112
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,080
 Every show often, a meth head is right.

113
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,960
 Everybody can guess something eventually, and to be fair, they do spend a lot of time

114
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,720
 staying up, thinking about stuff.

115
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,400
 Most of the time, it's just how to fix a blender, and how to get a blender in the first

116
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,840
 place so they can fix it.

117
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,400
 They know how to improve a blender.

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
 They came up with the best blender idea ever.

119
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,760
 But every show often, I'm not going to say that people who do meth are always wrong.

120
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,680
 They're right every once in a while, just like all of us.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,600
 Nadine tells the story.

122
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,400
 Nadine goes, "Listen, it was 11.30 in the morning one day.

123
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,200
 It was a Tuesday, and I was walking through a bad part of town with a friend.

124
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,040
 Now, I wasn't familiar with this part of town.

125
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
 I'm not normally out.

126
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,400
 I'm an upstanding citizen.

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,440
 I usually go to church five days a week.

128
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:44,200
 But this particular day, I was high on meth at 11.30 in the morning on a Tuesday.

129
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,360
 I'm walking through this neighborhood with my buddy.

130
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:56,840
 And walking towards us is a little boy in a school uniform, and he's wearing a backpack.

131
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,800
 Now this kid was about five or six years old, and using meth mathematics, I was able to figure

132
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,360
 out, "Wait a second.

133
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,120
 How was a kid that young walking down the street at 11.30 a.m. on a Tuesday?

134
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,320
 This kid should be in school.

135
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,000
 He definitely has on a school uniform.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,520
 Why isn't he in school?"

137
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,560
 So Nadine looks around and she realizes there's no bus stops in the area.

138
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,120
 The processing power of Nadine, fueled by meth I am quite envious of, she sees this little

139
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,800
 boy walking down the street.

140
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
 She scans the area.

141
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,840
 There's no bus stops around, and there's definitely no school bus stops around.

142
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,960
 So how did this kid get here at 11.30 in the morning on a Tuesday with no school buses

143
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
 around?

144
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,600
 But he wasn't alone.

145
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,480
 This little boy wasn't alone.

146
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
 He was with an adult.

147
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,200
 He was with an adult man.

148
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,560
 So you may think, "Dad?

149
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
 Uncle?

150
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
 Baseball coach?

151
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
 Bus driver?

152
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
 Bus driver?

153
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
 He's looking for his bus.

154
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
 He's like, "Where did I put it, kid?

155
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,000
 You were the last one on it."

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,120
 But something else, something else sparked off in Nadine's mind that made her highly

157
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,200
 suspicious of this duo walking towards them.

158
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,480
 She said that they were not, she goes, "I'm not racist.

159
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
 Not racist."

160
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,360
 But they were not color related.

161
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:27,160
 I think that she's implying, or basically saying, "One is black and one is white."

162
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,200
 And that makes her suspicious, but she's not racist.

163
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 She's not racist.

164
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,160
 But she did find it suspicious that at 11.30 on a Tuesday morning, walking in this not

165
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,720
 very good neighborhood, is a five-year-old boy in a school uniform, but no school buses

166
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,280
 around, and an adult who is not color related to him makes her very, very suspicious.

167
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,440
 And she begins to feel like something is wrong here.

168
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,200
 So she turns to her friend.

169
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,600
 Now let's do a little interlude here.

170
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,160
 You may go, "Jason, that actually is kind of suspicious.

171
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,960
 I always look to make sure people are color related."

172
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,520
 It is suspicious that kids not forget the color related part, but the rest of it is suspicious.

173
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,960
 Even if they're both the same race, it is weird what are they doing out here?

174
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,120
 Walking through this bad neighborhood.

175
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,760
 Fine.

176
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,920
 We can have that discussion.

177
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,880
 We can come over to my house at three in the morning.

178
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,920
 We'll smoke a little bit and we'll talk about it for 18 hours.

179
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,000
 But to let us know, okay, so remember she's with her friend.

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,600
 When she turns to her friend and goes, "I think there's something suspicious about that."

181
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,080
 Her friend, who knows Nadine very well, says, "Just shut up!

182
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
 Shut up!

183
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,400
 What are you talking about, you big weirdo?"

184
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,880
 He goes, "Mind your own business.

185
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,080
 Just mind your own business."

186
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,320
 So the two groups pass each other.

187
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,680
 Nadine and her friend and the non-color related duo, they just walk past each other.

188
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:08,920
 Well, it's only about 30 seconds that Nadine has now passed this kid and this adult.

189
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,200
 And she's really freaking out.

190
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,600
 She's basically full on panic attack because she realizes that kid is probably in danger.

191
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,360
 And she says, "I wanted to chase them.

192
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,720
 I wanted to chase them.

193
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,040
 But I want to grab the kid.

194
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,520
 I want to startle them.

195
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,480
 I would just run full speed towards two strangers."

196
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,640
 But she goes, "Listen, I want to run up and grab the kid or start screaming."

197
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,320
 I would simply ask if everything was okay.

198
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,160
 I would look at the boy, look at the adult, look at the boy again to make sure that they're

199
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,520
 not the same color.

200
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,400
 And then I would say, "Is everything okay?"

201
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,640
 And if it's nothing, it's nothing.

202
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
 What if it's something?

203
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,840
 I love this quote.

204
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,080
 I love this quote that she left.

205
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,160
 You're like, "Jason, when do we get into the shadow people?"

206
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,400
 You're all waiting for a paranormal story.

207
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
 You're like, "Oh man, is he tricking us?"

208
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
 She has this quote.

209
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
 She goes, "Perse...

210
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
 This is worrying.

211
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
 Do you want to do methamphetamines?

212
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,760
 Like, I'm not an advocate of it.

213
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,120
 I've seen it destroy people.

214
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,800
 It landed my cousin in prison for murder.

215
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,000
 Not a fan of methamphetamines, but it could always be worse.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,840
 It could always be worse, right?

217
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,560
 Let me read this quote to you.

218
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,280
 "Personally, as a mother myself..."

219
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,440
 So then I'm wondering, like, so where are her kids at?

220
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,880
 Maybe her kids from a school bus going to school.

221
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,680
 It's 11.30 at Tuesday.

222
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 A mother.

223
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
 A mother.

224
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
 Anyway, think about it this way.

225
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,960
 She's using her free time to either walk around that neighborhood or post on Reddit.

226
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,480
 Both are equally horrifying.

227
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,560
 "Personally, as a mother myself, that would not bother me.

228
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,080
 As long as you don't reach for my child, pull out a weapon of any kind or come too close

229
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,160
 then someone asking if everything is okay, that would not offend me, anger me, or cause

230
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,400
 me to do anything other than let my happy-go-lucky toddler..."

231
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
 So she does...

232
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,240
 I was wondering how old this kid was.

233
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
 My life...

234
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
 She has a toddler at home.

235
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
 She's walking around this bad neighborhood.

236
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,680
 She actually goes, "Oh yeah, my toddler's strapped in my back right now."

237
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,400
 And let my happy-go-lucky toddler answer for himself, "I don't believe that for an instant.

238
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,680
 I believe that shadow people exist.

239
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,480
 I do not believe if you walked up to this woman with her toddler and you go, "Is everything

240
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,080
 okay?"

241
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,640
 She would claw your eyes out.

242
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,040
 She 100% would claw your eyes out.

243
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,760
 No parent would put up with that.

244
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
 I don't think.

245
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
 Especially if they think you...

246
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,600
 If you thought something untoward them.

247
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,240
 That's a word, right?

248
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
 Something that was bad about them.

249
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 I don't think.

250
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,880
 I was like, "Oh, thanks for asking.

251
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,840
 Yeah, no, I'm not kidnapping this kid."

252
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,440
 See, we're the same color and they're like, "Oh, okay."

253
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,560
 I think that you would...

254
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
 I think most parents would get offended.

255
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,200
 I think if the parent was a habitual meth user, they're most likely to get offended.

256
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,760
 But anyways, she says, "Listen, if someone came up to me and asked me if me and the

257
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,080
 toddler were okay, I would be totally fine with that.

258
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,080
 If they asked me where my toddler was right now, I don't have the answer for that.

259
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,200
 But I'm sure he's doing fine."

260
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
 So she decides, "That's what I'm gonna do.

261
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,880
 I'm gonna turn around and I'm gonna just ask if everything's okay."

262
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,840
 Now, remember, this whole thought process is only taking 30 seconds.

263
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,400
 And in that time, she also reinvented the envelope and discovered a new way to build

264
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,000
 a bicycle.

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 But she turns around.

266
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,800
 They're gone.

267
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,600
 The man and the kid are gone.

268
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,480
 At that point, Nadine completely panics.

269
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,840
 She realizes that something bad is gonna happen to this kid.

270
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,640
 She throws her backpack to the ground.

271
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,600
 Hopefully the toddler wasn't in there.

272
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,840
 And she takes off running.

273
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,600
 She turns around the corner.

274
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,560
 They're nowhere to be seen.

275
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:03,440
 She believes so heavily that something bad's gonna happen to this kid.

276
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,080
 She begins knocking on random doors in this neighborhood.

277
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,120
 She said she knocked on every door within a thousand foot radius.

278
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,640
 Then she says that was only three doors.

279
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,480
 So I don't know if this isn't like a rural part of the country.

280
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,560
 Thousand foot radius.

281
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,800
 She knocked on three doors.

282
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,240
 One didn't answer.

283
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,920
 One only spoke Spanish.

284
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,600
 And she goes, "I only know how to say pants, dog, and milk in Spanish."

285
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
 Which I don't know.

286
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,280
 I don't know how to say that in Spanish.

287
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,360
 She has a leg up on me.

288
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,800
 At what point in her meth-infused life did she go, "Okay, at some point, some Spanish

289
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,240
 guy may ask me about milk."

290
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
 Leche.

291
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,280
 Actually, I do know that word, leche.

292
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,640
 Anyways, she said she also knew a sales pitch that she had practiced in Spanish.

293
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
 Again, why?

294
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
 We don't know.

295
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
 We don't know.

296
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,840
 We don't know any of these details.

297
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:03,280
 Finally, when she knocks on the third door, a woman and a child open the door.

298
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,480
 And Nadine starts going, "Hey, have you guys seen anyone in this neighborhood?

299
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
 An adult and a little kid?

300
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
 Their colors don't match.

301
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
 Their colors don't match."

302
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
 And then, where's another door?

303
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,680
 It's like, I don't know anyone in this neighborhood that matches that description.

304
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,320
 There's no other kids on the block.

305
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,840
 And then I can only assume the woman quickly shut the door and bolted it.

306
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:31,720
 And the story ends with Nadine walking away and saying she was always going to hate herself.

307
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,240
 Had she not waited 30 seconds?

308
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,080
 Had she reacted the way that she should have originally running around the neighborhood

309
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,120
 yelling at people who don't match colors?

310
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,760
 Maybe she could have spared this kid some torment.

311
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,240
 So while that might be the end of Nadine's incredibly eventful Tuesday, Tuesday mid-morning

312
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,920
 adventure, and I'm sure that she had many more crazy stories that happened just that

313
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,320
 day.

314
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,440
 Maybe does come up with two really good theories.

315
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
 Well, let me rephrase that.

316
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,680
 She comes up with one really good theory and one insane theory.

317
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,880
 Let's tackle the insane one first.

318
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,840
 Is it possible that Child Protective Services is a front organization for the shadow people?

319
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,840
 And it's pretty much what it is.

320
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:27,760
 The shadow people in meth mythology, they make you hallucinate and you hear voices and they

321
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,080
 can control your mind.

322
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,880
 That's not what a shadow man is typically known for.

323
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,080
 Minor actions with shadow men have been very observational.

324
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,880
 Like, they don't even care that you're there.

325
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,800
 I imagine it's kind of like what it must be like for a fox to notice a trail cam.

326
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,480
 You can't really comprehend it.

327
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,680
 It realizes something's there that shouldn't be.

328
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,080
 In that situation, we're the fox.

329
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,680
 When I ran into shadow people, I'll put the episodes in the show notes, but they're just

330
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,520
 so alien and so obtuse to the fact that they were even standing there.

331
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,000
 It's super fascinating.

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,800
 But in the meth world, they're more demonic.

333
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 They're evil.

334
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,120
 In my experience, they're neither good nor evil.

335
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,600
 They're just there.

336
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 They move.

337
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,640
 I mean, they're not just like, "Not just my shadow.

338
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,160
 I haven't been tricked."

339
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,120
 They're definitely something, but they are kind of standing beyond good and evil.

340
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:29,600
 Anyways, is it possible that the CPS, who I can only heartbreakingly imagine if Nadine

341
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,720
 hasn't had interactions with them before, it's coming, right?

342
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,200
 That would make sense.

343
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,120
 You would see Child Protective Services as this faceless organization trying to steal

344
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
 your kids.

345
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,440
 You're a good mom.

346
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,080
 That's what they're telling themselves.

347
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,840
 You're doing your best, and then this faceless organization comes in.

348
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,040
 Is it actually run by the shadow people?

349
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:55,880
 Is this a group that while the people may appear human, when they take the kid, it's

350
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,880
 delivered to a darker supervisor?

351
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,280
 No, not because they're not color related.

352
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,600
 I didn't mean like that.

353
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,960
 I meant like a demonic force, a shadow man.

354
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
 That's Poppycock.

355
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
 It's a great story idea.

356
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,800
 I do love it from that angle.

357
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,840
 But I don't believe that I will officially go on record.

358
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,200
 I do not believe Child Protective Services is run by the shadow people.

359
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,680
 She did have a super interesting theory though, which I love.

360
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,040
 This one really kind of messes with your head.

361
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:40,680
 She wonders if other people see her as a shadow person.

362
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
 That's weird.

363
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,240
 I don't think I've heard that before.

364
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,400
 I've heard stories or theories that shadow people are an alternate reality kind of laid

365
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,840
 over on top of ours, and there are certain times, there are certain places or certain

366
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,400
 mind states we can actually perceive through that wall.

367
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
 You know what?

368
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
 I didn't think about this.

369
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,140
 I did not think about this until I started saying it out loud.

370
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:12,280
 That could be why the normal shadow man experience is more like mine, where they're just there.

371
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,920
 Sometimes they're a little more sneaky, where they're like hiding behind a couch, poking

372
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,560
 their head out down a hallway.

373
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,160
 Sometimes they're just walking through the house like they own it.

374
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,120
 Sometimes they're walking through the house like it doesn't exist.

375
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,200
 They're just walking through the walls.

376
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,040
 Sometimes you wake up and they're standing at the edge of your bed.

377
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,240
 Sometimes when you look at the stories of the hat man, which is basically a shadow man

378
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,960
 with a fedora, he tends to be a little more of a menacing figure.

379
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,480
 But again, it's not like he's picking you up and throwing you out the window.

380
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,600
 It's not like you're sitting there and you're playing video games and he's unplugging your

381
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 controller.

382
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,100
 He's just scary.

383
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,640
 He has a scary presence about him.

384
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,320
 However, so that's the normal experience with shadow people.

385
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,760
 The meth head experience with shadow people is they are very diabolical.

386
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,680
 They are out to hurt you and make you hurt others.

387
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,760
 They're out there to torment you.

388
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,560
 What if I never thought of this?

389
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,880
 Really, it wasn't until I was saying all this.

390
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,920
 What if Nadine is right in the sense that when a normal person sees a shadow person,

391
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:26,520
 they are seeing a shaded reality of the reality they inhabit, which, you know, I'm not saying

392
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,640
 everyone's life is perfect by any means.

393
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,240
 No one's is.

394
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,280
 But I don't pick at my arm to try to get the spider eggs out.

395
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,120
 If you have someone who lives in a chaotic environment, their shadow people would be

396
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,880
 chaotic and evil as well.

397
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
 That's interesting.

398
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,880
 I've never thought of that before because you do have, it would be the same thing as

399
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,200
 if two people owned a fish bowl full of goldfish.

400
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,680
 But one person, the fish just kind of swam around normally.

401
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,840
 The other person's fish bowl, they were cannibals and they were eating each other, eating a

402
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
 fish.

403
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,440
 You're like, oh no, I ran out of fish food.

404
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,040
 Here, have this instead.

405
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,120
 It's the same creature.

406
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,520
 It's the same experience.

407
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:20,920
 But the experiencer is changing the observation.

408
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
 That's super weird.

409
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,240
 I hadn't thought about that before.

410
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,800
 I originally was just going to talk a little bit about how maybe people do see her as a

411
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,440
 shadow person and how you would have basically two realities sitting on top of each other.

412
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,680
 But I think that's just the tip of the iceberg.

413
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:42,960
 I think that it may be the observer changing the observed.

414
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,920
 Super interesting because again, the experience that is normal shadow people is that they

415
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
 are not making you hallucinate.

416
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,360
 They are not telling you to do evil things.

417
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,560
 But to a method, that is how they experience them.

418
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,000
 But to someone who's not on meth, they're just a weird force.

419
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Again, they're creepy.

420
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,960
 They are creepy, but they're not crawling on your ceilings and throwing up black blood

421
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,480
 and then you realize it's just a hallucination.

422
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 And your new blender that she designs is a success, but now you no longer have a left

423
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
 hand.

424
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,160
 That's not what we see in normal shadow people stories.

425
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,880
 So I'm going to actually look more into that.

426
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,880
 That'll be really interesting to see.

427
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
 I'm trying meth now.

428
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
 That's it guys.

429
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,480
 I got to go deep into this rabbit hole.

430
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,600
 I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the carbonicopter.

431
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,640
 Let's leave behind this neighborhood.

432
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,440
 Make sure that Nadine is not stolen anything out of the carbonicopter while it briefly

433
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
 lands and we load on board.

434
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,880
 Fly us all the way out to California, which actually may have been where that first story

435
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,720
 took place.

436
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,400
 Specifically we're headed to Santa Fe Springs, California.

437
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,360
 Be fly this carbonicopter over right there.

438
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
 Right there.

439
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,880
 I'm pointing at St. Paul High School off of Greenleaf Avenue, land on their roof.

440
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,440
 We're walking around.

441
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,160
 It's just a normal high school.

442
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,440
 Kids are playing basketball, squeaky shoes.

443
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
 Good shot, Jerry.

444
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
 Thanks, man.

445
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
 I've been practicing.

446
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,560
 Then we walk past the library.

447
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,800
 There's a bunch of people writing stuff down.

448
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,440
 Hey, good sense and Jerry.

449
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
 Thanks.

450
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
 I've been practicing.

451
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
 Shhh.

452
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,440
 Then we walk out to the football field and we sit on the bleachers until the sun sets.

453
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,640
 I guess we could have shown up eight hours later, but I wanted to walk around school.

454
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,280
 We're sitting on the bleachers at this football field at St. Paul High School.

455
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,360
 The sun sets, the moon rises, and we're just kind of sitting there.

456
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,480
 Then all of a sudden you hear a "Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut,

457
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
 Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut, Hut,
