1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
 We travel back to the world of video games today to take a look at two more examples of

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,660
 AI doing something it shouldn't be capable of doing.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,740
 Then we go to the Ukraine where a woman has a close encounter with the...

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,080
 Can't believe it took me so long to find this story where a woman has a close encounter of the turd, kind.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,480
 And then we travel to the Soviet Union. The year is 1983 and

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,440
 four Soviet fighter jets are scrambled to intercept an unidentified aircraft

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,920
 violating their airspace. As they jet off into the dark starry night, little do they know they're about to come face-to-face

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,700
 with a mystery today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:54,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,960
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm so old officially. It took a nap

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,200
 6 30 p.m. It took a nap woke up at 8 and was still so tired. I had to eat a chocolate bar

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
 to get enough energy to do this podcast.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,880
 That's my life now. That's my life. Can't have caffeine. I gotta eat a chocolate bar

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,560
 just so I can have excitement and speaking of excitement, guess who's walking into our

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,080
 Dead Rabbit Command Center right now one of our legacy patreon, Sean.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,880
 Sean is walking in with a pocket full of chocolate bars. Hershey bars with almonds. One of the best. It's not a much Macaulay, but

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,200
 that's what I had earlier. He's like all disappointed and like, "No, no, no, it's cool.

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,160
 I'm glad to see you. I'll eat those chocolate bars too. Just wish they were which Macaulay." Sean, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,640
 You guys can't support the patreon. I totally understand. Just helps for the word about the show. That really helps out a lot. Get the word out.

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,960
 I see you guys online talking about the show. Always makes me feel great. Sean,

21
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,120
 I'm gonna go ahead and as the sugar rush continues to move through my body, I'm gonna toss you the

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:58,600
 coal for the Carbinder Caboose. We're gonna take a little train ride, but we're getting digitized again just like Tron and Tron Legacy.

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:08,600
 Now we're driving a C++ Carbinder Caboose. It's all computer graphic. We are headed into the internet. The episode I came out with on Monday about

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:14,680
 video game AI and what was the other story? Oh, is the internet movie database a portal to another dimension?

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,520
 That episode got a really huge response, and I really appreciate it. You guys really really seem to love that episode.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,960
 Someday when we do repeat of it, I'll tell you what happened behind the scenes on that episode. But for right now,

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,400
 I'm basking in the love. You guys really love that.

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,480
 And check this out. As the Carbinder Caboose is moving through the net space, let's take a look at two stories

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,120
 I got from listeners. First off, fellow content creator on YouTube sent me this story.

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,880
 There's a game, and I've always wanted to play it, but it's a little too scary for me.

31
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,760
 I don't like super scary games. I watch scary movies and I read scary books, scary games too much.

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,040
 Alien isolation.

33
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,200
 Quick overview. There's an alien, and it's you. You're alone. So you're in isolation.

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,600
 There's other NPCs walking around, but it's like the Xenomorph from the Alien movies.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:10,200
 Coming after you. And it's really cool. It actually can hear you like apparently if you have your mic on and your baby brother knocks over a glass of milk.

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,360
 Hopefully not near your computer. Hopefully just on the floor. The alien in the game, if it's close enough, will hear that and come after you.

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,480
 So a lot of people play with their mic off, losers. But I won't even play it at all when I'm knocking them.

38
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,080
 Really ingenious. So you're trying to like fulfill these missions in this alien. The Xenomorph is walking around. It hops out of vents.

39
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,240
 We'll peek around corners. Sometimes you barely miss it. Now it's programmed to be at certain points in the game.

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,480
 So there's like certain checkpoints or choke points or things like that where the alien will show up.

41
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,520
 But for a lot of the game, you're doing things and it will be designed to just randomly move around the map.

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,960
 And then they have something called the director mode. That's not the official name, but that's the name of it in Left 4 Dead.

43
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,000
 Where if the game thinks you're breathing fine, if the game thinks that your heart rate is normal,

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,480
 the director of the game will, if the alien's too far away in the complex, it will make it go near you.

45
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:11,880
 It won't direct it specifically to you. But if it knows you're in the medic wing and the alien is stalking off in the armory,

46
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,120
 and it's been a while since she's seen the alien, the director will basically ping it and say,

47
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,680
 "Why don't you head towards the left side of the station?" So it'll give it a higher chance of you running into it.

48
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,560
 So that's cool, but that's all designed. Fellow content creator told me about this.

49
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,200
 GameRant did an article written by Andrew Dice. Yo, I wrote an article here.

50
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,040
 Most of you guys won't get that joke, but anyways.

51
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,840
 Lead designer Gary Napper for Alien Isolation has this quote in this article.

52
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,720
 Here's the quote.

53
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,400
 "It's a piece of AI and it has parameters we can tune, but the alien's network of behaviors is so insanely complicated,

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,520
 the thing is almost sentient. There's a difference between artificial intelligence,

55
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,720
 where we know what its parameters and behaviors are at a glance, and it being so sentient,

56
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,360
 we have to dig into the code just to find out why and how it did what it did during our play tests."

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:12,760
 This thing became so smart, or approaching intelligence, that the people who designed the game

58
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,960
 while they were playing it, they'd look at each other and go, "Dude, we never programmed that.

59
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,520
 How is it doing that?" And they would stop the play test, they would go in and see

60
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,040
 why it was doing that particular thing. So really, really creepy thing.

61
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,360
 They built this thing to be hyper intelligent. It's still a beast, but they built it to be

62
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,880
 the smartest beast they could, and even they were getting shocked by it. But that story is creepy,

63
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,280
 but it's designed to be a monster that's stalking. You check this out.

64
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,120
 I got a YouTube comment from AAA000. They turned me on to this story.

65
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,640
 I found this Kotaku article written by Heather Alexander about a game called Event Zero.

66
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,520
 This one's really bizarre. Apparently it's a Steam game. I guess it's mostly dialogue,

67
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,880
 and you're trying to convince this AI to do stuff. You're like, "Make me a cake." He's like,

68
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,880
 "What? I can't bake you a cake." And you just keep typing it in. You type in stuff,

69
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,440
 and that's how you're talking to this AI. You're on a space station. I guess I should

70
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,440
 have set that up. You're not in your kitchen. You're in a space station. There's three endings to

71
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,200
 the game. And throughout all of these choices that you make, there's three endings to the game.

72
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,200
 You upload your consciousness into the computer, and you destroy the engine. There's this engine

73
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,480
 there that you destroy. That's ending one. The second ending is you don't upload your consciousness,

74
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,320
 and you've been mean to the AI. Kaizen is this AI. You're mean to it throughout the game,

75
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,240
 and you choose not to upload your consciousness. Kaizen shuts itself down,

76
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,520
 and you're stuck on the space station all alone. The third ending is the player doesn't upload

77
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,240
 their consciousness to the system, to the AI system, but you were nice the whole time. In that case,

78
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,040
 the AI goes, "I'll take you back to Earth." Now, one of the things about being nice the whole time is

79
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,160
 you do what it says. At one point, it tells you to destroy this super drive, this hyper drive,

80
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,600
 or something like that. It says, "Well, you destroy this for me." That's one of the things.

81
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,360
 So, the game was programmed to have three endings. Game designer, Emmanuel Corno,

82
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,800
 was checking out his game one day on Wikipedia. The game had been released. You want to see what

83
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,720
 the fans had to say about it. Want to see what Wikipedia had to say about it. And it says on

84
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,360
 the Wikipedia page, "This game has four endings." He's like, "What?" "No, it doesn't. Doesn't at all."

85
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,960
 And they discovered something. If you're nice to it all the time, if you're nice to Kaizen,

86
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,480
 the whole game, but you don't destroy this particular engine, he's like, "Go destroy this,"

87
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,480
 and you say, "No, I'm not going to destroy it, but you're so nice to him the rest of the game,

88
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,120
 Kaizen will go, 'Yeah, okay, I'll take you home.'" They show the animation of the ship flying back home.

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:53,000
 Emmanuel Corno had this quote, quote, "This is crazy. Kaizen isn't supposed to let anyone get

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,080
 back with the singularity drive to Earth. This is how we coded the AI. I have absolutely no idea

91
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,400
 how this happens." Unquote. It wasn't programmed in the game. There's only supposed to be three

92
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,800
 endings, but they say it's a glitch. So did the AI actually create a fourth? The game created a

93
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,640
 fourth ending. Was it a glitch or did the AI, through all that human interaction, figure out an

94
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,680
 other way to have a satisfactory ending? You've been very, very nice to me this whole game.

95
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,560
 You did one thing I didn't like. Let's go home. Bizarre stuff. And it's interesting because I

96
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,320
 found those two examples just through random research. These two examples came within the

97
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,320
 first day. Who knows how many other times this is happening in gaming. If this guy had never

98
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,240
 checked that Wikipedia page, never would have known it. He would have just gone, "Oh yeah,

99
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,080
 there's three endings." And the players would have just assumed there was four. Because those were

100
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,560
 the options that they found. Very bizarre. How many other NPCs out there are way smarter

101
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,800
 than even the developers ever thought they could be. Sean, let's go ahead and "transist," is that a

102
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,760
 word? Sean, let's go ahead and "transform" is the word I'm looking for. It's not like I'm only the

103
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:13,800
 biggest fan of their properties. Sean, let's go ahead and "transform" the C++ Carpenter Caboose

104
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,160
 into the Hair Hanglider. We're leaving the digital space. We're flying out of somebody's

105
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:30,440
 floppy drive. We are headed out to 1990 Ukraine. Sean is expertly piloting the Hair Hanglider

106
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,840
 out to the Ukraine. Specifically, we're going someplace near Kiev. So if you're familiar with

107
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,440
 the region, it's over there. Anywhere that's near Kiev. Anywhere. We're going there. The year is

108
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:49,640
 1999. It's a sunny afternoon day. A local woman who's nameless, let's call her Stella, is picking

109
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,640
 mushrooms. She's out. She's picking up mushrooms in the outside place. What do you call it? The

110
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,360
 outdoors? I never go out there. She's singing some Ukrainian folk song and she's putting mushrooms

111
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,240
 in what I could only assume as a basket. Or maybe she's holding her apron out extra old-timey. But

112
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,400
 it is 1990. She's not Belle from Beating the Bees. I'm sure she could afford a basket. And then

113
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,840
 she sees kind of come out of nowhere this dude and he's just kind of walking. This guy comes

114
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,960
 walking out of the woods. He's not freaking saying. He's not freaking saying. I don't know why I made

115
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:30,840
 that noise. But he's very tall. He's six and a half feet tall. He's wearing a shiny black,

116
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:38,840
 like a dark, shiny diving suit with the giant bell head. Not like a church bell, but like a

117
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,160
 diving bell. Is that even a thing? You know what guys are and what I'm talking about. It's like the

118
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,640
 big ball on your head with the little circle in the middle. Like Jacques. Now farther back,

119
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:56,840
 like the 20,000 leagues under the sea type of scuba stuff. Not like modern-day scuba stuff.

120
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,440
 Right now the aliens kind of like around. It's like, dude, could you be any more vague about what

121
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,720
 I look like? I just look like an old-timey diver. Anyways, he looks like an old-timey diver. And

122
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,040
 Stella's standing there. She has a bunch of mushrooms. These were normal mushrooms, by the way.

123
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:19,400
 These are not magic mushrooms. And then the tall dude seemed to emit some sort of yellow light from

124
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,760
 him. Not specified that he had a gun or a wand or anything like that. Just a yellow beam of light

125
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,120
 shot out of him. Like a carabare stare. And it hit her. Sound like a cat. Sound like a cat.

126
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,360
 But it wasn't a cat. The beam hit her and then she looks and he's gone. He's completely evaporated

127
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,760
 into thin air, is the quote. After that, this woman has one of the strangest side effects I've ever seen

128
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,960
 related to an alien encounter. Kinda gave it away in the title, but you still probably can't figure

129
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,560
 it out. We've seen people get sores. We covered one guy who melted when he was around at UFO.

130
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,280
 Not melted his heart metaphorically. He literally melted over the course of about a couple hours.

131
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,560
 We've seen people develop horrible diseases. We've seen people cured of diseases. We've seen

132
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,920
 all sorts of things happen when people encounter aliens. Stella, for the next three years of her life,

133
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:18,280
 couldn't poop or pee. That's something you wouldn't notice right away. Like if I ever saw an alien,

134
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,160
 I'd be like "Ugh, what are you dressed like? Are you dressed like Jacques Cousteau or is it older

135
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,640
 than that?" And the aliens get annoyed. He shoots me with this beam. It would probably take me a

136
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:35,320
 couple days to realize I haven't pooped yet. Like it's not something I do every day. I am a biological

137
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,720
 human being. But I could probably go a couple days before I noticed that I wasn't pooping. Until the

138
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,760
 pain started. So it's not that she didn't have- I would notice- actually it's funny, I would notice

139
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,840
 I stopped peeing long before I peed because I pee more often than I poop. You love this podcast,

140
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,600
 guys? I pee all the time. I've noticed that. Apparently, like it's not that she didn't have

141
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,000
 to poop anymore. It's not like the aliens shot her with the beams or her body was this perfect system.

142
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,360
 No. She still had to poop and pee, but it just wouldn't come out. She would have to go to the

143
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,320
 doctors constantly and they'd have to manually pull out her poop and her pee. Which I can understand

144
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,520
 how someone would pull out your poop. I guess they would like stick like a medical spoon in there.

145
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,440
 Like a spoon made of stainless steel. It's all shiny and looks medically. They could just stick

146
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,400
 that in there and scoop it out. But how do you medically pull out somebody's pee? Like you just

147
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,000
 lean on them. You put your elbow on their bladder and you're like "Hold on Stella!" And you squeeze

148
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,080
 it out. They had to medically pull it out. This lasted for three years and then one day in 1993

149
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:48,760
 she just pooped and peed all by herself. The end. That's a book you can read to your guys as kids.

150
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,240
 The girl who couldn't poop or pee. That would be a shock. The one day you're like just sitting there

151
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,640
 and all of a sudden you're like "Oh my god. Henry, Henry, Henry! Call the children! Let everyone

152
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,360
 know I can poop again!" But apparently she can. That's a bizarre side effect. That's a bizarre

153
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,680
 side effect. I'm sure she was relieved. I'm sure those doctors were relieved. They didn't have to

154
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,240
 do that anymore unless one of them was a big old sicko. He's like "Oh, dang it. Now I gotta start

155
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,600
 ordering those videos from Germany again." I used to be able to just do it in the... do it in my

156
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,720
 office but now they're like "Why do we hire you? Why do we have you pervert doctor?" Anyways.

157
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,960
 Bizarre side effect of an alien encounter. Sean... Sean's like shaking his head. Sean's like "Tang it,

158
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,400
 can't we just stay in the computer?" No. We have one more story to talk about. Sean, we are gonna

159
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,320
 go ahead and give you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are headed out to the Soviet Union.

160
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:46,920
 So we're actually pretty much in the same continent. It's all the same. Ukraine in the other part of

161
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:56,600
 the Soviet Union. It's all the same. The year is 1983. Now the carbonar copter is painted all

162
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,120
 camouflage. We're wearing our battle dress uniforms, our BDUs, and I'm standing in front of

163
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,320
 you guys with like cool aviator glasses on. I have my hand on Sean's shoulder as he's looking ahead,

164
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:15,240
 piling us through enemy airspace. Ladies and gentlemen, the Cold War is on. Now keep us nice

165
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,920
 and low below the radar line, Sean. 1983 was one of the most volatile years of the Cold War and it

166
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,080
 definitely was since the Cuban Missile Crisis. President Ronald Reagan had just run this massive

167
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,280
 war game, this naval war game exercise in the area. The United States was planning on moving

168
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,120
 missile systems into NATO countries, which would really kind of quash the Soviet Union's nuclear

169
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,440
 threat. The Strategic Defense Initiative, aka Star Wars. The United States was going to build a series

170
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,440
 of space lasers, for lack of a better term, to shoot down... actually I think that was the term,

171
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,560
 to shoot down Soviet missiles. America was also flying spycraft over the Soviet Union and just

172
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,040
 a couple weeks before the event were about to cover, two American aircraft that was spying on the

173
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,240
 country were able to fly over and the commanders who weren't able to shoot them down, they were

174
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,120
 quote-unquote fired from their positions. I think they were probably literally shot, but 1983

175
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,120
 Soviet Union was a little bit better than it was during Stalin. Actually, actually a lot better

176
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,680
 than Stalin, it's not fair, but they definitely were like, "Oh you didn't kill those Americans flying

177
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,760
 over our country, you lost your job, you lost your pension, go stand on the bread line with everyone

178
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,960
 else." Tensions were high just globally and within the Soviet Union themselves, because they didn't

179
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,280
 know what was coming next, they did not know what was coming next. So September 1st, 1983, you have

180
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,280
 Kamchatka Peninsula in the Soviet Union, that's like on the eastern side of it, and in the pitch

181
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:57,960
 black night sky, an airplane has sighted flying over. Now just 10 days earlier, a massive storm

182
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,280
 hit this area and there was a Russian radar installation there that was damaged during the

183
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,400
 storm. They were repairing it and before this, a couple days before this happened, the Kremlin

184
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,440
 goes, "Hey, did you guys get that radar just repaired?" and they're like, "Oh yeah, totally." And they

185
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,960
 didn't. Still broken, they totally lied about it. So when this mysterious plane appears over

186
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,520
 Soviet airspace, it just popped out of nowhere. If they had had the radar dish, they would have seen

187
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,440
 it hundreds of miles away, but instead there's just a plane flying over the peninsula. Calls

188
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,360
 starting going out, "Hey, you got a plane in the area, what's going on?" The whole Soviet Union

189
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,440
 picked up the phone, they go, "Nyet, we do not." So they scramble four Russian jet fighters to find

190
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,120
 out what this is and they really know what it is. It's the American spying on them again. So these

191
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:49,160
 four fighter jets go up and they're trailing this thing. Back at Soviet command, there's two generals

192
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,360
 having an argument about what to do about this, because there's a couple different options.

193
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,080
 One, it's the Americans and they're doing a spy thing and they're going to take care of it this

194
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,000
 time because they're just tired of the Americans flying airplanes and taking a bunch of photos and

195
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,560
 stuff like that. The other one is it could be a possible passenger jet that has accidentally

196
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:17,240
 violated Soviet Union airspace. At this point, it's past the peninsula and the plane is flying over

197
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,520
 international waters. They can't identify what type of plane it is. It's a pitch black night sky,

198
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,160
 they're just following it. These fighter jets are just following it. They follow it for an hour

199
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:35,480
 through the night sky and then it passes over a tiny, unremarkable island that's controlled by the

200
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:46,440
 Soviet Union. The lead pilot of this little sortie, his name is Major Genadiy Asipovich.

201
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:56,120
 He fires a warning shot, specifically 200 warning shots. Bullets are flying right past this plane.

202
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,280
 Now he's looking at it and he has a really good view of it and he can tell it's a 747,

203
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,120
 but he says then at the moment and even later, it doesn't matter because you can turn any plane

204
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,160
 into a spy plane. But he fires 200 rounds past the plane. That's the warning shot. But as he's

205
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,040
 opening fire, he knows that it's probably not going to deter anyone. One, if it's a spy plane,

206
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,040
 they're not going to care. Two, if it's a passenger plane, which it very well could be,

207
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,920
 but he doesn't think it is. They're not tracer rounds, they're armor-piercing rounds and in the

208
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:35,000
 black night sky, if you can't hear it, it's basically saying "I'll knock on your door" and then

209
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,440
 knocking on a paper towel outside your door and being like "Okay, I guess I'm going to kick your

210
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:46,120
 door in now." The bullets just fly by. But after he opens fire, the plane slows down and all four

211
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:54,040
 fighter jets overshoot the plane. At that point, Major Asipovich, radio's in command and says "The

212
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,600
 plane's taken evasive maneuvers. I fired warning shots and immediately slowed down evasive maneuvers."

213
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,920
 And he gets the hard command, "Destroy it. Take this target out." He comes back around

214
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,080
 and the pitch black night sky gets behind it, fires two missiles at the plane.

215
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:22,920
 A couple hours earlier, Anchorage, Alaska, there's a passenger plane, Korean Airlines Flight 007.

216
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,400
 It was a flight from New York City to Seoul, South Korea, and there was a layover in Anchorage,

217
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:35,960
 Alaska. 246 passengers, 23 crew, and a slight error in their flight plan. When they started to take

218
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,880
 off, Air Traffic Control says "Hey, can you turn a couple degrees for this, that, or the other thing?"

219
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,440
 And the pilots were like "I wish you'd give us more information." But sure. And as they were

220
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,640
 turning, it's a little more complicated than this, but as they were turning their plane,

221
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,640
 they activated their autopilot system. Now in 1983, that was a big issue because the autopilot

222
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,720
 started to send them off course. This event we're about to talk about is the reason why you have

223
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,280
 GPS today. What happened here? GPS was something that the United States used for military purposes

224
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:13,080
 and it was invented in the 1970s. Because of this story, Ronald Reagan took top secret military

225
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,480
 hardware and said "Give it to the civilians. This can save lives." There was no GPS back then.

226
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,640
 They had the autopilot to go off of and they had their eyeballs and it's dark and they're flying

227
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:32,520
 over the Pacific Ocean. They end up 190 nautical miles off course, which brings them right into

228
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,880
 Soviet territory. They have no idea they're flying over Peninsula. They have no idea they're flying

229
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,120
 over this island. They definitely didn't see the warning shots because they weren't tracer rounds.

230
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,160
 They were armor piercing rounds. They never would have noticed them. As far as anything we can tell,

231
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,840
 the Soviet Union fighter pilots never contacted them on the emergency band. They claimed that they

232
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,240
 did, but they didn't. They also claimed originally they had fired tracer rounds and that turned

233
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,840
 out not to be true as well. So when this passenger plane is flying and all of a sudden it's struck

234
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:09,560
 by two missiles, you would expect the worst and you would be right. But what's super? This is where

235
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,480
 the story goes from being a story of human tragedy. That actually part still coming up,

236
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:23,960
 but it starts to become a really weird mystery. These two missiles strike a passenger jet, a 747.

237
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:32,280
 And based on telemetry, based on the black boxes, based on everything even the Soviet Union generals

238
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:40,040
 were seeing at the time, that plane continued to fly for another 9 minutes. There was about 4 minutes

239
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,160
 where it was really shaky. Because these missiles did a ton of damage, obviously, but this is not

240
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:52,040
 an armored civilian plane. I think any plane getting hit by two missiles would not have a good day.

241
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,800
 It's shaky for about 4 minutes and then for 5 minutes it has actually regained stability.

242
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,000
 Oh and I want to say this too, the reason why the plane slowed down after the bullets?

243
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,320
 Dumb luck. As the Russians were getting ready to fire those bullets, they had called South

244
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,520
 Korea and said "Hey, do you mind if we go up to 35,000 feet to save fuel?" And they're like "Yeah,

245
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,600
 go ahead." And so after those bullets were fired, they climbed and that caused the plane to slow

246
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:28,840
 down. Total dumb luck. But after the 9 minutes of flying, the plane hits a spiral, it breaks up,

247
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,920
 smashes into the sea. Again, because this is the Cold War and it's Soviet Union and they have to cover

248
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,280
 some stuff up now. Because it's only an hour or two before people start to realize the plane never

249
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,600
 showed up to South Korea. People are trying to track it. Soviet Union starts saying stuff "Oh no,

250
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,120
 we don't know where it crashed, we didn't have anything to do with it, oh well we might have,

251
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,560
 but we did fire these trace arounds, we tried using the emergency lines, all that stuff."

252
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,120
 They searched the area first, South Korea and America wanted to go in there. Russia's like "I

253
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,080
 don't know, we got it." And they're like "What's kind of rolling their eyes?" And then you had civilian

254
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,480
 rescue teams come out after the Soviet forces left and then eventually the black boxes were

255
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:14,680
 recovered. But the rest of the world was not told those black boxes were recovered until 1993.

256
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:20,760
 So 10 years later, Soviet Union's like "Oh yeah, you know the whole Cold War thing, you know,

257
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,120
 that is ending and we lost?" By the way, here's the recorders of that and they definitely showed

258
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:32,680
 more information as to what happened during that attack. But this is where it gets really,

259
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,960
 really weird. Soviet Union's really cagey on all their information, every government is.

260
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,760
 But one of the things is that the people whose loved ones died on that plane crash, they wanted

261
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:53,000
 their remains. 269 people on this plane. No bodies were found. The only thing that they found was

262
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,680
 they found a torso on the bottom of the sea by where the rubble was. And they found 10 pieces.

263
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,800
 They said they used the term limbs and tissue. So it could have been like a liver, it could have been

264
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:12,040
 a finger, but they found a torso and a couple of pieces. Eight days later and 70 miles away,

265
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,080
 13 body parts washed up on this beach. And you go Jason, the sea, the ocean's a big place.

266
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,400
 Maybe they just all floated in different directions. Well that's kind of the way the tide works.

267
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,800
 You wouldn't actually say that. You're smarter than that. But the tide, first off you would have

268
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:31,560
 had a bunch of people just there. When the Soviets got there first, the Soviet forces got there first

269
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:38,040
 that night, there's no reports of bodies being found. And when civilian rescue teams went there,

270
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,680
 one thing they noticed, this is where the conspiracy theory starts, to them, because they

271
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,440
 had worked sea time salvage before, to them it looked like someone had put the plane parts in

272
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:55,960
 the water. It didn't look like a normal distribution. So there's no bodies found other than that torso.

273
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,400
 Out of 269 people who died in that crash, you had one torso and about a baker's dozen of body parts.

274
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:09,400
 I don't know what a baker's dozen is. I meant 24 body parts. Two baker's dozens.

275
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,040
 So the people go well, one of the theories that came out was maybe they got eaten by the wildlife.

276
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:22,040
 Maybe they got eaten by giant crabs that live in the area. No luggage was found. None. Not a single

277
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,760
 suitcase washed up on a beach. You go, Jason, maybe it was a spy plane. To his death, Major

278
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,320
 Ospovich said that was a spy plane. He died in 2015. He goes, that was a spy plane. I don't believe

279
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,640
 that there was a bunch of people on that plane. As he is a single tear rolls down his face, he can't

280
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,080
 admit it. You would have to believe that if you had blown up a plane full of 269 people. No bodies,

281
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:51,800
 no luggage. And then there's another crinkle in this mystery. The Soviet Union did find clothing

282
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,360
 from the wreckage. So no luggage. But there was clothing and people go, so there must have been

283
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,200
 the clothing that they were wearing or the clothing that was in the plane, like in the cabin area.

284
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,800
 And they provided this stuff to the families. And there was a one woman, I was reading this

285
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,400
 Wikipedia article and this quote from this woman. She goes, I could tell it was my

286
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:16,520
 children's shoes by the way the laces were tied. That sounds like a minor thing. And I didn't

287
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,360
 really pick up on it the first time I read it. But when you look at other things that are happening,

288
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:28,120
 all the clothing, jackets and coats were zipped up. When you pack your clothing, do you zip

289
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,520
 everything up? When you have shoes that you're not wearing, do you tie the laces? Giant crabs,

290
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,440
 bro. Sure, maybe they took the luggage, maybe they gave the luggage to Ariel and it would be a

291
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,840
 new way for her to comb her hair. But the giant crabs ate everything. They ate the feet out of

292
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,880
 the shoes. Maybe. The guy, one of the main proponents of the giant crab theory is the guy who shot

293
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,120
 down the plane, even though he thinks it was a spy plane. He goes, but if it wasn't a spy plane,

294
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,680
 giant crabs ate them. And apparently there are these giant crabs in the area. This is closer to

295
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:04,600
 Japan. And they don't eat bones. Even if they did devour all the flesh and took the luggage to Ariel,

296
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,360
 did they give the bones to Sebastian for his xylophone? There's no bones, there's no bodies,

297
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:17,160
 there's zipped up clothing and shoes that are laced so perfectly that a mother could recognize

298
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,400
 that's the way my child laces their shoes. It's almost as if they evaporated.

299
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:30,040
 Let's put a pin in that for right now. Recently I did that episode about the Nashville bombing and

300
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:36,040
 I was bemoaning the idea that we're making a big conspiracy out of this guy who had a sad ending

301
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,800
 to his life and he blew this truck up, blew this RV up in front of the building. And I said in that,

302
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,760
 I go, as a child of the 80s, I grew up in the 80s, that was nothing. Like stuff blew up all the time.

303
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:54,280
 This is where, like, this is complete, several books were written about this. Several conspiracy

304
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,320
 theory books were written about this event. It was such a massive event. The song,

305
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:05,400
 Proud to Be an American by Lee Greenwood, it was inspired by this event. That's how you

306
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,400
 put your historical events. I was like, no, no, no, Ariana Grande has a great song about this

307
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,960
 national tragedy. This kind of changed the way, like, it made people really angry at the Soviet

308
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,240
 Union. So people were writing books about conspiracy theories about this event, 269 people blowing

309
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,440
 out of the sky. And it was conspiracy theory fodder because you didn't know all the facts,

310
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,160
 you never know all the facts. It happened in pitch black over enemy territory and they were

311
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,040
 being really cagey with details. So the conspiracy theory books started coming out. What happened

312
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:41,560
 to Flight 007? One of them was written by a guy named Michael Brune. It's a book called Incident

313
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,280
 at Sac Halen. That's the island it was shot over. Incident at Sac Halen, the true mission

314
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:54,840
 of KL Flight 007. He weaves this interesting story and he actually got people to kind of like

315
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:02,120
 back him up on this. That night there was actually a massive air battle. The Cold War was no longer

316
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:08,200
 cold and you had US forces fighting Soviet forces over that same area and this plane just happened

317
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,440
 to wander into it. Like a butler walking into the scene of a murder. And as this dogfights going

318
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,320
 off this plane, they didn't need warning shots, then they'd see all these explosions. This plane

319
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,160
 is just kind of flying through the area and a bunch of planes are shooting each other up.

320
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,120
 Sounds ridiculous, right? Because you would have to have, now you have two fantastic events. You

321
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,240
 have the accidental shootdown of this plane and then you have, because we know the plane goes down,

322
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,640
 but then you also have to involve all these other factors that were able to be covered up. One of

323
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,400
 the things that he was able to show in his book, there's a photo of some civilian rescue crews

324
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,280
 pulling out a piece of a weapon that had the letter "N" on it. So the Union doesn't have the

325
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,960
 letter "N" in their Krillik alphabet. So he goes, "There must have been another weapon in the area,

326
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,920
 i.e. an American weapon that went off." I can't dispute all that stuff. I don't think it's true,

327
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,880
 I don't think it's true, because we have that extra layer on it, but that's the level of conspiracy.

328
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,520
 Like people were digging through all the files to find stuff. But then you go, okay, so the plane

329
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:17,000
 got shot down accidentally by either the Americans, which would make it even a bigger scandal,

330
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,200
 because we were the ones going after the Soviet Union, or the Soviet Union didn't, we're having this

331
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,200
 dog fight. But then we have another conspiracy theory on top of that. And this is one that Michael

332
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,240
 Brune actually piggybacked on. He goes, "Actually, that'd be a great epilogue for my story."

333
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,520
 Two men got together. One was a brother-in-law, I think, of one of the people who died on the plane.

334
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,000
 The other one was a man who had escaped the Soviet Union. He'd escaped out of a gulag,

335
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,600
 and he was in the West now, talking about how crummy the Soviet Union was.

336
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,400
 When they meet up, they're digging through the information. This is the theory they came up with.

337
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,040
 The plane was shot, and it flew for another nine minutes. And again, that shocked everyone. It

338
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,240
 should have been shredded out of the air. No one could explain how that happened.

339
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,720
 Soviet command was thinking, "Are our missiles that lame?" But anyways, the plane continues on

340
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,200
 for nine minutes. They believe that the plane landed. It was a successful landing. Everyone was

341
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,560
 fine. Maybe it had a couple people blown up by the missile, but not 269 of them. They were immediately

342
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:19,240
 taken prisoner by the Soviets. The children were sent to orphanages. The rest of them were herded

343
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,640
 off into the gulags and disappeared into Siberia. That one became pretty popular,

344
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,800
 because it wouldn't make sense that it would become popular, because it would give you hope.

345
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,040
 It's not that they all died. If you had a relative on that plane, you'd think, "Well,

346
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:39,400
 maybe they're just in the gulag." Which is better than being dead, right? Maybe that kid's in an

347
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,960
 orphanage. He has a chance to have a better life, rather than just blowing up, getting eaten by crabs.

348
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:49,800
 It's an interesting story. It's a tragedy. And that's the end of it. We have no answers. We don't

349
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,720
 know where those bodies went. To this day, there's not a satisfactory answer. Even when you look

350
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,120
 at the story, some people say maybe they just all got sucked out of the plane as it was falling into

351
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,280
 the ocean, like the wind tunnel effect. But you would still find these bodies. All they ever found

352
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:13,800
 was shoes, jackets, a torso, a couple body parts. And that's it. Out of 269 people, it just doesn't

353
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,240
 make sense. Now, planes disappeared. Don't get me wrong. We had that very famous plane,

354
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,800
 that Malaysia flight. I don't remember the exact number of it. It disappeared. But we don't even

355
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:27,560
 know where that went down. If you know where the plane went down, you should be able to find the

356
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,800
 bodies. But there's just so much stuff that doesn't make sense here. You have the people saying it

357
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,240
 looks like the wreckage was just put there. The absence of bodies. No clear cut reason why the bodies

358
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:43,960
 aren't there. After all these years, it's been what? 40 years since this happened? People still

359
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,840
 can't figure it out. It's a tragic story. It's a mystery. I wanted to profile it and we'll wrap it

360
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,600
 up like this. If that happened today, and there just was an Indonesian flight that went missing

361
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,440
 just a couple days ago, so we hope that we find survivors from that thing. If this story though,

362
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:07,720
 if Korean Airlines 007 happened today, you know the first theory would be aliens.

363
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,720
 Because that's exactly what this seems like. And I know it's really weird to say you have the

364
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,360
 missiles, you have the Soviet Union admitting they fired these missiles. You have all of this stuff,

365
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:24,840
 you have the black box. But where did the bodies go? This happened today. I think that would be a

366
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,240
 big conspiracy theory. Aliens abducted them right before they died. They're in a better place.

367
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,360
 They're in a better place now, not heaven. That's a better place, but in the second.

368
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,080
 Like, a rung down, they're flying around in space, having space adventures. You would see that

369
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:45,480
 conspiracy theory. But I want to wrap it up like this. A long time ago, we covered the story of the

370
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:52,920
 Belray Surge. It was an energy weapon that the United States supposedly developed that was able to

371
00:34:52,920 --> 00:35:00,120
 evaporate the pipelines of a town. This was different than a neutron bomb. This was a weapon

372
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,000
 that was actually, it really was supposed to be an energy source, but instead it absorbed

373
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,400
 all living matter in a town and everyone disappeared. It's 1983, it's the Soviet Union.

374
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:20,360
 There is a plane of unknown origin that just was able to take two missiles and still fly perfectly.

375
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:27,560
 Imagine there is a Soviet commander on the ground who is a part of the Experimental Weapons Division.

376
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:36,520
 He has been following this flight the entire time. Everyone has been aware of U.S. spy flights

377
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:43,640
 over the Soviet Union, and he was waiting to see how this played out. When the two missiles struck

378
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,440
 the unknown aircraft and it continued to fly, that would be all the proof you would need that

379
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,200
 this is not a civilian craft, that this must be a heavily armored military craft, almost like a tank

380
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:03,240
 in the sky. That is when he is given the authority to use his weapon. A beam shoots through the

381
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:11,640
 darkness invisible because it's not a sci-fi movie, it's just pure energy. It strikes the plane and in

382
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:23,880
 an instant 269 people cease to exist. The plane plummets into the sea and crashes there. Soviet

383
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,640
 forces get there and they can look at this plane and they realize the weapon was a success,

384
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,880
 but it left some unusual damage to the whole of this aircraft. So they remove those pieces

385
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,440
 and then rearrange the rest of the rubble to kind of fill in the gaps. I don't know where the torso

386
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,520
 came from, maybe a Soviet diver killed himself during the whole expedition. He couldn't live

387
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:56,760
 with himself, so that's where their corpse came from. But that is just another conspiracy theory

388
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,240
 to throw into the mix. Whenever there is a tragedy, people will always try to figure it out.

389
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:10,200
 And whether it is a sci-fi fantasy or a Cold War thriller, we will always search for the answers

390
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,600
 to learn the truth of what happened that night in the cold black sky.
