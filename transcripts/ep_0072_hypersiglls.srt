1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
 Was there really an internet game that encouraged its players to commit suicide?

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,400
 And can magic help you get the life you've always dreamed of today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:24,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to Dead Rabbit Radio. My name is Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,720
 I hope you're having a great day too. Episode 72. This is crazy that it's actually lasted this long.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,120
 And not to be fair, no, no, no. Now that it's lasted this long, that I've kept doing it this long.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,440
 It's awesome. I'm very, very proud of myself. We're actually, which you know,

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,800
 you should always be proud of yourself, but we're actually doing great. Thank you so much

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,800
 for everyone who's downloading the show, listening to it. It's doing, it's phenomenal.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,920
 We're hitting the tipping point where now it's just getting subscribers and getting new downloads

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,360
 every day. So I appreciate that. And really, that plays into our second story. So I currently have

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,160
 a friend who's having trouble with mice in her house. Now I'm not going to say who it is because

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,600
 she would beat me up. But you know, the traditional answer is you have mice in your house. People

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,280
 say we'll get a cat. Cat, well, either mice or cats, however many mice you have. Apparently,

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,880
 she has a lot. That actually works with other species as well. I used to eat a ton of rice,

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,240
 pounds and pounds of rice. It's really cheap and it's filling and I love it. And I always like

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,200
 mix it with chili or a Taco Bell or whatever. Turns it's basically just a filler food. What I didn't

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,680
 know was that in rice, and correct me if I'm wrong, I probably am. I don't know if this is

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,840
 exactly where they came from, but in rice, there are little bugs called rice weevils, like eggs,

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,880
 basically. So if you and again, people are like, that's not how it works, Jason. That's not how

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,120
 it works. But this is what I was told happens. If you cook rice and don't eat all of it and you let

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,440
 it sit out for a while, the rice weevil eggs hatch. And so you get these little bugs that fly

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,600
 around your apartment. Now that sequence of events happened quite often where I would cook rice and

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,280
 wouldn't eat all of it. I would leave the bowl out and these bugs, these little rice weevils began

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,080
 to infest, not this apartment. This was years and years ago. I don't want people going, I'm never

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,240
 coming over to your apartment again, Jason. Anyways, so I'd get these rice weevils flying around.

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,160
 They pretty much limit themselves to the kitchen or wherever there was rice before. Maybe they

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,600
 showed up to eat the rice. I don't know. That's not the point. Anyways, I had rice weevils everywhere.

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:43,600
 And then one summer, the rice weevils were gone. But my sanitary habits didn't change. So I was

29
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,640
 like, "Oh, I wonder where all those rice weevils at." But I had an infestation of ants, not an

30
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,880
 infestation, but I had a lot of ants in my kitchen because again, not cleaning up. And so I was like,

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,440
 "Oh man, I got all these ants. Oh man, I just, no peace of course. I could have just cleaned up." But

32
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,840
 it's like, "What are we going to do with all these ants?" So finally I got some bug spray

33
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,680
 or just cleaned them up. I think I just like mass extermination of all these ants. And then maybe

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,840
 like a couple days later, a week later, the rice weevils came back. And I thought, "Wait a second.

35
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,360
 The ants, the rice weevils were here. The ants showed up. There was no more rice weevils to get

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,360
 rid of the ants. Rice weevils show back up." So then I realized that the ants must have been eating

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:37,360
 the weevils. So what I did, again, rather than clean up, I coaxed a bunch of ants into my apartment

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,560
 by leaving sugar out for them in lollipops and candy.

39
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:50,240
 The ants showed up in droves. Never had another rice weevil problem. Now, when I say rice weevil

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,320
 problem, let me tell you this story for an example. I was dating a girl at the time. She was over at

41
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,400
 the apartment and she was complaining about something or whatever. I'm sitting on the couch and she's

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,680
 just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." And she had something in her hand and she hit the top of the trash can.

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,040
 So like the lid would pop down to throw the thing away. She's looking at me because she's complaining

44
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,560
 to me about something. And she hits the top of the can and she drops the thing into the garbage can.

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:27,920
 And right when the candle is open, a bowling ball size of rice weevils just silently flew out of the

46
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,280
 garbage can. I was almost expecting them to make the shape of a mallet and hit her on the head.

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,680
 It was like a cartoon amount size of rice weevils. And they just flew right by her. If she had seen

48
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,320
 them, it would have been over right there. Absolutely. She would have crucified me and

49
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,160
 broke up with me, which technically happened later on. But I saw it like, and my eyes go

50
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,080
 wide because I'm thinking if she just turned slightly to her left, she is going to piss her

51
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,640
 pants. And they just fly up and then they just kind of like are buzzing around the ceiling of

52
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,960
 they're happy they finally got free of their garbage can jail. And she didn't see them. But so that was

53
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
 the level of rice weevil infestation. So I ended up coaxing the ants in, they took care of the rice

54
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,640
 weevils. And then as a reward to them, I built them an amusement park. I built them a little,

55
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,840
 I built the ants like this little like walkway. And then I had like this little thing of rubbing

56
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,400
 in alcohol. And it was like, if they fall on that, they die. So that's not really an amusement,

57
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,560
 but it was amusement to me. And I built like these little bridges they could walk across and I put

58
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,320
 sugar everywhere so they could eat it. I love ants now. I don't have them anymore. Sadly enough.

59
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,960
 Well, I guess that's good. But I always liked watching them like eat stuff, be like put out a

60
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,440
 lollipop and then you'd see them eat little little holes through them and stuff like that.

61
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,480
 So thank you ants for giving me entertainment and saving me from rice weevils. Let's go ahead and

62
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,400
 get started with the episode. So this is an interesting story because there's a lot of

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,400
 disagreement over whether or not it's real, which isn't surprising on the internet. But for the amount

64
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,880
 of impact this has had, it is weird. What we're going to talk about here is the blue whale game.

65
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,400
 Now the blue whale game started back in 2017, 2016, 2015 actually. So started back in say 2015.

66
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:22,320
 And what that is in an overview, an umbrella view of the blue whale game, you, it is a series of 50

67
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,680
 tasks that get increasingly more dark and violent. So the first, I finally found the list. It took

68
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,800
 me forever and see again, there's not a ton of concrete information on this. So we're going to

69
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,320
 go over a couple of the quick, we're going to quickly go over a couple of these tasks. So day

70
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,840
 one, you're supposed to carve a phrase on your arm. Day two, you wake up at 420 and you watch a

71
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,240
 scary video. You just keep going through. You have overcome a fear. You write an online status on

72
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,600
 social network about being a whale. You listen to music that the curator sends. And so what it is,

73
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,000
 is that you sign up for to be part of this blue whale game and you get an advisor and they walk

74
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,760
 you through these 50 tasks. And if you don't complete them, you get like berated, like you're

75
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,840
 not doing these fast enough. Where's that picture of that guy's name carved on your arm and stuff

76
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,600
 like that. And the end result is kill yourself. And some of these tasks are set up to overcome

77
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,560
 objections to killing yourself, like climb up a crane and go to the edge of a bridge,

78
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,960
 stand on the edge of a building and basically it's baby steps to get you to that point.

79
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,560
 Now supposedly it started in Russia. So it's been linked to like hundreds of suicides.

80
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,960
 And there is all these, it was an international thing. Governments were saying,

81
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,200
 parents, you have to monitor your kid's social network. There's this game going around that's

82
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,880
 taking young, vulnerable, depressed kids and talking them into committing suicide.

83
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,560
 There are people online who are trying to get your kids to commit suicide.

84
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,440
 One of like Egyptians former government officials, his son killed himself. They

85
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,560
 believe it was linked to this game. They had a big outbreak in India. The biggest was in Russia

86
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,680
 where they're having a ton of these. And what's weird is the pushback was no, this is a modern day

87
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,640
 witch hunt. This is just like the satanic panic of the 80s, which is where, you know, supposedly

88
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,560
 everything was, everything, they went wrong with saint worshiping. You could play albums

89
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,320
 backwards and there were preschools with saint worshipers running them. And that's almost

90
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,360
 like a, it's own episode, but it's kind of like this moral panic. The pushback was none of these

91
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,080
 suicides because kids were killing themselves. The question was, is it linked to the blue whale

92
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,640
 game? And they can never find, according to the online sources, they can never find definitive

93
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,440
 proof. What we know in this time period is kids were killing themselves, which is nothing new,

94
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,200
 unfortunately. And that there were websites dedicated to getting people to kill themselves.

95
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
 The question was, were the two things linked? So there was a really interesting article written

96
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,800
 in Cosmo where a young female reporter went undercover pretending to be an even younger female,

97
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,840
 and she got a hold of one of these groups because it wasn't incredibly hard. And she met a guy who

98
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,560
 was saying, you know, follow these steps. Why aren't you doing these things? And it's an interesting

99
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,800
 read because she talks about kind of the mental anguish she was going through because she was

100
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,320
 going in as an undercover reporter. But the way he kind of groomed her actually was making her

101
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,320
 feel depressed and lonely and things like that. Now again, the pushback is none of this stuff is

102
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:24,160
 linked. None of this stuff is linked. In Russia, they arrested a man. They arrested him for inventing

103
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,640
 this game, basically. And he was being held in charges of inciting suicide. And he's like,

104
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,120
 oh, these people want to die. And I'm just cleansing society. They're biological waste,

105
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
 which is funny because that's a lot like we talked about yesterday with Satoshi Umamatsu.

106
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,880
 He figures he's doing the world a favor. And again, the pushback, the debunking is, oh,

107
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,600
 there's really no proof this guy was arrested. That was first reported in this tabloid type

108
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,280
 website and things like that. It's totally made up. It's overblown. What I honestly think is

109
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,040
 going on. It doesn't surprise me. There are people out there trying to talk other people into committing

110
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,800
 suicide. Maybe it's their fetish. Maybe it's a power move. Maybe it's their way of being a serial

111
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,640
 killer. I think the pushback is the thing saying this isn't true. These kids are just

112
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,400
 unfortunately killing themselves. It's not linked. I think the pushback is coming from,

113
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,440
 and this is my conspiracy, coming from tech companies. If the governments of the world

114
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:27,120
 could prove a conclusive link between Facebook, between Instagram, between Twitter, and a suicide

115
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,040
 game that's causing hundreds of kids to kill themselves, it was like 230 kids or something

116
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:38,400
 like that, you would see massive regulation on those sites, massive. They would say Facebook,

117
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,880
 you have to vet every single comment that comes online because people are dying because of it.

118
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,720
 So what would Facebook and Google do? They would basically lobby to say this isn't true.

119
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,840
 They're going to favor search results that are like, well, there's no conclusive link.

120
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,760
 They're going to favor stories where they're like, yeah, but this didn't really happen this way,

121
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,560
 and we think it's just a made up thing, and this didn't happen, and this didn't happen,

122
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,080
 because otherwise, their survival would be in jeopardy. If the governments, and again,

123
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,960
 moral panics do happen, and stuff can get over-regulated because of that, but if the governments

124
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,680
 of the world could prove these things are actually happening, these sites would be shut down.

125
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,800
 I think that I believe that people are still enticing young people to kill themselves online,

126
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,400
 and I believe that young kids are doing it, and I believe it's a problem, and I believe it's a

127
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,160
 problem that's being covered up because there's just way too much at stake to let that information

128
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,800
 get out. We're already talking about regulating Facebook and Google because they're demoting

129
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,480
 conservative websites. Could you imagine if we could prove that they were encouraging suicide,

130
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,320
 or not necessarily encouraging it, but not stopping it, that people were using their sites

131
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,120
 for young kids to kill themselves? It'd be a disaster. Absolute disaster. So we'll see. Again,

132
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,240
 it's an odd story. There's tons of articles on it, but all of them say there's no conclusive link,

133
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,160
 and maybe there isn't. Could also be that, you know, when a young person takes their life,

134
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,760
 family is always going to look for answers, and maybe it's the easy answer to go,

135
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,880
 "Oh, they were coaxed online part of this blue whale game," but again, I think the truth may be

136
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,720
 half in the middle. Even if half the kids was linked to this group, that's still a problem,

137
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,600
 and it's a problem that would need to be addressed. I'm not a huge fan of Facebook and

138
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,280
 Google, honestly, but I just think that's an interesting story. Now it's kind of come back

139
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,320
 with the Momo challenge, which is kind of the same thing. It's this creepy figure that encourages

140
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,800
 kids to commit to suicide, so the game is still going on. It just will change its name, and because

141
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,600
 these creeps are always out there. The next story we're going to talk about is far more uplifting,

142
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,760
 so I don't want to end on that one. When I was about 18 or 19, I got this design in my head.

143
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,800
 I was really into metaphysical stuff back then, and I remember I saw this image, and it wasn't

144
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,240
 magical. It wasn't like it was floating in front of me in fire and talking to me in

145
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,200
 Inoki and or anything like that. It was just this glyph I got in my head. I can't really explain it.

146
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,280
 I can draw it easily. And it was basically when I saw it, I knew what it was. It was the symbol of

147
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,960
 my life. I was like, "That's how my life will be charted out. That's the symbol of my life," and

148
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,400
 I knew about sigils and things like that. So a sigil is basically an inscribed - I'm reading the

149
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,600
 definition here - is an inscribed or painted symbol considered to have magical powers. So it's basically

150
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,160
 like a design that is infused with magic, magical thought, magical vibration. So I had this image

151
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,960
 in my head, and I've drawn it out. People who know me may have seen it on me before, and usually I

152
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,440
 draw it when I'm bored, but it's always been very comforting to me because it's a symbol of hope,

153
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,480
 and it shows the good times and the bad times in my life. It kind of just charts the whole thing out.

154
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,920
 And I'll see if I can draw a picture of it and throw it up online. I need a scanner. But so

155
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,800
 that was - I had that sigil. What's interesting - so then we're going to skip ahead to what

156
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:16,160
 the story is about - is not the magical drawings, but something known as a hyper-sigil. So a hyper-sigil

157
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:26,000
 is not just a drawing of a symbol, a magical symbol, but it is a living magical work. It is

158
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,200
 basically a sigil that has its own - it's a sigil in story form, I guess is a good way to put it.

159
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,600
 People have made hyper-sigils out of things like poems, of comic books is a really popular one,

160
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,840
 movies, and things like that. And what it is is it is basically taking your life

161
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:52,160
 and turning it into a narrative. You live the hyper-sigil. Grant Morrison is a comic book writer.

162
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,840
 He's very, very well known in the comic book community. Not real name recognition, but he

163
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,680
 had a comic book that came out quite a while ago called The Invisibles. You probably know what

164
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,120
 better is the matrix because the matrix ripped off a lot of the plot, the overall plot of The

165
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,480
 Invisibles. But for him, The Invisibles was his hyper-sigil. To him, that's his hyper-sigil. That

166
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,040
 is the life he wanted and he lived through the story of the comic book. And he said, "I wanted to

167
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,880
 live in a glam, futuristic world, so I created a glam, futuristic world and enveloped myself around

168
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,280
 it and now I'm living the life I've always wanted to live." Now sure, being a successful comic book

169
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:42,960
 author is part of that because he has the money to buy those things. But you create and so imagine

170
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:51,200
 what your life is like right now. Now I want you to imagine if going forward, you had to cut a movie

171
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,960
 trailer for your future life. So you're where you're at right now, but you go, "You know what? I want

172
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,840
 to be this. I want my life to have these elements. I want it to be exciting or exotic or passionate

173
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:12,880
 or dangerous. Imagine a movie trailer of you waking up tomorrow, the life you want. Imagine a story,

174
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,120
 a narrative, where you are the main character and really put your mental thought into that. You

175
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:26,160
 are creating a hyper-sigil by doing that. I've done that with Dead Rabbit. When I was putting up flyers

176
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,640
 for the show, I imagined, I go, "This would be a scene in the trailer for this story of my life.

177
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,800
 Of me just going out and doing the groundwork to get this ball rolling." I remember specifically

178
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,640
 thinking that as I put the flyer up on the community board, I thought, "This is a scene in the trailer

179
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,280
 of the story of Dead Rabbit Radio. This is me taking that first step to get it known to the wider public.

180
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:59,200
 And that's how I live my life. I've created this narrative for me. I've created this character. That

181
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,760
 is me." When people meet me in real life or people who know me listen to podcasts, they're like, "Ugh."

182
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,360
 It's just like talking to you. But at the same time, Dead Rabbit is part of a separate space, part of

183
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:18,160
 like a magical thought space, a future that I want. And that's how I envision it. My hyper-sigil is

184
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,200
 Dead Rabbit. And I think about it and I put it out there. And it comes, that's the weird thing. It

185
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:32,880
 works. It absolutely works. If the show fell apart tomorrow, you could argue it didn't work.

186
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,440
 And I'd say, "Yeah, there is a, you know, convergence of factors and something happened,

187
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,800
 the show couldn't continue." But that's not going to happen. The show's going to keep growing and

188
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:49,280
 growing and growing because I've seen those parts of the trailer. I've already lived those parts of

189
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:57,600
 that story. I may get curveballs. I may get plot twists that I don't see coming. But the overall

190
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,720
 story is the same. If you listen to the early episodes, and I don't know if I necessarily

191
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,080
 said it on the episodes, I'm pretty sure I did. I did say in real life. I would tell people,

192
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,640
 "We're going to wait 50 episodes and then we're going to evaluate the show and see where we're

193
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,240
 going to do that in the future." Just two episodes ago, I was talking about five years from now on

194
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,640
 the show. Like, this is the growth of the show over the next five to 10 years. Like, I keep

195
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,880
 fixing that narrative to go farther and farther into the future. I don't want to preach to you guys.

196
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,760
 But I think this works. And I think this can work for everybody. And the beauty of it is, it's free.

197
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,200
 There's no seminar you have to go to. There's no book you have to buy. I will say this, all the

198
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,080
 information I've given you on Hypersidials is kind of all the stuff that I found. There is this quote

199
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,720
 and this is a quote from Grant Morrison. This is how he defined Hypersidials.

200
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:00,240
 The Hypersidial or SuperSidual develops the sigil concept beyond the static image and incorporates

201
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,640
 elements such as characterization, drama, and plot. The Hypersidial is a sigil extended through the

202
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,400
 fourth dimension. My own comic book series The Invisibles was a six-year-long sigil in the form

203
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,000
 of an occult adventure story which consumed and recreated my life during the period of its

204
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,360
 composition and execution. The Hypersidial is an immensely powerful and sometimes dangerous method

205
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,000
 for actually altering reality in accordance with intent. Results can be remarkable and shocking.

206
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 You don't have to believe me. It sounds completely foolish. I think it works. I've seen it work.

207
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,920
 Is it possible? We talked about this with the Despair Code episode too.

208
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,960
 You know, you hear stuff like The Secret, which is, I've looked into The Secret. Positive thinking

209
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,640
 is definitely good. There is actually an older book from the late 1800s called The Science of

210
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,760
 Getting Rich and you think it's a book about like how to do well in business. It's a book about the

211
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,840
 metaphysics of gaining property and money and it is fascinating. It's kind of, it predates this

212
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:14,560
 obviously and it's basically that the universe is full of a formless substance and when you think

213
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,960
 of becoming wealthy, the universe wants to provide to you that wealth. But you've got to work for it.

214
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,640
 It's super bizarre. Basically, the premise of the book is there are no natural limitation on

215
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,560
 natural resources. There is no limitation of money. Anyone who wants money can get it. But not just

216
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:39,840
 through hard work, you also have to visualize yourself becoming wealthy. And the William Waddles,

217
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,520
 I think, or Wallace Waddles wrote it. It's fascinating because he goes, you're going to have

218
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,400
 two hard workers next to each other and one person is rich and one person is poor. You're going to

219
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,440
 have two people with the same business. One person is rich, one person is poor. Two houses on the

220
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,240
 street, one person is rich, one person is poor. And he's like, if it was strictly because of

221
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,760
 socioeconomic factors or strictly because the business you are in, everyone on that street

222
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,680
 should be poor, everyone in that business should be poor, or reversely, everyone on the street

223
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,920
 should be rich, everyone in that business should be rich. He said the people who are wealthy are

224
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,720
 people who already believe that they're wealthy and they act accordingly and the universe recognizes

225
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,440
 them living that life and then rewards them with it. It's really bizarre. And it has the guy, the

226
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,320
 author was a Christian socialist and it has this weird Christian theme running through it. And

227
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,840
 the basically is like, God, the universe, everything wants you to be wealthy because you can't truly

228
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,640
 live life if you're poor. That's almost its own episode. But I mean, again, I think that it's

229
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,000
 your thoughts dictate your reality. And you go, well, Jason, what about the kid living in the

230
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Sudan? You know, his hypercigill could just be to get a meal the next day. I don't know. I don't

231
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,680
 know that they answer that question. The same reason why I can never answer the question like,

232
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,320
 why would a God or any higher deity let children die of cancer? I don't know.

233
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:13,520
 But I do think that there is a power to your thought. And if you can create a new reality

234
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,040
 around it, just try it. That's what I would say. And again, the beauty of like a system like this,

235
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:26,000
 you know, you're not no one's selling you anything, it just simply exists. I know it works for body

236
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,760
 builders. If you talk to any bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger, any of those guys, they'll say,

237
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:38,000
 I visualized myself being muscular. And that is how I got to this point. Well, let me rephrase

238
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,560
 that. They also had to work lift a shit ton of weights. But if you're just lifting weights and

239
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,200
 you're not visualizing yourself, you haven't created that story, you're not living that character

240
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,800
 as a monster of a human. You're just lifting your weights, there's a disconnect between the

241
00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:00,080
 mental and the physical. Imagine your life as a movie, create a plot around your life.

242
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,000
 Think of that, focus on that. And see what happens. I could be wrong.

243
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:16,880
 But I think hyper sigils work. And if they do, and we have the ability to reshape our own lives,

244
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,760
 you could say, well, Jason, I want to be a superhero, I want to fly around a building,

245
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,120
 can I use a hyper sigil for that? I don't know. I don't know, I do have a theory about that,

246
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,200
 though, actually. I think that if that was, if you really, really wanted to be a superhero, and you

247
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,240
 imagined every day you become a superhero, again, I have no proof of this, but I think that you would

248
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,720
 basically create an alternate reality where you are a superhero. You would still live in our reality.

249
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,880
 And I wouldn't like if my best friend every day wished he was a superhero, and he created this

250
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,840
 hyper sigil where he could fly around. I think, in theory, in my reality, he would still be Joey,

251
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,600
 but an alternate reality would open up where he got superpowers. Does that sound insane? Absolutely.

252
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,800
 Absolutely. Does this whole thing sound insane? Absolutely. Absolutely. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

253
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,360
 I'm not, like I said, I'm not selling you anything. And I don't really know. I believe that it works.

254
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,640
 Have you seen it work for me? But if I'm wrong, and a bunch of people want to say that was your

255
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,200
 dumbest story ever, because you're trying to convince me that if I tell myself a story, it'll

256
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,920
 come true, what do you have to lose if you don't do it? Like I said, the only thing you're losing is

257
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,720
 time and thought process, which we're going to spend anyways.

258
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,400
 I've said this before, I will sit at home and I will imagine getting new listeners to the podcast.

259
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,440
 But at the same time, I have to work on my podcast every single day. I think that's part of it too.

260
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,800
 I think part of the hyper sigil is you create the life you want in your head. But if the life in

261
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,680
 your head is to be a Major League Baseball player, you got to practice. You got to put that work in.

262
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,520
 That's kind of what Wallace Waddles was saying too. If I sat around and said I want to be a

263
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,320
 super successful podcaster and release an episode once a month, that's not going to work. But

264
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,120
 I put in the work to do the podcast. I was up till four in the morning recording stuff yesterday.

265
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,360
 And then in my free time, I imagine the future I'm going to have with this podcast.

266
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:31,040
 Hyper sigils. It's on the conspiracy iceberg. And it may be one of the truest things on there,

267
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:39,360
 honestly. We'll find out. Let me know how they work for you. DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going

268
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,240
 to be your email address. You can also hit us up at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio. One of my

269
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,200
 hyper sigils is not to be invested with ants by the way. I should put that out there. Twitter is

270
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,520
 @JasonOCarvander. DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy true crime podcast. You

271
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,920
 don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one, guys.
