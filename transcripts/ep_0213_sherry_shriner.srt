1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 The great philosopher Steven Urkel once said, "Does anyone have any cheese?"

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500
 But today we meet a boy who would never ask that question.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,700
 And then we take a close look at the life and times of Sherry Schreiner.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:27,000
 Exactly who is this woman who was gifted by God the ability to defeat the alien reptilian agenda today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,500
 [Music]

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,000
 I hope you're having a great day too. You know, I didn't get to address this yesterday. I totally forgot about it.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 On Friday's episode, the Benadryl induced rant about hybrid aliens.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That episode is actually probably a half hour longer than what was released because I spent a half hour talking about my charred pants story.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,500
 And I think that might actually be an end of being a lost episode for Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 When I was recording the charred pants segment, I thought this is so stupid.

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:17,000
 It's one of those stories that I've told to people who like knew about the pants and was kind of like,

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 "In that time period and they think it's hilarious." I haven't even listened back to it because it was so cringy.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Even when I was recording it, I was like, "I'm committed. I gotta finish this story."

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 But once I got done with it, I'm like, "It's basically sounded super stupid."

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 It's currently on the Rabatron 3000 and the power supply went off on that.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So I don't even have access to it right now.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 If I'm not able to get the Rabatron 3000 working again, I can still have the hard drives from it.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 But I think it's just a power supply issue. It's like an $80 fix.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 But it was terrible. It was a really, really bad segment.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I remember as I was recording it, because one of the things you're taught as an actor is you commit.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 If you make a choice, you gotta commit to it. You can't change course in the middle of it.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 You can change... I've obviously made adjustments over this run of the show.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I've made adjustments throughout the series.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 But once you commit to a certain action in a particular moment, you have to commit to it.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And halfway through, when I'm still doing this bit about these shard pants...

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 True story, by the way, but as I was doing this bit, I was thinking in my head...

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm telling the story, but in my head I'm thinking, "This will cause people to unsubscribe."

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 This might be the most unfunny and boring forced humor segment I've ever done.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 That's a high threshold, because I've pushed that line a couple times.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 But I've always thought it was funny, and you guys have always responded really well to it.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 The mongo, the mongo dick segment, I was thinking, "This isn't gonna work. This isn't gonna work."

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 But it did. The shard pants story, oh man.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 So for now it's a lost episode. It may be released at the end of the year, my New Year's Eve episode, but...

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I don't know, I'll have to listen back to it when I'm in a better mood, because it was really, really cringy.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 In my memory, at least. You may hear it, but probably not.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with our first story here now.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Now, the first story popped up, it's currently an inquest, which is the British version of a trial.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I think it's actually not a real trial, it's just people asking questions.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 So I don't know, whatever. This is basically an ongoing inquest.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 They should be done by Friday, but I kind of wanted to cover the story now.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I think we got most of the information out that we need.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 The year is 2017.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Well, let's go to England, so let's hop in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 We're gonna putter along across the big pond, I think that's the word they call the ocean, like a slang term for the ocean, the big pond.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I think. Anyways, we're gonna cross the term that may or may not exist.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 We're going to England, we're going back to the year 2017, so quite recent. Quite recent.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 We are at, this is a mouthful, the William Perkin Church of England High School, and this is in Greenford, West London.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 The only reason I know there's a West London, because it's a level on killing floor.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 They don't even know existed. But anyway, so apparently there is a place called West London, it's not ever run by zombies yet.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 But there's a high school there, and it's lunchtime.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 There's a boy who goes, "Oh, mate, I'm so hungry, and I see some food with my peepas. Can I have some of your food, Governor?"

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And his friend goes, "Ah, yes, yes, matey, here. This is all I got."

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And as a joke, his buddy gives his hungry friend a little piece of cheese. It's described as half the size of a post-it note.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 "Oh, what am I bloody supposed to do with this little thing?"

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And the kid, both of these boys are unnamed, because this is a criminal inquest.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Like, they don't reveal the names of minors over there, because this all happened when everyone was about 13 years old.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I probably should have set it up a little bit better, but anyways.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 "I'm bloody 13. What am I supposed to do? I'm a grown boy. What am I supposed to do with this tiny piece of cheese?"

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And the boy, jokingly, because what's he gonna do with it? He flicks it at another student, and it hits the dude in the neck.

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Who he flicked it at was a young boy, 13 years old as well, known as "Karanbeer Singh Chima."

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And the cheese hits his neck, and he goes, "Ah, ah, I'm allergic to cheese. I'm allergic to cheese."

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And he peels the cheese off of his neck, and begins rubbing his neck, and goes to the doctor.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And people are like, "What? Okay, you're allergic to cheese. Sorry, mate."

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And they go about their day. And "Karanbeer" goes to... well, just call him "Chima," because I can pronounce that better.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 "Chima" goes to the medical facility at this high school. The nurse. The nurse's office. This is not a medical facility.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 They don't have, like, tables and big lights, and so on. I'm sure they have a table, but it's not like...

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 It's not like the Umbrella Corporation. They don't have, like, an underground medical facility.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 But anyway, so he goes there. Now, later on, the first boy who flicked the cheese to sit in class, he gets called the principal's office.

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 The principal goes, "What did you do? What did you do to him?" And the kid's like, "What are you talking about?"

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So, "Chima" had such a bad allergy. And not just to cheese. So this is what he had... this is what his allergies were.

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 He was allergic to wheat, gluten, all dairy products, eggs and nuts. He was also asthmatic and suffered from a topic eczema.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 It's just like really bad eczema on your face. I think it's a bad eczema. But anyway, so he had this whole list of things.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And the cheese hit him on the neck, and he goes underground to the Umbrella Underground Medical Facility.

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And within 10 minutes, he stops breathing, and within 10 days, he's dead. People are really stunned by this.

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Because there's been no cases of anyone ever dying from getting an allergen on their skin.

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 So nobody can figure out what's going on. So eventually, though, they're holding this inquest. That happened back in July 2017.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Right now, they're holding this inquest. They're bringing in all these experts. They're trying to really figure out what happened here.

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And the first day of the inquest was the big news story. People are like, "The headlines that you're seeing is Teen Schoolboy died after people threw cheese slice at him," inquests told.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And here's another one. "Expert calls depth of dairy allergic boy hit by cheese unprecedented." And it truly was unprecedented.

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 They said their people have gotten sick from having food they're allergic to put on their skin, but to actually die isn't very likely.

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 It's impossible, actually. It's never happened before, but it happened here.

83
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So at a certain point, the schools think, and maybe he ate something at the same time he got the cheese on him.

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Like, that's the only thing that could have killed him. Well, what happened, the newest update, it's not as click-baity,

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 because the original, you know how the news works, the first article comes out, everyone pays attention to it, and then no one pays attention to the follow-up stuff.

86
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 What do they think happened is this. The cheese hit him on, it's still tragic, the cheese hit him on the neck, and he began scratching because it was irritating his skin,

87
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 but because he had eczema, his skin was weaker, and he started scratching the eczema, which caused bleeding, which then actually made the cheese on his skin go into his bloodstream.

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Knock him out within 10 minutes from that. Super bizarre.

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And the kids are like, "Listen, we knew he was allergic to stuff, but I thought he was just allergic to bread."

90
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 The kid who threw it said, "Listen, man, I was throwing stuff. We throw stuff during lunchtime. I wasn't trying to bully him or anything like that."

91
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 He goes, "I heard that he was allergic to bread."

92
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 It was one time he sat down next to a kid eating a sandwich, and he asked the kid to move.

93
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And the kid who gave the hungry boy the cheese said, "I knew he was allergic to dairy, but I didn't know that cheese was a dairy product."

94
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I just thought it was yogurt and milk. And on that one, people are like, "Well, we kind of overheard you saying he was allergic to cheese."

95
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And he goes, "I didn't say that. I didn't know if the kid was allergic to cheese. I just knew he was allergic to dairy stuff."

96
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 What's interesting as well, though, is that the EpiPen, so he goes down to the 18th level of this medical facility,

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 the EpiPen that they had on file for him was a year out of date.

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So the school may be partially responsible, but really the experts are coming in and they're saying,

99
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 "This was super unprecedented. People reacted the way they reacted, but we don't really think anything was at fault."

100
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Technically, the kid who threw the cheese was at fault, but it wasn't out of maliciousness.

101
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 He was just playing around. He was just playing around.

102
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I always think it's weird that people have such common allergies.

103
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I know they say that peanut allergies, the reason why we have a rise in nut allergies is because we live in a more sanitized world.

104
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Everything is alcohol rubbed, like, you know, the, pssst, the, what's that stuff that you put on?

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Hand sanitizer. I never use it, so I don't know what it's called.

106
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Hand sanitizer, and when you're using this antibacterial cleaner and everything like that, when you, rich kids,

107
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 and I'm trying to get to the point, tends to be that kids, upper middle class kids, rich kids, are more likely to have a nut allergy

108
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 because they live in a cleaner environment.

109
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Poor kids tend to have less allergies like that, unless it's just genetic luck on the draw, because they're being exposed to this stuff all their life.

110
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I never wash my hands before I eat. Okay, I put an asterisk next to that.

111
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 I'll wash my hands before I eat if I'm doing something particularly disgusting before I eat,

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 but that's my disgusting, not your disgusting. If I'm preparing somebody else's food, of course, I'm washing my hands.

113
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But I will put it around the house, do a bunch of stuff, clean up, not just like on my computer, which my computer's quite disgusting,

114
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 but I'll like, be cleaning stuff up. I will work a full shift at a job, walk two miles home, playing around with my phone,

115
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 picking up rocks, throwing them at squirrels, then like, picking up the squirrels and like, nursing their wounds and like, petting them,

116
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 and then they bite me, and then they realize, I didn't mean to really throw the rock at them, and then we become buddies.

117
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Go home, eat a sandwich. Actually, not a sandwich, because I'm on keto, but I will go home, eat a hamburger.

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Don't think twice of it. And you may think, well, you're not touching the hamburger when you eat it, aha!

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I am when I'm taking the frozen meat out and through it. I don't even wash, I very, I wash my frying pan,

120
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 like, once every two days. Because I figure all of the meat that I'm cooking keeps getting more and more burnt,

121
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 so it's not like, I can't get anything from it. So throw a couple of steak-ums in there, cook it up. That's one meal.

122
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And then I'll throw in some more steak-ums, maybe like eight hours later.

123
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Nom nom nom, eat that. And then the next day, I'll continue eating steak-ums, and after two days of cooking meat in the same pan,

124
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 then I wash it. And I am the, I'm super healthy. I never get sick. I get sick, but I don't get sick enough that it, like, affects me.

125
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Like, I'll be like, oh, my stomach hurts. But I go about my day. The moral of the story is, don't be clean.

126
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Don't be clean. Actually, the moral of the story is don't throw cheese at people, but the moral of the overall lesson,

127
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 the life lesson is, the less clean you are, the stronger you are.

128
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I don't think Hercules got his hair cut, and that's what made him lose his strength. I think they finally made him wash his hair.

129
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And it's an allegory for being a dirty person. Okay, now let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

130
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Now, this story is a companion piece to what we talked about yesterday, and I know people don't listen to every episode,

131
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 so I'm going to go over it real quickly. There was a murder in the state of Pennsylvania. There was a couple named Barbara and Steve,

132
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 and they were both followers of this online personality host, radio host YouTuber named Sherry Schreiner,

133
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 who believes that the reptilian alien demonic overlords are being sent here by Lucifer to destroy our planet,

134
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 and she has special powers and she can teach you how to fight these interlopers, these alien demonic reptilian creatures.

135
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I used the term blue as brains out a couple times on yesterday's episode, and I was like, "That's pretty insensitive."

136
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Like, one of his family members made listen to this episode, and I was pretty insensitive, so...

137
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But anyway, she shot him now when editing that, I was like, just kind of shaking my head.

138
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 So, Sherry basically, in her mind, was right. Barbara was a soul-scalped reptilian who killed one of Sherry's followers.

139
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Like, Sherry says, "I tried warning them. I tried warning them."

140
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Sherry also says she remote-viewed the killing, and she told us the story where Barbara was watching Resident Evil,

141
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 which is based on a true story and so on and so forth.

142
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 You can go more detail with yesterday's episode, but that's kind of the overview of where we're coming from.

143
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 An alien reptilian demonic army is Waging War against humans.

144
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Sherry Shreiner is a general for the sight of good, and she pointed out someone was really a reptilian in disguise,

145
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 and that person ended up killing a man in cold blood.

146
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 So, you have to ask, who is Sherry Shreiner? Coincidence? Like, did she just happen to pick out the one wacko that she could tell out of all these people?

147
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 She could go, "That person's a wacko. That person's probably gonna murder someone."

148
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And she was right. Like, just lucky guess right? Or, does she know something we don't?

149
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Let's take a look at Sherry Shreiner. Now, Sherry Shreiner has a hole.

150
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And again, I want to say this is all due to an email I got from Gary. There'll be a, again, we got two more Sherry Shreiner episodes coming up.

151
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 So, I want to say thanks, Gary, for letting me know about this bizarre string of events.

152
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 So, Sherry Shreiner, let's describe her in her own words. This is how her website opens up.

153
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Servant, prophet, ambassador, daughter, and messenger of the Most High God.

154
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 "Just as my ancient grandfather, King David, stood against the giants in his day with no fear,

155
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 so will I stand against the giants in these last days with no fear. The Lord is my strength."

156
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 So, she believes, so basically God tells her stuff, which is, you know, you could say that's crazy or it's not.

157
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 But God tells her stuff, and one of the things he said was that she is the granddaughter of King David.

158
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So, let's look at her arsenal. She has a radio show. She has at least a dozen websites.

159
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 She has a YouTube channel, I think even more than one YouTube channel.

160
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 She has articles that she, I mean hundreds of videos on all sorts of craziness.

161
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 "Pulse Shifts," Obama's a reptile, Hillary's a reptile, Trump, it's weird. It seems like most of her stuff kind of fell off during the last year of Obama.

162
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 She has Trump mentions every once in a while, but most of it's really focused on Hillary and Al Gore. When was he ever in threat?

163
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Al Gore and Obama and all these reptile stuff and pulse switches and all this like old school conspiracy stuff.

164
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Nobody talks about the pulse switch anymore, that's so like 2012. But anyways, her websites are littered with it.

165
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And you're thinking, "Okay, great Jason, you found a weirdo website. It's hilarious because it's all like GIFs.

166
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It's all like these. There's just a picture of Al Gore and then it shifts to a picture of a fat alien."

167
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And I was like, "I missed this internet. I missed this style of internet."

168
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 But anyways, you're thinking, "Great, you just found some wackadoo online."

169
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 She has a Patreon and she has eight patrons, which you think that's nothing. That's probably her and like her mom and her dad and brother and stuff like that.

170
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And I agree. When I saw that, I was like, "Eight patrons, like she's definitely like small time."

171
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 If only eight people are paying her, we don't know how much. She has that hidden.

172
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 But you can assume anywhere from eight dollars to eight hundred dollars a month.

173
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 So she did a GoFundMe and raised $154,000.

174
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 So she has a sizable presence. Looking at those donations, they're mostly small donations.

175
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 $10 here, $50 here, maybe $100 here. $154,000.

176
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 So she's not just some weirdo with the laptop. That's me. That's me.

177
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 That's when you have to sit and think that this is definitely something that's underground and viable.

178
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 The message that she's saying is resonating with people. So why?

179
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Now, there's two ways to dissect that, obviously. But first, let's look at why her.

180
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 When I was reading about this, I thought, "This is why this deserves its own segment."

181
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Because we finally kind of get to look into the mind in their own words of somebody who thinks like this.

182
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Completely unfettered. We actually get to see and we can kind of look at a pattern.

183
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 We're going to do a little psychoanalysis here.

184
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 But before I say that, the reason why Meg Ryan is so weird looking now is because a reptile is taking over her body.

185
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 So, I mean, again, she has a picture of Meg Ryan when she was like 25.

186
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And then she has a picture of Meg Ryan after years of plastic surgery and she's like, "Look, proof. There's a reptile."

187
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I mean, it's like just nonsense. Nonsense stuff.

188
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Sherry Shreiner in her own words. So, paraphrased, but the same thing.

189
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Sherry Shreiner has her "about me" segment. And she says, when she was a little kid,

190
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 she would see monsters and demons at the foot of her bed. Terrified her.

191
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 It would terrify anyone, especially a child. She couldn't figure it out why these monsters were all around her in the dark.

192
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 She started seeing a taller one at the foot of her bed at night.

193
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 This one seemed darker and more powerful.

194
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And she came to learn that this tall, dark figure at the end of her bed was one of Satan's generals.

195
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Sherry Shreiner was such a threat to the future of Lucifer's plans that he sent one of his top dogs to spiritually break down this little girl.

196
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And that was when she realized that she was going to have a great role to play in the upcoming war between good and evil.

197
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Here's a quote.

198
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 "From the time I was born, Lucifer knew I had a prophetic..."

199
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 God, that's how you pronounce that.

200
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 "Prophesy thing. Calling on my life. And that as an adult, I would grow up to become one of his arch enemies.

201
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I would learn as an adult how to expose, attack, and tear down his strongholds that he would create to control and destroy mankind.

202
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 To prevent this from happening, he had assigned one of his top ranking generals to kill me.

203
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Lucifer is on a mission to control the world as the Antichrist.

204
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 I am on a mission to make it as miserable as possible for him.

205
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 I despise him."

206
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Now, I think that kind of goes with that. I don't think most people are fans of Lucifer.

207
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Some Luciferians, but most people despise him.

208
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Anyways, thanks for those strong words there, Sherry.

209
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 So she's growing up, she has this.

210
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Now, at the age of 12, she says, "I read the whole Bible. I read the whole Bible.

211
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And I just keep reading it over and over and over again.

212
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 I was fascinated by the end times. More than anything, more than any of the Bible's stories.

213
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 It was this book of Revelation that really got my gears going."

214
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 That's my words, not hers. But here are her words.

215
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 "From the first time I had heard about the second coming of Jesus Christ, I was hooked.

216
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 That is all I cared to hear about. That is all I wanted to hear about.

217
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Nothing else about religion interested me as much.

218
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 I have seen enough and experienced enough of it daily to know religion itself is hypocritical."

219
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 So she goes into this thing where she's not a fan of organized religion.

220
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 She's not a fan of the church, but she's obsessed with the Bible.

221
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Now, that is... I've met a lot of people like that.

222
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 But when you devote your whole life to leading this God's army,

223
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 you might want to be a little more open to the fact that these more learned individuals in these things

224
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 know more that you can gain from. But she kind of believes that all the man's church is corrupted

225
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 by the alien reptilian demons and stuff like that.

226
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So there's a thing too where the book of Revelation is very evocative.

227
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 The Bible itself is quite boring, but the book of Revelation is basically a science fiction ending.

228
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 It would be if Anne of Green Gables ended with an alien invasion.

229
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Like, the last chapter was just aliens. But the thing is, is that to understand the book of Revelation,

230
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 you have to understand the rest of the Bible.

231
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 There are people who just studied the book of Revelation. I also used to be obsessed with the book of Revelation,

232
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 so I'm kind of speaking from this point of view.

233
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And my father, who was a minister, said, "Yeah, it's interesting and all that,

234
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 but the illusions and the imagery and things like that in the book of Revelation,

235
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 really, you have to know the rest of the Bible for it to fall into place."

236
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 You can read it as an apocalyptic text as a sci-fi novel,

237
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 but it works better as a whole. That's why it is a chapter in a Bible.

238
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 It's a book of the Bible rather than its own book.

239
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And also, there's debate who wrote it and whether or not it should even be in the Bible,

240
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 but that's another topic.

241
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 But you just can't keep reading the book of Revelation over and over again and have a revelation of your own.

242
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 You have to study the Bible and then you go, "Oh, this is what this part means,

243
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 because this is mentioned in Ezekiel or whatever."

244
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 But let's get on to the interesting stuff.

245
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Okay, so, wackadoo nonsense.

246
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 This woman, she's a young girl, she sees a bunch of monsters and demons and stuff at her house.

247
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 She can't figure it out. She begins reading the Bible, she begins becoming obsessed with the book of Revelation.

248
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 She begins completely disregarding all other worldly religious stuff.

249
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 She doesn't want to focus on it. She doesn't believe in the church. She doesn't believe in organized religion.

250
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 She believes that the reason why she's so connected to the book of Revelation is because she's basically a part of it,

251
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 that these demons have been sent to stop her because she is part of the prophecy of a book

252
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 written thousands of years ago that she's obsessed with.

253
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 It's the same thing as if someone who reads Harry Potter and then writes themselves into Harry Potter fan fiction,

254
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 except she's doing this and thinks it's real and is dedicated her life to making this fan fiction true.

255
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 But, and this is what I thought was fascinating.

256
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 This is what I thought was so fascinating.

257
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Sherri Schreiner's young girl being tormented by ghosts and demons.

258
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Sherri Schreiner discovers the book of Revelation, the Bible, she's reading it about age 12.

259
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 She said she was always praying to God, but she really gets into the Bible when she was 12.

260
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 She gets in a book of Revelation. She goes to college.

261
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 She goes to college.

262
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 She goes to college and she says, "I don't know if the demons left me alone when I went to college,

263
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 or if I was just too busy to notice them."

264
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 So she says she just, they were either there or she didn't notice them.

265
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 She said that she would work so hard she would go home and just kind of pass out.

266
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 She didn't have time to think about this war.

267
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 She always wanted to be a journalist. That's what her career path was going to be.

268
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 She ends up getting a job at the campus radio station.

269
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 That ends up turning to making her the director of the campus radio station.

270
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 She gets a job at a real radio station and at the same time interns at a rival radio station under a fake name.

271
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 She wants as much experience as possible.

272
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 She ends up transferring colleges, becoming the director of their radio station as well.

273
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 She really needs to get, just loves it. She gets her degree in journalism, in criminal science, and polysine.

274
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 She goes to Washington D.C.

275
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Her goal is to work for CNN. She wants to be a political correspondent.

276
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 She goes there and she talks to the Washington Bureau and they say, "You don't have enough experience to work with us.

277
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 You have to go here." Then she goes somewhere else and they'd be like,

278
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 "Well, I think you'd be better suited for the Washington Bureau."

279
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 She's going in these circles and eventually she gets frustrated.

280
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 She quits. She moves back to Ohio where she's from.

281
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 She gets married and while she's an unemployed housewife, low and behold, the demons show back up.

282
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And it was from then that she dedicated her life to destroying the Army.

283
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 This is... I read that and I was like, I know exactly what this is.

284
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Growing up, she was powerless and had no direction.

285
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And her mind created this mythology where she was important to the world.

286
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 But when she went to college, she was really important.

287
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 People counted on her for decisions. She was doing things that were affecting people.

288
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Every single day she was moving towards a goal.

289
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 She knew what she wanted to be. She knew what she had to do to get it.

290
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And she fought her way up that ladder and got it.

291
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 But when she got to a point where she got stymied,

292
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 where she got to a point where she saw her career and it was just out of reach

293
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 and she couldn't reach it and she gave up and once again became basically a little girl

294
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 with no direction or importance, she was just an unemployed housewife

295
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 in the middle of Ohio. All of her dreams were over.

296
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Everything she imagined for herself throughout college were gone.

297
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 In the silence of normalcy, the mythology began again.

298
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 It's been like this now for decades.

299
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 She couldn't handle being normal. So she's created this entire mythology.

300
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Fascinating insight on someone like this.

301
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Being normal is hard.

302
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Being a noticed and visible outside of your social circle is very painful for a lot of people.

303
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Some people are totally fine with it. I think most people are totally fine with it,

304
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 but there's a good chunk of people that they need something more.

305
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 They need direction. They need a myth about them.

306
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Most people though, go, "I really wish I was a lead guitarist for a band,

307
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 but I'm 44, I have three kids." Just dream.

308
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Maybe they'll pick up a guitar and play with their buddies on the weekend.

309
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Maybe they'll just play in the garage by themselves.

310
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 They'll kind of hold it onto that. And that's totally fine.

311
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 That's kind of just like a hobby thing.

312
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 And you think, "I wonder what could have been if I'd kept going with it."

313
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 That's not really what we're talking about here.

314
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 We're talking about somebody who, by their own admission, was King David's granddaughter,

315
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 who was a major player in the end of the world.

316
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 But once she got busy, all of that stuff disappeared.

317
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Her entire length of college, up until the point where she moves back to Ohio,

318
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 she is not plagued by demons, which really shows that they don't plague her at all.

319
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Because if they really wanted to take her out, they would take her out when she was most stressed.

320
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Working multiple jobs and trying to get school done and during finals.

321
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 That's when the Archdemon of Lucifer, Balbarath, would show up in your dorm room

322
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 and start knocking stuff over, deleting files from your computer,

323
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 pooping on your cat.

324
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 That's if any of this was real, that's when it would attack you when you were the most stressed.

325
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Now when you're sitting silently at home, and the only thing to keep you company is the baby monitor

326
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 so you can hear your baby softly snore in the other room.

327
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 But in that moment where she realizes, "I am normal again,

328
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 and I don't know what's coming next in my life,"

329
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 she creates this myth.

330
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 And I don't know if it's sad, but I don't know if it's weird.

331
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Other people are falling for this myth as well.

332
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Other people just like her, who have no direction.

333
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Someone who's working towards something, or someone who is very content with their life,

334
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 who's like, "I have everything that I want, and the stuff I don't have, I don't need."

335
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 They don't fall for this stuff.

336
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 They say generally people who fall for cults are too smart to fall for cults,

337
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 and that's true because you can have someone who's very smart, but empty.

338
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 People who have fulfilling lives, which is very, trust me, is very hard to tell.

339
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 You'll meet people, and they seem like they have it all,

340
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 and then you talk to them for a while, and you realize that there's like a chunk missing from them.

341
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 But if someone tells you the line that, "Listen, it's you and me,"

342
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 there's a war coming, and they don't see it. No one sees it, but I see it, and I know you see it.

343
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And together we can change history.

344
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Are you with me?

345
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 That message resonates with people who have a hole inside of them.

346
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 It's very, very easy to exploit.

347
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Very easy to exploit.

348
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I remember long before I did the podcast I was talking to Lana, and I said,

349
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 "You know what? I was thinking I might become a cult leader," and she goes, "Please don't. Please don't."

350
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Because once you realize how people tick, it's super easy to manipulate them, and I'm really good at that.

351
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 She's like, "Please don't," because she could almost, in a flash, see the disaster that would unfold.

352
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Sherry Shrinor's not an outlier either.

353
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 She's just one of thousands, really millions of people out there who manipulate others.

354
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 She does it in a weirdo alien way, and we're going to talk about some of her more bizarre beliefs tomorrow,

355
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 that littering can actually defeat aliens, that enough litter made of a special component can destroy UFOs.

356
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 We'll talk about that tomorrow.

357
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 But we live in a world where almost everyone has a hole inside of them. That's not a sexual joke.

358
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 But what's interesting about this little biography of Sherry Shrinor is that it makes you realize,

359
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 in my view, that even the leaders of these kooky groups are also empty, or also missing something.

360
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 They need that mythology to be true as much as they need you to believe that mythology to be true.

361
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 The only difference between Sherry Shrinor and anyone who follows her cult is she started the website first.

362
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 She was the first one to put these beliefs down. But mentally, spiritually, she's just the same as every other member of one of these groups.

363
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And it's a warning to all of us to make sure that we don't let ourselves get to that point,

364
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 where we become so empty and so unfulfilled with our lives that we'll look for anything to give us meaning.
