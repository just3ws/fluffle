1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
 If someone promised you a way to end all of your current money problems, but your soul

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,360
 would belong to them in the next life, would you do it?

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,460
 And then we travel to Australia to take a look at the story of a young schoolteacher

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,880
 who was out for a nature walk one day.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,520
 While out enjoying the sights and sounds of this beautiful world we live in, she sees

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,200
 a small clay statue wedged into the branches of a tree.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,760
 But after examining the statue, she continues her walk along the trail and finds something

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,480
 far more hideous.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:55,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,440
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,680
 New Transformers movies coming out.

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,280
 I know that's a warning for some of you.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
 You're like no, no, not again.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,240
 Oh man, I love those movies.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,740
 Beast Master People.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,240
 I don't know what it's called yet, but it looks pretty dope.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,520
 I don't know why I'm talking about it at the beginning of a paranormal podcast.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,440
 But someone who's always able to decipher my lunacy walking into Dead Rabbit Command

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,640
 right now is one of our longtime Patreon supporters and a supporter during the Thanksgiving

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,960
 livestream episode.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,440
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for Rudy Jazz.

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
 Woohoo!

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,400
 Yeah, come on in Rudy Jazz.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,520
 Walking on in to Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,960
 Rudy Jazz, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Rudy also has 100% attendance for our

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,480
 Sunday livestream episodes.

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,200
 I record Monday's episode live for the Patreons on the Patreon Discord.

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
 That's a lot of fun.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,560
 If you guys haven't joined us yet, you can hear me.

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,800
 You can hear all the mistakes I edit out.

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,480
 I edit out all the bad jokes, but none of the mispronunciations.

35
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,480
 Awfully enough, Rudy Jazz, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
 Durgible.

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,800
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:17,000
 Fly us all the way out to the house of a young man.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,920
 This guy posted this story online recently.

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,680
 We don't have his real name.

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
 He's remaining anonymous.

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
 We're gonna go ahead and call him Terry.

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
 Terry posted this story.

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,840
 He goes, "Listen, I'm in a bit of a pickle.

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,880
 That's kind of underselling it.

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,520
 He's going through some money trouble."

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,040
 Something that we all face at one time or another.

48
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,480
 Terry goes, "Things just are not good.

49
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,960
 Everything is stagnated in my life.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,120
 I'm on disability, so I have a fixed income.

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,040
 My family is in need.

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,560
 And I'm not able to provide for them.

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,360
 And it's just getting me down.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,600
 I don't know what to do."

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:04,160
 And when my wife took my hand in marriage, I assumed, I hoped, that we would have a

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,280
 bright future, but I'm looking around at everything and my wife deserves better, my family deserves

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,640
 better.

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,720
 I need money to get out of this situation.

59
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,480
 And he says, "I started working with a witch."

60
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,560
 We put this witch in quotation marks.

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,200
 I started working with a witch.

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,520
 So we don't know, is this like a fortune teller?

63
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,840
 Is this someone who actually claims to have magical powers?

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,360
 Or is it like a shaman type person?

65
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,120
 This is a fairly recent story.

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,200
 I found it on the X board.

67
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,000
 So we're not like in old timey France.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,400
 But he said he'd been working with a witch to get money.

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
 Not working for a witch to get money.

70
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,480
 He's like, "Sweep up my shop and watch out, that broom's magical."

71
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,640
 He's been working with this witch to see if she can cast any spells, work any charms

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,920
 for him to be able to get rich.

73
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,680
 And he goes, "I was told..."

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,000
 And he seems to be kind of dismissive of the whole thing.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,120
 Like again, putting a witch in the quotation marks, it seems like he's not a huge believer

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
 in all of this.

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,640
 But you know, when you're desperate, you'll do anything.

78
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,440
 And do things you may think are impossible.

79
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,280
 He says he started working with this witch and the witch told him, "Okay, so here's the

80
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,880
 deal.

81
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,520
 You are going to come into a lot of money very, very soon."

82
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,920
 That's just going to happen.

83
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,340
 But there's strings that come along with that money.

84
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,840
 And you'll be given a choice when this money arrives.

85
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,520
 So it's not like a raise on his disability checks, it's not anything like that.

86
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,120
 She says, "You're going to come into a lot of money and you're going to have a choice.

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,960
 If you choose to reject the money, everything will be the way it is right now."

88
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,360
 Which sounds pretty sucky, honestly.

89
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,160
 But this money will be provided for you.

90
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:10,320
 And if you accept this money in your next life, you will become a vampire.

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
 Whatever, right?

92
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,560
 You're sitting here at this witch's, first off, you're talking about a witch.

93
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,440
 Secondly, she's saying if you take the money, you'll become a vampire and you may go, and

94
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,960
 Terry might have thought this as well, vampires even exist?

95
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,440
 Does reincarnation even exist?

96
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,200
 Like that sounds like a sweet deal because if I don't believe in vampires and I don't

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,640
 believe in reincarnation, if I just believe that this is the only life I have and I'm

98
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,600
 offered a bunch of money, of course I'll take it because I don't believe in those other

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
 two things.

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,920
 But I think, whether or not you believe in those things, I think your belief would be

101
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,120
 tested by what happens next.

102
00:05:48,120 --> 00:06:01,320
 On October 9th, 2022, Terry finds out that he is going to receive millions of dollars.

103
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,400
 Far beyond what he was even thinking to ask for, millions of dollars.

104
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,760
 And he goes, "I'm not going to tell you how I got it or where it's coming from."

105
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,120
 But he goes, "Picture the lottery."

106
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,640
 We're talking like that level of money and that level of luck.

107
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,720
 Like if you had a rich relative and he's like, "Oh man, I need more money.

108
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,960
 I can't wait until Uncle Milford dies.

109
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,040
 He has millions of dollars and I was his favorite nephew."

110
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,360
 It wasn't that.

111
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:39,400
 He goes, "The chances of me coming across this money this way was so laughably small.

112
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:47,920
 The only way I could have come across this amount of money in this way was through magic."

113
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,720
 I mean, when you do look at lottery odds, they are just so infinitesimally small.

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,040
 But somebody has to win.

115
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,160
 And that's really the issue that Terry is going through.

116
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 He goes, "Listen, I don't know if I want to accept this money because let's be logical

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,880
 about this.

118
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,160
 Somebody has to win the lottery if it was actually the lottery."

119
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,680
 But that's kind of what he compared it to.

120
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,400
 Somebody has to get this money somehow.

121
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,200
 And it could have just been a total coincidence that I was talking to this witch and she said

122
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,680
 that I was going to come into a lot of money, but if I accepted it, I was going to have to

123
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,760
 become a vampire in my next life.

124
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,440
 It could just be a coincidence.

125
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:44,760
 But if it's not, and I accept this money, and it solves all of my problems in front of me

126
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:54,400
 right now, if the witch is right, when I die, what will I become?

127
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,960
 The rest of the conversation, that was the only time that he really posted that I could

128
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,480
 tell, export its anonymous so you don't know who's posting saying what.

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,680
 Most of the conversation then revolved around whether or not vampires were real.

130
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,280
 Then he had some energy vampires show up, which did a great job seconding the energy

131
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,280
 out of me because of how boring the post was.

132
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:23,920
 Energy vampires, I've met a lot of people who claim to be energy vampires.

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,360
 I believe, it's funny because putting my cards on the table, let's put all the cards

134
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 on the table.

135
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,720
 Vampires are really cool, right?

136
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,360
 Huge fan, a Buffy angel, used to play that game Vampire the Masquerade, not the video

137
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,400
 game, he used to do the live action role playing thing back in college.

138
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,200
 I love vampires, I think they're dope, I think it's awesome.

139
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,440
 But I guess I believe in a sense that energy vampires do exist, I don't think they'd be

140
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,480
 posting on the export or really anywhere.

141
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,800
 But maybe that's just because I figured they're fighting Buffy somewhere.

142
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,320
 I do believe that you could have an energy vampire, I believe that there's a lot of

143
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:15,000
 paranormal entities that can feed off human energy as well, which we would call vampiric.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,480
 So I'm not against the idea of vampires, and even the idea of reincarnation, that's something

145
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,800
 that's always, I like the idea of reincarnation.

146
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,360
 I think it's, I like Earth, right?

147
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,360
 The idea of going up to some unknowable paradise for the rest of eternity, that is scarier

148
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:44,320
 to me than coming back as a beaver, building dams all day long.

149
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,840
 Do I believe in reincarnation?

150
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,560
 I don't know, I would like to.

151
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,320
 And that'd be the same thing I would say about vampires, like traditional vampires, do I

152
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
 believe in them?

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,520
 I would like to, I would like them to exist.

154
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,520
 And then I'd sleep at night with my collar pulled down, I'm like, listat to come and

155
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,680
 feed off me.

156
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,040
 It's such an interesting thing, now it could totally be made up, right?

157
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,200
 It could totally be a lark.

158
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:21,720
 But I find it so interesting because if it's not, this dude is faced with a huge dilemma.

159
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,280
 Millions of dollars, millions of dollars, he can finally "fix" all of his problems.

160
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,040
 So at least all of his money related problems.

161
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,400
 We did a whole episode about money, I think money is its own entity.

162
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:44,280
 I did an episode, there was a Greek god called Monetta that I believe that we pray to whenever

163
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,240
 we're talking about, I need more money, I want more money, I don't have enough money,

164
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,680
 it's actually these prayers to this long hidden god.

165
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,200
 So I'm not a big fan of the pursuit of money, but I also know that we live in a world where

166
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,680
 money is needed.

167
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,280
 Especially when you have a family, and I get where this guy's coming from.

168
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,400
 Put that episode in the show notes, but I try personally not to use words like "I'm broke"

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:22,640
 because you're not broke, that's a bad term for it, it makes it sound like there's something

170
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,360
 incurable about you.

171
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,880
 I need more money, I want more money.

172
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,280
 I try not to use terminology like that, I don't have enough money.

173
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,680
 But anyways, you do need money to function in society.

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,560
 We don't live in a Star Trek utopia yet, I'm sure someday we will.

175
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
 But nowadays you need money.

176
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,040
 There is a family who wants to not just provide the base level for them, he wants them to

177
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
 have a better life.

178
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
 I totally get it.

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,320
 But he's now faced with a question, does he take this money?

180
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,360
 Now I know a lot of you would go "Yeah dude, take the money, vampires don't exist, reincarnation

181
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,000
 isn't real, it's just a coincidence."

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,480
 Or maybe the witch did cast some sort of spell to get you the money, I believe in witches,

183
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,400
 but I don't believe in vampires reincarnation, take the money.

184
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,520
 It's funny though because it's such a big gamble, isn't it?

185
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,520
 Imagine let's twist the words right, maybe you don't believe in vampires or reincarnation,

186
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:28,640
 let's say the witch said "You'll be getting millions of dollars soon, but if you accept

187
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,400
 it, you'll sell your soul to the devil.

188
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 In the afterlife you will be trapped in hell for eternity."

189
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,800
 That would make even people who don't believe in vampires or reincarnation, that would kind

190
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,560
 of make you go "Oh, okay.

191
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,400
 So now we're on something that I do believe in, the afterlife, a paradise and a punishment.

192
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,360
 Would you take the money?"

193
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,200
 Because at the end of the day you have to look at it and go "This could be a coincidence

194
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,600
 and this could solve all of my money problems.

195
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,200
 I would be a fool to not take that money.

196
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,400
 I have to take that money, of course.

197
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:10,240
 It's childish to think that a witch gave me this, it was just a coincidence."

198
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,320
 The thing is, is I imagine that he would spend the rest of his life.

199
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
 Terry will most likely accept the money.

200
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,960
 I think any of us would accept the money.

201
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,920
 I don't think most of us would go to a witch asking for it in the first place because of

202
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,240
 situations like this, right?

203
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
 If you say I've prayed to God a million times for things to get better, today I'm going to

204
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,080
 pray to the Dark Lord Lucifer and see if he has something to help me with.

205
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,240
 And then that's when the miracle happens.

206
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,080
 You're in trouble now, right?

207
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,080
 You've now, again, the miracle could have been coming no matter what.

208
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,320
 It could have just been coincidence.

209
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,480
 But Terry's going to spend the rest of his life if he accepts this money and I'm sure

210
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
 he will.

211
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,600
 Because how could you not, right?

212
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:06,440
 Terry's going to spend the rest of his life fearing death more than any of us do because

213
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,760
 he will, in the back of his mind no matter what he's doing, believe that he's going to

214
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,320
 become a vampire in the next life.

215
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,680
 And you go, "Jason, but vampires don't exist.

216
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,120
 Reincarnation isn't real.

217
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,800
 He'll be fine.

218
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:33,400
 But at the end of the day, if you were Terry, could you ever be 100% sure?"

219
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,080
 And if it was just turning into some sort of emotional energy vampire, sure.

220
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,240
 I can do that.

221
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,120
 That's fine.

222
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:50,120
 He would always wonder, he would always wonder if that deal is on the table.

223
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
 It's an interesting story.

224
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,640
 I found it absolutely fascinating.

225
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,160
 It was sad to see that most of the exporter were just calling him out saying he was making

226
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
 it up.

227
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
 Do vampires exist?

228
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
 Stuff like that.

229
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,640
 That's the core question.

230
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,320
 What would you do if you really sat down to think about it?

231
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
 What would you do?

232
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,920
 And I would be surprised if anyone would leave the money on the table.

233
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,120
 But again, it may be because you don't believe in these things, but if it wasn't something

234
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,000
 you did believe in, if you take this money, you're selling your soul to the devil, if

235
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,040
 you take this money, or you know what's even worse is what if the witch said something like,

236
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,240
 "You're going to come into a lot of money someday, but somebody very close to you, they're

237
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,760
 going to die prematurely."

238
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,600
 And at the time you may go like, "Whatever, I don't really believe in this."

239
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,120
 I'm putting you witch in aircodes.

240
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,720
 I don't really believe in any of this.

241
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,280
 And then you win the lottery.

242
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,080
 And if you accept that money, someone close to you is going to die prematurely.

243
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:53,840
 All of these things, he's unfortunately created this situation that it may be the witch's

244
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,200
 power that led him to this money, or it may have been a coincidence, but whatever it is,

245
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,240
 he has created the situation where they are intrinsically tied together, and he'll never

246
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,160
 be able to separate them.

247
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,840
 But he really, really needs that money.

248
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,280
 Rudy Jazz, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbonercopter where we are leaving

249
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,680
 behind this man on the verge of a huge decision.

250
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,520
 You're like, "Jason, it's not that big of a decision.

251
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
 Just take the money.

252
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
 Vampires don't exist."

253
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
 What else?

254
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,040
 Rudy, go ahead and fire up the Carbonercopter where we're leaving behind this giant, giant

255
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:38,840
 dude, Flias, all the way out to Australia.

256
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,120
 I found this story posted online.

257
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:48,680
 There was a really cool write-up by a person who goes by the name Stiosphere, Stiocephar.

258
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,240
 I'd never heard of this story before.

259
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,600
 I read constantly.

260
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,600
 I spend hours a day just reading online posts to find stuff for the show.

261
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,720
 I say hours a day.

262
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,600
 It's just two hours a day.

263
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,560
 I'm not like a wizard sitting in the library.

264
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,040
 I'd love to, though.

265
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,920
 I'd love to just read eight hours a day pulling stuff up.

266
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,600
 Who knows what we would find at that point.

267
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,160
 But anyways, Stiosphere, I've never heard of this story.

268
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,800
 Thank you so much for doing a little write-up on this and sent me off on a really cool...

269
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,920
 And decided their sources.

270
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
 I really enjoyed that.

271
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
 It's super important.

272
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,960
 More people need to do that, so thank you.

273
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,360
 I had fun looking into this.

274
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,000
 This is weird.

275
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,560
 This is a weird one.

276
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,760
 The year is 1975.

277
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:43,880
 We're in Victoria, Australia, which is about 100 miles southwest of Melbourne.

278
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,440
 This place is pretty remote.

279
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,000
 Victoria, Australia seems to be pretty remote.

280
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,560
 Victoria, Australia has a permanent population of four.

281
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
 Not 4,000.

282
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,360
 I didn't leave out a couple zeros there.

283
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,240
 Four people are the permanent residents of this area.

284
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
 At least it was back then.

285
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,160
 I mean, it could be a sea of condos by now, but you would have campers come out there.

286
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,960
 It seemed to be a pretty beautiful place.

287
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,400
 The kangaroo cage matches are off the hook.

288
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
 There was a river in the area.

289
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,920
 You'd have a bunch of hippies with their tents set up.

290
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,520
 They weren't the permanent four people.

291
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,360
 Those were people who actually had houses.

292
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
 It's remote.

293
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,280
 It seems to be a fairly remote area.

294
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:35,840
 Well, in 1975, near the Kennett River, there is a road called Dean's Marsh Road.

295
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,600
 Out in this area back in 1975, there was a school teacher just walking out in the wilderness,

296
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,200
 nature walk.

297
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:51,320
 And while she's on her travels, she sees a curious object wedged into the branches of

298
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
 a tree.

299
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,480
 Like the tree kind of forked out into two main parts of their branches and wedged into

300
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:08,160
 that was a 14-inch tall clay statue.

301
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
 The school teacher walks up.

302
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
 We'll call her Betty.

303
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,320
 She didn't give her name.

304
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,120
 Betty reaches out and she grabs this clay statue and she's looking at it.

305
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,880
 It's this little tiny woman.

306
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
 Statue of a tiny woman.

307
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,120
 Well, it's not the statue of a tiny woman.

308
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,240
 It's a tiny statue of a woman.

309
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,520
 She's looking at it and the statue's left arm is missing.

310
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,840
 A curio to say the least, right?

311
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,640
 You have this little tiny statue.

312
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
 It's clay.

313
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,960
 It's not made of the most durable material.

314
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,840
 I mean, I guess they used to build houses out of it, but it's a clay statue with a broken

315
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,760
 left arm.

316
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
 She wedges it back into the tree.

317
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,680
 Something will come back for her.

318
00:19:51,680 --> 00:20:00,240
 She continues on her journey, but she doesn't get far.

319
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:11,440
 She doesn't get far because she sees nearby on the shores of the Kennet River a dead body.

320
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,520
 Who knows how she called the police, right?

321
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,880
 She's in the middle of nowhere.

322
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,040
 Cell phones don't exist.

323
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,240
 Maybe she had some little tattooed piece of skin on her arm that linked up to the local

324
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
 constable.

325
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,600
 She must have at some point walked back to her car and notified the police because the

326
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,640
 police show up out there and they see where the school teacher directs them to go, the

327
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,840
 nude body of a dead woman on the shore of this river.

328
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,400
 The police go up.

329
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:54,080
 They take a look and her left arm is amputated.

330
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,000
 The school teacher had also told the police about the clay statue.

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,880
 The police have this clay statue of a woman with no left arm.

332
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,640
 Now they have very close to the location of this statue.

333
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,040
 It's in the middle of nowhere.

334
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,640
 You have a statue with no left arm and now you have the dead body of a woman with no

335
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
 left arm.

336
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:23,480
 They take the body back to the corner.

337
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,920
 Do an autopsy.

338
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,160
 What happened here?

339
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 The body had no idea.

340
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,320
 They had no idea who this woman was.

341
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,880
 The corner goes, well, she seems to be around 26 years old.

342
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,600
 She also did not die from drowning.

343
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
 So it doesn't seem like this was some sort of accident that happened.

344
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,000
 She had fallen into the water and skinny dipping or something like that.

345
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,320
 But I don't know how she died.

346
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:56,800
 I can rule out drowning, but other than that, I can't give you any idea of how she died.

347
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,640
 The police go, okay, well, did we tell you about the spooky statue?

348
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,840
 Did we tell you about the spooky statue that we found nearby?

349
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,160
 He was missing its left arm and her left arm has been amputated.

350
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,960
 The doctor goes, well, yeah, I didn't know about the spooky statue, thanks.

351
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,800
 I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.

352
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,160
 But her arm wasn't amputated recently.

353
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,040
 I can tell you that much.

354
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,520
 Her arm has been gone for several years.

355
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,560
 In fact, I would say that it's been amputated maybe as far back as when she was four years

356
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
 old.

357
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,040
 So I can't tell you exactly when her arm was removed, but it definitely wasn't a recent

358
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
 event.

359
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,320
 It's been gone for quite a while.

360
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,160
 But other than that, I don't have much information to tell you.

361
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,680
 Well, I should stop there.

362
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,400
 That's all the information the police have revealed, at least.

363
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:59,560
 I mean, the coroner may have found other stuff that they wanted to keep quiet.

364
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,360
 But there were stuff the police didn't want to keep quiet.

365
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,720
 They wanted to know the identity of this woman.

366
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,640
 And it actually became a new story in Australia where there were photographs of the statue

367
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,040
 and a police sketch of the woman.

368
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:20,600
 And knowing that her arm had been amputated for quite a long time, they began to put out

369
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,040
 into the community, does anyone know of a young woman who's missing, who didn't have

370
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
 an arm?

371
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,360
 Didn't have a left arm.

372
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,480
 Now, her arm was amputated about seven inches below the elbow.

373
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,000
 Why?

374
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,500
 Nobody knows.

375
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,600
 But they started putting that out.

376
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,080
 I mean, how many young women are out there missing a left arm that was cut off below the

377
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
 elbow?

378
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,480
 I mean, there can't be a lot of them.

379
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,000
 There's only four people in total living in this area.

380
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,360
 Does anyone know who the girl is?

381
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:04,320
 Maybe that can help us find out how she died or who killed her.

382
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:13,040
 And at this point, you started seeing stories in the media that she may have been killed

383
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,440
 as some sort of human sacrifice.

384
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,920
 Some sort of witchcraft ritual was the term that was used in these articles.

385
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,680
 And the place are based...

386
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
 This is in 1975.

387
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,320
 I know a lot of people like to think that the Satanic Panic took place in the 80s.

388
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,160
 It's much longer and much more...

389
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
 There was more evidence to the Satanic.

390
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,600
 I'm not saying all of it was real, but some of it was.

391
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,560
 They tried to always go, "Oh, people were just crazy back then.

392
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,880
 There's some weird stuff going on."

393
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,440
 And they always just try to blow it off as a moral panic.

394
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:03,360
 There were crimes being connected to dark groups, shadowy cults, Luciferian orders.

395
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,000
 Some of those crimes were actually legit.

396
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,160
 And the police in 1975, they say, "We know that there are stories of ritual murders in

397
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,360
 other countries, so we're not totally blowing it off here.

398
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:27,120
 It's possible that this, in some way, involved witchcraft."

399
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,280
 And what made them think that was the statue?

400
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:37,480
 What are the chances of those two things being near each other?

401
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,720
 So the police go out to the hippie encampment and they begin questioning people there if

402
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
 they had seen anything.

403
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
 They're like, "Are you Saint Worshipper?"

404
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,400
 They're like, "No, I believe in peace, love, and harmony."

405
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,040
 They're like, "Okay."

406
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,800
 They question the hippies and they're no help.

407
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:59,080
 They don't have any information that the police can use that bring them any closer to finding

408
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,880
 out who this woman is or how she died.

409
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,800
 And to this day, we still don't know.

410
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,960
 This case is 47 years old.

411
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,840
 We don't have a name.

412
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,760
 We don't have a cause of death.

413
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,960
 We don't know who may have caused that death.

414
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,240
 And we don't know the relationship between her and the statue.

415
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,480
 It's an unsolved mystery.

416
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,920
 It's interesting because have the statue not been located?

417
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,520
 Had it not been found or wasn't there in the first place, it would have seemed like a tragic

418
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,920
 accident or possibly a murder, right?

419
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,280
 The coroner couldn't rule anything out but drowning.

420
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,160
 I guess he could probably also go, "Well, she wasn't decapitated.

421
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,120
 She wasn't shot in the face with a shotgun."

422
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,920
 There's a lot of stuff I can rule out.

423
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,520
 She wasn't attacked by a squid, but he couldn't determine the cause of death.

424
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,280
 He just knew that drowning definitely wasn't it.

425
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:04,240
 She was dead before she hit the water.

426
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,080
 It probably just seemed like either an accident, some sort of accident, or a murder.

427
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,440
 But when they found the statue, that's what turned it into this idea that this is some

428
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,480
 sort of ritualistic murder.

429
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,760
 Because at the end of the day, what are the chances of you finding a statue near a dead

430
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
 body?

431
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
 I guess that's not...

432
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,160
 You die in a figurine shop, you're like, "Oh, they'll never solve my murder."

433
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
 I guess that's possible.

434
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,240
 Again, they're out in the middle of nowhere.

435
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,120
 There's a statue in the same area as this woman's body is found.

436
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:42,240
 But what connects them is the statue's missing its left arm.

437
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,040
 It's a story like that.

438
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,320
 This is so open-ended.

439
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,640
 You can just, again, kind of use your imagination or not if you don't want to think about it.

440
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,240
 You don't want to think about this poor unidentified victim lying on the beach somewhere.

441
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,680
 It does like, was the statue made for her?

442
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,480
 Was she trying to perform some sort of ritual with some sort of group?

443
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,760
 Was she in the same predicament as Terry was in?

444
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:20,760
 Was trying to look for any solution to whatever problems were plaguing her life and the ritual

445
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,920
 went wrong?

446
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:32,800
 Was she a victim of some sort of satanic group and this effigy of her was part of a ritual

447
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,880
 for them?

448
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
 We don't know.

449
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,200
 I don't know if this answers any of these questions.

450
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:47,400
 Did there just happen to be a statue of a woman there, unrelated, and its arm just broke

451
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
 off?

452
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,200
 A wallaby was playing around with it and broke its arm off and ran away.

453
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
 Totally unrelated.

454
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,040
 And what's interesting about it, there's that old case.

455
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,640
 We've never covered it on the podcast because it's so famous.

456
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,960
 The other day, Fabio Nervon, a longtime supporter of the show, emailed me.

457
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,680
 And I think we talked about it a bit on the Discord server as well, but I can't remember.

458
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,600
 Emailed me that the Summerton Man case had been solved.

459
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,040
 I see this happen so many times.

460
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,320
 They solved the all off pass.

461
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
 They solved this.

462
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,680
 They solved that.

463
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,000
 And so I just kind of brushed it off.

464
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,400
 Honestly, I was just like, oh, someone else solved it.

465
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,520
 But Fabio, after he sent me this YouTube video, I was like, I'll check it out.

466
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,080
 It's probably just some guys theory.

467
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,640
 No, they figured it out.

468
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,600
 The Summerton Man was this guy in brief because it's a super popular case.

469
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,760
 He was found on Summerton Beach.

470
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,640
 He had no labels on his clothing.

471
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,520
 He was dead just laying there.

472
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,600
 And he had a little piece of paper rolled up that said Talmud should.

473
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,080
 That was really all they had to go off for like decades.

474
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,160
 Who was this man?

475
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,360
 Why did he die?

476
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,120
 What's he doing on this beach?

477
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
 Nobody knew who it was.

478
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,600
 And that was the big thing.

479
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,760
 Nobody knew who it was.

480
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,680
 And I'll put this video on the show notes.

481
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
 It's pretty interesting.

482
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,080
 They explain about people who'd been researching this for decades.

483
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,560
 And then one day this guy was like sitting at home and he saw, or maybe he was on the

484
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,400
 web and he saw a thing like five unsolved mysteries and no one knows the answers to

485
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
 it.

486
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,680
 And he's like, oh, this, he'd never heard of the Summerton Man case.

487
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,320
 He's like, oh, I'm going to try to figure that out.

488
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,800
 And then he started spending a decade or more trying to figure this out.

489
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,480
 And they started doing DNA tests.

490
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,760
 And he was able to track, they pulled like hair that was removed from a plaster cast

491
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,000
 that was made of his face.

492
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,160
 And there was like three strands of hair.

493
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,440
 He was able to find his descendants.

494
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,880
 They were able to give him a name.

495
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,000
 The Summerton Man has a name now.

496
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,960
 And they were able to track people who were alive when he was still alive.

497
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,040
 And he killed himself.

498
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,600
 It was a tragic suicide.

499
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,840
 He actually had tried killing himself before that.

500
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
 It's a crazy mystery.

501
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
 It's a crazy story.

502
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,200
 I'm probably doing it a bit of an injustice by just covering it in brief.

503
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,480
 But again, it's super famous.

504
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,960
 I'll put the video on the show notes.

505
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,680
 It's really cool we're getting a conclusion of some of these stories that have plagued

506
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
 people for a long time.

507
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,320
 The Summerton Man case.

508
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,200
 We have a solution to the Man from Toret case, a definitive solution to that.

509
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,840
 We know that was a guy illegally trying to enter the country of Japan.

510
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,200
 And at some point, the myth became bigger than the facts.

511
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,920
 And some random dude on Reddit, like Saw was like the man from Toret.

512
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
 What?

513
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,280
 I'll put that episode on the show notes too.

514
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
 He just saw this and goes, "What?

515
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
 That's a mystery?"

516
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,640
 I think I know the answer to that.

517
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,180
 And he was able to provide newspaper articles showing the trial of this man who everyone

518
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,480
 else thought came from an alternate reality.

519
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,160
 So we're getting some really concrete conclusions to some of these cases.

520
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,280
 But those cases are super well known.

521
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,240
 They're so well known I've never talked about the Summerton Man on the podcast.

522
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,000
 The only reason I talked about the Man from Toret, which is super well known, is that's

523
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,320
 one of my favorite paranormal stories.

524
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,320
 And I like it even more now that we have an indie for it, a real indie.

525
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
 We know what happened.

526
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,160
 The Man from Toret has always been one of my favorite paranormal stories.

527
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:32,640
 The reason why I bring those up, no one's researching this girl.

528
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:40,320
 I mean, this is a unsolved mystery that's lost among a sea of unsolved mysteries.

529
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,640
 It was actually included on a list of nine other unsolved mysteries.

530
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,440
 And they had the Dover Demon.

531
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,600
 They had who put Bella in the Elm Tree or whatever that is.

532
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:59,760
 Those are super famous paranormal, quasi paranormal, but definitely unsolved mysteries that I don't

533
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,800
 talk about on this podcast because they're so well known.

534
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:10,760
 And then this one is included in that and I'd never heard of it before in my life because

535
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,080
 no one's talking about it.

536
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,840
 No one's looking into it.

537
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,440
 And her identity not only remains unknown to this day, but will probably never be revealed

538
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,920
 because it doesn't get the same.

539
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,800
 And who knows why, right?

540
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,160
 I'm not saying that there's any sort of hidden agenda.

541
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
 This story's just not getting that much attention.

542
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,560
 And you have, I mean, the Man from Toret and the Summerton Man were both solved because

543
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,880
 it was constantly being covered in all sorts of media that two people, two random people,

544
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,360
 just having to stumble across and go, "Oh, I know the answer to that."

545
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,360
 Or, "I can find the answer to that."

546
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
 And they did it.

547
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,680
 But this story remains unsolved and probably will remain unsolved.

548
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:57,080
 And it's terrifying if you think about it because she could have been ritualistically

549
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
 murdered.

550
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:10,800
 And that statue could have been a symbol of the victim or a totem, an offering.

551
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,300
 Who knows?

552
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,900
 And it's super interesting to think that if the schoolteacher hadn't been walking down

553
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,600
 the road this way, and I don't think it's actually a paved road again.

554
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
 This is in the middle of nowhere.

555
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,340
 But I don't, if the teacher wasn't walking by, if she didn't see the statue, if she

556
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:33,120
 just saw the body and reported it, and the police came out and they just found the body,

557
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,840
 it would just be a tragic death.

558
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,240
 They'd still investigate it.

559
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,480
 But the statue would have never been found and we wouldn't have had this possible link.

560
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,440
 And it makes me think, are there other places on Australia?

561
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,340
 Are there other places around the world where these bodies have been found?

562
00:34:52,340 --> 00:35:00,020
 These mysteries have begun, but somewhere near that location, a key piece of evidence

563
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,820
 was never found.

564
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:07,940
 A clay statue that is an avatar for the victim.

565
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:13,220
 They find the body of a man in the middle of the forest and don't see the clay statue

566
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:20,320
 of him buried under a nearby pile of leaves.

567
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,200
 A young girl's body is dredged out of the water underneath an overpass and his investigators

568
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,560
 rule it as an accidental death.

569
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,120
 They don't notice the clay statue that's a representation of her in the darkness underneath

570
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,720
 the roadway.

571
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,460
 The dead woman found in her apartment.

572
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,340
 No known cause of death, the coroner rules.

573
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,620
 And as her grieving family arrives at the apartment to pack up her things and to put

574
00:35:51,620 --> 00:36:01,820
 into storage, nobody takes note of the small clay statue mixed among all the other chachkies

575
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,980
 in this woman's home.

576
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:13,280
 Was this story possibly go far deeper than just one woman somewhere in Australia?

577
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,320
 Was this a ritualistic murder and do these rituals still take place today?

578
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:32,880
 And right now, is somebody slowly but methodically carving out another clay statue, one that

579
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:58,060
 looks just like you.

580
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:28,040
