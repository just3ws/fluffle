1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 Is there a coastline in Mexico that is protected by an underwater alien base?

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,400
 And then we go on an off-roading adventure with two young kids

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,280
 out on their motorbike exploring the wilderness.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,120
 But little do they know something is following them.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:25,360
 And nothing, not even the laws of physics, will stop this creature from catching them today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:25,680
 "I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm a wild freak, I'm

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:40,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter or I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,400
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, longtime supporter Backdoor Burglar.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,000
 Backdoor Burglar, thank you so much for continuing to support the show.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,440
 Really, really means a lot. You're back in the captain's seat this episode.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,880
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,600
 That also really, really helps out a lot. Backdoor Burglar, we're going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,320
 and we're going to drive on out to Colorado. This is going to be a real quick story, so we're taking a little road trip.

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,600
 Now, this is more of an update really than anything.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,960
 Recently, it was episode 497. I did a segment on a nasal drug called Spravato.

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,280
 It's an anti-suicide drug. Spray it up your nose and make sure you don't want to kill yourself.

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
 For a period of time, again, you have to go to counseling and stuff like that, but

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,200
 I envisioned this dark future. That's great. That's a great drug that they've invented.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,800
 It's a ketamine-based medicine. I said in that story, I made a joke about,

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,240
 I can imagine a dark future where the police have a giant, giant bottle of this and they're jumping

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,880
 up and down on the spray bottle and it's spraying this Spravato through the crowd,

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,040
 making everyone just less angry, just calms you down.

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,240
 Little did I know at the time of that joke, they're doing that now.

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,680
 It's been going on for a while, but it's actually worse than that.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,120
 What's been going on is the police are showing up to these locations.

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,280
 You got a crazy guy running around and the cops will grab them and then they call for backup.

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,360
 In this version, the backup is an ambulance shows up and they inject the guy with ketamine.

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,960
 They don't even use the nasal spray, which would be a little more gentle.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,640
 They inject ketamine right into them. A couple people have died because of this,

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,600
 because they're not getting the dosage right. So there you go. That's what happens when you

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,120
 make a joke on a podcast and find out that it's real. I can understand when you get to the hospital,

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
 they start trying to calm you down, but when you're on the street and you're struggling,

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,520
 you're like fighting the cops, the paramedics trying to get the needle.

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,080
 What, who is this paramedic actually? Is he Hawkeye? How's he getting into a vein?

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,320
 Drug users have a hard time and they're perfectly still because they need their drugs.

36
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,920
 This guy's fighting the dude, the guy has a hypernetic needle and he shoots it into his arm.

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,600
 He probably wishes that they had this giant spray bottle I was talking about.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,280
 Also, actually while I'm doing updates, recently I did that episode about the young woman in

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,160
 Australia who her radio was playing a transmission from the future. That's been solved. The radio

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,080
 station actually looked into it. They released the press release recently saying that it was the

41
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
 escape room. That was a theory that I had actually poo-pooed. I said no, no, no, I don't think they

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,760
 could do that. It actually was. The radio company found out that the escape room somehow was

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,640
 broadcasting on their frequency. It was supposed to only be heard in the escape room, but it got

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,000
 out. So there you go. You got two updates. One, a nice wrap up to a transmission from the future.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,480
 It wasn't a transmission from the future. It's a transmission from a building 50 feet away.

46
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,280
 I also found out, here's not update, here's just me rambling on news I found.

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,360
 The Department of Justice is thinking about classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction.

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,040
 And the reason why I found that out, because when I was thinking about this ketamine story,

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,240
 I thought, okay, so I made up a joke about cops using ketamine to disperse the crowds,

50
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,920
 or basically just make them take a nap in the middle of the street. Could you make a gun?

51
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,880
 This is me. This is my thought process. Could I make a gun? Not you. I don't want you to have this.

52
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,760
 Only I can have this. It's like a super shoker type gun. But instead of shooting out water,

53
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,840
 it goes, pfft. Shoot some like puffs of air. But in the air, it's not just air because then

54
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,600
 otherwise people are on a hot day. They're like, let's riot. And they're getting all,

55
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
 we're gonna get a bunch of puffed air on them. Cops are like, why isn't this stopping them more?

56
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,480
 Are shelling up? Pop open those fire hydrants on this 110 degree day. This will be great.

57
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:37,200
 I can make a gun that shoots out fentanyl. So it's just because fentanyl is a powder. It is also

58
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,440
 pronounced differently, but that's okay. I'm shooting out fentanyl and it's like pfft. Now I would

59
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,560
 obviously have a gas mask on, right? I'm not gonna be like, oh, the wind doesn't change direction.

60
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,040
 While I'm spraying people with this super toxic drug. And I was thinking about that. Could you

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,720
 make a gun? I'm sure you can make the gun. And fentanyl is relatively cheap. Not if you're buying

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,280
 it to be a drug user, but you can mass produce it. China just mass produces it by the metric ton.

63
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,800
 So allegedly. So you could just get these guns and you walk around. Now, now the difference

64
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,720
 between this and ketamine is ketamine, it will put you, it will calm you down. It may kill you.

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,000
 Fentanyl, getting shot in the face with a fentanyl gun. You're not gonna have a good day.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 But yeah, you just make like a puff gun. And you're just like, I guess I basically have not,

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,840
 I don't know where I'm going with this segment. I've not made a

68
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,360
 riot control weapon. I've actually just made a weapon of mass destruction, which is pretty much

69
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,280
 why the department of justice wants to ban it. Because you can dump it out of airplanes, you can

70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,040
 cover crops in it, you can use it to poison the watershed blight. Don't know why I'm giving you

71
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,440
 guys this idea. You're looking over that little pouch of fentanyl on your table. You're like,

72
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,040
 I was going to inject that. But now, now that I know I can take out half a city with this much

73
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,880
 fentanyl. So there you go. I have now willed that into existence as well. Two weeks from now,

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,440
 we're going to find out about a guy who's walking around town, throwing fentanyl at people.

75
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,400
 Backdoor burglar, let's hop in that dead rabbit robot. We're going to leave behind Colorado.

76
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:16,240
 We're going to row down the Colorado River. We're going to eventually get to Meramar beach in Mexico.

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,800
 So we're walking around. It's all sunny and stuff like that. I'm all covered in fentanyl.

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,960
 Don't come near me. Don't come near me. I have a gas mask on. You don't. If you try giving me a hug,

79
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,640
 which I know you really want to do, you'll probably die. So don't do that. Don't do that.

80
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,320
 But we're walking around this beach in Mexico. This was actually a story recommended by Gerardo

81
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,080
 Campos on YouTube. So I really, really appreciate that. We're walking around the beaches in Mexico.

82
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,120
 In Mexico, you have Siddad Madrero and Tampico, which is where the disgusting drink comes from.

83
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,960
 They're embarrassed, but that is their main export. This part of the Mexican coastline

84
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,400
 has not had a hurricane hit it since 1966. And you're thinking, okay, there's a lot of places

85
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,240
 that hurricanes don't hit. Alaska, for example. But this place is actually prime hurricane territory,

86
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,160
 because before 1966, it was an issue. So why haven't there been any hurricanes hitting there

87
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,120
 since 1966? Scientists say, oh, you know, pull out their nerd chart and they're like, based on the

88
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,000
 water levels and the humidity and the atmosphere and all sorts of dumb stuff. Party poopers say it

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,200
 has something to do with that. But the locals actually believe in something else. And even it's

90
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,440
 funny, because the reason why I like this story is the locals believe two things, which is always

91
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,000
 funnier. They all believe one thing. That's just the cold. So in this area, you have a group called

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,480
 the Association of Scientific UFO Research of Tamil Pius, also known as ACOT. They believe that

93
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:53,840
 an underwater alien base just off the coast is protecting the people of that area. Juan Carlos

94
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:02,160
 Ramon López Diaz is the president of ACOT. And he says, I've been there, guys. I've been to the

95
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,200
 alien base. It's really dope. You guys should visit it sometime. And we're like, oh, that's awesome

96
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,840
 that we will visit that with you. And his eyes shift side to side. He's like, you have to

97
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,760
 astrally project there. So he says that he has visited the base, but he's never like taken a boat

98
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:24,480
 there. He's just kind of laid down, not dreaming, not dreaming, right? He's laid down and then his

99
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,240
 spirit left his body. He walked around. He said that it is completely lit up, but there's no

100
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,680
 sun. It's like sealed. Otherwise, you'd be seeing fishes walk by. Actually, first off, fishes don't

101
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,120
 walk. Secondly, if you could see fish walk, dang it, if you could see fish swim by, then you could

102
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,560
 see boats. And the boats could see you. So it couldn't be transparent. But anyways, it's a long

103
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,560
 way to say that the place is totally lit up, even though there's no sun down there. I'm saying that.

104
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,640
 Why did I even take that note? There's a lot of places that aren't lit up as if there's no sun,

105
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,160
 i.e., any indoor building. But anyways, so he said that it was miraculous. He's like, what are all of

106
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,280
 these miniature suns? Look at, I pulled this little switch and the sunlight's having it. Aliens are

107
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,560
 like, "Ah, no more astral travelers inside of our building." He said that they were Nordics. They

108
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,680
 were the six foot tall, blonde hair blue-eyed Nordic type aliens. He also said they were kind of

109
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:27,520
 jerks. He says they were very cold people, not to the touch, just kind of like very aloof aliens.

110
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,120
 He says that they actually asked him about emotions. Like, what's that thing called when you like

111
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,960
 leak out of your eyeballs and he's like crying? And they're like, yeah, tell us a little bit about

112
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,040
 that. And they start pinching his astral soul to make him cry. They're like, does this make you

113
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,120
 cry? He's like, "Ah." You want to know about feelings. You want to know about like happiness,

114
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,360
 because they don't feel those type of things, right? But anyways, he eventually comes back to

115
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,360
 his body. I eat the alarm clock goes off. And he begins telling people this. Now, he wasn't, people

116
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,720
 believed this alien base was here before he went on this astral journey. This is actually really,

117
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,080
 really well known in this area. There's an interesting other step to this theory, where even

118
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,000
 Juan says that this is pretty likely. The aliens themselves aren't stopping the hurricanes. What

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,440
 it is is the collective belief of the people about the aliens is stopping the hurricane. It's almost

120
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,120
 like a topa-generated force field. So you have everyone believing the aliens are protecting

121
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,400
 them. Therefore, the aliens are protecting them. A hurricane probably wouldn't damage an underwater

122
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,040
 UFO base. I really have nothing to base that off of. So there's that. It's not that the aliens are

123
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,120
 doing it out of any sort of friendliness towards the people nearby. It's that the people are doing

124
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,200
 it themselves. The real hurricane magic stopping power was in them all along. But we have the people

125
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,840
 who 100% believe that the UFO base is under there. You have the scientists trying to say

126
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,760
 why. That's not true. We have scientists keep bumping into us. I'm below a little fence in

127
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,520
 their face. Take that science as they pass out. Quote unquote, pass out. What I love about this

128
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,480
 story is the rest of the population of Tamil Pais. Basically, when they hear this story,

129
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,240
 all their eyeballs went ka-ching! A little dollar sign's popping out. Because the people of the area,

130
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,200
 one, they think it's a hilarious story, right? Like you do have the people who believe it as fact.

131
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,840
 The other people go, "Ah, yeah, it's pretty funny bunch of aliens living nearby. How can I make money

132
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:33,440
 from that?" So you can visit this region of Mexico and it's all alien stuff. It's Roswell on steroids.

133
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,840
 It's Roswell on fentanyl. Actually, it's everywhere. They're little green alien balloons and trinkets

134
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,000
 and toys. And they really play up this belief to the fact that the local basketball team is called

135
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,120
 the Hurricanes. And they're mascots a little alien, dude. I'm like, that's pretty dope, dude. I actually

136
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,560
 was thinking about buying one of those jerseys or hats. They're really embracing this idea. I've

137
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,200
 talked about on other episodes, you can make so much money like Stole, Kansas. That's the place that

138
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,520
 supposedly has one of the seven gates of hell Ariana Grande was there not doing a concert. She was

139
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,320
 trying to find the gate to hell. There's an old episode as well. It's one of my favorite episodes,

140
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,440
 honestly. Everyone in town runs off the outsiders. They got Ariana Grande's autograph and they're

141
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,040
 like, "Now get out, witch!" They run off outsiders. And I said in that episode, I said in the episode

142
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,360
 about the Dark Forest entity or the Dark Forest committee or whatever in Connecticut, that they

143
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,480
 also run off outsiders. I go, "Dude, you can make so much bank if you set up a little store at the

144
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,200
 edge of town where you're selling like little Saint and Bobble heads." I went to the gate of hell and

145
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,000
 came back and blah blah blah. We have a better slogan on your shirt than that, but you could have

146
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,720
 a local basketball team play basketball in the graveyard of Stole Cemetery, shootin' hoops,

147
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,960
 build like a giant... Yeah, you have giant tombstones with basketball hoops on them. You would have your

148
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,560
 basketball team called the Hellions. The Stole, Kansas Hellions or something like that, see?

149
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,440
 And make so much money. And I think it's suspicious that the... I said, I think those groups are

150
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,880
 covering stuff up. Those places might really be haunted. Because why aren't people making money?

151
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:18,160
 Greed is good sometimes. In the case of taking advantage of people who believe in the paranormal,

152
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,800
 yeah, it's totally fine. Because I get a cool shirt out of it, right? Like, I believe in aliens.

153
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,840
 I don't know exactly where they come from. We've talked about this several times on the show.

154
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,360
 I don't know if they're interdimensional, if they're already here, from outer space, but...

155
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,960
 That's dope. I would buy a Hurricanes, a Tamil Pai's Hurricanes jersey. That's dope. People would

156
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,560
 be like, "Oh, you're a big fan of the sport?" And I'm like, "No, I just love... I just love alien knickknacks."

157
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,320
 And one more interesting side note to this story. The government in the area is, tells people,

158
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,880
 "Listen, we know you really like this alien story, and we did name more team after this phenomenon,

159
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,640
 but you should be prepared that a hurricane may hit." At the very least, have some sort of bug out

160
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,840
 bag. Because even though there hasn't been a hurricane hitting here since 1966, and hurricanes

161
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,200
 are hitting all over Mexico and in the Gulf of Mexico and all that stuff, just in case, just in

162
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,880
 case be prepared, because if this alien thing isn't true, we'd hate to see you guys get caught out.

163
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,800
 So that's kind of an interesting thing, like the government has had to address it.

164
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,520
 But no hurricanes, and what is that, 40 years? Almost 50 years? But the people there, they do

165
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,480
 seem to be prepared just in case, and they're having fun with it, and most importantly,

166
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,880
 they're making money. Ka-ching! Little eyeballs popping out. More than that, they're turning

167
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,120
 into dollar signs and popping out. The entire city's eyeballs just popped out. That's a completely

168
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,320
 different story. So, Backdoor Burglar, let's call in that carpenter copter. We're going to leave behind

169
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:54,320
 Mexico, and we are headed out to Wyoming. As we're flying to Wyoming, I realize you're flying the

170
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,840
 helicopter up really high, and I'm like, "Oh, huh? What?" And I look out the helicopter, and we're like,

171
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:08,960
 "Way too high." And I'm like, "Guys, guys, we're way too high. I think I might have vertigo."

172
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:16,080

183
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,720
 I yell as I'm still getting vertigo in the Carbenter copter. So bring it down a little bit,

184
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,120
 Backdoor Burglar, and then I turn and I look out the rear window, the Carbenter copter,

185
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,880
 and I see we have arrived at our destination. We're at a Native American reservation here in

186
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:43,200
 Wyoming. The year is 1976. There are these two kids riding on a Honda mini bike. We're gonna call them

187
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,760
 Jesse and Paul. So Jesse is steering the thing and Paul is on the back like a punk. He's the one

188
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,440
 sitting in the back. Sorry, Paul. We're at the Wind River Indian Reservation. It's in Thermopolis,

189
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:09,760
 Wyoming. It's August 1976. This Honda mini bike is cut in lines through the desert.

190
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,440
 So Jesse and Paul are going down this dirt road and something strikes Jesse. He's never been down

191
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,960
 this dirt road before. For whatever reason, he knows that he is down a road he's never been on

192
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,480
 before and he's biked all over this area. But it's young. They're both 12 years old. This is a life

193
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:41,920
 adventure. So motorbikes going down the dirt road. And then this is a sound effect heavy episode.

194
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,520
 The bike slides in the dirt. It's dead. So the two kids get off the bike to try to figure out what

195
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,560
 it was. Jesse said, "I figured a spark plug went out because that's what it felt like. He's worked

196
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,200
 on his bike before." So he checks the spark plugs. They're totally fine and him and his friend are

197
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:07,360
 puzzled. They don't know why the bike just died. And then Jesse says he feels utter fear wash over

198
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:14,160
 him. There are very few times in your life where you'll actually feel that sensation. There are

199
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,520
 soldiers in combat who have never felt that. You have your journal in pumping, a bunch of bodies

200
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,440
 all around the place, hopefully of the enemy. But you're in the zone. You may be fearful afterwards,

201
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:33,200
 but this sense of utter fear. We hear a lot with paranormal stories. It's something that the human

202
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,960
 mind wasn't meant to comprehend. Unfortunately, our brains are made to comprehend violence. So we're

203
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,200
 very violent species. But when something abnormal, something that you could never imagine happens,

204
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,360
 you're just washed over. Your body is reacting to something that shouldn't exist. Jesse is washed

205
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:59,040
 over in this primal fear. He turns and he looks. And at the same time, so does Paul. Paul must be

206
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,560
 feeling the same emotion because they both look over at the same time. And they see about 50 feet

207
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:15,120
 away a man on a horse, not unusual for this area. But this was no ordinary man on no ordinary horse.

208
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,760
 The man was dressed in all black, had a black cowboy hat, black horse. But as Jesse's looking at

209
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,320
 this figure, there's something else going on. It's afternoon. The sun is up. We're not at dusk. We're

210
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:38,320
 not at dawn. There is not a single detail noticeable on this figure. He can see the hat, but the face

211
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:45,920
 is in shadow. But it is the darkest shadow. It's like he can see the outlines, but no details.

212
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,240
 He can see the outline of the clothes, but there's no buttons. There's no flesh visible,

213
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,160
 where the wrist and the hands pop out of the black shirt. No detail on the black boots.

214
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,320
 They're only separated by 50 feet. Again, this isn't a vast distance. So when he's looking at

215
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:12,000
 the horse and he realizes, I can't even see that thing's eyes. They realize something is wrong.

216
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,760
 It's as if somebody cut a hole in the universe in the shape of a man on his horse. Other than the

217
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:27,760
 black silhouette, no other detail is visible. The man on the horse begins riding towards the two kids.

218
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,040
 He said that in this area, the shrubs were about two and a half to three feet tall.

219
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:39,600
 And he's grown up around horses. He's driving his mini bike all over the place. He says,

220
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,400
 these shrubs are so big, you either go on the main road, go around the shrubs, or if you're on a

221
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,520
 horse, you got to jump over the shrubs. He goes, we're looking at this guy, and he's walking

222
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:57,280
 through the shrubs. Again, not as if it's pushing the shrubs aside. It's as if this is a hole in

223
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,000
 reality. It doesn't matter what is in front of it. It simply moves through it. The two kids at this

224
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,400
 point, they basically have their very limited options. One, get captured by a universal impossibility.

225
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,400
 Two, take off running and hope they can outrun a man on a horse that's from some sort of alternate

226
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,080
 realm or really, really hope their motorbike starts working again. They get on the bike,

227
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,600
 Jesse, trying to start it, trying to start it, trying to start it. The rider is getting even

228
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:36,240
 closer to them. He finally miraculously gets the mini bike started. And he takes one look back

229
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:46,800
 at the rider, and he sees the rider still coming towards them. Kicking up dust, that mini bike

230
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:53,360
 flies down this unknown dirt road for about a mile. Jesse says as he's riding, he feels the fear

231
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:03,440
 disappear from him. They stop the mini bike, and him and Paul get off of it. They scan the horizon.

232
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,560
 They've outrun whatever it was. And the two kids start talking and they're like,

233
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,840
 "What in the world was that?" And they're like, "Yeah, I don't know." You saw it, right? "Yeah,

234
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,600
 yeah, I saw it. Yeah, it was weird. Had no detail, whatever. Yeah, I don't know what that was."

235
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,720
 And they're sitting there, they're chatting, and Jesse says that feeling crept back over him.

236
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,920
 Him and Paul again look over at the same time. And this is where the story gets really weird.

237
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,160
 They had traveled a mile, this thing was nowhere to be seen. The feeling reappears. He turns and he

238
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:46,080
 looks, and he sees the rider is there again. But he said it is in the exact same position it was

239
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:53,120
 the last time I saw it. The horse's body position, the rider's body position, was the exactly the

240
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,760
 same as the last time he saw it a mile ago. He described it as this. He said it was as if somebody

241
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,960
 froze time. Like if you had an image, if you had a movie of a man riding a horse, and then you

242
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,720
 paused the movie. So it's like one hoof is up in the air, the rider's looking off to the right,

243
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,880
 the arms are in a specific position, and then you paused that movie, and then you took that screen,

244
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,560
 moved it a mile, and then hit play right when somebody turned around. It broke all the laws

245
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,840
 of reality. At this point, they're at this point they're done exploring this unknown dirt road.

246
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:43,440
 They kick that minibike into action. And don't stop until they hit the main road, and then keep

247
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:51,680
 on going. I got this story from thinkaboutadox.com, and they got it from a website called hbccufo.org.

248
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,200
 It was a self-reported story. I think the story is creepy on a very basic level, and it's something

249
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,880
 that when you think about it really puts you in peril. Now not all of us are riding minibikes in

250
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:10,080
 the middle of the desert. Not many of us really go anywhere where we're isolated. That's not the

251
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,920
 scary part of it. The scary part is this. And I see this all the time. People are afraid of ghosts,

252
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,400
 or demons, what have you, and they still expect the laws of physics to protect them. I see this

253
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,520
 happen all the time, either in stories I see it all the time in horror movies, and I've met people

254
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,600
 who also have expressed these beliefs. People are in a haunted house, and they leave the house they

255
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,320
 expect to be safe. But a house is something that humans have created. There's nothing real about

256
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,160
 it. There's no predetermined boundary there outside of what you paid the county for the land, or

257
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,960
 where you've agreed for your walls to be. That means nothing in a metaphysical world.

258
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:01,040
 UFOology is full of aliens walking through walls and beaming people up. They will see themselves

259
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:07,760
 going through the roof of a house. Phasing technology, teleportation, invisibility, all of these things

260
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,480
 are very well known and paranormal, but people still have this thing when they get that horrible

261
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,320
 feeling they're being followed. They go, "If I can get home, I'll be safe." But it's applying physics

262
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:26,560
 to a non-physical entity. Physics won't save you. Sound won't save you. You can be in one room and

263
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:34,000
 you see something crawl out of your closet, and you're screaming for help. Your loved ones in

264
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,480
 the next room will not hear you. I've personally had that experience happen multiple times actually,

265
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:48,160
 or twice, but that's multiple. Sound, all of these things we take for granted. Sound, light,

266
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,320
 what's to stop some sort of entity as you're walking into your bathroom you wake up in the

267
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,840
 morning to walk in your bathroom and brush your teeth. All of a sudden the lights go out,

268
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,240
 but it's not just that. The lights haven't gone out. All light has disappeared. You're blind.

269
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,400
 You can't see anything in this pitch blackness. Can't call out for help. You can't see. Reality

270
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:16,320
 can be warped at any moment by these things. And yet we still find these comforts. Salt will save me.

271
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:24,560
 Sage will save me. These are physical items, and you're using it against a non-physical entity.

272
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,520
 Not only that, not only just a non-physical entity. Gas would be, I guess, considered non-physical,

273
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:37,200
 but something that exists outside of our reality. The fact of the matter is, is these kids could

274
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,440
 have driven to Timbuktu. The difference between moving a mile for this type of spirit and moving

275
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,320
 8,000 miles is nothing. The only thing that really limits, I think, that we find comfort in

276
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,400
 is that we have haunted locations where we go, that house is haunted, that's a haunted forest,

277
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,680
 that's a haunted dirt path. So if we're not there, we'll be safe. But the point of the matter is,

278
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:06,320
 you're not safe. These things can go anywhere. It's like the childhood belief of pulling your

279
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,120
 covers up over your head. As an adult, we look back and go, "Well, that's dumb. The boogeyman could

280
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,360
 easily just find you underneath the covers." But we still hide under the covers. We just do it in

281
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,040
 other ways. As you're walking through that dark parking lot, you think something's out in the

282
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,080
 bushes. You feel a little safer when you're in your car, right? When the doors are locked.

283
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,000
 And if that's a human adversary, you're definitely a lot safer. But if it's a dark silhouette,

284
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,960
 it doesn't matter how many locked doors you have. So just remember this the next time you're going

285
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,520
 to bed, and you have that thing where you can't sleep with the bathroom door open, or you can't

286
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,200
 sleep if a light's on in the other room, because you're afraid you'll see feet standing outside

287
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:57,760
 your door. Those are small comforts, but they're useless. That door might as well not exist at all.

288
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:05,040
 These things will get you no matter what, if they want to. And the reason why they haven't gotten you

289
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:15,360
 yet is because they haven't wanted to. But someday they will. Someday that creature under your bed

290
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,640
 will slither out. Or that sewer grate you walk by every morning. The thing in there will get tired

291
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:29,040
 of simply watching you and follow you home. Or that odd feeling you get while sitting at the bus

292
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:36,800
 stop. It's not just a feeling. Something is behind you. Eventually these things will get bored

293
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:44,800
 of simply watching. They will get you. And there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.
