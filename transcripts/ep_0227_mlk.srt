1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 "Lone Pine Devils" return.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Why don't we see caveman ghosts?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And I've been looking all over for the story of sexual assault missiles, but did I already cover it?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And then we take a look at an American icon, who just recently was accused of some of the most heinous crimes today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 "I'm a walking down"

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 This might be the equivalent of a clip show. We're going to be talking about a couple past episodes to start off.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And for two reasons. One, I've gotten a lot of interesting feedback lately. Two, I'm coming down really hard off of nicotine.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I had to give up the lozenges. I couldn't do the keto. I struggled. I lost. It took me like three weeks to lose like three or four pounds. It sucked.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And I wasn't eating enough. The lozenges, the nicotine lozenges, was giving me just enough sugar to keep me out of ketosis.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And I wasn't eating enough and it was just nasty. So I'm on the patch. I haven't had a nicotine lozenges now in probably about 15 hours.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 And I feel all I can do is eat and sleep. I've basically reverted to a caveman. And we'll talk about that in a second.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 But yeah, the patch gives me 21 milligrams of nicotine for 24 hours. I normally take 10 milligrams of nicotine in an eight hour period.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it, but I want to get an episode out for you guys. I enjoyed doing this show. Definitely wanted to do it.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 But this episode is pretty much the podcast equivalent of a clip show. But I hope it's entertaining because the stuff we're going to talk about really had me thinking.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 The first thing we're going to talk about though is this happened really recently. Maybe like a dare to ago, I got a comment on my YouTube channel about my episode.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It was episode 198 Attack of the Lone Pine Devils. And that was a story about supposedly there were these winged bat creatures up in the Lone Pine Mountain, which is a mountain in California.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And it all it all hinged on this tale of this guy from like this missionary from like the 1800s who went up there.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 They were throwing a giant rager during this expedition and he hid in his tent and everyone chopped down all the trees.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And that's why it's called Lone Pine because they only left one. They had a huge bonfire and these winged demons showed up and killed everybody.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And there had been sighting sense of these things. And I have, like I do on my show, I put the links. This is where I'm getting this information.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Yesterday or the day before I got 24 Robbers came knocking on my door. No, yesterday I got a comment on YouTube video for that one that came out grammatically weird.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And it was from Chop Top and Chop Top said, this was his exact message. And I kind of woke up to this. It said, as far as I can tell the Lone Pine Mountain Devils were created for a YouTube video called Mountain Devil Prank Fails Horribly.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Can't find any reference to it before the posting of that video. And I was like, what?

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And so I watched the video. It's a short film about a group of guys that are trying to pull a prank on their friend. They go to Lone Pine Mountain and prank goes horribly.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 A bunch of flying creatures show up and kill the friends. And they're basically short filmmakers. They ended up doing a segment for VHS, the horror movie compilation.

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 But I watched the short film. I thought it was pretty interesting. And the short film came out in May 2010. And Chop Top is right. There is not a single reference to these creatures before May 2010.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 After May 2010, you start to see it. You see the video come out. Later on you see these articles.

29
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 But before May 2010, there's no reference to these things whatsoever. I went back to my trusted guide, the National Directory of Haunted Places.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Because when I covered Lone Pine, I covered two stories. One about the woman whose house was under assault by a bunch of ghosts.

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And that is listed in the book, which was published in 1999. That is also listed on the web. But in the book, there's no mention of these flying creatures.

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And supposedly this account came from the 1800s. And this book did the research in the area and were only able to come up with the story of the ghost assaulting the house.

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 The reason why, and I'm not doing a correction. Thank you, Chop Top, for pointing that out. And I acknowledged him, but I'm not doing a correction.

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Even though I probably should, I don't normally do corrections unless I make an egregious mistake.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 This is one I just find fascinating because this shows the level of myth-making in our society. They might have made it up. Or a fan of the film might have made it up.

36
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But what's weird is now when you read about it, all my links never mention the film. All the links just say this is a historical event that happened.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 People in the area cite it. It goes back to the time of the natives. La la la la.

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So I find it fascinating how quickly myths are formed. Because if Chop Top had never sent this to me, I never would have known.

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It's something from 9 years ago, a short film from 9 years ago, basically started this myth. And I found out about these things on a cryptid website.

40
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And going forward, unless someone like Chop Top or now you guys hear this cryptid myth, unless someone steps forward and goes, "Oh no no no, that was based on a short film.

41
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 There's no evidence of this ever existing before the short film." This is going to be a cryptid that will continue to grow. The legend will continue to grow.

42
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Sometimes I will take an unsatisfactory answer over "Who knows?" And that's what this is. It's funny because it's an unsatisfactory answer because the monsters don't exist.

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 But it's also to me extremely fascinating because of the element of some kids created a short film and that creature is now a recognized cryptid that's covered on podcasts, covered on YouTube channels,

44
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 covered in cryptid websites and it's all because of these three or four young dudes making a short film. Blair Witch could have been that same thing if that was a more underground film.

45
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 That movie was like a cult film instead of wide release of the theater. There probably be a lot of people who believe in the Blair Witch.

46
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 There actually probably is a lot of people who still believe in the Blair Witch. But thank you Chop Top, I found that fascinating that you found that out.

47
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Well I know Chop Top's one of the people who made the movies or he could just be the fan of the movie or he could have just wanted to try to do more research but I find it fascinating nonetheless.

48
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Now let's talk about two other episodes here. So I got an email from a gentleman named Austin and he was talking about two different things in this email.

49
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 The first off was when I did the story about the grinning man. The grinning man who, that's the one episode I didn't write down when I was taking my notes,

50
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 it was a fairly recent episode. It was the grinning man of Scotland where he would have magically appear in front of women and he would be doing weird stuff.

51
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 He'd be like rubbing his chest, he'd be like running in place and only women saw him and they only saw him in this very very limited geographical area.

52
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And Austin says, you know what, and let me say this too, this is a bit of a correction too, and Kaylee on YouTube picked this up as well.

53
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 I kept calling it the grinning man. He's technically called the "girning man" which I guess is a, he would smile but he also made these weird faces and that's a different thing called "girning".

54
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 So it's super, I thought "girning" was like a slang, like a Scottish term for grinning because they just can't pronounce stuff right over there,

55
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 but Kaylee was like, no no no, they're two separate things actually. "Girning" is more like a scrunched up face.

56
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So there's a lot of corrections on this episode, but Austin said, what if the grinning man, we'll just keep calling him that, this guy who appears in front of women and seems to be doing this salacious stuff in front of them and frightening them,

57
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Austin goes, what if that is a practiser of "mubobobo".

58
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Now "mubobobo" was a magical sexual assault spell that I covered in episode 191 where women in Zimbabwe were saying that they were being psychically raped to the point where they were physically feeling the sensation of rape and the police were arresting,

59
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 throwing people in jail for this crime. They're like, oh yeah, we know what that like, women would be like, yeah, I was just sitting in this DMV office and I felt myself get penetrated in the cops,

60
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 and I was like, oh yeah, we know what that is, we know what to look for. It's a problem over there in Zimbabwe, is this, and he goes, what if the grinning man is another type of magic user who does that,

61
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 because he only appeared in front of women and it was in a short geographical area, and it's interesting because I hadn't made that connection.

62
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 The sexual assault magic in Zimbabwe, and at the end of that episode I go, what if that guy has moved on to other places, like what if this practitioner moved to a place where the police didn't know what to look for,

63
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 and Zimbabwe, it's a legit crime, what if this guy went somewhere where people don't know what to look for, and then Austin goes, maybe that is where the grinning man comes from.

64
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 That might be true, you have the same, it didn't physically rape them, but the whole thing definitely seemed perverted, the grinning man, the way he appeared to women and the stuff he did was just seemed like the intent was for personal excitement.

65
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 It wasn't necessarily popping up and scaring them or trying to possess them, it was just doing odd disturbing stuff in front of them, moving oddly in the middle of the night, the foot of your bed, just some creature going,

66
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 "hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe

67
00:09:36,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 and then disappearing, just really, really bizarre stuff, but then Yomi sent me an email, but then Yomi goes, let's talk just about the moobabubo, I love saying that, it's a horrible, horrible crime, but he goes, what if that is related to sexual assault missiles.

68
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Now sexual assault missiles is a mystery that I've been searching for really since the beginning of the show, and I've never made any headway, what is sexual assault missiles you ask, I don't know, it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg, and I've never been able to find anything for it.

69
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And he goes, what if moobabubo is related to that? Now I don't know, but it does give me an interesting angle to look at, it might be a little bit of the break I need, maybe it is related not just to a physical missile, but some sort of sexual assault magic missile,

70
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 something, I was thinking more of like a weapon system, a lot of people have said maybe it's the gay bomb, which is a bomb the military tried to invent, they would drop on people and it would release pheromones and start making the soldiers bang each other, and I thought maybe, but the gay bomb is pretty well known.

71
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 I've read multiple articles on that over the years, so I don't really think it's that, but Yomi may actually have a step in the right direction, sexual assault missiles, so we'll keep looking at that.

72
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I know this is feeling like a clip show, I really guys hope you are enjoying it, I, again, I find all this stuff really fascinating, and I think it's interesting, I get a lot of story recommendations from you guys, I also get a lot of really cool emails from you guys, so I really like to take this opportunity to kind of go through them.

73
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Now, I mentioned this on an earlier episode as well, this is kind of less of a clip show and more of a new story, so if you haven't listened to those episodes, one I'd recommend them, all those episodes we've talked about are actually really good episodes, I really like those ones.

74
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 But in Austin's email he talked about the moobababoo and the grinning man, and then he goes this, he goes, you've talked a lot about ghosts in the past and things like that.

75
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Let me read you this part of his email here. "My idea regarding ghosts, my idea is that a lot of ghosts we see are caused by human emotion, in particular, very strong emotion or the gradual build up of emotion over time."

76
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Now that's fairly standard, a lot of people, it's a very standard way of looking at ghosts, like that's not groundbreaking at all, and I'm not putting it down Austin, but I mean that's a pretty normal way of looking at it, but as we go forward I think there's some real nuggets in here.

77
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 He continues, "Why does emotion have a lingering effect?" I don't know, maybe there is an astral plane or higher dimension or something like that.

78
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And that made me think of one of the things that scientists don't understand about gravity, is gravity technically should be stronger than it is, and so that's one of the reasons why people think there's a multiverse, they think that gravity is coming from another level into our reality and then leaving.

79
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 As opposed to electromagnetic energy which is here, gravity should be stronger but it's not so it makes scientists go, it has to be going somewhere, it has to not originate from here.

80
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Now I'm really bastardizing that theory, I've watched a couple documentaries on it that are made for the general public on PBS, I know it gets a little more scientific than that, but that's kind of the way they go.

81
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Technically if you jumped off a building you should fall to the center of the earth, gravity is that powerful of a force, it can hold a planet together, but it's not powerful enough to make you plummet into the ground, it's just an odd force.

82
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Gravity can warp space time, but when you hit the planet you just splatter, so again totally bastardizing that.

83
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 So anyways, and that made me think what if human emotion is the same way that, or the soul or however you want to describe it, it seems like it's so important in this universe but it actually extends across other dimensions.

84
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I don't know, I just found that really interesting that it's coming from somewhere else and it's also emanating into something else, and we're just getting a little sliver of how powerful emotional energy actually is.

85
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 But the key part of the email that I was looking at said, "Hell, one thing I thought of now is that the emotional residue probably decays over time till nothing is left, which could explain why we don't really have any ancient Sumerian ghost or ghost of people getting crushed by mammoths."

86
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Now one of the things like I'm fairly skeptical and we talked about that along the show, one of the things that, and thanks Austin for the email, is I've always said, technically every square inch of the planet should be haunted.

87
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 If ghosts are the spirits of dead people, every square inch of the planet should be haunted because on every square inch of the planet over the course of four billion years, someone or something has died.

88
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Now, ghost dogs or ghost dinosaurs would be awesome dude.

89
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 How is Sci-Fi Channel not done? I'm sure they have. I saw a movie called Triassic Attack. There was a bunch of skeletons of dinosaurs running around.

90
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It was so funny because at one point a guy was running away from a dinosaur, a skeleton T-Rex, and it bit him and he just fell out of the stomach. He just fell out of the bones and ran away.

91
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 But a ghost dinosaur would be terrifying because how would you destroy it? Could you exercise it? It's non-denominational. It's just a big old ghost dinosaur.

92
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Anyways, as I'm plotting my script in my head, I thought, you know, I always go there should be, there every part of America, there's been a Native American who died or a settler who died or something.

93
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 There's just statistically every, maybe not every inch, but every square mile should be haunted.

94
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And I hadn't thought about it before. And he was saying that maybe emotional energy just decays over time and that's why we don't see these old ghosts.

95
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So then I went and looked that up. And that also is a theory other people have put out. They've said that when somebody dies, it may be a brutal murder or something like that,

96
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 but over time that emotional residue leaves the area and that would explain why most ghosts we see are from.

97
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Like Victorian times, maybe there is a two, three hundred year time limit to how long this emotional residue can float around.

98
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 The article that I also read about the caveman ghost said, it could also be that we don't go where they lived, which makes sense because it's not the caveman themselves.

99
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 There was what, maybe a hundred thousand of them, two hundred thousand of them.

100
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 It's shocking to think of the amount of numbers that humanity started off with to where we are today, but there weren't a lot of them.

101
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And unless you were in where they were at or in their caves, the caves themselves may be haunted, but I mean other than that.

102
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 But I think Austin's more on the nose that it's this emotional energy thing.

103
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 But, but, last call back to a past episode, I got an email from Alder, because I recently said I'm going to do an episode on caveman ghosts.

104
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And Alder is like, no, no, no, not yet, not yet. Let me tell you this real quick before you do this episode.

105
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Alder said, me, and this is fascinating, and a great way to wrap up this listener segment.

106
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Alder said, the maybe the reason why there are no caveman ghosts is because of what I explained in my episode about the bicameral mind.

107
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 And that was episode 166, the tale of the talking tumor.

108
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And that was the theory that humanity used to be much, much simpler, where one side of your mind would tell you to do something and then you would simply do it.

109
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And that is where we get stories of voices from God, voices from the outside, because you would wake up and your mind would be like, time to go into the field.

110
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 You'd walk out of the field and it'd be like, time to brush your teeth and you're like, what's a toothbrush?

111
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And the mind's like, invent one. And you're like, okay, and then you invent a toothbrush and you use it.

112
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And so for the longest time we basically had our two parts of our mind were just talking to each other.

113
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 We were what were called noble automatons.

114
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And some of the proof of that was if we look at early, early, early literature, characters simply did things.

115
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And it wasn't until later literature or later books of the Bible where characters are starting to be introspective and starting to question things about themselves and the world around them.

116
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Before that people are just kind of walking around.

117
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 He goes, maybe that's why there's no caveman ghost.

118
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Maybe it's not an emotional energy thing.

119
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Maybe it's the fact that we weren't complex enough to leave a ghost.

120
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Fascinating stuff. You guys always impress me.

121
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 I get a lot of emails from you guys. So thank you all dare and thank you, Yomi and thank you, Austin.

122
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Thanks to everyone who's ever sent me an email.

123
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 I get a lot of really cool emails from you guys.

124
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I got an email from Rabbitfish.

125
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 He was actually on vacation and he drove up through Hood River, which is kind of cool because I'm thinking, you know, I'm making this podcast.

126
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And here's this guy on vacation.

127
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 He just drives through the town and he's like, it's like seeing, seeing this place that to me, Hood River is so creepy and dark.

128
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And I don't think I've ever really been able to convey that on the show.

129
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 To me, it is like this location on the border of the odd.

130
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 It's quite weird up here.

131
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 But yeah, so I mean, just getting these emails from you guys, I get a lot of them and I don't, not able to always respond very, very quickly.

132
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And I apologize for that.

133
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 But I do write down your suggestions and I do enjoy reading them.

134
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And I wanted to take this time out to kind of highlight some of the more recent emails I got.

135
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And I'm not on a trip really.

136
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I've eaten my body weight in M&Ms since I've given up nicotine on Wednesday.

137
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 I'm going back on the keto, but it's going to be a rough couple of days.

138
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 So but but that being said, that being said, let's go ahead and get on to this last story here now.

139
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Now, this last story is really fascinating to me.

140
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 This is going to be a controversial one too.

141
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So you might think, oh, Jason's just phoned it in because he's feigning for nicotine.

142
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 No, this one's going to be a controversial one.

143
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 This news just came out.

144
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 There's an author named David Garrow.

145
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And I know some of you are already like, Jason, don't do this story.

146
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 There's an author named David Garrow.

147
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 He's a British author.

148
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 He wrote a bunch of books, which is usually what authors do.

149
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 He wrote a book on the abortion battles leading up to Roe versus Wade.

150
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 That was one of his big books.

151
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 He wrote an Obama biography, which is actually quite heavily criticized because it focused on him as a person,

152
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 which is kind of an odd thing to criticize.

153
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And I didn't read the biography, obviously.

154
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I just found out about this, but it was interesting because the biography says that Barack Obama was just kind of like a dude hanging out.

155
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And then like in the late 80s, early 90s, he was like, I'm destined for something.

156
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I'm going to be president of the United States.

157
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And his girlfriend at the time, it wasn't Michelle.

158
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It was this other girl.

159
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 She says it was bizarre.

160
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 She didn't actually say it was bizarre, but she said it was it was odd because all of a sudden he had this manifest destiny.

161
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 All of a sudden he just knew what he was set on earth to do.

162
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 So I've always find that type of stuff fascinating.

163
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And then he won.

164
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 David Garrow won a Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for the book, "Baring the Cross," Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

165
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Pulitzer Prize winner for biography.

166
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 He described David Garrow describes himself as a Bernie Sanders Democratic Socialist.

167
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 So he's not Ben Shapiro.

168
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 He's not Gavin McGinnis.

169
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 He's not a right-wing dude.

170
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 He describes himself as a Bernie Sanders Democratic Socialist.

171
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So that's the political view he's coming from.

172
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 But he's currently putting together an article for a British magazine called "Standpoint Magazine."

173
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 The article hasn't come out yet, but this happens a lot.

174
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 A lot of times they'll release details of what the article's going to be about.

175
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 So when the magazine drops, it'll be a huge seller because people want to read it.

176
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 It's basically a promo piece for the article that he's writing for "Standpoint Magazine."

177
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Back in January of 1964, Martin Luther King Jr., Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.,

178
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 you don't know who he is, Civil Rights pioneer, helped lead the boycotts, Rosa Parks,

179
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I mean, trying to boil it all down into a couple of sentences here.

180
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 He's only got like 10 minutes left.

181
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 But he's basically, he was a...

182
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 The best way to look, if you're not familiar with the Civil Rights movement in America,

183
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 the best way to explain it is this.

184
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Martin Luther King Jr. was Professor Xavier and Malcolm X was Magneto.

185
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And Stan Lee actually based those two characters on the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.

186
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 If, I don't want to say this, but if you consider the African-American community the mutants,

187
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 that's, sounds really...

188
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 What I'm trying to say is that, that's the struggle.

189
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 The struggle.

190
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Where you had one guy who was super militant, which was Malcolm X,

191
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 and then you had one guy who was like, "No, we can work with people to get what we want.

192
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 We can live together."

193
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Professor Xavier's dream of how the mutants were going to be in society,

194
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 and then Malcolm X is Magneto.

195
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Now, I've always been a big fan of Malcolm X.

196
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I still am a big fan of Malcolm X.

197
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 I read his autobiography.

198
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 It is an amazing book.

199
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 It's full of just...

200
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 He quips the whole time.

201
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 It's basically like, as serious as the subject is that he's talking about.

202
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 The stuff he comes up with is gold.

203
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Oh, I love that book.

204
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Autobiography of Malcolm X.

205
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 It's a great book.

206
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 But basically, and one of Malcolm X's arguments was,

207
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 "Hey man, you can either choose my path of militant violence,

208
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 or you can go with King's path of peace."

209
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And America decided to go with King's path.

210
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Now, both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated,

211
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 and both of them under incredibly suspicious circumstances.

212
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But that's kind of the overview of Martin Luther King Jr.'s place in the civil rights struggle.

213
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 He believed that the blacks and the whites could get together.

214
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Like, could be friends.

215
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I had a dream, speech.

216
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 He's the guy who did that.

217
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 It's funny.

218
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 You're thinking, "Jason, you're an idiot.

219
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Why do you think...?"

220
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 This is an international show, too.

221
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 A lot of people listen to the...

222
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 I only get 60% of the audience from America.

223
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 So sometimes I have to do overviews.

224
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 There are people in other countries who aren't aware of that.

225
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 So, who aren't aware of Martin Luther King Jr.

226
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Any ways the point is, is that Malcolm X was held up as this militant leader,

227
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 who would not shy away from resorting to, at the very minimum, threats of violence.

228
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 He was constantly talking about blowing people up.

229
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 He would say stuff like,

230
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 "A white liberal would walk up to Malcolm X and say, 'How can I help you?'

231
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And Malcolm X would go, 'You can help me by joining the Klan,

232
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 taking a revolver to the next meeting and killing as many of them as possible.'

233
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That's the only way you can help me as a white person."

234
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 So, he was not shy away from violence.

235
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Martin Luther King Jr. presented himself as someone completely different.

236
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Now, Martin Luther King Jr. always had two rumors following him around his entire career.

237
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 One, he was a communist, and two, he cheated on his wife.

238
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Now, both of those things, the communist thing obviously really made the government nervous back then.

239
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Nowadays, people shrug off. The guy writing about him describes himself as a democratic socialist.

240
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 People don't even blink nowadays if someone goes, "Oh yeah, that person's a communist."

241
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 But back then, huge deal.

242
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 The fact that he was sleeping around on his wife, people thought was kind of slimy.

243
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 He was a minister. He was a Baptist minister. He was married to...

244
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 But it wasn't enough to offset the mission.

245
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 But this is what we're getting to right now.

246
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 David Garrow is writing this article in "Standpoint" magazine.

247
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And he says that he has not listened to the actual recordings,

248
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 but in the national vaults, and like the FBI vaults, there is a series of recordings

249
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 of Martin Luther King and his friend, the Reverend Logan Curse,

250
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 in a hotel room, or hotel rooms, there was two of them, in a Washington, D.C. hotel from January 1964.

251
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 The recordings will be released in the year 2027.

252
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 But the summaries of the recordings are available now.

253
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And David Garrow, and David Garrow began going through the summaries of these recordings.

254
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And what he found will, if true, will forever ruin the name of Martin Luther King Jr.

255
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Everything I'm about to say is a legend.

256
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 We all learned about him in high school. We have a Martin Luther King day where we get the day off.

257
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Elementary school kids love him, high school kids love him.

258
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 He's an icon, man.

259
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Orgy at the hotel.

260
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Him and his minister friend bangin' a bunch of chicks. It's all recorded on audio.

261
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 So what, Jason? A lot of people are bangin' dudes.

262
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 They weren't bangin' dudes. I mean, a lot of dudes are bangin' chicks.

263
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Yeah, you're right. Not a huge deal.

264
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 In the transcripts, it says, in the summaries, the FBI agents say,

265
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 it was they engaged in acts of degeneracy and depravity, which, I mean, makes you think the worst of the worst,

266
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 but again, these were 1964, these were agents in 1964 who, back then, oral sex may have been depraved.

267
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 So, make an excuse, say, sure.

268
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Yeah, you know.

269
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Have an orgy in a room with your best friend and a bunch of chicks who went to the best friend's church.

270
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 It's a bizarre. It's not something you want to do, but it's not earth-shattering.

271
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 In the recordings, apparently, a woman doesn't want to do it, and Martin Luther King Jr. says,

272
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 it'll be good for your soul.

273
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Ah, it's a little slimy, but even that's not enough to start tearing down street signs with his name on it.

274
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 The day before that, though, the day before the orgy, if true, if this allegation is true,

275
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 the day before the orgy, a woman came over to the hotel room.

276
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 This is all audio recorded, and we'll find out in eight years.

277
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 There's an audio recording of Logan Kurs, the FBI document.

278
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 So, what happens is these women come over and King and Kurs start talking about, like, which women they should do what to.

279
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I'll just read this part of the article.

280
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 "In King's hotel room, the files claim they then discussed which women among the parishioners would be suitable for natural and unnatural sex acts."

281
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And then, the FBI document says, "When one of the women protested that she did not approve,

282
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 the Baptist minister immediately and forcefully raped her as King watched.

283
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 He's alleged to have looked on, laughed, and offered advice during the encounter.

284
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 FBI agents were in the next hotel room monitoring the wiretap live, and they didn't go in.

285
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 They just sat there and listened to it.

286
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I mean, obviously, the FBI, at the time, wanted to take King down.

287
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Is it possible that these summaries are fake? Yes.

288
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Apparently, according to David Garrow, according to these articles,

289
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 the FBI then sent a copy of the recordings to Martin Luther King Jr.

290
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 with a letter saying that this will completely ruin your future.

291
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 You'll always be known as this horrible sex dude.

292
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 You should kill yourself just to make it right.

293
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 You should kill yourself so nobody ever finds out.

294
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And obviously, he did, and he was assassinated five years later,

295
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 but they obviously had an axe to grind with him at the time.

296
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Is it possible that these summaries are overblown? Yes.

297
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Is it possible that these summaries are completely falsified,

298
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 trying to get approval from higher-ups to take out Martin Luther King,

299
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 say, "Look at all this horrible stuff he did." Yes.

300
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 But anyone, like anyone higher up in the government would say,

301
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 "Oh my God, this is horrible. Can I listen to the audio?"

302
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So they would have to produce some sort of evidence.

303
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I don't know, though. I personally don't know if these are true.

304
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 The summary-- let's say this.

305
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 It's possible that the summaries are completely false.

306
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 David Garrow is totally making the whole thing up.

307
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Totally 100% possible that everything's made up.

308
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 It could be that the summaries are getting cherry-picked,

309
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 and some of them are bad, and the media is running with it.

310
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 That's possible, too.

311
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 David Garrow, though, doesn't seem-- his book from 1986

312
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 about Martin Luther King Jr., Pulitzer Prize winner,

313
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 doesn't seem like he necessarily has an axe to grind with this dude.

314
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 He does say-- David Garrow is quoted as saying,

315
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 "It poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature

316
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible."

317
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And he said when he was going through these summaries,

318
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 he was like, "Yeah, I know he's a slimebag.

319
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I've always heard rumors that he was cheating on his wife and stuff like that."

320
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But as he's going through the summaries, when he gets to that part,

321
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 he's shocked, shocked by this guy that he has respected and has, you know--

322
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 the world has respected. He's shocked by his behavior.

323
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I obviously don't want this to be true. I don't want this to be true.

324
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And I'm fairly skeptical that it is.

325
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 However, the only thing that makes me think that it could be true--

326
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 I have to weigh the FBI had a bone to pick with them--

327
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 what makes me think it could be true is the source that's coming from

328
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 who is more left-wing.

329
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 He had wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning biography on this guy.

330
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 What we'll have to do is we'll wait until the standpoint article comes out,

331
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 and David Garrow starts doing interviews where he's able to be questioned

332
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 and he can give more information. He may come out and say,

333
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 "Listen, the articles that ran with it originally,

334
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 they were kind of taking some stuff out of context.

335
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 That really wasn't what I was trying to say.

336
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Actually, it didn't happen. This didn't happen. It was dead.

337
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Clickbait, clickbait. It's possible."

338
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 But if he comes down and says, "No, this is true.

339
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Here are the summaries. Look them up yourself."

340
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 The recordings will be out in eight years,

341
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 so we better start planning on how we're going to look at this guy's legacy

342
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 in eight years, because everyone's going to know soon.

343
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 I think the-- I think-- and again, if this is true,

344
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 I think it'll be one of those things that will be relegated to a conspiracy theory.

345
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 I personally don't believe the audio tapes, if this is true, will ever be released.

346
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 I don't think it'll ever release them. It'd be too damaging.

347
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And I think it then falls into that category that I always believe in.

348
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 It's conspiracy theories don't always have to be these huge overriding things

349
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 with pizzicade and reptiles and satanic overlords and all sorts of stuff.

350
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Sometimes it's just people or groups of people doing horrible things

351
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 and covering it up. And in this case, somebody doing a horrible thing

352
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 and the government going, "It's not worth everyone finding out about.

353
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 He's a national hero. Let's just cover it up."

354
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 David Garrow's article will probably come and go,

355
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 and it will just become a conspiracy theory, and anyone who brings it up will be considering

356
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 tarnishing the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.

357
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 There's an old saying, "Never build a statue of a living person,

358
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 because you don't know what's going to happen."

359
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 But when people are 50 years dead and we're still getting revelations like this,

360
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 it really makes you question who do you build statues of?

361
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Who do you name streets after, or make holidays after?

362
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 We may never fully know what happened in that hotel room in January 1964.

363
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Logan Curse has passed away, Martin Luther King Jr. has passed away.

364
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 We may never know the full details if those tapes are never released.

365
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And we may never know the full details if they're released.

366
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 We don't know if they were edited or anything like that.

367
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 But one thing is clear. Humans are complex.

368
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 That's not an excuse. If this is true, that's not an excuse at all.

369
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 But humans are complex, and we can deify people and memorialize people

370
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 and hold them up as lofty ideas of how humans should behave.

371
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 But at the end of the day, they're still just people.

372
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 People can be both good and evil.

373
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 People can give both love and hate.

374
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And no amount of dreaming can ever change that.
