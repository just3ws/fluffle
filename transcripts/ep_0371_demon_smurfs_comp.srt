1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
 What happens when an artist takes criticism a little too far?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:12,040
 And then we travel back to the 1980s to talk about Smurfs once again.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,680
 Three apples high, little blue guys running through the forest trying to outwit an

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,040
 idiotic wizard and his crazy cat.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,440
 A basic story, a tale as old as time, but to some religions

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,200
 The Smurfs not only represented demonic forces taking over the entertainment industry, but we're actually coming alive

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,760
 entering our real world and

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,420
 Attacking their children today on Dead Rabbit Radio

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:51,000
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter or I'm having a great day

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. You know our first story is a cautionary tale of

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,440
 being able to take criticism

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,080
 There's constructive criticism

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,680
 Which I actually got the other day on 4chan this guy was like hey man love the show

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,080
 But now you're going off on these weird like side humor things and it's kind of forced and it's not as funny as it used to be

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,160
 The show is not as funny as it used to be I listen to I used to listen every day now listen to every other episode

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:24,960
 That's constructive criticism and this is why this is what's wrong with the show and this is why it's affecting me personally

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,200
 It's not your show sucks. It's not you're not funny. None of that stuff's helped. This is the problem

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,160
 This is specifically the problem and this is the result. I'm not listening to the show as much and I I

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,480
 We talked for a bit and I totally understand

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,920
 I said probably the show just gets annoying after a while just like a relationship you talk to the same person every single day

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,560
 Eventually the things that you enjoyed about them do get grading take a break for a while

22
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,000
 Maybe come back, but they're they're kind of doing that and they said they don't listen to every different

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,480
 So I don't take that and that's all I don't expect people to listen every episode either. I don't listen to every episode of my favorite podcast

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,760
 I'm always impressed when you guys do but you got to be able to take criticism when you put stuff out into the world

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,600
 You have to be able to take criticism the reason why I'm telling the story is because

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,240
 We're gonna learn about a guy who can't take criticism not only cannot take criticism

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,120
 But criticism may have actually driven this man insane

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,000
 Let's harbor the carbonar cocktail guys. We're headed off to the United Kingdom

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,680
 We're headed to Glen Rhoads the village of Glen Rhoads. It is October 3rd in

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,680
 2014 so very very recent just what four years ago five years ago. Wait, what year is it six years ago?

31
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,200
 It's all he's six years ago and there we're gonna meet a young woman working at an asda supermarket

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,400
 That's some British thing. It's a supermarket, but everything is on the left side of the aisle. So

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,520
 There's a young girl working there. Her name is Paige

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,320
 Roland roll and roll and roll and roll and wood and she is has a red baseball cap on her baggy pants

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,480
 There is nothing hotter than a woman in a baseball cap with a ponytail pulled to the back of the cap

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,000
 I don't care

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 What else you look like if that is the top of your forehead from your eyebrows up? I'm in

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,520
 Anyways page rolling. She's she's rolling. No, just page rolling 18 years old

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,520
 She's working at as the grocery store. She's on her knees kind of moving stuff around on the bottom, right?

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,480
 And while she's she's moving around some hot dog flavored water

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,280
 She's a soft drink down there coming down the aisle

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:33,760
 Is Richard britain, which would be the best name living in britain as in I would love to be named jason america

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,400
 Or jason united states, but i'm not i'm jason carbonar Richard britain

44
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,320
 In britain is walking down this aisle this young woman is kind of moving stuff around

45
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,720
 She grabs the chocolate starfish and putting it next and then bonk

46
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,920
 Now now there's more

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,000
 I I have to guess how loud to me that sound effect that didn't sound super dramatic

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,480
 But the point is it made a much louder noise in the grocery store

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,600
 He smashes this girl over the head with a full

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,120
 Bottle of wine. She's like, uh, she goes unconscious for a moment, which which she's lucky. She didn't die

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,240
 And the newspaper articles don't really say if he runs away or if he stands there

52
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,520
 I'm assuming he left the scene, but he does get arrested now. The question is why what is the motive?

53
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,360
 So they eventually track this guy down. He's on the run. I don't know

54
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,320
 He could have just sat down and drank some wine outside the store

55
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 The point is eventually he gets arrested and when the cops start to interrogate him they go

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,640
 Why'd you do it? He goes, aha, I have the perfect motive. I will admit that I hit this woman

57
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
 But once I tell you why

58
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,400
 Then you will you'll you'll go and hit her you'll go to the hospital here

59
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
 I'll let you borrow this bottle of wine a shoplift did one

60
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,720
 Here you can go and you can hit her over the head because you will also want to brain this young woman

61
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,280
 You see and that's when he reaches in with jacket and pulls out a book and they're like, whoa

62
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,600
 We should have we should have checked him. We should have frisked him before we brought him in here

63
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,680
 That could have been anything he goes. This is my book. I wrote this novel. It's the most beautiful novel ever written

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,400
 They're looking at it and it's called the world

65
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,720
 rose

66
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080
 She's pushing the book over pushing the book over to warm hope and they'd pick it up read it

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,800
 They're like just tell us just tell us we're not going to read the book

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,200
 He's like, well, you promise to read the book later. They go, fine

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,200
 So he wrote this book called the world rose. He put it on wattpad, which is an app people can read free stuff

70
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:37,120
 And he then did some edits and published it in page roll and had read it on wattpad and said this sucks

71
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,880
 Is no good. Now. I don't know how detailed her criticism was. I don't know if it was constructive criticism like

72
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,800
 Characters fall flat the world buildings lame the title is uh beyond pathetic

73
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,200
 I guess that's not constructive criticism

74
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,800
 But she could have been very detailed said this is what I do to fix it. But for whatever reason whatever her

75
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,480
 Review was he went nuts. Now. He lived 400 miles away from page

76
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,920
 He drove all the way to her grocery store to hit her over the head and what's funny now that I think about it

77
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,520
 He was able to plan to find her drive out, but he didn't even bring a weapon with him

78
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,600
 He what if they didn't sell alcohol there?

79
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,560
 What if they had no bottles or she was in a weird aisle?

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,920
 But anyway, so poorly poorly planned attack. He gets arrested

81
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,160
 Britain has some real problems with their criminal justice system. He gets found guilty

82
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,760
 He gets sentenced to 30 months in jail. That's not a huge he was attempted murder really

83
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,360
 I mean you could totally kill somebody with that. He gets sentenced to 30 months in jail

84
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,120
 He only does 15 with an indefinite order to never contact page again a month after he's released from jail

85
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,480
 He sends her a letter saying I dreamed of you last night. Are you going to send me back to prison?

86
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,560
 Now he's sending her mail with stuff saying such as nothing is real except our love

87
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,280
 Which we all remember that great hauling out song. I will love you forever. That's

88
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,680
 fairly less creepy and this page is torn because we are torn without each other. So

89
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,360
 She's obviously freaked out. She's contacting the authorities. I don't know if they know where he's at

90
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,960
 honestly because I didn't see any follow-up of him getting arrested again, but

91
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,400
 15 come on Britain. I know America gets gets grief for being too strict

92
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,920
 But this dude's 15 months. They had that terrorist who they had to kill on the London bridge a couple months ago

93
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,840
 He got out. He did seven years for trying to blow up parliament. What's your problem over there?

94
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story now

95
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,800
 I teased this story on yesterday's episode because we talked about smurfs. There was a street gang known as the smurfs

96
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,880
 Let's hop on board the carpenter copter. We're leaving behind Britain for good

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,760
 We're never doing another story from there. Just too many lunatics

98
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,840
 We're flying back to the good old the united states and we're going to

99
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,280
 Any town usa because this was kind of all over the place now in the 1980s. We had a couple different things going on

100
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,080
 We had an explosion of children's media

101
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,520
 Really in the late 70s you started seeing like obviously a fred flin stone stuff like that

102
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,240
 That was more of like a simpson's thing. It was more for like adult sand kids

103
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,520
 Then you had the hannah bar bar cartoon scooby-doo that stuff is late 70s

104
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,400
 But in the 1980s companies decided whoa

105
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,840
 We have the ability to put out a half hour commercial every single day kids will buy our clothes

106
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,840
 There's actually a really cool youtube channel called toy galaxy. I recommend people checking out. It's really cool

107
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,640
 It's super informative their videos are only like 10 15 minutes long

108
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:35,680
 And each video they go back to an old toy line or mostly toy line and they talk about how the toys were

109
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,720
 Designed and made and a lot of them have these weird corporate battles going on in the background

110
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,720
 They'll come out with the toy line and can't get a cartoon launched in time the toy line fizzles

111
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,080
 It's a really cool channel really really talented people on that show

112
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,520
 But you had this thing where you had these cartoons being made and they were a half hour long advertisement

113
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,160
 So you saw an explosion in children's media that has never been replicated

114
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,840
 It really was a great time to be a kid wake up on saturday morning or just come home from school

115
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,320
 You'd have two hours of solid entertainment you had that but then you also had a thing known as the satanic panic

116
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,520
 There were satanists around every corner and it was

117
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,480
 It was a perfect time to be a conspiracy theorist nowadays. We talk about pizza getting all that stuff

118
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,640
 It's all very esoteric. It's all very like this

119
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,640
 Elite cult that runs the world is doing this satanic panic was they're in your neighborhood

120
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
 It wasn't something that was happening in washington dc in your neighborhood

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,800
 Saint worshipers are killing cows in your neighborhood. The reason why you lost your cat is to say it was very like boots on the ground

122
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,760
 conspiracy theory paranoia was everywhere and it was really cool. I mean, I was too. I was probably like

123
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,840
 This story takes place in 1983 mostly. So I would have been

124
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
 Seven when this story was taking place

125
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,600
 But even I was kind of aware because I went to southern baptist church madavis a minister

126
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,560
 This idea that there were satanists around every corner. They were in the highest levels of power

127
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,000
 But you also had like your mailman could be a satanist and as a conspiracy theorist

128
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,680
 It was a really cool time super scary if you believed in it

129
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,000
 But you have this satanic panic going on and what happened was you have the satanic panic

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,080
 Which is this idea that satan worshipers are taking over the united states and really the world and this explosion

131
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,520
 In children's media

132
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,880
 So just like and again guys this all goes and this is why a lot of times I brush off stuff and people go

133
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,080
 What you don't think katie parry is a saint worshiper back when I was a kid

134
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,800
 It was saint worshipers are taking over the country or the world and they're doing it

135
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,600
 They're influencing children by children's cartoons nowadays. It's not saint worshipers. It's illuminati who may or may not worship satan

136
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
 It really depends

137
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,600
 It could be part of some other religious group or they could be atheist whatever

138
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,040
 But now it's the illuminati using music to influence children and stuff like that because and the reason why it's because

139
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,960
 Cartoons don't exist the way they used to people can still say oh, there are still these cartoons with this messaging

140
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,800
 But it used to be that cartoons saturday morning and afternoon cartoons were such an intrinsic part of a child's life

141
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,600
 That if you wanted to affect them, that's how you would do it. The myth has evolved is what I'm saying

142
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,240
 I don't think the illuminati were like damn. Damn it. The cartoons are off and also what used to be saint worshipers

143
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,440
 But now I think the myth evolved. I don't think it was true. I don't think saint worshippers were affecting

144
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,480
 He-man and and smurf cartoons. I don't think that was happening. I don't think the illuminati is controlling katie parry

145
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,680
 It's myths myths will change with the times

146
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,320
 But anyways anyways that all being said satanic panic well back in the 80s

147
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,440
 This was it now a lot of my information is going to come from an article on the paranormal world wiki

148
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,320
 So there's a paranormal world wikipedia not wikipedia, but it's like a wiki. It's a self edited thing

149
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,600
 It's an article called a brief history of killer smurfs and I just want to note take that because that is where I

150
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,760
 I did go and backtrack information, but this gave me a good framework for it

151
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,680
 So I wanted to give credit where credit was due. We talked about a bunch of stuff just now

152
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,680
 A trip down memory road jason's paranoid religious memory road has a southern baptist

153
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,800
 I was taught very very briefly my dad wasn't into a bunch of nonsense and stuff like that

154
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,680
 But there were members of the church who believed that smurfs were demonic and payo who was the anonymous payo was a

155
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,160
 pseudonym for the author of or the creator of smurfs and the rumor was was that payo meant

156
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,880
 Demon in italian, which is not true. I at least I didn't double check it, but I'm pretty sure it's not so it might be

157
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,520
 But anyways the point is is that I heard that briefly my dad as a southern baptist minister thought it was stupid

158
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,800
 Didn't have any problem with me watching it or he man or anything like that

159
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,680
 He probably just figured it kept me quiet kept me from bugging people or actually

160
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,640
 Setting fires and I got in a lot of trouble as a kid

161
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,000
 but anyways

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,720
 The point is is that my dad didn't have problem with it. He is a minister theological

163
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,360
 Studies doctor and all that stuff. He didn't have a problem

164
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,960
 So but lay people lay people in the church may have that being said

165
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,800
 I'm just the reason why I'm saying that is because people in my own religion had a problem with this

166
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,720
 The rest of these examples are going to be about the jojova's witness church

167
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,360
 So not knocking them this type of nonsense can happen in any religious community

168
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,760
 But this a lot of these examples came from members of the jojova's witness church

169
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,800
 Reddit threads from ex-church members and things like that and one thing jojova one thing you can count on jojova's witness to hate

170
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,320
 Is anything supernatural? So when you start to think that smurfs are demons

171
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,360
 You could have southern baptists being like, yeah, I think they were bad influence

172
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,080
 I don't think my kids should play with smurfs jojova's witness pretty much

173
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,480
 According to these ex-members. So again, there might be a bit of a bone to pick

174
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,360
 But according to these ex-members jojova's witness basically went to war with the smurfs now

175
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,680
 They didn't go to war by saying don't buy the well they said don't buy the toys

176
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,040
 Don't watch the cartoon stuff like that

177
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,720
 But they weren't just saying that don't do it because pale means demon

178
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,280
 They were doing it because they believed again allegedly and that's the last time i'm going to say this

179
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,680
 You just insert that word the church's doctrine was that

180
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,240
 The smurfs themselves were demons that could enter our reality

181
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,040
 And here's a couple of little stories that people have said they heard when they were kids

182
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,440
 This young girl is given smurf curtains for her room because smurfs are cute little guys, you know

183
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,840
 Three apples high little blue people put them up

184
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,280
 Have you briny smurf and gopher smurf or whatever poppa smurf and all that stuff and she goes to bed

185
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,400
 Oh, I love my smurf curtains falls asleep

186
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,360
 Wakes up in the middle of the night

187
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,400
 She looks around in the dark room

188
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,480
 That's not her laughing and she's not the crypt keeper

189
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,520
 She's looking around her room. She can't see anything her eyes haven't adjusted yet

190
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,160
 Little feet

191
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,040
 Running around she kind of gets you kind of get the picture smurfs don't have to keep building it

192
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
 Smurfs jumped off of her curtain. You're like, I didn't expect that

193
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,480
 I just expected a different group of smurfs. They're actually the two-dimensional smurfs jumped off the curtain

194
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,400
 Now running around her bedroom. They were dancing and laughing quote satanically

195
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,000
 I have no idea what a satanic laugh would sound like but I mean you figured that would be like, ho ho ho

196
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,320
 That'd be less scary than

197
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,400
 Little little pee run creepy if you heard that story as a kid you wouldn't want to be around smurfs

198
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,200
 Here's another one kid gets smurf wallpaper

199
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,840
 Apparently johova's witness a real problem with flat smurfs

200
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,440
 They're like, oh regular smurf dolls. We'll get to smurf dolls in a second

201
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,040
 But it's weird that two of these stories involve I would not be threatened by a two-dimensional object

202
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,400
 That's funny because the first one these kids are all johova's witness, right?

203
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,120
 But they're like new to the church or they hadn't heard yet that smurfs are demonic

204
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,640
 They just thought it was a cute cartoon the first one the girl gets smurf curtains

205
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
 So you could see like her grandma who's like here

206
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,000
 This is a cute little cartoon sending the curtains the smurfs jump off the curtain start running around this other kid has smurf

207
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,600
 Wallpaper which means they spent eight hours. They had to go to the store by

208
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,960
 Multiple rolls of it take it home get it prepped put it on the walls take a break go eat a sandwich

209
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,840
 Go back up finish putting the wallpaper up be like, ah done and done

210
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,480
 My kid finally has this smurf which I don't know what a smurf is and I haven't heard from my church yet

211
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,800
 Whether or not this is demonic, but here you go

212
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,200
 Click shut off the light this kid supposedly wakes up the next day

213
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,000
 He comes down to eat the meal in the morning

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,800
 He gets up

215
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,600
 He's eating his ego waffles and the parents are like what happened to you and he's covered in little red dots little red bites

216
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,920
 He's like, oh, yeah, what are you gonna do?

217
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,200
 Life sucks and the parents are like what do you have bed? It's funny because in the story the parents asked him

218
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,120
 Are there bugs in your bed?

219
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,080
 Which is not something you would ask you just check

220
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,880
 The parents go did you get bit by a bunch of bugs and he's like, oh though these oh, yeah

221
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,280
 No, no, no not bugs. So remember that wallpaper that you put up yesterday?

222
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,840
 Last night all the smurfs jumped off the wallpaper and bit me. It's funny

223
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,920
 The first one just some curtains and this girl just got laughed at this guy has an entire room full of him

224
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,360
 And he's getting eaten and you know that they then had to remove all that wallpaper before the end of the day

225
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,160
 Which they did and according to the story

226
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,720
 They tried burning it and it wouldn't burn

227
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,280
 So they had to put on copious amounts of gasoline to burn it

228
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,880
 So imagine these stories being told around like a campfire

229
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,080
 At them jojova witness or really I mean I think these apply to any these again are

230
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,120
 Ex jojova witness stories, but I think you could see this with really any religion that's super fundamentalist

231
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,000
 These stories being passed around I would say

232
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,480
 This one's pretty easy

233
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,240
 The last part at least to debunk obviously smurfs did not jump off this guy's wall

234
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,160
 Because smurfs were one of the most popular merchandising thing and people in the 80s were not covered in red welts

235
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,560
 You did not see a Madonna video where she's dancing around and she's just covered in red welts

236
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,720
 That was not something that I don't know why Madonna would have smurf wallpaper

237
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,680
 My point is is that everyone had smurfs and not everyone had red dots on them

238
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,880
 But that being said let's say they put it up the kid has nightmares. They pull the wallpaper down

239
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,120
 They try to lay it on a fire. It doesn't burn. What if somebody told you that part of the story? What is the rational answer for it?

240
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,800
 It's probably fire retardant wallpaper, which would make sense

241
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,480
 Right like sometimes you have to be skeptical about this stuff

242
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,880
 This next story might be one of my favorite stories. I've covered on dead rabbit radio in a long time

243
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,480
 This story apparently is a friend of a friend type of story. The guy telling this story saying hey

244
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,480
 I wasn't there when this happened, but my friend was so this family recently joins the Jehovah's Witness church

245
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,640
 Their new converts they're walking into the temple and their kid is carrying a smurf doll

246
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,240
 Now I don't know if he has it visible because again at this point

247
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,720
 The church is at open war with these blue creatures. They've heard in Kentucky that I can't got a bunch of red welts

248
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,240
 Red welts are all over the country, but the media is covering it up

249
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,080
 They're burning trying to burn people's wallpaper houses are catching up fire

250
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,800
 They're at open war with the smurfs. This kid though brings in a smurf doll

251
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,040
 So maybe he has it hidden in his jacket

252
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,320
 Nobody sees it or maybe everyone's facing the other way

253
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,080
 He brings it into the church and he's sitting there with his smurf doll and the service is going on as normal

254
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,840
 I've never been to a Jehovah's Witness temple. So I don't really know how it's done

255
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,480
 But I'm just going to assume for the second narrative

256
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
 It's like Southern Baptist church where you go and you sing a couple songs

257
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,640
 Minister gives a speech or sermon is actually what it's called. You do the offering and then it's over with

258
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,440
 So they're doing that. They're halfway through the sermon guys up there talking about Jehovah's Witness stuff

259
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,280
 And the smurf doll this kid's holding the smurf doll, right? He's just sitting listening church probably bored

260
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,360
 I slept a lot in church. He's listening and then in the middle of the sermon

261
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 The smurf doll jumps out of the kid's lap and lands in the aisle

262
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,800
 So most churches have pews on both sides and there's a large aisle in the middle the smurf doll springs to life

263
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,400
 So that's a miracle right there. That's beyond signs

264
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,360
 jumps out of the kid's lap and lands and is now standing in the middle of the aisle

265
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,920
 And he goes quote

266
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,240
 I'm sick of this shit

267
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
 It turns around and walks out

268
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,520
 Now let's just call a spade a spade that if that story is true if that story is true

269
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,280
 I was attending Jehovah's Witness or any church. I'm attending. I'm the Southern Baptist

270
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,520
 I'm sitting there. I'm half awake

271
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,080
 And my dad's given a sermon and I'm like, uh, I can't wait till I get home and play some more Legend of Zelda

272
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,000
 And then I hear a rustling behind me and I turn around and I see

273
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
 a one foot tall

274
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,640
 Smurf doll on the floor in the aisle and I'm like did a kid throw that and then at that moment the doll begins to

275
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 Stand up on its own

276
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,840
 Look at my dad and go. I'm sick of this shit

277
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,080
 I would renounce all home religion. I would if that happened

278
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,440
 I'd say my god can't do that

279
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,680
 Do that god be him throwing transformers on the ground do it do it as the smurf is strutting out of the building

280
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,160
 That would

281
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,400
 Completely change everything now you could say jason. That's the work of the devil. I'm not saying I'd start worshiping the devil or smurf

282
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,040
 I'm just saying that would be a pretty

283
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,440
 That's ridiculous. That story is so it's funny

284
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,200
 But it's so ridiculous because it would completely change the game

285
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:39,040
 If you not only saw a doll walking through church, but then blasphemy your religion and bounce

286
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,680
 I would that would totally change

287
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:48,320
 Everything everyone in that church should have been a convert to something. I'm not saying again. They're like, hey, old satan

288
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,080
 They're worshiping smurf ed, but it would really make you reconsider where you're at

289
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,840
 And there's another part of this story. Where did the smurf go?

290
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:06,800
 Because it's a one foot tall doll, right? And it says i'm done your sermon sucks. He turns he walks out of the

291
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
 temple

292
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,320
 And then what?

293
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,640
 And this is the problem with a lot of these stories. I mean, obviously this story is pretty ridiculous

294
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
 But a lot of these stories you have to ask and

295
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,920
 So let's say someone legitimately tells you this story. They said that they were here and they saw this thing happen

296
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,520
 You would go I think most people do this they go. Oh, that's interesting

297
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,320
 They do that with ghost stories and UFO stories and all sorts of stuff

298
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,640
 But you really have to go and so the doll leaves the temple

299
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,880
 It obviously doesn't have a magical power. It doesn't disappear or a ball of flame appears

300
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,640
 So it doesn't have the ability to teleport it actually has to walk out of the temple

301
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,240
 And then what is it standing on the street corner? Is it waiting for a bus? Does a small car show up?

302
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,560
 So as you jump in the bushes, is he still out there? Did he have to get a job as a day laborer because he's trapped in our reality

303
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
 In this cotton filled body

304
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,480
 Where is he if the parishioners had followed him out what they've seen him walking down the street and trying to hail a taxi and

305
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,600
 Realize that he doesn't have any money and then he has to go and like start like panhandling and said like

306
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,160
 And these are the questions that need to be asked when you have these stories and I get it. I love the story

307
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,720
 I think it's absolutely fun. It would make me completely question the existence of my god

308
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,880
 If this thing could just magically do this it would absolutely blow my mind

309
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,040
 If at all could just get away with that in a church totally unopposed

310
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,240
 But then the other part is logically where does the doll? Does it go to a toy store?

311
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,120
 Even then it would get to the toy store couldn't open it up. Does it go to like a bin at a goodwill?

312
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,040
 There's so many questions to this

313
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,920
 How did it even reach the doorknob of the church where the door's open could put enough for like no, okay now

314
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:52,640
 I'm nipping now. I'm nipping but I'm sure ghosts can inhabit dolls. I own one by the way, but I don't think it'll ever move

315
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,480
 I don't think toys can ever move. I think the locomotion just simply wasn't work

316
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,360
 There's no proof that that could ever happen, but let's go to this story

317
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,680
 There was someone who was saying that again, Joe was a witness on this thread

318
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,800
 They go I have a smurf story and I as a kid I had never ever heard

319
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,000
 That smurfs were satanic like I just happened to have one and my family didn't know about it

320
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,480
 It wasn't till a way later that I heard the story

321
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,960
 But I had a smurf doll and it was a big smurf doll and he never liked it never liked the doll

322
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,560
 He had a weird feeling about it and one day he was in his room all by himself

323
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,440
 And he watched the doll stand up

324
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,160
 and kind of begin walking around the room

325
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,760
 And he said it was not a cute walk. It wasn't like a doot. Doot. Doot. It was like a

326
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,920
 The way it almost stalked the room. It had a very creepy walk about it

327
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,000
 And then the kid ran out of the room screaming and just thought it was a weird event

328
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,720
 Maybe made up in his head and then later on in life

329
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,960
 He had learned that joe was witness didn't like smurfs there satanic stuff like that

330
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,400
 You know stories just that stupid because again

331
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,720
 If this was possible

332
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,120
 Then dolls would be the dolls would be walking everywhere

333
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,880
 They would have declared open war on the joe hovis witness or anyone else who opposed them

334
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,320
 They everyone everyone in part of these religions would have been locked up because they'd been like the smurfs did or the smurfs did it

335
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,360
 If a doll can walk a doll can set a fire if a doll can walk a doll can smother a child

336
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,800
 If a doll can do these things and they're demonically possessed

337
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,040
 Then you should you should have seen mass casualty events in the 1980s

338
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,120
 Unless a doll drove a truck into the marine barracks in libya. They weren't doing these things

339
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,680
 So a doll getting up and walking across the room spookily is not

340
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:38,000
 This is eternal war between good and evil and the stake is the rest of time and space

341
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,160
 And demons are making dolls walk out of churches. It doesn't make sense

342
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,040
 They should have been like suicide bombers or something like that if these demons can do this

343
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,040
 Then all they were doing was walking out of churches and walking around rooms with one person in it. Congrats

344
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,280
 Forces of evil. Great job. However, I'm gonna end this on a personal story

345
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,720
 And the story might sound just as stupid as the rest, but I don't think so

346
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,600
 I used to have a serious problem with freddy kruger

347
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,840
 I actually used to not be able to watch horror movies at all

348
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,480
 I was super super scared of him and I'd go to school

349
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,240
 I remember going elementary school and kids would be like, oh, yeah, I'm the new freddy krugman movie

350
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,160
 He's playing this kid like nintendo and he's like now you're playing with power

351
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,600
 And he like cuts the kids veins out and he uses them like a marionette puppet

352
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,200
 And how I imagined it in my head was always 10 times worse than the movies were

353
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,760
 I actually ended up watching the movies years later, but I remember being so terrified of jason freddy and michael miers and all this stuff

354
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,400
 to the point of almost like

355
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,400
 Mental illness level a pair. I don't want to say mental illness, but I was

356
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,560
 Stone cold petrified of these villains that I'd only heard of I'd never actually seen any of the movies

357
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,320
 I'd seen commercials though. I knew what they looked like

358
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,600
 I would would just kind of freeze in my tracks and I lived a lot with my grandma and my great grandma

359
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,800
 And they're great houses full of lovely people and people who love me

360
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,320
 But also they're pretty creepy and I have seen ghosts a lot at my grandma's house

361
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,120
 And I'm sure that my great grandma's house had some issues as well

362
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,560
 There was one room that was super spooky that I didn't ever feel comfortable going into that was kind of sealed off from the rest of the house, but

363
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,280
 I remember one night I was sitting I had one of those brave star

364
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,480
 You guys remember brave you guys are like no, I don't remember brave star brave star

365
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,320
 They actually had like these 12 inch tall action figures and it was a cowboy in space

366
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,480
 It was this native american character in the 25th century. He was a cowboy on this planet called new texas. I think it was

367
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,960
 I know a bunch of you guys are like. Oh, yeah, I remember that

368
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,560
 They're really cool toys

369
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:36,000
 There's like space cowboys he had a talking horse a topic talking cyborg horse that could stand on all fours and punch people

370
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,680
 In the face with its metal hoof. I mean, that's the end of every episode

371
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,240
 Just smashing dudes heads

372
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,080
 But the bad guy was like this outlaw was this alien outlaw was this purple guy and I had both of them

373
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,600
 I had brave star and the purple guy. I don't think I had the horse, but I really loved that cartoon

374
00:27:51,600 --> 00:28:00,000
 And I remember one day I was sitting in this chair at my grandma's house that it's funny because I loved that chair

375
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
 Like I haven't been in my grandma's house in eight years, but I just love that. I miss that chair so much

376
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,240
 I miss my grandma obviously too not just the chair

377
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,280
 But you know, you just had that place was my home like that little corner of that house is my home

378
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:18,320
 Anyway, so enough of memory lane. I'm holding this as I go to tell a story for memory lane. I'm holding this toy

379
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,480
 This brave star toy this bad guy is he was the bad guy's name. His name wasn't just bad guy. I forgot his name

380
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,680
 I'm not gonna look it up. The the point is is that I'm holding this purple doll

381
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,760
 It was probably like 10 o'clock at night. I'm I think I was like older. I think it was like

382
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,640
 10 or 11 or something like that 12 maybe old enough

383
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,560
 I shouldn't be scared of the dark anymore, right? But I'm still scared of the dark

384
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:48,880
 I'm holding this doll and it's late. I'm watching something on television and I remember something made me look at the doll

385
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,520
 I'm holding this doll and I'm looking at it

386
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,560
 and

387
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,080
 Obviously I'm not on any drugs. I'm a child

388
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,480
 Wasn't on any night quill nothing like that. It's totally lucid. I'm looking at this doll

389
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,440
 And its face is already kind of an alien face. It's already kind of like wrinkly

390
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,280
 But for more than a brief second or more than just the second it wasn't a flash

391
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,080
 And I know what I saw

392
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,520
 The face of freddy kruger appeared on the doll

393
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,840
 Now

394
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,720
 The flesh changed because the alien's purple. So now it became like flesh

395
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
 The scarring was there the look in his eyes

396
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,480
 It was freddy kruger's head

397
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,520
 on this doll's body

398
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,240
 And I threw the doll and I screamed in a panic

399
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,720
 a panic

400
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
 I ran through my grandma's house

401
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,360
 I jumped into my grandma's bed

402
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,040
 Probably broke it and they're like damages and the springs are they're like, oh they all get thrown out

403
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,960
 I was quite a chubby child. I guess that makes that joke makes more sense now

404
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,400
 Jumping into my grandma's bed. I didn't tell him what I saw it sound crazy

405
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,480
 crazy

406
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,600
 But I know what I saw now is it

407
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,320
 realistic to think that this

408
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,280
 fictional character a fictional demon

409
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,880
 And we actually did an episode he's based on a true story, but it wasn't freddy kruger's dream demon

410
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,240
 That's an old episode but check that one out, but the um

411
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,680
 Is it possible that a fictional character jumped into my toy? No, it's not it's not at all. It's completely ridiculous, right?

412
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,320
 But that's what I saw

413
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,900
 That's what I saw. I saw something that was completely ridiculous and impossible

414
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:49,120
 And I can talk trash about dolls walking and say well if my doll wasn't walking it just changed into a fictional character

415
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,400
 They're both ridiculous, but as much as I was going on the story and kind of taken it apart

416
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,520
 In the back of my mind i'm thinking yeah, but I had my own creepy experience with the toy now again

417
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,760
 There's a huge line between seeing a doll face morph into your childhood fear

418
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,200
 and

419
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,160
 Do whole interrupting a sermon in front of 30 people and walking out and then catching a bus back to smurf village

420
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,440
 There is a huge difference

421
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,800
 But as far as like just the childlike wonderment of having a toy and having a world of evil

422
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,520
 interfere with that because

423
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,840
 I don't think that freddie kruger's face was in that doll

424
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,520
 But something was

425
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,320
 Was it a ghost?

426
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,240
 Was it a demon?

427
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
 was it

428
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,560
 Something in my head a hallucination

429
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,880
 Who knows?

430
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,520
 I think I lean more towards ghost. It's most likely was hallucination, but again

431
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:54,320
 Forget that because that's mundane and that puts all the blame on me ghost, but most likely a demon because what else would want to scare a child like that?

432
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,760
 So if demons wanted to inhabit toys

433
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:06,720
 They wouldn't want to walk around in broad daylight unless again, they were declaring open war which obviously they either can or they can't and they haven't

434
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,280
 So that makes me think they can't but it doesn't mean that there would be totally wrong to just inhabit a toy

435
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,840
 just inhabit a toy

436
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:21,280
 Just to make children feel uncomfortable because a demon wants to

437
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,000
 Hurt you but if it can't physically hurt you it wants to hurt your psyche

438
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,480
 So it doesn't have to get up and walk around it doesn't have to laugh creepily or bite you in the middle of the night or critique your sermons

439
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,120
 It just has to sit in the darkness of your room and make you feel uncomfortable in the one place you should feel comfortable your own home

440
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,360
 It can sit there and just draw off

441
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,440
 The negative energy you're giving it and in return making you feel more and more uncomfortable

442
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,080
 to the point where you fear

443
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,960
 Being in your room where you fear

444
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,000
 everything

445
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,920
 A demon doesn't have to jump up and walk around and bite you to be effective

446
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:08,800
 A demon just has to make you scared of it and it's even smarter if the demon can make you scared of

447
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:15,280
 Something you can't place your finger on it. You don't know for sure if it's that doll or your room

448
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,400
 You just feel uneasy

449
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,720
 Psychological warfare but on a spiritual level

450
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,600
 That's the true satanic panic

451
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:34,320
 You never know where it's at you never know where it's coming from you're paranoid of everything so you don't know where to direct your resources

452
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,600
 And that's easy to pull off

453
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,240
 You don't need to control the entertainment industry

454
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:48,080
 You just need to wage this war one bedroom at a time one frightened child at a time

455
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,920
 Children are our future

456
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,960
 And if you can make them scared of everything

457
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,560
 When it's time to fight

458
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,120
 They won't even be able to overcome their own fears

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,240
