1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Is it possible that the path to unlimited riches were inside of us all along?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,640
 Then we travel back in time to the year of World War II, when a young soldier about to be killed

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,960
 overdoses on meth and goes on an amazing journey.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:28,480
 And then we travel to Falkville, Alabama to meet a young sheriff who gets a mysterious call one

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,560
 night. Was it a call from the future? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:45,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,680
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. We've got a lot of

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,800
 stuff to cover, so let's go ahead and now we're gonna put on our overalls here, put on our hazmat

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,680
 suits. Helmet comes down, breathing apparatus. We're not going to China. We are actually going

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,640
 to Japan. Now as far as I know everything's fine over there and you're wondering why do we have

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,280
 this suit on. Well we're gonna get dirty. We're gonna get dirty. We're gonna go straight up

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,520
 Christina Aguilera. That's a dated reference. Where people are like, what does she just not

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,640
 bathe? That's an old song. It's older than you guys. We're going to Japan. We're walking through

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,440
 the sewers and we're shining our flashlight and you're like, is there some sort of cryptid down

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,560
 here? Like why are we here? Is there like a Japanese sewer cryptid? I'm like, no, actually. And I

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,920
 reached my hand that, now I want to say this too before I go any further. Dead Rabbit Radio has

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,200
 not become the butt show. I know there's been a lot of butt stories recently, but we're not the

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,000
 butt show, okay? There's just been a string of butt stories. So now I reach my hand and no pile of poop.

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,880
 And I pull out some poop and I begin sifting through it and you're like, oh, Jason, come on,

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,440
 have we really come to this? And I turn around and I go as I'm turning around, I turn around fast

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,760
 and it flies and hits you in the mask. I go, what I'm holding right here is so much more than human

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,560
 poop. Snap my finger. Now we are in an archaeological place. We're in a desert, right? There's a bunch

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,520
 of caves and stuff and dirt. Wherever archaeologists are known to gather, you know when I was a little

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,280
 kid I wanted to be an archaeologist. I thought that'd be such a cool job. Being a podcaster,

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,720
 though, is way doper. Less women, women hate, I don't even tell women I'm a podcaster anymore.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,080
 It's a huge turn off. So there's less women, but also I don't have to worry about doing this.

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,320
 So these archaeologists, what they're doing, I'll just do it with my words. People have to do this

28
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,240
 for real life. They're finding human poop, like fossilized human poop. This is in Fallon, Nevada.

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 Now that I looked over at my notes, we're not just in the nondescript desert. We're in the

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,240
 desert known as Nevada. They're finding these poop, these archaeologists, and they're like,

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:06,560
 break them in half. And they can see corn in them, but it's not just any corn. This is corn

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,920
 from the second harvest. So what has been going on for thousands of years is you eat corn and then

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,880
 you poop it out and then you eat the corn again. You pick it out of your, I'm sorry, you're like

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,600
 eating a bowl of corn right now. You're like, I'm going to save this episode for Thanksgiving and

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,920
 you're like, do you poop out the corn? You mm-mm-mm-mm, and the corn there doesn't get digested. You

36
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,240
 pull out of your poop and you eat it again. And you're like, so what, so is that why we're in Japan?

37
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,200
 Are they known, Japanese people known for their massive corn consumption? I'm like, we'll get to

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,120
 that in a second, because I pat you on the back. First off, let's talk more about this, the second

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,720
 harvest. Wait, no, I'm done with that part. Here's some other poop facts. That's what this note is,

40
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,280
 that's what this segment is actually labeled in my notes, poop facts. Old-timey doctors,

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,160
 now where you appear in like grease or something, a hero notice is hanging out. Hey, what's up hero?

42
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,400
 Hey, what's up guys? He hasn't been on the show for a long time, but we walk up. I actually wash

43
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,360
 my hands, give him the cool secret dead rabbit handshake. You don't know that yet. You're not

44
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,360
 down like me and Dotaus. And he's like, hey guys, come check this out. And there's this doctor

45
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,560
 talking to some dude and he goes, I think you're sick. And the guy's like, I'm obviously sick.

46
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,280
 That's why I'm at the doctors. But back in old-timey days, doctor, I don't understand this. Like,

47
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,280
 I understand like eating corn, you're starving, eat some corn, and you're like, oh, I can't wait

48
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,520
 for my next meal. Just got to digest it first. I get that. But I don't get this. The doctor,

49
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,320
 back in the old times, you'd poop for the doctor. You do that nowadays, but you'd poop for the doctor

50
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:53,760
 and the doctor would taste your poop. Tastes like you have a bit of cholera, a little bit of gonorrhea.

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,880
 There, I lost all my listeners. Now let's the episode really begin.

52
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,280
 I'll start reading off number stations for my Russian handlers. No, for my listeners who stayed

53
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,120
 past that disgusting joke, the doctors would taste your poop. I don't understand. You just look at

54
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,920
 it. It's either watery, full of blood, or normal. There, I've diagnosed you. I'm a better doctor

55
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,520
 than old-timey. Let's say goodbye to hero Dottis. Now we're going to Finland, where they did a study

56
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,080
 recently. And they do a study of men in Finland who are into SNDM, which is what, like eight guys.

57
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,120
 Like, how many people in Finland are into this? Maybe it's more than eight. But anyways, they did

58
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:41,200
 a study. And out of all the men, out of all eight men in Finland who are into SNDM stuff, 18% of

59
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,800
 them at some point in their life ate human poop. You're like, Jason, please stop with the poop facts.

60
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,240
 I'm like, one more thing, because this is actually fascinating. We're back in the sewers of Japan

61
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,680
 and you're like, damn it. And I'm standing there and I go, this is actually fascinating. So that's

62
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,840
 all poop facts. But we've talked about second harvest with the corn. Because I'm eating cornbread.

63
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,600
 You're like, how did you get that in your hazmat suit? A man who's hungry has ways. So then I tell

64
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,120
 you that in Japan, they figured this out. If you take the poop of one million, this is true,

65
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,040
 they're doing this right now. If you take the poop of one million people, it can be worth up to

66
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:32,560
 $13 million. Japan has actually built a processing plant that goes through all the poop and separates

67
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,280
 like heavy metals, like you little bit of aero smith in there, little bit of Metallica. They

68
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,960
 separate like a lot. There's a lot of gold in human poop from the water because they actually said

69
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,080
 there's so much gold in the oceans that it would devastate the there's more gold in the oceans

70
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,440
 than humanity would ever, ever need. It's just very, very expensive to pull out more gold in the

71
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,200
 oceans floating around than you could ever find mining in the cave. But we can't take too much

72
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,120
 to actually get it out of the ocean. But we drink it. And when people poop, a million people's poop

73
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,840
 will contain up to $13 million of gold of platinum. I don't know about platinum. That might hurt

74
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,400
 coming out. But gold and all these other minerals that people like a big old gemstone, you're like,

75
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,880
 oh, shouldn't have eaten that hope diamond. So Japan's built a processing plant that actually

76
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,360
 filters through your poop and eat everyone's poop has just microscopic fibers. Don't do this

77
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
 yourself. You don't have a microscope like you're not and you don't have the poop of a million people.

78
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,080
 But I mean, sure you can maybe get like a nugget over the course of your life. You're like,

79
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 it's struck gold. As you're just dying of dysentery. But if you take a poop of a million people,

80
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,080
 you can make a ton of money. The other minerals now that I'm looking back on my notes,

81
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,880
 silver and copper, and they've said they're the bill is processing plant. There is more gold in

82
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,760
 the poop of Japanese. I have show notes. I'm not making this up. There is more gold in the poop of

83
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:08,480
 Japanese people than there is gold that's estimated to be in the Japanese, the main Japanese goldmine.

84
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,720
 And that main Japanese goldmine is one of the top goldmines on the planet. And there's not even that

85
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,000
 many Japanese people. There's what like 13 million, 20 million, something like that. So their poop

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,560
 has more, just their poop has more gold in it than is estimated to be in this one of the best

87
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,000
 goldmines in America. So I have really no way to wrap that story up. I find it fascinating.

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 But anyways, that's enough of poop facts because I realized I've been talking for

89
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,160
 quite a long time about that. Let's go ahead. It is fascinating though that all that gold,

90
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,680
 them's gold and them our butts. And I think we're going to cool off on the butt stories for a while.

91
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:53,440
 I actually have like two or three more. But we've had a lot of butt stories recently. One of them,

92
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
 I was just like, I'm not going to do this one. And then we've just done a lot of butt stuff recently.

93
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,400
 So we're going to cool off on butt stories for a while, but they will be lurking in the

94
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,320
 shadows of the show. So anyways, now we are going to Finland. So let's hop on board the

95
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:18,640
 carpenter copter, take off our hazmat suits. We're flying over to Finland. We're going back

96
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,200
 to March 18th, 1944. Now this story was recommended by Inio. Really, really appreciate the recommendation

97
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:34,080
 Inio. Fascinating story. We're going to be in Finland. Oh, dude, maybe this guy's, I didn't make

98
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,120
 this connection. Maybe this guy is one of the 18 dudes who's into S&M. The whole, the whole

99
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,040
 rest of the story, you're going to be like checking his fingers. She's like, no, I swear it was simply

100
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,040
 a Hershey's bar I was eating with peanuts and corn and a little bit of gold flakes on his fingers.

101
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:59,920
 We're like, come on, man. This guy's name is Aimo Koyvun. Ivo Koyvunen. We're just going to call

102
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,040
 him Aimo, obviously, because I can pronounce that. Aimo is a member of the ski patrol for Finland.

103
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,800
 Now, spoiler alert, he's with the Nazis. So I don't want you to get your hopes up into this

104
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,240
 being. He's basically powered by Nazi meth this whole story. So don't, if you're a budding screen

105
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,080
 writer, don't be like, oh, I can't wait to write this, write this script. This is a main story.

106
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,400
 No one's going to make it. It's never going to get made. Just roll with it. This guy is a

107
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:34,560
 supporter of the Nazi regime. And 1944, Soviets are basically curb stomping people at this point.

108
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,320
 He's on ski patrol with about like, I think it's like 10 other dudes, right? They're on this thing.

109
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,880
 And they're kind of just skiing around looking for troops and stuff like that. And then like one of

110
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,920
 them stubs their toe and they're like, man, I really kind of love the pain I'm feeling. And Imo's

111
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,600
 like, hmm, another convert to the cause. I wonder if I can get him to eat poop as well. But before

112
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,120
 he can test his theory before he's converted another man to the SNDEM lifestyle, they're attacked.

113
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,640
 Soviet troops throwing those old timey grenades with like the sticks on them.

114
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,160
 And then Imo's like, no, I will fight. I will fight to the valiant end for my Nazi allies.

115
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,480
 But eventually they just totally get overrun. And Imo's like, you know what, screw the Nazis.

116
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,800
 I'm out of here. Now Imo starts skiing down the mountain and the Soviets are not known for being

117
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,280
 quitters. So they go in pursuit of him. Now we're in a military unit now. And let's say I'm the commander,

118
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,600
 obviously, and you're my second in command, because you're totally awesome. And then we got a bunch

119
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 of other bums to do the rest of our stuff. You may carry like the communication equipment,

120
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,440
 this other dude's carrying the maps, and this other dude's like the medic, he's carrying the medic bags.

121
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,680
 We may have, I may have like a map on me, you may have a couple of band-aids on you,

122
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,240
 but for the most part, it's kind of divided up like that. Imo takes off down the mountain

123
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,120
 and he has Purvitan, which was basically factory made methamphetamines. We've talked about this on

124
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,000
 the show before, the Nazi war machine, really the Nazi economy was run on Purvitan. They're

125
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,200
 handing it out. You take it, it was a pet pill, and it was methamphetamine. And when you're out on

126
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,600
 patrol, you want to stay up all night. So his job was to carry the Purvitan for the entire squadron.

127
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,400
 But now he's the only one left, right? And he's trying to outrun the Soviets and he's like,

128
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,240
 "Uh-oh, this is not good because there these dudes do not take prisoners." Again, the Soviet Union

129
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,280
 not knowing for quitting and not knowing for taking prisoners. He's going down the mountain

130
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:40,240
 and he gets a break and he goes, "Hey man, in for a penny, in for a pound." He takes 30 doses

131
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,400
 of these methamphetamine pills. Enough for the entire squad.

132
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,040
 You're supposed to take like one a day, right? He's like, "Gulp." Because if you think about it,

133
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:58,320
 if the drugs don't kill you, the Soviets will. So pick your poison. He takes these pills. He gets

134
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:06,320
 a short burst of energy, which is an understatement, right? I'm sure the short burst of energy was

135
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,320
 his heart literally exploding, pausing matrix style. The camera rotated around it and then it

136
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,480
 reconfigured itself. And he's like, "Ugh, going down this hill." Then surprise, surprise, he enters

137
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:27,120
 a delirium and then blacks out. He wakes up the next day and he has no supplies. He has no idea

138
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,000
 where he's at. But he's still high as a kite. And then the Soviets get up to him and start shooting.

139
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,680
 And he was like, "Oh man, not this again. I was already trying to get the bugs out of my skin

140
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,960
 and now these Soviets are after me again. What a world. He's going down the mountain, throwing

141
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,280
 those old-timey grenades." Now he obviously gets away because he's on 30 doses of meth.

142
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,920
 He didn't fall asleep, mind you. He simply blacked out. His body just couldn't handle it.

143
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,240
 He goes, he goes, he goes, he goes. And then as he's getting away from them, he's like,

144
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,920
 "I don't see him anymore. It's clear." He steps on a landmine and gets blown into a ditch.

145
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:14,400
 Uuuuuck. And he lays there for a week. So his countrymen find him, they take him to a doctor.

146
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,360
 He's been in this ditch for, he got blown up by a landmine. And I think his leg got blown off,

147
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,840
 but it didn't say that in the notes. I'm just assuming human physics, that's what happened.

148
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,160
 But maybe the meth reconstructed it. He gets taken to a hospital and when he starts to find out,

149
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,960
 like, what had happened, he was 250 miles away from where he started with his group.

150
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,400
 And when they took him to the hospital, so he had been chased by the Soviets, blown up by a

151
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,720
 landmine, ended in a ditch, and then a week later he's found, when they take him to the hospital

152
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,720
 a week later, his heart rate is still 200 beats per minute. He was still that high on meth.

153
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,040
 And what's interesting about this, I don't know how big he was before, but when they took him in,

154
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,240
 he was super emaciated. Because again, your heart thinks you're running a marathon. He was only 94

155
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,320
 pounds. And he said that whole week when he's laying in the ditch, all he did was eat pine buds

156
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,920
 and at a certain point, a sparrow or some sort of bird flew down, he grabbed and just ate it raw.

157
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,000
 Which is what you would expect from somebody on enough meth for an entire patrol squadron.

158
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,320
 They could just grab a bird out. The fact that he could grab a bird out of the air

159
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,040
 is proof of meth enough. Now what's funny is, a long time ago, it did an episode about meth

160
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,880
 in mortality and I was making fun of all these people who said how awesome meth was.

161
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,920
 And one of the guys said, who was like pro meth, said meth turns you into Superman.

162
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,160
 There's the story of the ski patrol that went fought for 10 days on, this is what he's referring to.

163
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,640
 And it's funny because in that episode I said I could find no proof of this claim.

164
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,400
 And here we are a year later, NEO sends me this story that must have been the story that this,

165
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,760
 now obviously it's changed, if I remember correctly, he was saying the whole squadron was like fighting

166
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,040
 for a week on it and this dude was just running for a week on it.

167
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,920
 Regardless of who was on it, it is fascinating that he just didn't simply die of a heart attack.

168
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:19,360
 But that is the story of Imo. Superman? Super meth head? Who knows? We do know one thing,

169
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,560
 he is able to catch birds. Think about Superman faster than a bird, no that's not it. What is it?

170
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,160
 Wait, what's this thing? Superman jumps higher than a building,

171
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,600
 outruns a train faster than an locomotive, can jump a building with a single bound.

172
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,600
 You know why that's in there? Because he didn't fly originally, he could just jump really far,

173
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,520
 which made more sense. Faster than a speeding bullet, it doesn't matter.

174
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,840
 What's, oh it's a bird, it's a plane, never mind. The joke, the joke was failed before I even started it.

175
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,240
 Let's see if I can recover it. He's like Superman, Superman's faster than a bird.

176
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,840
 Never mind, dang it. He's not faster than a bird, everything's faster than a bird.

177
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,120
 What is it? It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman. Yeah, can you imagine a bird that big

178
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,120
 that you would mistake it with a human, a bulletproof human, jumping over your city? You're like,

179
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,400
 that's a big bird. But we'll leave behind Finland, we'll leave behind him and his

180
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,600
 kimp wearing friends that he was reunited with after the war. We are now headed to Falkville,

181
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,200
 Alabama. So let's hop on back and board the Carbender Coptor.

182
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:33,440
 We're gonna land in this dude's front yard. We're looking in the window,

183
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,680
 it's gonna be another episode where we're just kind of, we're dressed up as cops,

184
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,520
 so this is gonna be another episode where we're just staring inside people's windows the whole time.

185
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,520
 I just like wearing this cop uniform. Gives me a sense of power, gives me a sense of respect.

186
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,680
 You're like, Jason, okay. Weird. Anyways, we're looking in this window. It's October 18th, 1973,

187
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:01,440
 it's Falkville, Alabama. And we see Sheriff, we see Chief of Police Jeff Greenhaugh, 26 years old,

188
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,320
 walking around. His lovely wife is there as well, it's 10 p.m. He gets a phone call. Sheriff, I mean,

189
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,680
 Chief of Police, as you know what he is, he has to look at his own notes, he looks at the table,

190
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,240
 he's like, oh, that's who I am. Chief of Police Greenhaugh, and the voice on the line is so

191
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,960
 panicked woman. Chief of Police Greenhaugh, you have to come out, there's something out in the

192
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,640
 field, there's something really weird going on out in this abandoned field that'll give you

193
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,000
 directions to, and he's right down in directions, he's like, yeah, I'm kind of vaguely aware of

194
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 that field. Thank you, madam. I will take care of it. Okay, click. He gets in his patrol car.

195
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,040
 Now, we're gonna hide in the trunk, right? We're all snuggled up in the trunk, the car's super

196
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,320
 bumpy, he's like, oh, should have gotten his shocks fixed, but he didn't. So, I'm trying to drink a

197
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,560
 milkshake in there, and it's spilling all over you. I'm like, anyway, so now we get out, you're

198
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,560
 covering your milkshake, and he's walking around this empty lot, this empty field, really. It's

199
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,480
 abandoned road, empty field. Now, he brought his normal police stuff, accruements, accruements,

200
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,760
 I don't know, stuff. He brings his stuff with him. He has like his gun and his badge and his

201
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,400
 flashlight, but he also, for whatever reason, at last minute, grabbed the Polaroid camera,

202
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,000
 which wasn't part of his normal gear. And so, he's looking around, looking around this field

203
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,600
 trying to get his flashlight. He doesn't see anything. He gets in his car, he drives around a

204
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,480
 bit, and he's like, I'm gonna have to find out. You know, it's funny, I didn't even get that woman's

205
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,320
 name. There's just such a panicked person telling me to come out here. I hope it's not an ambush or

206
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,320
 something. So, he decides to do one more drive around, and that's when he sees, he didn't see

207
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,280
 this previously, but now he sees, 15 feet in front of his car, something standing there.

208
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,600
 He gets out of the car. What in the world? Shines his flashlight for a little bit more light.

209
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:57,120
 It's the size of a child encased completely in metal. Here's a quote from Greenhaugh himself.

210
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:05,280
 "It looked like his head and neck were kind of made together. He was real bright, something like

211
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:12,800
 rubbing mercury on nickel. But just as smooth as glass, different angles give different lighting.

212
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,120
 When I saw him standing in the middle of the road, I immediately stopped the car and asked if he was

213
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,960
 a foreigner, but no sound came out of his mouth. He said that the child began to walk in a herky

214
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,360
 jerky motion, like a robot would, like a 1950s robot would on television. Seemed to have an

215
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,120
 antenna sticking out, and it didn't seem to be concerned that Greenhaugh was looking at it.

216
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,280
 So, Greenhaugh reaches into his car, pulls out his Polaroid camera,

217
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,960
 takes a photo. The robot's still just standing there in the beams of his car.

218
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,920
 Another photo comes out. Robot turns a little bit towards him.

219
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:08,640
 Third photo. The creature, whatever it is, 15 feet away from Chief of Police Greenhaugh,

220
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:19,200
 looks at him. One more photo taken, and then the creature takes off so fast.

221
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,920
 He can barely even register it's moving. Greenhaugh gets in his car,

222
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:30,480
 has an old-timey siren. He's taken off, but again, this is an abandoned road, this is a dirt field.

223
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,280
 He's trying to chase it, but he can't go over 35 miles an hour without completely destroying the car.

224
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,040
 He tries it, but this thing is moving so fast, it is out of sight. It's gone.

225
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,520
 The photos are very famous. They're available online. You can actually check them out. They're

226
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,360
 all going to be in the show notes. You can actually just Google as well, "Fuckville Alien."

227
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:57,200
 "Falkville." That came out wrong that other time, but they're available. It basically looks like a

228
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,520
 man in a suit. What's interesting is he goes back to town and he tells everyone about this.

229
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,800
 I have photographs of this alien encounter. Now, there's a couple things we have to look at. One,

230
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:17,120
 this happened October 18th, 1973. October 11th, 1973. In Pascula, Mississippi,

231
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,280
 you had a very famous UFO sighting that I think is really boring. A couple people are on a rowboat

232
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,120
 and they get abducted by an alien, and then nothing happens. You're like, "Jason, this is not boring."

233
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,960
 I think we've covered so much weird stuff on this show that if they just get beamed aboard and then

234
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,880
 they don't remember anything or they're just like an alien putting stuff up their nose, to me,

235
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,440
 that's boring now. I need to have weirder stuff than that. Some people think when he goes to

236
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,040
 town and starts telling people, some people are like, "I think you're just trying to get famous

237
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,480
 because there was just that famous story a couple days ago that's really in the newspaper and we

238
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,760
 think you're trying to do this." Other people say, "This might sound authentic. This chief of police.

239
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,520
 He's the chief of police. Why would he lie about this?" They start looking at the photographs.

240
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,720
 Now, even skeptics don't think the photographs are fake. They think the photographs are of a

241
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,440
 buddy in a suit. No one's saying that the photograph, it's a model or that it's a double exposure or

242
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,120
 something like that. They're saying, "Oh yeah, there's totally someone in this suit." We think it's

243
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,960
 a suit you made with your buddy. And he's like, "No, no, no, no, no. I didn't know. Who would I

244
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,480
 know? I don't even know." And then people go, "Well, who called you out there?" And he goes,

245
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,480
 "I don't know. That's a good question." And that woman was never able to be tracked down. The woman

246
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,040
 who called him up to invite him out there in the first place, to not invite him, it wasn't a party,

247
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,360
 to get him out there in the first place, has never been revealed. He gets ridiculed because

248
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,440
 people think he's making it up. They're basically saying, "Maybe you had a friend call or maybe you

249
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,320
 made it the phone call in the first place, then you and your buddy went out there and you decided

250
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,960
 to take pictures of your buddy in a suit." And he was really, really saying, "No, this is 100% true.

251
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,720
 Please, please believe me." His wife leaves him. He gets fired from his job. And his house burns down

252
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,800
 all within months of this taking place. Now, I don't think the house burning down was part of

253
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,240
 this, but he got fired. The city council fired him for being a weirdo. His wife left him because

254
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,360
 she couldn't stand the teasing. Nowadays, it would be different, but we've talked about this on the

255
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,840
 show as well. But back in the day, it really was a stigma if you came out as having an alien

256
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,680
 encounter. It was really hard to get past that stigma. And even today, let's say you are a cop

257
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,320
 and you see something weird, you're not really going to talk about it because then people are

258
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,000
 going to put posters of ET in your locker and things like that. Because when you're in organizations

259
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,040
 where safety is key, another part of safety is everyone falls in line. You don't want a wacky

260
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:47,200
 and wild 747 pilot. Everyone kind of has to have the same personality. You see that in the military,

261
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,640
 you see that in police forces, you see that in most things that involve you, other people counting

262
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,280
 on you being safe. Yeah, everyone kind of has to fall into line. So if someone all of a sudden

263
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,920
 goes into a house, a cop goes into a house and they see something paranormal, other cops will

264
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,520
 say don't tell anyone. You can tell me that story and I'll keep it in the wraps, but don't go around

265
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,600
 telling that story. Yeah, you saw you walked into a house and you saw a woman float four feet off the

266
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,680
 ground towards you. And then her relatives are just saying, oh, she's just having some schizophrenic

267
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,640
 episode, help her get down there. And you're like, what? No, I saw her float and they deny it. Just

268
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,400
 don't ever talk about it. Keep it in the wraps because you're just going to get a bad reputation.

269
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,520
 They're going to start calling you Molder around the office. That's cool. I love Molder. No, no,

270
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,800
 no, no, trust me, trust me, don't reveal it. So and this is why this is one of the reasons why

271
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,800
 Luzus is drunk. So you go Jason. And to this day, he I don't know if he's still alive, but actually

272
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,960
 for the rest of his life, he regretted ever telling the story about the Falkville alien,

273
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,880
 regretted ever bringing it up still, but never recanted it as far as I could tell. So Jason,

274
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,960
 why are you telling us this story? A man runs into an alien in the middle of the woods, takes a

275
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,040
 couple pictures, the pictures are available online, he runs away. That doesn't sound like the most

276
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,800
 compelling alien story and abduction actually is more interesting on its face. And I would agree

277
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,400
 with you on that. However, I don't think this was an alien. And I actually have a conspiracy theory

278
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,800
 for this as well. And I just have a hunch I had read in the story because I had to read the story

279
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,080
 a couple times, a couple different sources, and I got the same hunch every time. There's a conspiracy

280
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,520
 theory that aliens are time travelers, that the greys are just basically either robots or advanced

281
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,840
 humanoids. And the reason why UFOs can blink in and out of existence is you're basically moving

282
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,280
 through time, which would conceivably be easier than traveling from one part of the cosmos to

283
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,120
 another. What if this was, he got called out to this thing because he wasn't supposed to have

284
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,120
 that job, he wasn't supposed to be married to that woman, and as he would have died in his house,

285
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,160
 he would have burned down in his house if he wasn't having all this other trauma going on.

286
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,720
 It was future Jeff Greenhaugh, or future Jeff Greenhaugh descendant most likely because he's

287
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,800
 not alive during time travel, but someone far along in the timeline says we have to keep this guy

288
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,760
 single, or at least not married to her, and he doesn't need to be a chief of police,

289
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,760
 he should be something else. Probably because Jason keeps calling him a sheriff this whole episode,

290
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,560
 so they send back a little robot, and then it runs away. And then it kind of ruins his life,

291
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,240
 but maybe he wasn't on the right path he was supposed to be on. You're like Jason, you,

292
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,040
 that is, you talk about people, stuff coming out of people's butts, you totally pulled that out of

293
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,840
 your butt, think about this. Why don't, if UFOs are everywhere, and supposedly there are, and there

294
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,880
 are galactic civilizations and all these Artemis ones or whatever, the Starship Athena floating

295
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,080
 around out there, and you have Pleiadians and lizard people and the conformers and all sorts of stuff,

296
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,720
 how come not many people see UFOs, or aliens at all? Like you're an infinitesimally small,

297
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,800
 but more people see ghosts, and I'm not talking about UFOs where you look up and you go, oh what's

298
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,880
 that drone, and it's a drone. What's that light in the sky? I'm not talking about that, I'm talking

299
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,040
 about full-on saucer, cigar ships flying over your house, you're out in the woods, you get abducted.

300
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:09,600
 Infantesimally small percentage versus the people who see ghosts is not even comparable,

301
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,160
 not even comparable at all. What if the only people who are seeing UFOs, like close encounters,

302
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,520
 not again the light in the sky, but close encounters of the second and third and fourth

303
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,840
 kind, are actually, these are actually intervention teams from the future. It would explain a lot

304
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,160
 actually, it would explain why certain people get chosen, maybe the same people get abducted over

305
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,120
 and over again because they're now learning from their mistake, and the future's like,

306
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,600
 send back another time machine, they're obviously still smoking cigarettes, let's do this.

307
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,600
 It would explain why aliens have such a dumb obsession with the environment, which I think is

308
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,960
 totally lame, but they're always like, save the planet, maybe they come from a future where people

309
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,000
 like me were in charge and we're like smoking our big cigars as we run cities where we control the

310
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,360
 air supply, I'm like, let them burn. So aliens have to come back and be like, no dude, don't be like

311
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,040
 Jason, don't be one of those fat cats in Oregon controlling the world's air supply,

312
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,680
 maybe that's, maybe that's why. And so people who see aliens or people who see UFOs close up,

313
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,360
 they're the ones who need course corrections in their lives, the people who aren't seeing them,

314
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,520
 they're actually moving along the timeline that they're supposed to be on. Who knows,

315
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,640
 I have a hunch that at least this story was a time traveler because his life changed so drastically

316
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,200
 afterwards, which doesn't normally happen, which I guess goes against my theory, if most of the

317
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,120
 time it doesn't. Okay, let me reframe this, I think this one was a time traveler, but maybe not all

318
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,600
 aliens are time travelers, maybe some of them are time travelers, but maybe sometimes people just need

319
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,800
 little tiny course corrections, this guy was really off the rails. But aliens being from the

320
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:53,360
 future actually, I believe, makes more sense than interstellar travel. So the next time you're out in

321
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,640
 the woods or simply at home by yourself and you feel like your life isn't as amazing as it could be,

322
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,680
 that you wish you could have a glimpse of an alien life form or simply have a UFO fly by that you

323
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,360
 can wave at, because you want to be part of the world of the supernatural of the paranormal.

324
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,640
 I would say this, hope for a ghost, because if you do see an alien craft, it may be a sign that

325
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:27,280
 you're headed down the wrong path, that your life isn't what it should be. And if that's the case,

326
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:36,400
 are you ready for everything to change just for a glimpse of a message from the future?
