1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Two middle school Satan worshipers try to enact a terrible plan.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,480
 And then we look at the conspiracy that is called "God Was Raped" today on Dead Rabbit

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
 Radio.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,480
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,160
 This is the season finale for season 2.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,120
 So after this we're going to be taking a week long break.

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,320
 I hope you guys stick with me.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,200
 You guys should be seeing notifications in a week.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
 What is that?

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,680
 November 5th is when I'm taking my break.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,520
 So seven days after that, November 12th.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,920
 Hey, yeah.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
 So we'll be back here on November 12th.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,560
 I hope you guys have a great time.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,600
 I just needed some time off there.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,840
 So you know, yesterday's episode was pretty fun.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,640
 I had a lot of fun with the paranormal porn stars and they actually hit me up on Twitter

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
 and they said thanks for the shout out.

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
 And that was really cool.

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,440
 And if I ever needed any help, I'm plugging the show and I said let the same, you know?

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,680
 So I didn't know this at the time.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,440
 I went and they had some YouTube videos up and I was watching them.

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,680
 Now they did have the Spirit Box thing, which we've discussed before.

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,480
 They did have a clip of a curtain moving and it appeared the windows was closed.

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,040
 So you know, at least they're putting content out there.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,900
 They're putting ghost hunting content out there.

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,900
 So that's cool.

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,900
 We'll see what comes of it.

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,040
 I would really like to see them.

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,400
 And that's one thing I messaged them is I hope you guys find some proof of ghosts because

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,520
 again, I'd like to see some good proof of ghosts.

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,680
 And I'd also like to see them send up the paranormal groups that have been operation

36
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,600
 for decades to get beaten by this group of newcomers.

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,440
 So that would be, that's not a pun either.

38
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,480
 That would be really cool.

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,360
 So but yeah, yesterday was fun.

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,000
 We had ghost baby and we had paranormal porn stars.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,960
 And if I had planned stuff out better, probably would it be this way because last night's

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,160
 episode was a lot of fun.

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,300
 This night's episode is quite grim.

44
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,300
 One of the stories just kind of fell in my lap.

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,220
 And the other one I'd been working on for a while, it's one of, it's a conspiracy iceberg

46
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,220
 story.

47
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,460
 So I had to do more research on it, but we're going to go ahead and present it.

48
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,940
 And it'll, it'll be a good way to end the season.

49
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,900
 But it's just a little bit darker than yesterday's episode.

50
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,700
 Actually before we get started with the first story, I want to let you guys know how much

51
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,020
 it means to me that you guys are enjoying the show.

52
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,220
 I love the feedback.

53
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,560
 It's growing faster than I could have ever imagined and I'm really humbled to think that

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,360
 so many people are into this show.

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,000
 It's really, really great.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,520
 And I'm getting art from people and I'm getting kudos from people and it's just an amazing,

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,600
 it's been an amazing ride so far and we're just getting started.

58
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,680
 We are just getting started with Dead Ravvo Radio.

59
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,640
 So let's go ahead and jump into the first story here.

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,080
 Now the first story just happened on October 24th.

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,760
 This is very, very recent.

62
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,400
 And I just found out about it today.

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,200
 Now what it is, I guess this is, this is kind of lighthearted.

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,420
 I think it's funny, but it's pretty grim if you really kind of step back and think about

65
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,420
 it.

66
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,300
 So at Bartlow Middle School, which is in Florida, a student got wind of something and went

67
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,260
 to a teacher and said, "Teacher, I think something bad is going to happen today."

68
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,580
 And the teacher goes to the principal and the principal calls in the school resource

69
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,260
 officer, which I think is just a term for like a security guard or a cop.

70
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,620
 And they start looking for these two girls who hadn't been in a class.

71
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,360
 So they were looking for them anyways and they find them in the restroom.

72
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,880
 I'm assuming it was a girls restroom.

73
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,160
 That's totally not clear, but they were definitely in the restroom.

74
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,360
 And what these girls had planned was terrifying.

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,640
 So the girls got arrested and the police went through their text messages and they came across

76
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,760
 what they had heard from the student was that these girls had a plan.

77
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,760
 They were going to attack students as they came into the bathroom, the smaller students

78
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,520
 because of course serial killers can't take on real threats.

79
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,060
 They're going to attack students who came into the bathroom.

80
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,820
 They were going to stab them and then drink their blood and eat their flesh.

81
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,900
 And then once they got to say, the article says up to 15 students.

82
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,560
 I don't know why that's such an arbitrary number, but once they got to a certain number

83
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,660
 of students, they were then going to throw body parts outside of the school and then

84
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,660
 kill themselves.

85
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,660
 That was their plan.

86
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,740
 Now these two girls aren't being named.

87
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,180
 I'm sure that'll change because even the slender man girls, the girls who tried killing the

88
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,200
 other girl to get into slender man's mansion, their names eventually leaked.

89
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,760
 So I'm sure these girls' names will leak as well.

90
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
 But so that was their plan.

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,440
 And when they got arrested, the cops, you know, obviously were interrogating them and

92
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,920
 they said they were doing this for Satan.

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,960
 So they had this belief that this was some sort of offering to Satan.

94
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
 And I've talked about Satan worshipers in the past.

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,520
 There are two types of Satan worshipers.

96
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
 There's people like this, these girls.

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,360
 And then there are people who are called themselves Satan worshipers or more, more, probably more

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,820
 aptly Satanists, which basically they're just humanists.

99
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,800
 There are people who believe in the pleasures of the flesh, but even they have fairly strict

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,900
 rules about animal sacrifice and human sacrifice and things like that.

101
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,780
 So when you hear about Church of Satan, that's not what they're, they're not referring to

102
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,060
 lunatics like this.

103
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,380
 The Church of Satan is an actual legitimate religion.

104
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,020
 And I went over that on my anti-cosmic Satanism episode as well.

105
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,500
 But I think it's important to make those distinctions.

106
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,720
 These girls had a very, very limited view of the theology of Satan worship and also

107
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,400
 piss poor planning.

108
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,520
 So I left out a key detail.

109
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,920
 I said that they found the girls in the restroom and then they were arrested by the police

110
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,680
 and you're like, well, that's it.

111
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,520
 Girls are allowed to use the restroom, right?

112
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,280
 That's not, they were caught with weapons in the restroom.

113
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,080
 Now the weapons they had were butcher knives.

114
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
 That's fair.

115
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,960
 I mean, you can plan on stabbing people and eating their flesh.

116
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,080
 I could see bringing butcher knives to the party.

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,100
 They also had a pizza cutter.

118
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:51,380
 Now despite the word cutter in the term pizza cutter, when have you ever even been able

119
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,780
 to cut a pizza properly with a pizza cutter?

120
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,460
 You always just like, oh, oh, you just really got to go at it to get through that crust.

121
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,060
 They really, I mean, that's the level of planning that went into this, that with two girls, they're

122
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,420
 11 and 12 years old.

123
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,700
 They thought that you could use a pizza cutter to one kill a person and two to cut them up.

124
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,480
 I don't think a pizza cutter, you would have to sharpen that so sharp for that to be effective

125
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,280
 in any way, shape or form.

126
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,680
 And then even then, listen, if you're going to do like a mass murder thing like this, you

127
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,800
 may not want to do it in a restroom because as you're chopping up one body, someone else

128
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,200
 is going to walk in.

129
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,440
 That's just the way it is.

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,400
 And then you got to chase that person and now you run through.

131
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,000
 I'm giving tips to young murdering girls, but terrible plan.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Absolutely terrible plan.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,140
 I've always had this theory and we read about this a lot in failed school shootings or school

134
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,340
 bombings or school stabbings or school cannibalism.

135
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,740
 There's always a student, not always, but most part there is a student that comes forward

136
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,060
 and reveals the plans.

137
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,860
 I have a theory.

138
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,740
 I call it the 21 Jump Street theory.

139
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,300
 I believe that all over America in high schools, there are maybe not all over America, but

140
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,840
 I believe that in some high schools, there are actually undercover agents who look for

141
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,520
 this stuff.

142
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,360
 Because I noticed this trend back in the early 2000s where you would have three kids, you

143
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,560
 would have two kids caught for trying to blow up a school and they would get ratted out.

144
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,120
 I don't want to use that word yet.

145
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,080
 Ratted out by a third student.

146
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,800
 And let me say this right now.

147
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,840
 Don't ever shoot up a school or anywhere.

148
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
 It's terrible.

149
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,920
 I said you're throwing your life away.

150
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,080
 But I've always had this theory that because we do this with terrorists where we'll have

151
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,920
 a guy show up and he's like, "Hey, you want to buy this bomb from me?"

152
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,720
 And the terrorists will go, "Yeah, sure."

153
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
 And then the feds come in and arrest them.

154
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,880
 Or someone will go in and he'll find four guys and say, "You know what?

155
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
 I really hate the government.

156
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
 You know what we should do?

157
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
 We should blow it up."

158
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,160
 You should print out plans to build a bomb and you should run a truck and you should buy

159
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,660
 the supplies and it's all a government thing.

160
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,940
 And the question always is, would those four guys have ever thought about building a bomb

161
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,580
 on their own without the agent coming in and selling it?

162
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,240
 And I've wondered about that off and on over the years about these.

163
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,600
 Obviously, there are real school shootings and they're absolutely tragic.

164
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,880
 But I've always wondered if they have operations like that in high schools where an undercover

165
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,100
 agent goes to a high school, identifies kind of like the loner kids and starts getting

166
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,860
 them talking about, "Oh yeah, we should shoot up the school.

167
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,440
 We draw plans and they get them all excited about the idea and then the agent goes, "Those

168
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,860
 are the two kids who are planning on blowing up the school."

169
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,760
 And the feds come in and they arrest it and it's this big deal.

170
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,140
 If they are doing that, I can understand on one hand that they may figure these kids are

171
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,700
 going to blow up the school anyways.

172
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,460
 Our agent didn't actually make them make these plans.

173
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,500
 On the other side, it's possible that they weren't going to blow up the school and they

174
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,220
 got excited about the idea.

175
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,580
 But once you get to the planning stage, you've crossed a lot of lines and that's where a

176
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,220
 lot of these guys get caught.

177
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,900
 Now having an undercover agent at middle school might be a little bit tricky, but in

178
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,660
 a high school, I could see that happening.

179
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,740
 In a high school, I could see an undercover agent going in, pretending to be one of the

180
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,860
 outsiders, and checking to see if anyone else is on the fringes.

181
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,420
 If anyone else is ready to blow and they just get enough information and then they report

182
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
 them.

183
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,820
 So I don't know.

184
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,100
 The other theory, I mean obviously that's a conspiracy theory and I have absolutely

185
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,580
 no evidence to back any of that up.

186
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,140
 It's just a hunch.

187
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,820
 It's far more likely that three kids start planning about something and then one gets

188
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,340
 cold feet rightfully so because it's a horrific act.

189
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,900
 Or the kid or kids who are planning on doing this thing, they have big mouths and they

190
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,420
 end up telling somebody and then that person again rightfully so rats them out.

191
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,020
 Now I'm not trying to use the word rat as a derogatory here.

192
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
 That's just...

193
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,620
 What's the other word?

194
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,620
 Informs.

195
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,340
 Yeah, I just can't think of another word for it right off the top of my head.

196
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,940
 So yeah, these two middle...

197
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,220
 Could you imagine if that had happened?

198
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,260
 Could you imagine the horror and shock if their plan had been successful?

199
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:17,540
 Two middle school girls eating up to 15 kids as they wandered into the bathroom one at

200
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,900
 a time and then killing themselves on the front step of the school.

201
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,500
 Could you imagine the sheer horror that the world would have to deal with when faced with

202
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,940
 that kind of evil?

203
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,780
 It would have been beyond shocking.

204
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:37,100
 So I'm glad that they got caught and I'm glad that it was put to an end very quickly and

205
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,980
 peacefully and don't bring a pizza cutter to a murder scene.

206
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,220
 It's not going to help you one way or the other.

207
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,740
 So the next thing I want to talk about, if you thought that story was dark and it was

208
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,780
 fairly dark but it had a happy ending, not for the girls, they're screwed, but...

209
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,100
 The next story comes from our conspiracy iceberg.

210
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,780
 It's something that I've gotten a lot of requests on and it's fairly dark because the

211
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,580
 imagery is fairly dark.

212
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,820
 The ideas behind it are dark.

213
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,380
 And it is the phrase "God was raped."

214
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,140
 God was raped appears on some of the earlier conspiracy icebergs.

215
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,700
 And very quickly people were throwing out ideas for what it was.

216
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,580
 But God was raped really only has maybe two or three hypotheses of what that phrase actually

217
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
 means.

218
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,620
 Let's go ahead and break it down and I'll give my analysis or what I think is going

219
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,620
 on.

220
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,900
 So the first one is that there's God and then there's other cosmic beings.

221
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,340
 And God was raped by one of these other cosmic beings.

222
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,340
 And we are the product of that.

223
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,060
 Humanity is the product of that rape.

224
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,140
 He basically gave birth to us.

225
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,780
 And that's the reason why God is such a dick to us over the years, over the millennias.

226
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,460
 Because we're basically like his rape children.

227
00:11:51,460 --> 00:12:00,900
 Now while rape does play a large part in some mythology, the Greek gods raped an awful lot.

228
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,420
 You know, I read that one, I read that theory and I was like, "I think there's more to it."

229
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,900
 Because there would be nothing to really back that up in that God was violated in that way

230
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,220
 by another cosmic being.

231
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,780
 You'd have to imagine that there was a cosmic being on God's level or even more powerful.

232
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,740
 And because when we're saying God, we're really restricting ourselves to the Western idea

233
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,740
 of God.

234
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,380
 So Judaism and Christianity and Islam.

235
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,180
 So I don't really think that that's the case.

236
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,740
 But it's an interesting note.

237
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,380
 And again, I'll touch on this later, but I don't necessarily think God in that sense

238
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,140
 has turned his back on humanity.

239
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:43,980
 Now the second theory is a more interesting one, because there is a little bit of biblical

240
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,900
 basis of this one.

241
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:52,540
 That is the idea that, so we know when, let's back up for a second, so the story of Sodom

242
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,780
 and Gomorrah.

243
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,620
 So a quick paraphrase of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.

244
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,420
 So Abraham was pleading with God.

245
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,580
 God was basically like, "You know what?

246
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,740
 I'm done with the city of Sodom, because there are two separate cities."

247
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
 And I was like, "You know what?

248
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
 I'm done.

249
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
 I'm so done.

250
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,140
 It's just such a wicked place.

251
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,100
 Everyone is super rude there, and they commit a bunch of crimes, and they don't treat foreigners

252
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,660
 with any respect.

253
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,660
 I don't like it.

254
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,940
 I don't like it at all."

255
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,420
 Now Abraham was like, "God, listen, you can't destroy the city."

256
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,780
 And basically God goes, "Okay, tell you what.

257
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,140
 If you can find me 50 righteous people in that city, I'll spare it."

258
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,020
 And now Abraham starts to basically negotiate with them, and he's like, "Tell you what?

259
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,700
 What if I can only find 40?"

260
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,260
 And so God goes, "Okay, you know what?

261
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
 40.

262
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,820
 If you can finally 40 people, I won't destroy it."

263
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,620
 Then Abraham goes, "What if I can only find 30 people?"

264
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,780
 And so they negotiate it down to 10 people.

265
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:55,820
 So basically if God says, "If I can find 10 people in this town, then I'm good.

266
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,020
 I won't destroy it."

267
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:02,740
 And then God sends his angels into the city of Sodom, and when they show up, their disguise

268
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,220
 is normal people.

269
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,820
 When they show up, Lot is sitting outside the gate, and Lot's like, "Oh my God, dudes,

270
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
 you dudes are rock.

271
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,420
 Why don't you come into the city and we'll hang out and I'll show you how good this town

272
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,420
 can be."

273
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,980
 So they go to Lot's house, and they're just chilling in there.

274
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,140
 And what happens is a bunch of dudes show outside and start banging on Lot's door, and

275
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,980
 they're like, "Lettison, let us in.

276
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,540
 We want to bang the dudes that just came in your house."

277
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,100
 And Lot's like, "No, no, no, no, no.

278
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
 You don't understand.

279
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,100
 These people are special."

280
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,180
 And people are like, "No, dude, we want to have sex with them.

281
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,180
 Let us in."

282
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,900
 And then in one of the most curious parts of the Bible, Lot says, "So Lot is there with

283
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,740
 the two angels, his two daughters, and his wife."

284
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,460
 And Lot goes, "Tell you what, guys, there's your poundin' on the door, like the walking

285
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,460
 dead."

286
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,860
 Lot goes, "Tell you what, you cannot under any circumstances have sex with these two

287
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,780
 dudes who just came in from out of town.

288
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,820
 However, I have two virgin daughters.

289
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,420
 I will gladly give you if you leave these guys alone."

290
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,420
 What?

291
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,300
 That's such a weird thing.

292
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,900
 But see, the thing that gets lost a lot in the story of Sodom, one of the things that

293
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:12,500
 made God very mad, it was a big part of Sodom's sin, according to the Bible, was the fact

294
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:19,460
 that they were rude to travelers, that people would come there to visit and they would get

295
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,620
 stabbed or stuff stolen from them or raped or all sorts of stuff.

296
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,220
 And that was a thing.

297
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,300
 Like if somebody comes into your home or comes into your city, you should treat them as family.

298
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,820
 So the fact that Lot was saying, "You can't hurt these travelers," because Lot didn't

299
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,420
 know they were angels, Lot said, "You can't hurt these travelers.

300
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,660
 You can't hurt these travelers."

301
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,300
 And Lot says, "Listen, they're in my house.

302
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,580
 I cannot let you hurt them.

303
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,980
 They're from out of town and they're in my house.

304
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,180
 You can't hurt them here.

305
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,420
 Have sex with my virgin daughters."

306
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,340
 And that was considered because he was basically those, it's so bizarre.

307
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,980
 It's such a weird little aside.

308
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:02,380
 But the fact that the city of Sodom they were being rude to outsiders was actually one of

309
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,460
 their biggest sins.

310
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,300
 So anyways, and you know, the rape, that is part of that too.

311
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:14,980
 So what happens is the angels eventually end up blinding the people outside, using their

312
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,620
 powers to blind the people outside.

313
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,740
 And at that point, God was like, "You know what, Lot, take your family, get out of town,

314
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,060
 and whatever you do, don't turn around.

315
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,060
 Just leave.

316
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,020
 Don't turn around and watch what's happening."

317
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:33,300
 So Lot and his wife and his two daughters take off out of town, out of Sodom, and the city

318
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,180
 is, by all accounts, just nuked.

319
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,380
 It's vaporized.

320
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,100
 And Lot's wife turns around and looks and she turns into a pillar of salt.

321
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
 So she's gone.

322
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,100
 And people have thought, "Well, maybe there was some sort of nuclear blast, because what

323
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,420
 else would turn a person to salt?"

324
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:54,260
 Well, I don't know, but looking at a nuclear blast sure won't turn you into salt.

325
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,060
 And then of course there's an even odd, you know, cap to this story.

326
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,580
 Lot passes out at some point and both of his daughters have sex with him and give birth

327
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,100
 to his sons, their grandkids.

328
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,540
 So it's to keep the family line going, because the mom was dead, so the two daughters seduced,

329
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,540
 well, didn't seduce him.

330
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,660
 Basically, they raped him.

331
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,660
 He was asleep.

332
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,100
 There's a lot of rape in this part of the Bible.

333
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:24,780
 Now, the story, I paraphrase, basically, Genesis 18 and 19 for you, but this is where the God

334
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,140
 was raped story comes from.

335
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,460
 So God says, let me read you the exact passage here.

336
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,860
 So this is Genesis 18, "And the Lord said, because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,

337
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,740
 and because their sin is very grievous, I will go down now and see whether they have

338
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:49,060
 done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me, and if not, I will know."

339
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:55,180
 So what's interesting about that is that God's saying that he's going to visit Sodom.

340
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,660
 This is from the King James Version.

341
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,140
 So and then we finish out 18 where he's having this debate with Abraham over how many good

342
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,300
 people he has to find.

343
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,220
 And then when we go into Genesis 19, it just starts off with the two angels showing up

344
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,340
 outside of town.

345
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,620
 The theory is this, that in the original version, if you look at the original translations of

346
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,500
 this, is that it was God who went into Sodom, and the story ended up a little bit differently.

347
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,740
 So that God visited Sodom, and he saw the wickedness.

348
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,860
 He was at Lot's house.

349
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,220
 The guys were banging on the door, and they raped him.

350
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,420
 And then they say, one of the theories is that then the story got changed.

351
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,500
 So it was God said, I'm going into town, but the angels went into town.

352
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,780
 The angels got raped, and God destroys the city.

353
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,540
 And now the version that we see in the Bible is, God says he's going down, but he sends

354
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,580
 his angels down instead.

355
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,340
 They don't get raped, and God destroys the city.

356
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,580
 Now we do know when we look at stuff like the Council of Nicaea, the Bible has been

357
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,140
 edited by man.

358
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:02,700
 And books have been deleted from the Bible that they feel didn't really fit the vibe that

359
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
 they were going for.

360
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,700
 This is a good way to put it, as good as any.

361
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,260
 So the idea that there are parts of the Bible that have been modified is not a very controversial

362
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,340
 idea among most theologians.

363
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,220
 I did try looking up other times when angels blinded people.

364
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:25,500
 So I looked for another part of the Bible where an angel used the power of blindness

365
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,540
 over people.

366
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,460
 And I personally couldn't find one.

367
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,420
 It may be out there.

368
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,340
 The other character who definitely does get blinded is Saul.

369
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,300
 Eventually he becomes Paul when he becomes the father of Jesus.

370
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,820
 And actually, so what happened with Saul was hunting Jesus and persecuting Christians,

371
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,020
 and he heard a disembodied voice say, "Why are you persecuting me?"

372
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,580
 And Saul's like, "What the hell?

373
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,580
 Where's that coming from?"

374
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,780
 And the guy's like, "I'm Jesus."

375
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,860
 And he blinds Saul, and then eventually Saul becomes Paul.

376
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,260
 His vision is restored, and it's like, now he can see the real, he can see the beauty

377
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,980
 of God and the beauty of Christ.

378
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,340
 Now the Holy Trinity, God is Jesus, and Jesus is the Holy Spirit and all of that stuff.

379
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,820
 So the only people who I've seen, and I could be wrong on this, that have the power to blind

380
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,420
 people in the Bible is God or Jesus.

381
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,300
 And again, if somebody wants to correct me on that, I'm 100% behind being corrected on

382
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,380
 that.

383
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,940
 So it makes the story of the angels having the power to blind the crowd outside a little

384
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
 weird.

385
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
 So we have two things.

386
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,140
 I mean, I'm going to go into the city, and we have a bunch of people being blinded, which

387
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,260
 we've seen God/Jesus do that in other parts of the Bible.

388
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:42,900
 Is it possible that the Bible has been modified, that it was God who went into the city of

389
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,020
 Sodom himself, and almost was raped?

390
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,620
 Is it possible that the Bible has changed so much that God did go into the city, actually

391
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,180
 get raped, and then blow up the city?

392
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,900
 You know, it's not like Sodom and Gomorrah were the only cities where evil was happening.

393
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,340
 God really had a beef with these towns.

394
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,780
 Like it really, really stuck in his craw that these guys were operating the way that they

395
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,180
 did.

396
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,940
 And if God takes to physical form, I guess that is possible.

397
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,420
 So, but then again, if he has the power to blind people, I don't really think they would

398
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,580
 be very effective rapists, especially if he can blind a whole group of them.

399
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,980
 But the phrase "God was raped" may just be based on the idea that God was in the city

400
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,500
 of Sodom and he was almost raped.

401
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,980
 And I think that theory holds more weight than the first one, because now we have biblical

402
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,340
 text we can look at.

403
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,860
 Now, I'm not a biblical scholar.

404
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,580
 I'm not a theologian.

405
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,020
 I don't speak Latin or Greek or Hebrew or any of these things.

406
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,900
 And this is something that people could go, "Oh, no, no, no, you're real off-basist."

407
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,820
 And again, I'm totally open to feedback.

408
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,740
 But I think that may be where the theory God was raped came from.

409
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,580
 But, when I was researching this, I came across something very sad.

410
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,500
 And this interview was in 2005.

411
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,620
 So it definitely would predate the iceberg by, what, six, seven years.

412
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,580
 So there was a young actress named Pamela Senna who was raped.

413
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,260
 And she gave this really interesting interview.

414
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,820
 So let me go ahead.

415
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,340
 So this was an interview that was going on.

416
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,500
 And I'm going to start off with a question and then her answer to it.

417
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,820
 So the question, so basically she believes that during the rape she left her body.

418
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,380
 She had a little altar to God placed in her house.

419
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,700
 And during the rape she kind of disembodied herself and she walked over to the altar.

420
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,580
 Now, this is the question.

421
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,940
 You explained that she left her body to walk over to the altar where God lived in your home

422
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,700
 and repeatedly pleaded with him to help you, but to no avail.

423
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,900
 Clearly up to this point you believed that he existed and that he could help you, but

424
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,500
 the torture didn't stop.

425
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,580
 So do you feel that he could have helped you, but chose not to?

426
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,020
 This was her answer.

427
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,380
 Before the rape, I believed in him absolutely.

428
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,660
 So much so that when I reached that moment of realization of being absolutely powerless,

429
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,140
 I had the out of body experience that I wrote about in the book.

430
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,700
 Whatever small part of me believes that praying to God was redundant was explained to me by

431
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,860
 my mother, who believes that God was in that bed with me, crying at the potential for human

432
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:28,060
 cruelty, that God was also being raped with me, so how could he help me?

433
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,220
 There's some part of me that believes that.

434
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,220
 I think that is an interesting little piece of this puzzle.

435
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:46,380
 And it's the idea that God was raped because he's raped when anyone is raped.

436
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,340
 He dies when anybody dies.

437
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,100
 He hurts when anybody hurts.

438
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,820
 He's happy when anybody's happy and so on and so forth and so on.

439
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:02,260
 And I think that's the key component to, again I'm not trying to name a particular deity,

440
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,860
 and that's why I've kind of set this about all kind of Western religions that believe.

441
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,700
 And even I think if you were a polytheist and you believe that there is just pantheon

442
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:17,140
 of God's, is that the problem that a lot of people have with religion is they go, "How

443
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,660
 could God have let babies die of AIDS in Africa?"

444
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,300
 But I think that's not the point.

445
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,140
 I think the point is that he's dying with those children as well.

446
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,260
 It's not that he's immune to our suffering.

447
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,140
 He suffers with us.

448
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,060
 So this young woman was being raped in her bed and he was there with her experiencing

449
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,860
 that because technically you're his child.

450
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:47,940
 So the same way that any parent would suffer seeing their children suffer, that's God but

451
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,940
 he has the ability to unfortunately be there in those horrible moments.

452
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,300
 So God doesn't let little babies get AIDS and God doesn't let people get raped and God

453
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,300
 doesn't let all these horrible things happen.

454
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,380
 God experiences those things on that level if you believe in that.

455
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,180
 And I know not everybody believes in that.

456
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,340
 But I think that's the key.

457
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,700
 Technically yeah, God was raped.

458
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:20,020
 God was raped every time any person was ever raped or beaten or bruised or hurt or whatever.

459
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,260
 So it's an intro.

460
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:28,700
 I started off looking at this phrase and I was really clued in onto the story of Abraham

461
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,700
 and Law and Sodom and Gomorrah and the angels and all that stuff because I'd heard that

462
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,820
 story growing up.

463
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,140
 But I think Pamela Sinna's interview is more accurate to that phrase.

464
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:45,260
 Yes, God was raped because she was raped and God is with her.

465
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:51,900
 And that is how you can take a cosmic omniscient being and break him down to a level that

466
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,380
 we can understand.

467
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,260
 So he's all powerful.

468
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:02,820
 But in that moment, he's just as vulnerable as his children.

469
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,460
 Which I find mind-blowing, honestly.

470
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,460
 So that's where I...

471
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:15,500
 If I had to say what that phrase means, the kind of cool, interesting way to look at it

472
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,740
 is that God went to Sodom and he got raped and he blew the cities up.

473
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,140
 And if we could find...

474
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,940
 That's something that we could actually track back.

475
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,860
 If we could find someone who could read Hebrew or someone who could read Latin, they may

476
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,780
 be able to go through and go, "Oh yeah, there is some weird other parts of that text that

477
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,660
 don't really make sense."

478
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:44,620
 But I think that the idea that God not was raped, but God is raped, and God is killed

479
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,620
 and God is...

480
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,060
 You know, God has stuff stolen.

481
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,940
 God gets his Xbox stolen because you're like, "Ah!"

482
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,660
 God has walked out of his house and looked and his bicycle lock was broken.

483
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,540
 I think that's a more interesting way to kind of break down such a powerful character.

484
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,540
 So I think that's what the phrase, "God was raped" means on the iceberg.

485
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,460
 But it doesn't mean that I'm 100%.

486
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,620
 If you guys have any feedback or any other ideas about it, I'd love to hear from you.

487
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,460
 And lastly, I know this episode is running a little bit long.

488
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,940
 But I promise you zombies.

489
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,580
 There's some zombies.

490
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,660
 Crystal from Twitter.

491
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,500
 I suggest turning down your radio.

492
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,380
 We're gonna go ahead and get started here.

493
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,980
 But before we do, just want to let you guys know, Dead Rapper Radio Daily, Paranormal Conspiracy

494
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,980
 and True Crime Podcast.

495
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,260
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

496
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,460
 Have a great one, guys.

497
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,980
 Okay, so we're back.

498
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,460
 Now, again, if you've been listening to...

499
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,940
 I had to take the song out.

500
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,260
 I performed a rap song here.

501
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,700
 So Dead World Part 1 and Dead World Part 2 is the story of a young...

502
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,700
 A story of...

503
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,300
 No, he's not necessarily young, I guess.

504
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:01,700
 But it's the story of a man and his daughter trying to outrun a group of zombies in Sacramento.

505
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:08,660
 I ended up taking both of those songs out of the podcast because they do contain a instrumental

506
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,140
 that I do not own now.

507
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,300
 And I explained this on the earlier edited episode, Dead World, when in the hip-hop world,

508
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,140
 a lot of times people rap over other people's beats.

509
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,780
 It's kind of a normal thing.

510
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,980
 But when you start to get into the corporate world of podcasting and things like that,

511
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,500
 you don't really want to mess with copyrights.

512
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,740
 Now, the songs have not disappeared.

513
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,900
 They're available on YouTube, and I'm going to include the YouTube link and the show notes

514
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,340
 if you want to go check those out.

515
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,020
 I really like them.

516
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,700
 I thought they were really cool, but maybe you don't like rap.

517
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,620
 Maybe you don't like me rapping, or maybe you don't like both.

518
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,620
 But anyway, so I did want to take that out because, again, I just wanted to stave off

519
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,140
 any trouble in the future.

520
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:53,220
 I didn't want to be way deep into the podcast and get a copyright claim notice and so on

521
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,220
 and so forth.

522
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,660
 And I think if you've gone through the archives, this is going to be the last time we're going

523
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,900
 to do anything like this, you may notice things where I say, "Here, let's listen to this clip

524
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,060
 and no clip plays."

525
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,980
 That's because I ended up taking the clip out because I didn't want to get...

526
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,380
 And again, in a court of law, it totally would have stood up as fair of use because I would

527
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,820
 play a clip and comment on it and critique it and things like that.

528
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,420
 But I just didn't want to bother with the hassle.

529
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,340
 So we're going through season three forward.

530
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,500
 We're not going to be doing that.

531
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,620
 We're just going to be discussing things.

532
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,420
 It didn't really add a ton to it anyways.

533
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,900
 The song did, I think, but yeah, we just want to be in the clear with all of our copyright

534
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,900
 stuff.

535
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,420
 All of our art we own, the intro and outro song we own.

536
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:42,100
 Every song that you hear on the show we either own or it's stock music.

537
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,420
 It's free music that I find.

538
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,620
 So yeah, sorry, it's a little bit of an anticlimatic for such a great episode.

539
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,980
 I really like this episode, so it's kind of anticlimatic, but I hope that you enjoyed

540
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,980
 it nonetheless.

541
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,220
 If you want to check out the music, click the YouTube link before.

542
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,700
 Now I'm going to go back into the future and I hope you'll join me then.
