1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 A 20 minute follow up discussion of the Phantom of the Opera, no I'm just joking, we're done

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,160
 with that one.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:14,000
 A woman finds physical proof that she jumped between dimensions and then we finish off

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,360
 Too Good to Be True Week, with the story that actually started the idea for the theme.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:29,620
 The Pied Piper of Hamelin is a classic tale of revenge, but according to historical documents,

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,880
 the woman did go into the town of Hamelin and 130 kids disappeared forever.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:47,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,440
 Garbender, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,200
 It's funny, I'm re-recording this intro, I just went on a 5 minute rant about the fans

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,320
 of the video game.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,400
 The Walking Dead R World is a little VR game that I've been playing on my phone, just casually

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,280
 hitting the screen killing zombies.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,680
 Turns out there's actually a huge boycott against it, people are like "we're gonna

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
 keep playing your game but we're not gonna spend any money until you fix this stuff"

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,360
 and I'm thinking why not just keep playing the game.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,200
 Actually made me want to stop playing the game, cause I was like, all this drama over

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,880
 of an AR game, it's like Pokemon Go was zombies, you just walk around, you find zombies, you

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,880
 poke them in the head with your finger on the screen and they die and then you get some

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,580
 coins and then you use the coins to upgrade your heroes.

21
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,600
 But you can also spend the money to upgrade your heroes faster.

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,840
 People are like "I've spent 50 bucks multiple times on your game and you need to fix this

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,160
 stuff" and I'm thinking "50 bucks?

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,760
 Dude, it's a free mobile game, like sometimes I'll drop for a free game if I'm playing a

25
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
 free game a lot.

26
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,920
 I spent about 2 bucks on the Walking Dead I bought something.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
 When I'm playing a free game like Warframe or something like that, sometimes when I'm

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,160
 playing a free game though and I have a lot of enjoyment out of it, I'll throw the developers

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,200
 a couple bucks, but 50 bucks I'll go buy a video game, like a real video game for that,

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,160
 an actual video game, not a mobile game.

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,480
 So yeah, just super bizarre, people get so worked up over the weirdest stuff.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,840
 One guy was like "I have to do spreadsheets every day for a mobile game?

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,760
 If you're playing a mobile game and you're developing spreadsheets, that's just bizarre

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,320
 to me, that's just so- I don't even have spreadsheets for my podcast, I don't even do spreadsheets

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
 for this.

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,600
 This is kind of like becoming my job, this is my career at this point.

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,800
 Yeah, man, it was just a bizarre little subculture that I stumbled into.

38
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,560
 I was just looking for tips, I was looking for like "which card should I upgrade next?

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
 Should I upgrade my submachine gun or should I spend more points on getting Carl to be

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
 stronger?"

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,320
 And I stumbled across this huge boycott.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,200
 That's all one, that's what I get for going on Reddit, and two, it's just weird.

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,840
 I'm just like "ah, if people who are spending $50 every so often are having such trouble

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,560
 with this game and I'm not paying anything, I kind of just don't want to play it anymore."

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,960
 But anyways, that aside, I'm always like just amazed by these bizarre subcultures that

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,460
 pop up.

47
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,480
 Other than that though, let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,960
 Now our first story is actually, I found it quite amusing because I guess it kind of goes

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,440
 into the same thing with subcultures.

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,280
 If you stumbled across this information, I want you to think "what would you do with

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,080
 this?" and then we look at what she did with it.

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,920
 So there is an author named Trish Lassage.

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,280
 I'll give you three guesses of what she writes about based on that name.

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,960
 She's probably a lovely person, I'm not trying to say anything bad about her, but obviously

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:43,560
 she's in a metaphysics and she's into healing crystals and all that stuff.

56
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
 Trish Lassage.

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,520
 Anyways, so she wrote an article and she tells this story.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,980
 It was January 21st, 2012.

59
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,000
 She says every month in her town, which I wasn't able to figure out where it was, I'm

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,320
 going to assume it's America, she gets this monthly magazine about metaphysics and spirituality.

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,560
 So really I'm thinking it's most likely a West Coast city if they're able to put out

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,680
 a monthly magazine about metaphysics and spirituality.

63
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,640
 So she gets this monthly magazine and she notices she's in the December issue and the

64
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:23,920
 January issue there is an ad for some healing stuff, some stuff that doesn't work at all

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,880
 unless you believe in it 100%.

66
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,040
 She sees ads for it.

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,720
 It says in the ad, totally fake.

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,560
 Only works if you think it works.

69
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,640
 Call this number.

70
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,400
 She sees the ad and then there's this quote, I love this quote.

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,120
 I was interested in getting some healing energy done and I wanted to try to change some parts

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,800
 of my soul contract.

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,840
 Never heard of that before, never heard of a soul contract before and I was like I could

74
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,800
 research this more and maybe I will, but I don't want to right now because I have more

75
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,520
 weirdness to go into.

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,600
 So she's sitting there, she's kind of like, you know what, I'm having some physical ailments,

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,560
 some spiritual ailments and oh yeah, that's soul contract I've been trying to get that

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
 worked out for a while.

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,240
 So instead of going to a soul lawyer, ooh, a soul goodman maybe, instead of going to

80
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,240
 a soul lawyer, she ends up, instead of going to the soul lawyer, she ends up seeing the

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,920
 website and the phone number in the ad and an email address.

82
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,400
 So she emails the healer at first and doesn't get a response.

83
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,280
 Now I don't know if she was sitting there the whole time like tapping her fingernails

84
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,680
 waiting for the response to come through or if she knows how email works, she sends an

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,040
 email and then you wait an amount of time, but anyways she says, she sent an email, she

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,080
 didn't get a response, she went to the website, there was no website there, so she called

87
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,680
 the person up, she called up the healer and she says, hey I'm responding to the ad in

88
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,400
 this magazine and then there was dead silence on the other end of the phone with the healer.

89
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,360
 She's like hmm, that's weird.

90
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,280
 And then the healer starts talking after this silence and they're talking, yeah, yeah, yeah,

91
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,560
 I do that fake stuff, oh yeah, you do the fake stuff, you do that stuff that's going

92
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,240
 to make me think that something actually happened when nothing happened and I gave you $70, yeah,

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,040
 yeah, yeah, that's my specialty, how'd you know?

94
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,720
 Totally fake, totally fake healing services.

95
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,600
 So they're talking about it and then Trish goes, oh, can I send you the money via PayPal?

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,120
 And the healer goes, oh, I don't have a PayPal.

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,920
 I'm actually waiting for my son to come home, so I'm assuming this woman's like at this

98
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,440
 point like 67 years old, oh, I can't work on those computer things, sure I can bin space

99
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,480
 time and touch the astral plane to fix your ailments and work on your soul contract, but

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,360
 computers, whoa, no way, you know what's funny, I run into people all the time, it frustrates

101
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,600
 me so much, they go, I'll be talking about computers or cell phones or something like

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,360
 that, I've come up with the perfect comeback because it's been happening my whole life,

103
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,160
 they'll be like, oh, I'm not a computer person and I will always say I'm not an oven person,

104
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,920
 I don't know how to work an oven at all and they'll be like what?

105
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,320
 And then I go into this, I go, listen man, computers have been around for 40 years, 20

106
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,480
 years ago, sure, people could say, oh, I'm not good with computers, but computers have

107
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,240
 been around for about 40 years now, consumer wise, since the late 80s, like you could afford

108
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,040
 your own computer.

109
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,080
 If you don't know how to work a computer now, it's no different than if someone came

110
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,880
 up to you and says, I don't know how to work an oven because they're everywhere and you

111
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,640
 should know how to work a computer.

112
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,960
 I mean, I've gotten to the point where it really frustrates me when people say I'm

113
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,640
 not a computer person because they're everywhere.

114
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,120
 Anyways, yes, it's one of those episodes where I'm a little snarky, so this person's not

115
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,960
 a computer person, although she is one with the megalith mind of all eternity, she can't

116
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,280
 work a computer.

117
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,800
 And she goes, my son is going to come over and help me set it up.

118
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
 And then she goes, oh, and also I never placed an ad in that newspaper, so that's why that

119
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,520
 confused me at first when he said that you saw my ad in a newspaper.

120
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,720
 I've never placed an ad in that newspaper.

121
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,000
 Dun dun dun.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So this is the quote from Trish after all of that.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,520
 Since she started speaking immediately after that, after that revelation, since she started

124
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,160
 speaking immediately after that, I got distracted and did not mention her website.

125
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,680
 However, after hanging up the phone, I remembered that I did cross over into a parallel universe

126
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,920
 at approximately 1.40 AM on January 1st, 2012.

127
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,120
 And I crossed over to yet another parallel universe on another day in January.

128
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,760
 What could she have possibly…

129
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,920
 Okay, there's a lot of stuff that I said there, but let's start off with the beginning.

130
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,320
 Since she started speaking immediately after that, I got distracted and did not mention

131
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
 her website.

132
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
 What could possibly…

133
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,840
 You realize now that you're talking to someone from another universe, that you're holding

134
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,080
 physical proof that they posted an ad, the reason you got their number was because of

135
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,800
 an ad in the newspaper and there's a website and a phone number.

136
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
 You're holding it.

137
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,440
 You're holding physical proof in your hand.

138
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,680
 What possibly could the other person say that would make you get distracted from that reality?

139
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,840
 Oh, oh yeah, she started talking about all this other made up stuff, so I totally forgot

140
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,160
 about the made up stuff that I believe in.

141
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,640
 And here's the thing, she's holding the physical proof that she slipped into another

142
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,000
 reality.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,640
 And then the article ends with her just going, "What a wacky world we live in.

144
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,520
 Sometimes we just swap from reality to reality and that's it.

145
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,040
 All done."

146
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
 So what would you do?

147
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,960
 And I read that and I thought, "You know what, okay, let's say that this experience happened

148
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
 to me."

149
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,160
 Let's say that I was dumb enough to call this psychic or this healer up or whatever

150
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,280
 the world she technically was and said, "I need your fake services."

151
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,760
 I saw your ad in the newspaper and your website's down and they were dead silent.

152
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,120
 And then through the course of the conversation they go, "Oh, I'm not a computer person."

153
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,280
 And I tell them, "I'm not an oven person.

154
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
 Let's get through this, okay?

155
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,240
 I'm going to do this rant and we'll keep on moving."

156
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,880
 And she's like, "What are you talking about?

157
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
 Forget it.

158
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,880
 I just want to know why you have a website in your ad that doesn't work."

159
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,120
 And she goes, "I never put up a website.

160
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,960
 I never put up an ad.

161
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,200
 I would then hang up the phone, go to her place of business and spend the next three

162
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,560
 hours showing her the newspapers and being like, "Dude, this is some serious stuff."

163
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,920
 I go, "This is your phone number, right?

164
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,520
 Yeah, this is your phone number."

165
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,920
 So you did place an ad.

166
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,680
 I'm from a reality where you placed the ad already.

167
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,800
 Like that is what a normal human would do.

168
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,960
 Go to the metaphysical newspaper and say, "Hey, you guys make up a bunch of stuff in

169
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 your newspaper, right?"

170
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
 And they're like, "Yeah, it's all made up."

171
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,520
 Well, you want to cover a real story?

172
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
 Look at this.

173
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
 Throw down the newspaper.

174
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,800
 And then they'd match it against the paper.

175
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,960
 They did print in that reality and their minds would blow up.

176
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,800
 That's what a person would do.

177
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,440
 That's what a normal person would do.

178
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,400
 And that is what a person would do if the story was true.

179
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,880
 This story was true in any way, shape, or form.

180
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,360
 Now the thing is, we have no photographs of the ads.

181
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,480
 We have nothing of this, of proof of this story.

182
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,920
 Now obviously she could have shifted back into another reality where she know, and also,

183
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,880
 I just thought of this, how many times do people shift reality?

184
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,000
 And their apartment shifts reality too.

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,680
 Was she carrying both copies of the newspaper around when she was shifting realities?

186
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,040
 Like it's not that you shift reality and then your car shifts with you, and you're like,

187
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
 "That's weird.

188
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,200
 I'm playing this Jamie Lynn Spears CD on my car, and Britney Spears is just an actor,

189
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,760
 and the world's foot flopped and everything's horrible."

190
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,360
 No, you shift reality.

191
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,040
 The man from "Torred" he didn't shift, his whole plane didn't shift, just eat it.

192
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,480
 Maybe the stuff in his pocket, like his pennies, we've talked about that before.

193
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,560
 But you just don't shift and then you go into reality where all your food's spoiled because

194
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,080
 you didn't pay your electric bill in that other reality, but everything else is normal.

195
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,680
 It just doesn't make sense.

196
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,320
 It doesn't make sense at all.

197
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,120
 So I'm, and I should say, I'm not calling Trisha Liar, I'm just saying that this story

198
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
 has a major hold in it.

199
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,920
 And it was possible proof.

200
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,400
 It was absolute possible proof of someone shifting realities and it's just kind of like

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,920
 hand-waved off.

202
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,400
 It would be like me walking around with a book that said "The Berenstein Bears," not

203
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,840
 "The Berenstain Bears," and I have a whole library of them because I shifted reality with

204
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,560
 those books over and here you are.

205
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,600
 I mean your reality and I would be able to show those books and people would be like,

206
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,680
 "Oh, you could dispute them and say those are misprints and stuff like that, but she could

207
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,920
 have taken the newspaper to the healer, she could have taken the newspaper to the newspaper

208
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,920
 that published it and showed proof that a sliver of the stuff that they talk about actually

209
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
 has some sort of merit.

210
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,440
 But instead, what a wacky world we live in.

211
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,440
 But let's go ahead and Fridays are actually turning out to be rant episodes.

212
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,280
 I don't necessarily want that to be an ongoing theme.

213
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,000
 I don't necessarily think it's healthy for my mental development to every Friday sit

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,840
 in front of a mic and just rant as entertaining as they may be.

215
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,240
 And I don't know how entertaining it is.

216
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,240
 I haven't edited it yet, but I don't think it would be good for my growth, my soul contract,

217
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,400
 to just get angry every Friday.

218
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,640
 I think it was last Friday was the Benadryl episode.

219
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,000
 That was, man, that was rough.

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,440
 Now again, my story is so bizarre and this is the story that made me say, I wonder how

222
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,400
 many other things out there are true.

223
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,120
 Because I never thought this one was true.

224
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,040
 Let's hop into Dead Rabbit Durgible, which is actually good because we're going back

225
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
 in time.

226
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,200
 We want to be quaint and quiet.

227
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,600
 We don't want anything loud.

228
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,240
 Plus all of our loud vehicles have kind of been destroyed, but we are working on them.

229
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,440
 So have faith, true believers.

230
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,480
 We're going to take the Dead Rabbit Durgible, we are going back in time to the year 1284.

231
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,200
 We're flying to Durgible over Germany.

232
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,520
 We're specifically going to the town of Hamlin and in this town.

233
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,960
 Well, you know what's funny?

234
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,240
 It's actually kind of hard to tell the story because there's different versions of it.

235
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,320
 So we're just kind of kind of settling on one and then kind of kind of go through, take

236
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,840
 the details out that were added later.

237
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,920
 So we're over the town of Hamlin and there's a bunch of rats, dude.

238
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,080
 The place is terrible.

239
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,640
 It's totally infested with rats.

240
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,560
 Rats are eating your cheese.

241
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,480
 Rats are dating your daughter.

242
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,320
 Rats are actually running for mayor in the upcoming election and they may win because

243
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,400
 there's so many other rats to vote for them.

244
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,600
 It's a total, total mess.

245
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
 Town people don't know what to do about it.

246
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,800
 You can only bash so many rats heads in before you become a shell of a person, just as Charlie.

247
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,040
 So they don't know what to do.

248
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,080
 And one day a guy showed up and he was wearing multi-colored clothes, which multi-colored clothes,

249
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,320
 another term for that was pied.

250
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,800
 I don't know why those two things are connected.

251
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,000
 Even if you put different berries in a pie, it'll always turn out just red.

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,400
 Like if you threw some boysenberries in there, well I guess then it would be purple, but

253
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,520
 if you threw like boysenberries and then cherries, do they make strawberry pie?

254
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,800
 Anyways, you put all this stuff in, it just becomes one uniform color, but for whatever

255
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,480
 reason pied means multi-colored.

256
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,200
 Pied, this guy shows up, he's wearing all these funky clothes and they're like, "What

257
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 are you doing here?"

258
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,840
 And he's like, "Hey man, I have a deal for you.

259
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
 I got this flute.

260
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,160
 I'm gonna play it."

261
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,600
 And I'll lead all the rats out of town, but you gotta pay me a ton of money.

262
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,960
 And the thing they settle on is about like a thousand dead marks or doinks or whatever

263
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
 they marks.

264
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
 What do they use in Germany?

265
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
 Marks?

266
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:04,360
 Anyways, he's like, "Give me a thousand of those gold things you have over there sitting

267
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
 in the corner."

268
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
 He's like, "Those?"

269
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
 And he's like, "Yeah, those.

270
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 Give me a thousand of those.

271
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
 I'm gonna play my flute.

272
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,360
 I'm gonna lead the rats out of the city and drown them."

273
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,040
 And they're like, "That, okay, that, we don't think it's gonna work, but go ahead, weirdo."

274
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,720
 So the dude, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo, doodoo.

275
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,560
 And the rats start like getting up.

276
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,280
 They end their mayoral campaign, leave your daughter at the altar, and leave all your

277
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,120
 cheese alone, and they leave all the rats in town, follow the Pied Piper out of town,

278
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,000
 and then he leads them into the river and they all drown.

279
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,720
 Your daughter is heartbroken, but she'll get over it.

280
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,600
 Pied Piper comes back into town and says, "Hey, you made my money.

281
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,680
 I did my part of the job.

282
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,320
 Give me the thousand gold things."

283
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,200
 And they're like, "Oh yeah.

284
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
 It seemed like we thought it was gonna be harder.

285
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,080
 We thought you could actually earn your money, but that was like super easy.

286
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,520
 So we're not gonna pay you the full thousand.

287
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,640
 We'll give you half or one-tenth.

288
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,440
 It really depends on the version of the legend, and some of the legends, they don't pay them

289
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
 at all."

290
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,160
 And at that point, the Pied Piper, his son, gets covered by clouds, and the Pied Piper

291
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,680
 gets all dramatic, and he goes, "I will return, and I will get my money in a true act of revenge."

292
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,520
 I will do that.

293
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
 Stumps off.

294
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,880
 Stumps people was like, "That wasn't very funny.

295
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,680
 I thought Jason was gonna come up with a funny joke."

296
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
 And they're like, "No.

297
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,200
 You're just setting the scene.

298
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,840
 So anyways, Pied Piper leaves."

299
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,760
 Now, this is where stuff gets interesting.

300
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,120
 June 26th, 1284.

301
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,240
 That's a big festival day.

302
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,440
 It's like the day of like St. Paul and Mary or something like that.

303
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,040
 It's a big festival day.

304
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,960
 So all the adults were in church in the town, but the kids weren't.

305
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,840
 Kids were out and having a ball.

306
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,840
 He's reading all your cheese, marrying your daughter, running for mayor.

307
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,240
 And the Pied Piper shows up, but this time he's wearing all green.

308
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
 The clothes of a hunter.

309
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,480
 He's kind of badass, actually.

310
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,240
 He shows up in all green this time.

311
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,040
 Starts playing his flute.

312
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:05,400
 And the kids in town hear the music and get up and start kind of boogying, following him.

313
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,040
 Now all the parents are in church, so there's no witnesses to this.

314
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,600
 But there's three kids who do see what's happening, because they're able to report it later on.

315
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,560
 And the three kids, one of them was blind, so he didn't know where to go.

316
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
 He didn't know where to dance.

317
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
 He couldn't do the...

318
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
 He couldn't...

319
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
 He didn't know the right dance moves.

320
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
 He was bumping in everyone.

321
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
 He didn't know what path they were taking.

322
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,720
 I don't know why he couldn't hear the flute, the direction of the flute, but he couldn't.

323
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,520
 So the blind kid got left behind.

324
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,840
 There was a deaf kid who could see everyone boogying, but couldn't like get down, couldn't

325
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,400
 feel the funk, because he was deaf.

326
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
 He couldn't hear the music.

327
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,000
 And he's like, "Why is everyone dancing on the street?"

328
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,840
 He sees the blind kid straight up like doing the cabbage patch in the corner, but he's

329
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
 like, "What's going on?"

330
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
 And the blind kid's like, "I don't know.

331
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
 I'm just...

332
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
 I love this music.

333
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
 This is my jam.

334
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,920
 I love this flute."

335
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,880
 And then the third kid was a lame kid, which technically means that he was like...

336
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
 He was handicapped.

337
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,000
 But I'd like to think that the Pied Piper thought that guy was so lame.

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,320
 I'm not taking that kid.

339
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,320
 He's like a kid with his checked up haircut.

340
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,000
 Worst clothes in the Pied Piper, like they're just ragged and they're just super gross in

341
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,880
 the Pied Piper, is dancing down the street and acting revenge, trying to steal all the

342
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,840
 kids and sees this total dork in the corner dancing.

343
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,920
 The Pied Piper's like, "Pushing him away with his foot.

344
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
 Get out of here.

345
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
 I don't want you.

346
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
 You're lame.

347
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
 You're lame.

348
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,720
 You're too lame to kidnap."

349
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
 That is lame.

350
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,360
 If a man bent on revenge against the city is stealing all of their children and leaves

351
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,560
 yours, you should feel embarrassed as a parent, because you know your child is lame.

352
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,840
 But anyways, so the lame kid, the blind kid and the deaf kid.

353
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,720
 Well, not the blind kid, doesn't see this, but the deaf kid and Millhouse.

354
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,040
 But the deaf kid and the lame kid see the Pied Piper lead the kids off out of the city

355
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,560
 and into the mountains, and the kids were never seen again after that.

356
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,640
 So they alerted the townspeople and they said, "Hey, townspeople.

357
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,440
 I mean, hey, people that we know, mom, dad."

358
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
 The lame kids like, "Mom, dad," and they're just pretending it's not their kid.

359
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,720
 They're like, "Oh, who's he talking to?

360
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 Who's he talking to?

361
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
 You?"

362
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,800
 They tell the people in church, "Hey, this is what happened.

363
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,240
 People in the church come out, town's empty, except for them and the blind kid and the

364
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
 loser and the deaf kid."

365
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,080
 So the moral of the story is pay your debts.

366
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,680
 Like basically the moral of the story is if you make a deal with someone, pay your deal,

367
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,320
 because otherwise your children may get kidnapped.

368
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
 The end.

369
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,640
 But what's interesting is that there's actually a lot of historical evidence that something

370
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,040
 like this happened.

371
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
 And let's look at it.

372
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
 It's fascinating.

373
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,640
 If you hear that story and you're like, "Oh, this is like a folktale."

374
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,420
 And people go, "Yes, yes, the brothers are Graham and all this stuff based on actual

375
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
 folktales.

376
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
 This isn't a folktale.

377
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,720
 There's historical records that something happened in the town of Hamlin."

378
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,560
 So in the year 1300, so that story took place in 1284.

379
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,000
 So only about 16 years later, a stained glass window was installed in a church in the town

380
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
 of Hamlin.

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,360
 And it's been destroyed now.

382
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,280
 It's been the 1600s it was destroyed.

383
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,920
 But there are documents of what it said back then.

384
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,560
 There are writings of the time of when that window was still up saying what it showed.

385
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,720
 The stained glass window showed a pipe piper, a man in multicolored clothing playing his

386
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
 flute, kids walking away.

387
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
 That's what it showed in the window.

388
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,080
 And the inscription, like they have the writing in the window, in the year 1284 after the

389
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,280
 birth of Christ, from Hamlin were led away.

390
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,560
 130 children born at this place led away by a piper into a mountain.

391
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,240
 And you're thinking, okay, maybe that's just like a little fable that they put on their

392
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,680
 window for whatever reasons.

393
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,920
 Maybe it was something playful.

394
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,960
 Maybe the guy at the church was having some artistic license.

395
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,920
 16 years after the supposed event, this window goes up in this church.

396
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:53,160
 In the Hamlin town chronicle, so like their town record in 1384, somebody wrote in the

397
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,000
 town record, "It is 100 years since our children left."

398
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,880
 It's getting creepy.

399
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,520
 In 1556, a new gate was built into the wall of the, that's around the city of Hamlin.

400
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,880
 They put in a new gate.

401
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,040
 1556.

402
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,840
 And there's an inscription on the gate that says, "In the year 1556, 272 years after the

403
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,680
 magician led 130 children out of the town, this portal was erected."

404
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:30,040
 So this was centuries before the brother's grim, centuries before Goath was writing these

405
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,560
 poems and these stories and making it a story that is well known in the Western world, the

406
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,680
 Pied Piper of Hamlin.

407
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,760
 This is long before that.

408
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,200
 If it was afterwards, you can think maybe it was some tourist trap thing where they're

409
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,680
 like, "Oh yeah, let's make this thing because everyone knows Pied Piper of Hamlin.

410
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,920
 Let's make some money off this."

411
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,880
 Way before that, people, there are documentation, there are records, there are inscriptions

412
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,960
 saying, and I'm, those are three of them.

413
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
 There are a ton of them.

414
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,320
 I could keep going on and on about, it was written like this in the 1400s, it was written

415
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,600
 like this in the 1500s, there's a ton of them.

416
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,600
 Those I think are the three kind of creepiest ones.

417
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,120
 So something did happen to the children of Hamlin.

418
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
 They left.

419
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,640
 There are a lot of people who have tried to figure out exactly what happened.

420
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,880
 Only enough.

421
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,560
 It wasn't until 1559, because the story was being told.

422
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,080
 It wasn't like this popular thing where people would be like, "Hey, let's go to the Hamlin.

423
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,840
 Let's go find that place where all those kids went missing because, again, it's 1500s.

424
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,360
 Everyone kids are missing.

425
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,600
 The black plague is ravishing Europe.

426
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,160
 There's wars all the time.

427
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,520
 People aren't putting on their Mickey Mouse hats.

428
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,880
 These are like rat-shaped hats going to a place where other kids are missing.

429
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
 Your kids are missing.

430
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,200
 Your kids are dead somewhere in a ditch.

431
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,580
 So anyways, that was kind of dark.

432
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,360
 It wasn't until 1559 though that when people talked about the story of Hamlin that they

433
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,160
 added the rats.

434
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,560
 The original story of Hamlin was a dude shows up in multicolored clothes and leads 130 kids

435
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
 out of the city.

436
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,720
 The almost the morality of it, the story of the townspeople deserving Matt, was added

437
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,120
 300 years after it happened.

438
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,880
 The original version is a dude just shows up and takes all the kids.

439
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,120
 So there's a couple of theories of what's going on.

440
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,240
 One is it was the Pied Piper represents death and it was the black plague.

441
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,920
 People don't buy that one because the black plague didn't hit that area of Europe until

442
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,960
 much, much later.

443
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,480
 And why would it only attack the kids?

444
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,520
 There was the idea that it was the kids being sold off into slavery.

445
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,560
 That someone showed up and enslaved all the children that the people of the town sold

446
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
 the kids.

447
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,840
 And the story of the Pied Piper was basically a cover story for the fact that they all sold

448
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,040
 their kids.

449
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,920
 Some people say if you look at a Polish phone book, which sounds like a setup for a joke,

450
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,160
 but if you look at a Polish phone book, there are names in there that appear that they would

451
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,720
 have come like surnames that would have come from Hamlin.

452
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,680
 So they think that some people may have been sold in a slavery in Poland.

453
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,960
 That is possible.

454
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,680
 But the thing is, is like, if you have a town and you have 130 kids and the references seem

455
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,920
 to be that the kids are taken since her children left and stuff like that.

456
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,080
 One, if you did sell your kids in a slavery, why would you make any record of it at all?

457
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,200
 You wouldn't even put a veiled reference to it.

458
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,520
 You definitely wouldn't put it in your church.

459
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,720
 So you know, yeah, remember when we sold all over children to slavery?

460
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,560
 Let's make a big stained glass window of that.

461
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,560
 You would cover it up because one, you wouldn't want anyone else to notice it.

462
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,760
 And two, I can understand families selling their kids individually into slavery because

463
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,280
 they need some money.

464
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,960
 But for a city to function, you need a next generation to come up and be the new tax

465
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,120
 paying citizens.

466
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,640
 So for them to sell off for a city decision to sell off 130 future tax paying citizens

467
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
 is quite odd.

468
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,280
 It's very, very short-sighted.

469
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,520
 So but it's possible that's one of the theories.

470
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,600
 The other one is that the kids left on their own because they went to go join a children's

471
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,880
 crusade and the dude, the Pied Piper was some sort of military recruiter.

472
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
 But I mean, that's kind of odd.

473
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,160
 I think he would be like, "Come on you maggots, get up there.

474
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,480
 We're going to go kill some Muslims.

475
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
 Let's go, go, go, go."

476
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,720
 And the kids are like running through the streets, holding their swords above their head.

477
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
 This is my rifle.

478
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,960
 This is my gun, that type of stuff.

479
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
 I don't think he'd be wearing multicolored clothes and playing a flute.

480
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,280
 That might just be me being facetious and having a modern interpretation of it.

481
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,120
 But that wouldn't make sense though.

482
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,440
 The military version would make sense why the blanket, the deaf kid and the lame kid

483
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,200
 were left behind because they're going to go like storm Istanbul.

484
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,760
 They don't want them there.

485
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,760
 They're like, "Oh, you're going to be dragging us down, blind kid, deaf kid and lame kid.

486
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
 You just suck.

487
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
 So you stay here."

488
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,080
 None of those theories are bulletproof.

489
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:37,280
 The only thing that we know historically is that 130 kids disappeared from a town in

490
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,680
 a single day because some of the written references will say on June 26th and other versions reference

491
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
 that day.

492
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,040
 And then the historical documents will also reference that day.

493
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,920
 So if it was the Black Plague, they just don't go "ugh" fall at the same time.

494
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,920
 If they're getting sold into slavery maybe, if they're getting recruited maybe.

495
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:02,480
 Although interestingly enough, the road that the kids walked down to leave town is named,

496
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
 now it's named.

497
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,640
 I've been saying that before, but now it's named Bungalusenstrasse, which means street

498
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,200
 without drums.

499
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,200
 And apparently, even to this day, it is illegal to play music or dance on that street.

500
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,000
 Is it possible that some weirdo dressed all like the Joker on acid showed up at a town,

501
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,840
 played a little music and led 130 kids never to be seen again?

502
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,120
 It seems far-fetched, but it's possible.

503
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,400
 We've had things like Dancing Mania, we did an episode a long time ago about that where

504
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,120
 people had this compulsive need to dance and they just danced from town to town and there

505
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,400
 was people would like, be paralyzed from dancing too much, people would die and drown and all

506
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,720
 sorts of stuff.

507
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,840
 It's weird to think that a story you hear as a child could be true.

508
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,280
 A story that's as fanciful as this could be true.

509
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,680
 A man showing up at a town and kidnapping 130 children in one day and those kids never

510
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,720
 being seen again, or the Pied Piper.

511
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,000
 It really, you know, it's funny because you can put the Pied Piper in one of two categories.

512
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,880
 You could put him in the category as some sort of spirit or some sort of force.

513
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,720
 Like it's a man, I believe it was a man who did this, but that he had some sort of mystical

514
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,800
 power through the power of his flute could get people to do what he wanted to.

515
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,520
 We have to dismiss the rats because that wasn't added until a long time before.

516
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,400
 So just looking at the story of someone coming to town and stealing 130 kids, you can look

517
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,880
 at it as this was a man who had some sort of magical power over the children or this

518
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,640
 was just a man who literally kidnapped 130 kids somehow.

519
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,840
 And it's funny because it's one of those things that is just a matter of degrees.

520
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
 Can a person kidnap one kid at a time?

521
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
 Absolutely.

522
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,240
 Can a person kidnap two kids at a time?

523
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
 Absolutely.

524
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,680
 Can a person kidnap five kids at a time?

525
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
 Maybe.

526
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,480
 We're basically just looking at the raw numbers.

527
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,640
 If the story was, a man came to the town of Hamlin with a flute and one child disappeared.

528
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
 You wouldn't even bat your eye.

529
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,040
 You wouldn't even think, well, you would feel bad for the kid.

530
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,680
 But I mean, you wouldn't then immortalize it in a legend.

531
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,000
 But it's the numbers that makes it so high.

532
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,400
 It's not the fact that a stranger comes to town and a child or a few children disappear.

533
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,520
 It's the fact that there's 130 of them on a particular day.

534
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,440
 What I think is fascinating is that the story, the version of the, with the rats in it that

535
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,400
 was added 300 years later, makes the story more comfortable.

536
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,880
 Because then the villains of the story are the townspeople who didn't live up to there

537
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,240
 into the bargain.

538
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,440
 You add the rats because then it makes the people in the town, the bad guys, the Pied

539
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,360
 Piper is the wronged party.

540
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,160
 You're not going to pay me my thousand gold German currency?

541
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,320
 I'm taking your kids.

542
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,320
 And when you're reading that, you get a moral from that story.

543
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
 Pay your debts.

544
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
 Which is funny.

545
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,520
 I wrote it for me to say, oh, the IRS, a bunch of money, but pay your debts.

546
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,880
 I'm paying it, IRS, I'm paying it, I'm getting my money together.

547
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,320
 Pay your debts is the moral of the story.

548
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,920
 And then you turn to the page and you go to the, whatever, the tortoise and the hare

549
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,240
 or the three bears, Goldilocks and three bears.

550
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,600
 Go to the next moral.

551
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,040
 That's comfortable.

552
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,120
 Because then you realize that if you pay your debts, then you are fine.

553
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,560
 You move on to the next moral lesson.

554
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:31,000
 But the original story of the Pied Piper is much more unsettling.

555
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,240
 A small town somewhere in Germany.

556
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,480
 Everyone minding their own business and things are going okay.

557
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,160
 And then on June 26th, this religious holiday, the adults all go to the church and when they

558
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,720
 come out, streets are silent.

559
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,440
 They hear no babies.

560
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,120
 They see no kids running through the street.

561
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,680
 Toys just left on the ground.

562
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,320
 Because in that version of the story, they are still punished, but they don't know why

563
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,120
 they were punished.

564
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:10,640
 They don't know what they did to deserve 130 children disappearing forever from their city.

565
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:20,560
 And the only moral lesson in that story is that life is cruel and unfair.

566
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,280
 And IRS, you will get your money very, very soon.
