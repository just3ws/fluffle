1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 A man and his four-year-old son are in a race for their life against the trio of truly bizarre alien invaders.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we travel to Mount St. Helens, shortly after the devastating eruption of 1980.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Prepare to grab your gear, ladies and gentlemen, you've been enlisted on a special mission.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Operation Bigfoot Barbecue, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys have some fun plans for the weekend.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We got a really cool episode ready to go, so let's get it started.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 First off, before we get started, let's introduce one of our Thanksgiving livestream supporters.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command, everyone give it up for Helena. Yay, woo! She's coming in. She's doing cartwheels.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Showing off Helena. You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. That helps out so much. Talk about it on your socials.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Talk about it to your friends and family. Really, really counting on you guys to help the show grow.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Helena, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We're going to take a nice leisurely drive all the way out to Russia.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 [Music]

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You know, when I started this show, we're going on year four, really, in June. It'll be four years since we started this show. It's crazy.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 One of the things that I never would have predicted that we would be in Russia so much,

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 when the Iron Curtain fell, when communism was wiped off of the European continent,

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 a bunch of people showed up and started talking about UFOs. It's really, really fascinating.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 What happened was you had people having these experiences around the same time that the Americans were,

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 really post-nuclear bomb atomic age to now.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 But you didn't want to talk about it. We've addressed this in other episodes because you would end up in a gulag at best.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 You're basically, if you said that you saw these unusual events, you would be visited by the KGB.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And we have covered UFO stories before where it ends with the people being told,

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 don't mention this to anyone, the KGB will come looking for you.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'll see if I can find this specific episode where the dude, like, kept his mouth shut.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 He told the people in the village and they were like, "Stop talking to us, please.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I'll see if I can find that episode." Because it happens more than once.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So, I, looking back, I think that's been really cool to look behind the Iron Curtain and all the,

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I would say, honestly, pound for pound from the research that I've done.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 There have been more UFO sightings in Russia than in the United States.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And I know there's a bigger land mass to Russia, but still, it doesn't even seem like it's in comparison.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 So many stories are coming from Russia or came from Russia.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 This one is from August 1989.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And we're in Teimazov. That's in the Ufa region of Russia.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And this is a very bizarre story and it starts off bizarre.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 This one takes place at 7 a.m.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 It's 7 a.m. and we're in the kitchen of a man who just gives his first initial "F" then his last name is Zayevoy.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 So we're going to call this guy Frank.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Frank is working in the kitchen, cooking up some eggs, throwing in some bacon, static on the television.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 His four-year-old son is upstairs, still hanging out in his room.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And Frank is sitting here cooking up these eggs, throws them on the plate.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 He's done. Done making breakfast and he leaves the kitchen.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 A short while later, he walks back into the kitchen.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 There's still the plate there with the eggs and the bacon.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He walks into the kitchen.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And sitting on the kitchen floor is a bent fork.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Now Frank looks down at this with the curiosity that any of us would have.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 He was just in this room. He remembers not bending a new fork.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 He walks over and he looks at this bent fork on the floor.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So he bends over to pick it up.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And as he's bending over and he's reaching for this fork, all of a sudden, in front of him, this is so bizarre.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So imagine this. You're totally bent over in this kitchen.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Bending over to pick up this fork and then you see a blue glow.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And you notice the blue glow is coming from in front of you.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 But you're bent over. You can't really see what it is.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 It's almost like I've seen this in cartoons.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 He starts to look up as he's holding this fork.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 He starts to look up and he sees a pair of glowing blue legs.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And he's slowly...he doesn't know who he's looking to, right?

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And you're kind of nervous. Do you want to know who they've looked to?

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 He's slowly looking up as he's straightening his back.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 He's slowly raising his eyes and raising his head.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And he's seeing that these blue legs are attached to a glowing blue person.

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 But not just any glowing blue person.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Not Benny, who lives down the street, who loves to glow blue in the morning.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 This dude is 8 feet tall.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 To this day, he's still slowly looking up.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 He's still craning his neck up.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And then he realizes, actually, there's two glowing blue people in the room.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Right? That's just not weird enough. There's a giant 8-foot tall guy.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 There's another one standing next to him who's shorter.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Doesn't say how much shorter. Doesn't say if he's still 7 feet tall.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 But now Frank is standing in his kitchen.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 He's an 8-foot tall glowing blue dude.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 [imitates glowing blue dude]

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Just standing there.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And then his partner standing there as well.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 [imitates glowing blue dude]

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Fight or flight.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Fight or flight, it is natural to human life.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Really animal life. Fight or flight.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And as he looks up and sees these two intruders glowing bright blue in the morning.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Right? It would be weird anytime of day.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 It's 7 a.m. We don't get a lot of alien encounters this early.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 He's looking at these two guys and the taller one points two fingers at the dude

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 and says in a mechanical voice, "Do not resist."

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 But fight or flight, you gotta do something.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Frank begins just reaching randomly in the kitchen throwing stuff at these dudes.

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Right? Toaster, plate, bent fork.

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 He starts throwing all this random stuff at these dudes and the taller one just looks at Frank and goes,

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 "Nothing can touch us."

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So that was the fight response, right?

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Now when he says nothing can touch us, I'm wondering if stuff was actually bouncing off of these dudes

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 or if it was harmlessly passing through or if they were pretending it didn't hurt.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 He hits them super hard with a toaster and the alien's like, "Oh, noxley went out of him."

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And he's like, "Ugh, you can't defeat us."

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And then he turns around and he throws up.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 He goes, "Nothing can touch us."

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And that's that fight or flight mechanism, right?

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 You did the fight, you did the fight thing.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It didn't work. These two dudes are just totally standing there.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Now it's the flight part.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 But this dude can't just bounce. He has a four-year-old kid upstairs.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 So he runs upstairs, grabs his kid, and as he's running back down through the living room,

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 these two dudes are still just standing there.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And I don't know why he made this leap of logic, no pun intended.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I guess you don't know the fun yet, but he comes down the stairs and he sees these two blue dudes.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I don't know where they are at in relation to any of the doors in the house.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 But when he runs downstairs holding his four-year-old son, he thinks the only way out of this house,

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I'm gonna jump through the window.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 So I don't know where he made that leap of logic, no pun intended,

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 but he jumps out of the window away from these two blue dudes

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 and, 7 a.m. on a sunny August morning in Russia,

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 he leaps through his window, he's now standing in his front yard,

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 and there is another alien.

119
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And when I use the word "alien" this is where we talk about "alien" as in, absolutely not of this world.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 The other two beings were glowing blue, but they were humanoid.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Arms and legs, heads, mouths, they're talking. When he jumps out the window,

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 there is this dude standing there.

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Arms and legs, that place is looking up really slowly, he's like, "Oh, it didn't work well the first time,

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 but this time it might be good."

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 He's looking at this guy and it's basically a robot.

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 He describes this one as incredibly robotic, but it didn't have a head.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Instead it had this huge computer monitor.

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And it was just showing all of these multi-colored lights dancing across the screen.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 [Multicolor lights]

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Frank took his son and did not look back, he just ran through town until he felt safe.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 He's running to this day.

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I got a story from a doc.com, they got it from a magazine called "Evening Ufa"

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 which technically is the name of the town, I'm wondering if it was like a newspaper there.

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's written by a guy named Jannadi Ivanov.

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 It's a great story. I love the setup of it, we very rarely get this stuff happening in the morning.

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 You're destroying the sanctity of the house, how would you ever feel safe if these things could just appear in here?

137
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And this is what we know about aliens, right? This is what we know about aliens, they just appear in places.

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 You can't stop them. And I also love it when we get the alien aspect of it.

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 We don't see it as often as you should.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 We covered that story, the invasion, like what was it, the Costa Blanca invasion?

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I'll put that in the show notes, it's one of my favorite episodes. It's truly alien, the way these things are behaving.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 We cover a lot of this stuff on the show, but when you look at UFO lore in general,

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 in American UFO lore specifically, it's a lot of great aliens, Pleiadians, Reptilians.

144
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And you go Jason, I mean Reptilians are alien, yeah, but they're still in that humanoid thing,

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 and the Reptilians have these power struggles and the Pleiadians are like, "No, we must bring about world peace."

146
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Those are all human emotions to just wake up and you're in your kitchen doing your thing,

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 and then they, they ruined his fork too. They're there. Why are they there? Why are they there so early?

148
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Why'd they bend the fork? Was it them coming into our reality that caused the fork to bend?

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And then just the one dude in the front yard with the multi-colored monitor head, truly alien thing.

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Like I get the first two guys might have been looking for some ham and eggs, but what was the guy doing with the monitor head in the front yard?

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 It's so weird. Such a bizarre story.

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And I'm wondering, you know, we do have a glut of great alien encounters in America, and in Russia there is no through line.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Like I've been reading stuff about Russian UFO encounters now for almost four years and I wasn't really aware of them before this.

154
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 They're so abstract. Very, very abstract and centricizing because when you look at artwork that came out of or was made during the Soviet Union

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 and artwork in the United States, their artwork is more abstract. I wonder what, that's always the question.

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It's too, too big to go into here, but what is the UFO phenomenon? Is it alien life? I don't think it's made up.

157
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 I don't, I'm not one of those people who thinks that everyone makes it up and there's no life anywhere.

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 My question always is, is it interdimensional? Is it from outer space? Is it from, are they people who evolved alongside of us on Earth?

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And they're hidden, they're hidden in cave systems or underwater. I mean, these are all, like I'm not making these theories up.

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 These are all different theories in UFOology, but then you have to wonder is the perceiver of the alien encounter also affecting that?

161
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 If it's an interdimensional creature, is what your worldview affecting that? Because Russian UFO encounters are so abstract.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 They're so bizarre. You do get weird stuff happening in America, but most of the time they're wearing little helmets with little,

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 if they're not a gray alien, when you look back in 1950s, 1960s UFO encounters, they're making pancakes for people.

164
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Put that episode in the show notes. I didn't just make that up. They wear helmets and suits and they look like people from old 1950s alien movies.

165
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 When you go to Russia, it's just the tune of what the giant monitor had. Very, very interesting stuff.

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 You know, a side note, did you know that there's a conspiracy theory and honestly, I think it's true.

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 I think a lot of people think it's true that the art coming out of the Soviet Union during the 60s and the 70s was so daring and abstract.

168
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 It was this new type of art and what was happening in America was like the Norman Rockwell type of thing.

169
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 You know, like, hey, look, it's two kids, two straws and a chocolate milkshake and a malt shop.

170
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 The elite, the artist community was like, dude, art sucks. Like, look at the stuff that Soviet Union is doing.

171
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Maybe they know something. Maybe communism is better. The conspiracy theory, and I honestly think this is true.

172
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And I think there's a lot of stuff to back it up. The CIA funded the modern art movement in America to compete with the Soviet art movement.

173
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 All that stuff going on, all that modern art that came out of the 60s and the 70s and today was created by the CIA.

174
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I don't even think this is a controversial statement. As the CIA breaks into my house and kills me, I've read articles about this.

175
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Like, I'm pretty sure that's well known. The CIA funded the postmodern art movement of America and the modern art movement as well

176
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 to compete with the Soviets. Fascinating stuff. The CIA, man, they got their fingers in everything.

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 They got their fingers on the trigger every time they catch me in their crosshairs as well.

178
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But I just loved this alien story and I wanted to share it with you.

179
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 I can understand, like, these aliens who are talking to me and saying, don't resist.

180
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 I mean, I'm still going to resist. I can see them saying you can't harm us.

181
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 But could you imagine coming up against something that is just a monitor forehead?

182
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Like, you can't even look into its eyes. It's so inhuman. It's the, you know, definition of a robot.

183
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And what was the monitor showing? Where was the signal coming from that was being shown on this monitor?

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Absolutely creepy. And it all happened at seven in the morning, too, which adds that extra layer of you're never safe.

185
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 You're absolutely never safe from these things.

186
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Helena, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are leaving behind Russia.

187
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 That guy's still running down the street. Come on, come on, jump on the helicopter.

188
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 His son is now an adult man. He's like, Dad, please put me down.

189
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Let's give him a ride and Helena fly this carbonar copter all the way out from Russia to Mount St. Helens, Washington.

190
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 It's May 18th, 1980. Mount St. Helens erupts.

191
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 [Breathing]

192
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Hot lava. People are running down the mountain. They're like, ah, ah.

193
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And the lava melts them. [Makes a noise]

194
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And then there's some dude. He made it down the mountain. He's like, that was close.

195
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I'm just going to look up and go, yay! And my whole of my mouth opened. He gets a bunch of ash.

196
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 [Makes a noise]

197
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 There's another dude running down the mountain and a boulder is chasing after him. He's like, ah.

198
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 A bunch of people died. A bunch of people died in real life, not in these comically bizarre ways.

199
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I don't even know if a bunch of lava shot out of it. I know it was a lot of ash and part of the mountain, part of the volcano, like collapsed.

200
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 It was like an entire side of it just kind of bubbled out and then blew up.

201
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So it wasn't like Joe versus the volcano. It wasn't like something dope like that.

202
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It was just like, it was just massive human misery because it killed dozens of people.

203
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 It was a huge environmental catastrophe. Ash spread across 11 states and 4 Canadian provinces.

204
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Thousands and thousands of animals were killed in the heat and the ash and the debris. It was awful.

205
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 But something else happened when Mount St. Helens erupted.

206
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Of course you had a bunch of rescue teams coming, right? You had wanted to come in.

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 You had to like save people, save people from looking up and going, look at that.

208
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 As more ash was coming, they're like, no, no, close your mouth.

209
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 You had National Guard come out there. They were trying to prevent more deaths and save people that they could.

210
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 So National Guard was out there and people in town saw a bunch of Chinook helicopters fly over to the area surrounding Mount St. Helens.

211
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 That's normal, right? Chinook helicopters, they're used for military transportation.

212
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So it makes sense to see a bunch of these during a rescue operation.

213
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 But the rumor was, is these Chinook helicopters weren't rescuing people.

214
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 There's like people stranded on their roofs, a bunch of hot lava surrounding the building.

215
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 They're like, help us, help us Chinooks. Like, eh, these Chinook helicopters weren't there to rescue humans.

216
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 It was a retrieval mission these guys were on.

217
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 They were there to pick up dead bigfoot.

218
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Apparently, among the thousands of animals and dozens of humans, quite a few bigfoot were killed when this mountain went off.

219
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And that would make sense, right? Washington Pacific Northwest is the home of bigfoot.

220
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 When a disaster this huge would hit, of course, you would see this as a side effect.

221
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 You'd see a lot of dead bigfoot.

222
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 So these Chinook helicopters came in to retrieve these bodies and they attached, they are so heavy.

223
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 They had to have these huge nets. The Chinook helicopters had to net them together and fly away with these bigfoot bodies.

224
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Destination unknown. Military laboratory.

225
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Pervert, pervert scientist. He wanted to see if it was just the feet that were big. Who knows?

226
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 We don't know where these bigfoot bodies went.

227
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So that is a story that you'll see pop up every once in a while in Bigfoot lore.

228
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 That a couple bigfoots died when Mount St. Helens went off and the Chinook helicopters flew them away.

229
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Very, very interesting. However, recently, Mysterious Universe did a write-up about bigfoot Yeti and government records.

230
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 What do agencies really know of these hairy giants?

231
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 By Nick Redfern. And that article mentioned another story.

232
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Back in 2012, a former National Guardsman contacted BigfootEvidence.blogspot.com

233
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 to say that this was more than just a couple Chinook helicopters picking up the corpses of these burnt bigfoot.

234
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 I was on the ground. This is the whole story.

235
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 So this National Guardsman, we're going to call him Joey.

236
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Joey said, Joey said him and his fellow guardsmen were sent to this particular area of Mount St. Helens to work on this cleanup crew.

237
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And while they're there, some dudes like, "Hey, you guys, you dudes over there, quit cleaning up."

238
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 They're like, "We weren't doing it. How do you clean up after a volcano?"

239
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 They're like dusting rocks. They're like, "I guess this works." They're like giving squirrels baths.

240
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 But just then, the commanding officer on the scene goes, "You guys, hey, put down those beavers. They can build their own dam."

241
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 You guys are being reassigned. Escort mission. Get your gear and get ready to go in five minutes.

242
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And they're like, "Okay." They're putting down the beavers. They're waving goodbye.

243
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And they're getting their gear ready. And they're like, "Well, we're doing escort mission. Who are we escorting around here?"

244
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And at that point, there's this vehicle there. And out of the back jumps a civilian.

245
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 This dude's walking around, glasses and like just regular old civilian clothes.

246
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 He doesn't have a uniform, right? You can obviously tell this guy's not in the military.

247
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And Joey turns to the commanding officer and goes, "Oh, so is this the guy we're escorting?"

248
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And the commanding officer looks, looks dramatically right at the camera and goes, "No."

249
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Well, yeah, you're escorting him, but you're also escorting that.

250
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 [Squawking]

251
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Out of this van, hops Bigfoot.

252
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 [Squawking]

253
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Now you would hope he was seen egypted for the first time. You would hope he was in a good mood, right?

254
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But he's not. His fur is singed. And he has a bandage on his arm.

255
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 [Squawking]

256
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 A little sad, right? A little underwhelming, right? You wanted to see this guy forever.

257
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 He has a really sad, kind of haunted look in his eye.

258
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And the civilian guy turns to Bigfoot and goes, "Uh-uh? Uh-uh-uh-uh."

259
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Bigfoot goes, "Uh-uh-uh-uh."

260
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 The soldiers are like, "Do we sign up National Guard to like help floods and stuff like that?"

261
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 They help during volcanoes and now we're going to be escorting Bigfoot.

262
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 What in the world is going- Where are we going?

263
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 The civilian goes, "Here's what we're going to do, everyone. Get in this jeep."

264
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 The Bigfoot's driving his feeder, destroying the gas pedals.

265
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Everyone get in this jeep. We're going to go wherever this big fella tells us to go.

266
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 It's interesting because the National Guardsman describes this Bigfoot as looking like the beast.

267
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Not from the Bible. It's the Antichrist. He's opening up this portal. I will devour your souls.

268
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Now, beast from the X-Men. So just very furry with the look of intelligence on him.

269
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And he doesn't even specify how big this guy is.

270
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 The beast from the comic books is normal height.

271
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 So he doesn't even say that this guy's like super huge. It's just- I mean, it's obviously not human.

272
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 It's a big old monster man.

273
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 But you have this dude covered in fur. The very, very expressive face and the expression right now is sadness.

274
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 So they all get in the jeep and they're driving around and the whole time the Bigfoot and the civilian are having a conversation.

275
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 [imitates car honking]

276
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And the soldiers are just listening in. They don't understand anything, but it's fascinating.

277
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 A man, a human talking to a Bigfoot- Bigfoot's existing in the first place?

278
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 [imitates car honking]

279
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Stop. He's telling us to stop.

280
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 [imitates car honking]

281
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 The jeep comes to a stop and the Bigfoot's sitting in the back and goes,

282
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 [imitates car honking]

283
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 The forest is quiet. They wait a moment.

284
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 The forest is quiet. They wait another moment.

285
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And then Bigfoot turns to the civilian.

286
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 [imitates car honking]

287
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Keep going. Keep going. We're leaving this area.

288
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 [imitates car honking]

289
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 The jeep continues on its path. They get to the next location.

290
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Bigfoot yells out into the forest,

291
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 [imitates car honking]

292
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Do you like chasing a police dog doing a super irritating Bigfoot voice?

293
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Nope.

294
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Because what happens is when he yells out this time,

295
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 off in the distance of the woods,

296
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 [imitates car honking]

297
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Bigfoot got super excited.

298
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And he's like, "Ugh, okay, I'll just sing with him."

299
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Bigfoot's saying in English at this point.

300
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Otherwise, this episode is going to be three hours long.

301
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Basically, Bigfoot's going, "One of my people. One of my people are here."

302
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Apparently he's a professional wrestler now.

303
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And so the National Guardsmen go out and they follow the sound of this other Bigfoot,

304
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and they find Bigfoot,

305
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 [imitates car honking]

306
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 He's injured. But he's going to be okay.

307
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Come on, come on.

308
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Let's get an entire division of troops to carry you back to the jeep.

309
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 [imitates jeep grunting]

310
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Now, I'm guessing it doesn't say that this Bigfoot jumps in the jeep with the other guys.

311
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I'm guessing like they left some soldiers behind to like keep them company while the rescue mission's coming in.

312
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Because the jeep that Joey is in, and the civilian and the first Bigfoot, continues to drive on its way.

313
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 They go to the next location. It's a cave.

314
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And the Bigfoot yells out of the car, "Is anyone in there? In there. In there."

315
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 [imitates car honking]

316
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 They hear a Bigfoot yelling and being, "This would be the most horrifying mission I've ever gone."

317
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 They hear the sound of this Bigfoot screaming and pain down this dark cave so two soldiers go inside.

318
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 And they start trying to help this Bigfoot out, and he's really badly burned.

319
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And so, the soldiers are trying to help this wounded Bigfoot out of the cave,

320
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 and eventually the Bigfoot in the vehicle sees his compatriot and just kind of shakes his head.

321
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 [imitates car honking]

322
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 He's not going to make it.

323
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Let's go.

324
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 The guys like at least give me a fighting chance.

325
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Take me one of those helicopters. Take me somewhere.

326
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 The Bigfoot orders the jeep to leave, and as they're driving away from the area, they hear a [imitates car honking]

327
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And as they're driving away, they hear that gunshot and the Bigfoot in the back seat just kind of [imitates car honking]

328
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Shakes his head.

329
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Think about how rare it is to even see a Sasquatch.

330
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 It would be, I mean, it's awful when a human dies, but there's seven billion of us.

331
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Imagine there was only seven of us, and one of them died. It would be horrifying.

332
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 So Bigfoot in the back seat is like, "Oh man, that's going to suck."

333
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 They do this at three more locations, not shoot fellow Bigfoot's.

334
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 They go to three different locations and the Bigfoot is yelling out of the jeep, "Is anyone out there?"

335
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And there's no response.

336
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And then their final location, they stop that day.

337
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Bigfoot lets out his call, trying to see if any of his brothers or sisters are still alive.

338
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 [imitates car honking]

339
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 He hears in the distance.

340
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 They find this dude, he has a really bad burn on his left leg, but other than that, he's A-okay.

341
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 So the soldiers are like waving goodbye to Joey and the jeep with the civilian and all that stuff,

342
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 and they're going to call in a rescue crew for this guy as well.

343
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 So Joey and the Bigfoot and the civilian and whoever is left in this jeep, because they've been leaving people behind the whole time,

344
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 finally make it back to base camp.

345
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And by then, they see the wounded Bigfoot's actually being taken into the base camp as well.

346
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 They've also been rescued successfully.

347
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And as the Bigfoot jumps out of the jeep, he starts walking into the tent where his fellow Sasquatches are,

348
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 and the civilian is walking next to him, they're having this conversation.

349
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And Bigfoot turns around and looks at Joey, looks at Joey straight in the eye,

350
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 gives him a little wave, a little wave of the hand, and then looks back down at the ground

351
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and walks into the tent of the base camp at the foot of Mount St. Helens.

352
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Joey and the other National Guardsmen who were part of this mission are like,

353
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 "Okay, we just had this adventure now, what?"

354
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And they're almost like their commanding officer knew what was going on, because he goes,

355
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 "Listen, I know you guys have a lot of questions, I'm going to tell you this right now.

356
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 You can't tell anyone about this. You cannot tell anyone about this, and here's why.

357
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 These dudes are just like us. They're just trying to survive.

358
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 There's not a lot of them left, and if you guys go out and tell the story of what you guys just saw,

359
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 this place is going to be flooded with hunters and camera crews and wackos and everything in between.

360
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Keep your mouth shut." The commanding officer did say,

361
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 "If you want to tell the story, wait 20 or 30 years, and then you can talk about it,

362
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 because at that point, they're not going to be here.

363
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 But for now, best to just let it lie."

364
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Joey goes on to say that after this, he's a resident of Washington, that's why he's in the National Guard.

365
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 He goes, "I've spent my life hiking through the Pacific Northwest.

366
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I'm always living out here, and I'm always camping out here."

367
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 He goes, "I have never, ever, ever seen anything to make me think that these bigfoot are still in the area,

368
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 and I looked for them. I learned a little bit of bigfoot. He's yelling at the end of the distance."

369
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 He goes, "I specifically was looking for these. Sometimes I was just enjoying the great outdoors,

370
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 and I wasn't really looking for them, but on my camping and on my hike,

371
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 I would think, are they still out here?" And goes, "Since then, I've never seen any clue that they've ever been out here.

372
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Since. I've never seen anything close to what I saw that day when I escorted bigfoot around Mount St. Helens."

373
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 I find it fascinating when we talk about bigfoot.

374
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 There's two camps. We've talked about this before on the show, so I'm going to go over it really briefly,

375
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 but there's the camp, and I think this is the most popular camp.

376
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 That bigfoot is a biological creature that exists, that leaves behind fur and leaves behind poop,

377
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 and it eats berries and wild animals, and someday will catch it.

378
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Just like every year or two, we discover new species on the planet Earth.

379
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 That's a misleading fact. It's a truthful fact, but most of the time it's like little salamanders,

380
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 tiny little fishes, insects, that you could have stepped on all day long and never seen.

381
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And then you can look back, like people thought the gorilla was a myth.

382
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 People didn't believe gorillas were real. Hans Wormhat still doesn't, but until they saw them,

383
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 they'd heard these stories about these giant man-like creatures, and they're like, "That's impossible."

384
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 But they found him. But I think the more realistic, quote-unquote realistic idea,

385
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 at least for me, but it sounds unrealistic for bigfoot, is that it's some sort of spiritual entity

386
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 that it is interdimensional. We've covered stories where humans turn into bigfoots.

387
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 We've covered stories where bigfoots are piloting UFOs or prisoners in UFOs.

388
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 We've encountered interdimensional bigfoots. We've encountered biblical bigfoots.

389
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Mormon bigfoot is supposedly Cain from the Bible who killed his brother and continues to walk the Earth.

390
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I'll put all those episodes in the show notes if you want to have a bigfoot bash.

391
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 But I also, I think it's more like that. I think it's more that it's some sort of spiritual creature,

392
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 some sort of transdimensional creature. However, I do believe, if it's not that,

393
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I believe the bigfoot used to be here. I think that's far more likely that when the Native Americans

394
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 were settling the New World, they encountered bigfoot.

395
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And when you had tales of the Yeti, when you had tales of these creatures and other,

396
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 the wild man in Russia and all these things, they did exist at that time.

397
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 They were a real biological creature. And the stories today would be the last sightings of these things.

398
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 It's possible that bigfoot existed from Native American times up through 1960s, 1970s, 1980s,

399
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 and the population kept dwindling smaller and smaller. And now there are none.

400
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Now, this is just hypothesis. You know, you can say, "No, Jesus, I saw bigfoot.

401
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 My house is getting robbed by bigfoot right now." I think it's possible that the creature existed at one point,

402
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 and nowadays it's mistaken identity. Nowadays it's something else.

403
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 It's a bear walking through the woods or something like that. I'm not adverse to believing that bigfoot never existed.

404
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 I don't know if I'm being rambly here. I just find it so hard to believe.

405
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 I believe in aliens and demons and ghosts. I find it so hard to believe that there's a biological creature

406
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 walking around today that has a dedicated industry to finding him and they can't find him.

407
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 So that makes me think he either one used to exist is a biological creature and is long dead.

408
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Like 1980s, that may have been the last surviving troop of bigfoot in the area.

409
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And nowadays it's just all people telling stories or misidentifying things.

410
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Or bigfoot is not a biological entity. It is some sort of spirit creature.

411
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 It is some sort of transdimensional entity. But I do like this story because it is that idea that this is the last group of its race

412
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 and this mountain exploded, this volcano blew up.

413
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And bigfoot's driving around trying to find survivors of his very, very quickly dwindling species.

414
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I also like the idea of the human translator, right?

415
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 I mentioned on an episode a long time ago and I don't remember what episode it was, but if the military, if the governments of the world

416
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 have groups dedicated to studying UFOs, to studying psychic phenomenon, to being able to tell can you remote view the military, Russia, and America,

417
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 have tried to have remote viewers, they've tried to work with telekinesis and telepathy.

418
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 If they have groups dedicated to that, I am sure they have groups dedicated to finding out are ghost real, are demons real, does bigfoot exist.

419
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Why wouldn't you? You just be like, "What? That's ridiculous. I'm going to keep turning these dials and trying to find an alien transmission from Alpha Centauri."

420
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 If you're looking for alien life, if you believe that telekinesis is possible, why would you shut the door to the bigfoot phenomenon?

421
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I like that idea as well, that the military would know about these things. The reason why they would keep it quiet is because why not?

422
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 If they're just a bunch of gentle giants, it's not like you could train them to go kill Osama bin Laden, right?

423
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 They would just be eating figs and things like that. If the government knew, "Hey, there's a species, there's probably about 15 of them left by the year 1980.

424
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 All the other sightings are misidentified and there's a horrible disaster. Let's see how many of these guys we can save."

425
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 It doesn't necessarily have to be a malicious story. They would be curious, right? They may take the dead bodies to do some experiments on, but...

426
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Interesting story. It just really opens up the idea of what is bigfoot?

427
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Is it a quickly dying species that suffered a great loss on May 18th, 1980?

428
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Is it a vibrant biological community that to this day is all over America, all over the world, these Sasquatches, these bigfoot, these Yetis, these Yawis,

429
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 still continue to exist today and raise new families, have little baby bigfoot, and so on and so forth?

430
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Or is it a even more puzzling answer that they are interdimensional, that they have some connection to UFOs or just high strangeness in general?

431
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 But whenever we look at these big theories, we do tend to forget the humanity of the bigfoot.

432
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 They really do seem to be gentle giants. We very rarely come across stories where they threaten humans, let alone hurt them.

433
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And here was a story about a National Guardsman who was in the right place at the right time to become part of history, a rescue mission, to save the Sasquatch.

434
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 When Joey was out hiking, is it possible that he missed every sign that these bigfoot buddies were still around?

435
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And he thanks to this day, well that was the last of them.

436
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Like my commanding officer said, just wait 30 years because they're not going to be around much longer.

437
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 A species on the verge of extinction and since then, they've disappeared.

438
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 Or even though Joey thought he was walking alone in the woods, was he being watched by an old friend of his?

439
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 A bigfoot that once sat in the back of a jeep, wailing mournfully to see if his fellow countrymen were still alive, is now standing in the forest, completely cloaked by the foliage above his head.

440
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Standing next to his son and his wife and going, "That is the man who helped me that day."

441
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 "That is the man who saved our people."

442
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 And as Joey's fishing in the stream, bigfoot turns to his son and goes, "That is why I named you Joey."

443
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 Because of him.

444
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 And as the bigfoot family disappears into the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest,

445
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Joey, the former National Guardsman out on a hike, thought he had a once in a lifetime encounter with the mighty bigfoot.

446
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 It turns out he made a friend for life.
