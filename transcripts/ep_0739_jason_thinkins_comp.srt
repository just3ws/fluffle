1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 Everyone's favorite conspiracy theory website is threatened with lawsuits and takedown notices.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,000
 They're a crime, accusing Bill Gates of wanting to melt elderly people from the inside out.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Since when is the truth been illegal?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,500
 And then we travel to South Africa to meet a man who has a broken thigh bone and goes to the hospital.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
 It's supposed to be a routine procedure.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:34,000
 But when he goes missing, hospital staff have no idea they're about to be plunged into a bizarre and brutal mystery.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,500
 And then we plug ourselves into the most bizarre conspiracy theory of all.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 If rocket ships are phallic, because they are, if you didn't know that, if you didn't know that,

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,000
 rocket ships are very phallic, the Earth-based rockets is a little long for an intro.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 If rocket ships are phallic, it's a flying saucer when an alien's wing looks like.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,500
 Yeah, we're gonna talk about that today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:13,000
 [music]

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,000
 I hope you guys had a great weekend. I am feeling much, much better.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500
 I think you guys can hear it in my voice.

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,000
 Last week I dealt with really bad earache, but I am back.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Better than normal. Better than normal.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I'd say, you know who else is better than normal?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 One of our newest Patreon supporters coming into Dead Rabbit Command.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 It's Famlica. Everyone give a round of applause to Famlica.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,500
 Doing cartwheels into our headquarters here.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,000
 Famlica, you're gonna be our captain or pilot of this episode.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Because can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Just help spread the word about this show.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Famlica, I'm gonna go ahead and attach you to the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We are headed up, up and away, all the way out to...

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Irma Lake Lodge, Wyoming.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 [imitates engine]

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Famlica is perfectly piloting this thing.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 We're in stealth mode.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,500
 Because if you're a regular listener of Dead Rabbit Radio, and if you're not, that's fine too.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,000
 We'll do a quick update.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Can you guys just get your news from the actual news?

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 You may not be aware of this.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Bill Gates, a millionaire computer designer, prototypical nerd, Bill Gates,

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 is actually currently on trial, it's this military tribunal, for crimes against humanity.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 If I remember the series of events correctly, he had a...

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 We covered this on the show.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 It was breaking news, I'm sure you saw it on CNN or Fox as well.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 But in Irma Lake Lodge, it was revealed that there was a bunch of tunnels underneath it.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And he was like full of dead kids, or like some kids were alive and some kids were dead.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I don't really remember the details.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 It's gory either way, right?

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I mean, like if they're living kids, that's just as...

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I don't know if that's just as bad, but it's just based on how many kids in your basement.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 At all, even if you have a family, let your kids play in the front yard.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 But anyways, he had a bunch of kids in his basement.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Okay, so here's the thing.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I have to be very careful with this because he didn't, right?

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 You guys know what a joke is.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 When I report on these Bill Gates stories or the Tom Hanks stories or whatever, I'm joking.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And I... you guys know that.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 But here's the problem.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 The people in Spotify don't, because I have one episode missing from what, 730 something episodes at this point?

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 If you go to Spotify, they're all there except for one.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And I think the title was "Is Bill Gates the Antichrist?"

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And I was... I don't... I haven't listened to the episode in forever.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I can tell you pretty much... I can tell you pretty much what it is.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 It's the same type of nonsense we're covering here, but for whatever reason, Spotify knocked that one down.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 The rest of them are still all on there.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So I don't know who triggered that or who flagged it.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I was obviously being very facetious about it, but who knows.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 But anyway, so I feel... I feel like at least one of Bill Gates lawyers listens to this podcast.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And I'm sure you enjoy it.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 I do talk about Bill Gates all the time.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 But if you find it odd that that's the episode that got deleted.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Now it's still on YouTube, it's still on every other podcast app.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 It's just not on Spotify.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 But I also have to be very careful because of the subject matter we're talking here.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 This is why we're going back to Real Raw News.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Irma Lake Lodge, family cuz flying the... family cuz the lawyer for Bill Gates are like,

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 "Oh, I'm glad I'm on this episode."

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Flying the dirgeable over family cuz boss's house.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Real Raw News loves to publish these stories about these world figures being held in this tribunal.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Like Hillary Clinton was pooping her pants in Guantanamo Bay.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I think she was recently hung or electrocuted or shot, one of those things.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Nancy Pelosi has a lookalike who wears a Nancy Pelosi mask, runs around San Francisco,

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 runs around, goes into Congress, passed his laws and stuff like that.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 It's not the real her.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And President Biden is the actor from the erotic tales of the invisible man.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 It's just utter nonsense that this website Real Raw News puts out.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And all those episodes I'll put in the show notes.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Cuz I'm sure if you haven't heard those you're curious.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I had recently discovered I was poking around Real Raw News.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I found this and it kind of bummed me out honestly.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Cuz we've covered Real Raw News a lot.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 It's this website that pedals this stuff.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I came across this disclaimer.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And this is what it says.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Information on this website.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 This is actually on the website itself and it's kind of difficult to find.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 The website is not well made.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And one thing I've noticed about these hardcore conspiracy websites,

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 they're always terribly designed.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I don't know if it's a bug or a feature.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Cuz if you go to the About Us page on Real Raw News, it just brings you to the front page.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Like you have to really click around to find this disclaimer.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And it says information on this website is for informational and educational and entertainment purposes.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 This website contains humor, parody, and satire.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And when I read that I said, "It makes a lot of sense."

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It makes a lot of sense, right?

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Cuz these stories don't make sense.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 It doesn't make sense.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 We know Hillary Clinton wasn't pooping her pants in Guantanamo Bay.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I cannot verify if I should poop her pants anywhere else.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I will not go on the record to say she didn't poop her pants in Vermont.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 But she did not poop them in Guantanamo Bay.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 So I saw that.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And I thought, "Damn it."

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 At that point I thought, "I'm just not really gonna cover Real Raw News again."

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Cuz it kind of took...

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 If they're cracking...

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 If it's the onion for a conspiracy theorist, then it's funny.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But it's not...

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I can't really talk about it on the show.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And to continue this disclaimer, it says,

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 "We have included this disclaimer for our protection on the advice of legal counsel."

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 So I read that and I thought, "Well, are they actually saying that?"

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 "Are they actually saying that this is a comedy website?"

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Or, "Are they saying we have to tell people to comedy websites so we can't be sued?"

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And you'll see that when you go to eBay and you buy haunted paintings or haunted dolls,

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I'm probably gonna be selling both of those pretty soon.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 But when you go to eBay and you look at the descriptions, it says,

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 "This is for entertainment purposes only.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 We make no promises that this doll actually has a ghost in it."

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And it's kind of a week-a-week-not-not saying,

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 "This does have a ghost in it, but Amazon won't let us sell it."

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Ghosts don't exist according to Amazon.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 It's just like an out.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 It's a legal out.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 So when I saw that, I thought, "Well, I probably won't cover them anymore."

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 If it's satire, I don't want to cover it.

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 But I immediately thought,

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 "I found out about Real Raw News because of another website we used to cover all the time, Dark Outpost."

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 That is 100% authentic.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I believe.

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I mean, now I'm a little puzzled.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 But they seem to be really authentic craziness

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 and they quoted these guys all the time.

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So when they're not at satire,

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 you may be having a laugh and that's fine.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I can't tell you what to laugh at.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 But it's definitely affecting the conspiracy sphere.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Because I'm seeing this stuff being reported other places.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 But I decided when I read this, it was probably like two or three weeks ago,

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I said, "I'm just not going to cover Real Raw News anymore on the show."

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 However, I still enjoy the website.

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I will still go and check out these articles and get a good laugh.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And that is when I saw this one and I don't think this is satire.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I don't think this is.

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 There's a very, very interesting article.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 On September 7th, they published two articles.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 One was Bill Gates is on day four of his tribunal.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And what happened was they brought forth evidence that Bill Gates melted elderly people from the inside out.

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I don't even know where to start with that one.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I don't think you want to go into detail.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 I guess back in the 90s, Microsoft or the Bill Gates Foundation or something like that was running a pneumonia shot for five years.

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 You don't have to get the flu shot for five years.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And people signed up for it and 250 of the people melted their organs.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 They weren't M&Ms, they just melted.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And their organs melted away and stuff like that.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And I go, "Whoa, that's probably some old conspiracy theory."

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I wouldn't surprise me.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 We know Bill Gates was doing vaccine stuff back then.

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Oh, there goes this Spotify trigger right now that I said that in one sentence.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 We know that he's been doing health work and working on vaccines and trying to beat malaria in Africa and stuff like that.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 So maybe he was affiliated with a group that was working on a five year long flu vaccine and they were looking for volunteers in the Seattle area.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 I don't think he melted people.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Do I have to say that?

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 I don't think he melted anybody.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 We would have known about that even if there was a big cover up because according to Real Raw News, one person survived of this 90 year old woman.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And she's like, "I lost both my eyeballs and both my kidneys failed and I got one lung.

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 But here I am, here I am, the beautiful Guantanamo Bay to testify against Bill Gates."

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And she said her organs shut down.

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 She was the only person to survive this organ melting thing, this elderly lady.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And she said while she was in the hospital room back in Seattle back 20 years ago,

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 she got a phone call and she recognized the voice of Bill Gates and he goes,

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 "Don't tell anyone about this. Remember you signed those non-disclosure agreements."

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 So goodbye.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And I thought, here's the, I read that and I immediately thought, who in the world could recognize Bill Gates' voice?

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 So Real Raw News reported that and then they also reported this.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Same day, bad timing, Real Raw News.

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 They got an email or a series of emails from the Gates Foundation spokesperson, Mark Sussman.

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 The whole article is so bizarre.

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So on September 2nd, they get this first couple of cease and desist orders and they're saying,

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 "You're going to be hit with fines and takedown notices and you'll face jail time,"

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 which is not how that works.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I think Real Raw News can't help but lie.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Oh, and I should say this actually, after I found out about their disclaimer.

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 I emailed Michael Baxter. He's the owner of Real Raw News.

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He writes other articles and I asked him, "Is your website satire?"

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And he hasn't responded yet, but I did reach out to him about that.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 But he has this article and he says, "Mark Sussman writes this saying,

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 'You have to remove all of this Bill Gates stuff.

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 You can't have this out here. It's not true."

200
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 If you look at the comments, some of the people are going, "Well, it's a satire website."

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 So you can't sue somebody who claims it's satire and they posted about a time that Rachel Maddow,

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 she's a commentator for MSNBC, and who's the other guy, Tucker.

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Tucker Carlson on Fox have both been sued and they're defenses and they won by saying,

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 "This is an entertainment show. It's an opinion-based show."

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 We're not hard news and they aren't.

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 So their lawsuits apparently failed.

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 So people in the website were saying that Real Raw News is the same.

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It's satire. You can't sue someone for writing satirical articles,

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 even though it's hard to discover it's satire.

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But in the article itself, Real Raw News posted this, this quote,

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 "Real Raw News stands by its reporting and sources who risk their lives and livelihoods

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 to provide us with sensitive information."

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And then it goes on to say, "If we weren't confident in our reporting or our ability to legally defend ourselves,

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 we wouldn't risk printing these stories and so on and so forth."

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 I want to talk about this for a couple of reasons and I'll wrap this up super quick.

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 One, whether or not Real Raw News is satire, it is entertaining.

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I don't know how much I'm going to cover on it going forward because I don't want to just be covering jokes.

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 The same reason why I don't cover creepypasta or ARGs, right?

219
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Because we just know where they're from to begin with.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 We know the motivation behind them.

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 A creepypasta will always be, or for the most part, 99% of the time will be creepier than a real story.

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And an ARG will be more mysterious than a lot of real mysteries because they're designed that way.

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 They know how humans love to read and they know how to craft a story.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Reality doesn't have that.

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Reality is messy and the mysteries are messy.

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And it's satire would fall in the same thing.

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 They know what's funny so they can make a funny sounding conspiracy.

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 On the other hand, I thought it was interesting.

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 A big thing with this stuff, we've talked about it on the show.

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 We talked about it as recently as the Tom Hanks episode.

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Someone will come out and make a crazy claim.

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 They'll come out and they'll say that.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Chris Evans loves to wear the skin of elderly women once a month.

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 He's not a sicko.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 He doesn't do it every single day.

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But once a month, he goes in with claws and he pulls out this leathered old woman's skin.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And he puts it on his shirt and Bill Gates melts it on his old people.

238
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And I make that claim.

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And I can back it up and it's disgusting and people go,

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 "That's something that can catch on."

241
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Because what's true, it's totally true. Chris Evans does do that.

242
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 But no, it's gross. People don't trust the elite.

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 People don't trust wealthy people to begin with.

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So, again, conspiracy theories that are gross actually catch on quicker.

245
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So, it would have legs.

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 It would have wrinkly leathery legs to run on.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And then, of course, he's going to ignore it.

248
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Because he doesn't even know.

249
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 He doesn't even know that he said that.

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 He didn't listen to this episode yet.

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 He listened to the other 730. He hasn't gotten to this one.

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 But let's say he does here. Let's say he goes viral.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Let's say all of you people start tweeting and on Instagram and posting this.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Chris Evans wears elderly skin.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Let's get it trending.

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Let's say a million people start talking about it.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 He's never going to respond to it because it's so absurd.

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Because if you stopped and responded, the more famous you get,

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 the more power you assume, the more weirdos come out of the woodwork.

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And if you stopped to comment on every bizarre belief, that's all you would ever do.

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Every press conference, they were like, "Chris Evans, you know,

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 before we talk about The Avengers 4, we want to know about that meme

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 that went around a couple of years ago about you wearing old lady's skin.

264
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 You can't do it."

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 So a lot of times you see, and we talk about this in Tom Hanks' episode,

266
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 people go, "If it's not true, they would sue us."

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 They would sue us, but they know if they take us to court,

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 we're able to present evidence.

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 We're able to hall exhibit A, this old woman's skin.

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Chris Evans is like, "Ah, they broke into my closet."

271
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 So they don't want to go to court because they know it's true.

272
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 But here we have that.

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Here we have, if this is true, what you would be a weird double bluff, right,

274
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 to lie about getting caught lying about someone.

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It would be really, really inception level deception.

276
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Inception deception, you might say.

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Don't say that.

278
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Don't ever say that again.

279
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 But if this is true, then that argument goes out the window

280
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 because they are saying, "We are willing to take you to court over this stuff,"

281
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 satire or not.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And satire is not the best defense either,

283
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 especially when you say that you have reporters and they're risking their lives.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Good Boffins died to find this Bill Gates story.

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Very, very interesting.

286
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 We'll see how it goes.

287
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 We'll see where it goes.

288
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Either real raw news will eventually get shut down and they'll become a whole new...

289
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I don't think it'll go that far, but something will happen.

290
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 If they stop the Bill Gates saga, it's possible.

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 But an interesting conspiracy within the conspiracy theory community,

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 and that is always entertaining to me.

293
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Famlika, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit robot.

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 We are leaving behind Irma Lake Lodge.

295
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 It's probably landlocked.

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 We'll find a long river.

297
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 We are rowing all the way out to...

298
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Durbin, South Africa.

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Splishity splash.

300
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Splishity splash.

301
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Rowing all the way out there while Famlika is having a Mai Tai

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 and enjoying the breeze.

303
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 That's the benefit of being a captain.

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 This is a story I came across.

305
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Absolutely bizarre mystery.

306
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I was reading this article in The Mail and Guardian,

307
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 which is a South African newspaper.

308
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I was reading this article by Nellie Sweeney Masome.

309
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 It's one of those articles.

310
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 As I was reading it, I was like, "That's interesting. That's interesting."

311
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Newspaper articles are written in an inverted triangle,

312
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 where the most important information is at the top.

313
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And information, as you get farther down the article,

314
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 the information gets less and less important,

315
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and that way an editor can just take off the last two paragraphs.

316
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 There's not room in the newspaper.

317
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Online, it doesn't really matter as much.

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 And the reader, when's the last time you finished an article?

319
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 A lot of times, unfortunately, some people just read the headline.

320
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 That drives me up the wall, but you read the headline,

321
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 and then you read what the headline's about,

322
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 and you read the context of it,

323
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 and you read the first couple paragraphs.

324
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 The first paragraph's the most important.

325
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And then you probably read halfway through,

326
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 and the information does start to become less and less important.

327
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 This article...

328
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Okay, so let's talk about this.

329
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 May 10th, 2019, in Durban, South Africa,

330
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 we're at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital,

331
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 and there's a dude walking in...

332
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I mean, walking in, probably in Wheeldon,

333
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 named Sandile Sibia, a 53-year-old man.

334
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 He's a builder by trade,

335
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and he often gets injured on the job.

336
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 But this day, he injures his leg,

337
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 he injures his thigh, and he's like,

338
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 "Oh, man, just all on a day's work.

339
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I haven't built something unless I've been injured."

340
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 But he's continuing to putter around the work site,

341
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 and his leg keeps hurting more and more.

342
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 He's not a sensitive man.

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 He can walk off a lot of injuries.

344
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 But when he looks down, his pants are getting tight.

345
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 But he's like, "That's weird. I don't remember wearing yoga pants.

346
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I don't remember wearing jeans on one leg

347
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 and the other leg yoga pants."

348
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 He goes to the hospital, and he has a busted femur.

349
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I mean, it's like really, really injured.

350
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I don't know what accident led to this.

351
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 But he was walking around for a bit.

352
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Starts swelling up.

353
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 He's in the hospital. Now, he's there for about three days.

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 It's that bad of an injury.

355
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And after three days, they say, "You know what?

356
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 We're actually going to send you to this other hospital.

357
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 We're going to have the specialist take a look at you

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 and see what we can do for this, because this is not going to be well."

359
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So they're going to transfer him to Addington Hospital.

360
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And the day they're getting ready to transfer him,

361
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 they go into his room.

362
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 He's not there.

363
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And they're thinking, "It's weird,

364
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 because this is a guy with a broken leg."

365
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Although he's able to, you know, sustain injuries

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 that would probably give all of us a really, really bad week,

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 the staff go, "Well, he couldn't have gotten far."

368
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 And he has a broken leg. We've been treating it for three days.

369
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 However, maybe if he was stubborn, maybe he would try going home.

370
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Let's just look around the hospital and see if we can find him.

371
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 So they're checking the hospital, go to the chapel,

372
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 go to the other rooms, go to where all the sexy nurses take their break.

373
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 They can't find this dude. They can't find Sandile.

374
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 They end up calling his family.

375
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Family comes down to help look for him.

376
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 They're like, "Do you know of any hidey-holes he likes to hide in?"

377
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Did he always pretend he was Harry Potter and live under stairs?

378
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Family's looking for him. Security's looking for him.

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Staff is looking for him.

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Eventually they call the police and file a missing persons report.

381
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 They have no idea where this dude is.

382
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Fourteen days later, May 24th,

383
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 that's when the smell starts.

384
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Dude, do you smell that?

385
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 They're like, "I'm in a hospital. They're holding a bedpan full of human poop."

386
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 They're like, "No, no, not that. The other disgusting smell."

387
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 You have to think, like if you go into a restaurant and it smells bad, you're not comfortable.

388
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 If you went out doors, you're walking around out doors and you smell something really bad,

389
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 you can just maybe keep walking.

390
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 If you keep walking, you're walking by a body, like a mass grave.

391
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Oh my God, the smell will get better eventually.

392
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Right where here where the genocide ends, 100 feet away.

393
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 But in a hospital, that's one place you don't want to smell bad.

394
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 I would say a hospital, a restaurant, a hospital, a restaurant, or your house would also be really bad.

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 But this isn't a list of things where stuff smells bad.

396
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 This is a mystery that has to do with the smell.

397
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 They're continuing to look around and I think the staff is kind of realizing,

398
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 "Actually, I wonder if they did. I wonder, because it's 14 days later."

399
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I mean, are they still looking for this dude? They figure he's just around town?

400
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 I don't think they're, I don't think when they go, "Oh, that smells like sandile.

401
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 That must be that man who's missing."

402
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 But they do smell something horrible. They can't locate the center of the smell.

403
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 They can't locate the source of the smell.

404
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And then at one point an employee is going about his business and he opens up a storage room.

405
00:21:37,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 He goes inside, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip

406
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 He's up there eating sauerkraut for 14 days. "You miss me?" They're like, "Yeah."

407
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Now he's dead and his body was rotting and the dripping was his liquefied remains soaking through the ceiling.

408
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 And you're reading this and you're like, "Okay, wait a second.

409
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 This dude who was bedridden for three days who had a broken thigh bone, swollen leg, disappeared."

410
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 That's the weird part one. Him being able to shamble out of the hospital and no one's seeing him.

411
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But now you're telling us he climbed into a roof, like into the ceiling, where they had to get a ladder to get up in there.

412
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 So not only was this guy immobile, too immobile to leave the hospital, now they're trying to tell the family that he climbed up a ladder.

413
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And the family's like, "That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any sense at all. What did he die of?

414
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 What did he die of?" They're asking the doctors. The doctors are kind of looking at each other and the coroner reports are inconclusive.

415
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 They don't know how this guy died. And this is a 100% true story. This is not creepypasta. This was reported in several newspapers at the time.

416
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 They have no idea how this guy climbed up into the ceiling, how he died, why he did any of this.

417
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Now the hospital said, according to medical records, he was mentally ill and you can never predict what mentally ill people can do.

418
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Sometimes they can fly. Sometimes they can hover five feet into the air and walk into the ceiling. His family goes, "He's not mentally ill."

419
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And mentally ill people can't fly. I don't think I would take advice from that doctor.

420
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 But his family says that's not true. He was actually never diagnosed with being mentally ill or anything like that.

421
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 So it was this weird thing, it was, "What's the hospital trying to cover their butts?"

422
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 By going, "Well, mentally ill people will do mentally ill things. They'll walk around on broken legs and climb into roofs."

423
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 The reporters are like, "That's not generally not known what mentally ill people do. They're generally not their modus operandi."

424
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 But the family says that's not true. And I'm reading this article and I go, "That's a really cool mystery. How did he get into the ceiling?"

425
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 But then, this is like two paragraphs to the bottom of this article. And I was already hooked. I was already like, "I'm gonna talk about this on my show. Just a cool little mystery."

426
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Almost 80% way through the article I get to this sentence. Strangely, quote, "Strangely enough, Sibaya is at least,"

427
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 if you're qualifying this, right, "is at least the second patient to be found dead and among the rafters in a South African public hospital in the last two years."

428
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Unquote.

429
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 A 16-hour drive away from Durban, South Africa is Stelenbosch, South Africa.

430
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 October 5th, 2017, at Stelenbosch Hospital, Tetekeke Kosti, 61-year-old man, had just had abdominal surgery done on him.

431
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Stomach surgery would be a more easily pronounced way to do it. He had surgery in his abdomen area.

432
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I don't know how many of you people are avid walkers. I don't know how many people like to get up at any point, like just get about a bed.

433
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 The abdomen's pretty important to, you know, like movement. You kind of need that part.

434
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 So he had just had his abdomen cut open. They did the surgery. He's in recovery. It's like the next day.

435
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 There's like, "Oh, it's stomach. It still hurts." The nurse comes in at his room. It's 5.15 a.m. and she's like his nurse. She's there to make sure that he's not playing with the stitches that he's not trying to eat much spaghetti.

436
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 They're like, "No, no, no." And then she goes, "I'm going to go get you some new linens. I'm going to go get you some fresh bedsheets."

437
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And she leaves the room and she comes back shortly afterwards, what, maybe a half hour, an hour at most.

438
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 He's gone.

439
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And they're thinking, "Okay, this guy couldn't have gotten it." This guy, let me lie down, we used the term, he couldn't have gotten far.

440
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Literally, this guy's stomach was open. His abdomen was sliced open just a couple hours ago, like the night before.

441
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 He literally can't get very far. He has to be somewhere. They search everywhere in the hospital. They can't find this guy.

442
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 On October 7th, two days later, they call up the family and they're like, "Hey, you know, don't panic."

443
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 But you know that loved one you dropped off at our hospital? He doesn't happen to be at your house right now.

444
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 He's not there. And they're like, "No, no, he wasn't." So the family came down there. It's the same thing.

445
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 The family comes down, they're looking for him. And 13 days later, October 18th, they find him in the ceiling.

446
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Not on the ceiling, not in the attic. He's not hanging out. He's not sitting in some haunted rocking chair.

447
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 He's like stuffed in the ceiling.

448
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 This is one of those stories that you're almost at a loss for words for. It's a real-life mystery.

449
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Both of these are very, very well-documented deaths. They're relatively recent as well.

450
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 It's not like I'm reading a newspaper article from the 1890s. Super bizarre. And a serial killer?

451
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Like, is it someone's weird f- Did they do it? Did two men, 16-hour drive apart? It's different sides of the country, really.

452
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Do they have to do with this? Were they- Was it ghosts? Were they possessed?

453
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Aliens who teleport or malfunction? Could only bring them up into the attic?

454
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Who knows? Super bizarre story. And it's one of those stories that will have no resolution. Absolutely, absolutely bizarre story coming out of South Africa.

455
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I guess the only thing we can wait for is for it to happen again.

456
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 You're sitting in South Africa, you're like, "Oh man, I just had surgery at this hospital."

457
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And now, you know, to relax, I'm gonna listen to my good old friend, Jason Garvin, who put on this podcast.

458
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And now you're super scared. You're looking up at the ceiling. Who? Cryptid?

459
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Is there a cryptid in the ceilings of South African hospitals? Who knows?

460
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 This really, there's no correlation to it in the lore. It's- The closest thing you can compare it to is missing 4-1-1, really.

461
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Like, it just makes no sense.

462
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 It's- The most likely answer is both of these guys against all odds crawled up into the attic.

463
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 It doesn't even make sense to- It wasn't the attic, it was like in between the floors. It was like the little roof.

464
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 It doesn't even make sense to say like a tube. They don't even know how these guys died.

465
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 They just ended up in the ceiling and rotted away twice. Once would have been a mystery.

466
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Twice is just- Twice is a conspiracy. Twice is a conspiracy.

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Famlica? I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

468
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 We are leaving me on- There's some guys in the ceiling right now. It's like there's still time. Save me, save me.

469
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 We're like, nah, you're good. You're good.

470
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Smell ya later. Famlica, go ahead and fire up that carboner copter. We're leaving me behind this begging man.

471
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 We are heading on out to Mount Rainier in Washington.

472
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 [Moutain Rainier]

473
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Mount Rainier, most famously known for- I mean, sure geology weirdos probably know it for way more stuff,

474
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 but to the rest of the world, to us cool kids,

475
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Mount Rainier is known as the very first sighting of the flying saucer.

476
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Now UFO sightings can go back centuries, millennia, but the flying saucer, the disk,

477
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 was really named when Kenneth Arnold, he was a private pilot flying by Mount Rainier back in 1947,

478
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 saw what he described as flying saucers. Basically dishes turned upside down.

479
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Dinner dishes turned upside down.

480
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 And the reason why we're here, for a little segment, we've only done this once, we're going to try it again.

481
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 It's called Jason's Thinkins.

482
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Jason's- you're like, Jason, is this really how you're ending your episode?

483
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 It is. It is because I have some interesting Jason Thinkins this episode.

484
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I suppose the last episode, those ones were super- I don't remember what the last ones were,

485
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 but anyways, these ones are dope. Jason's Thinkins, we'll start off with the one I mentioned in the intro.

486
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 The rocket ship is not the most aerodynamic vehicle.

487
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 It's not. A sphere would actually be, like if we're shooting stuff and we're trying to pierce the atmosphere,

488
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 a sphere would actually be more aerodynamic. The rocket ship, and even the spatial though, to a certain extent,

489
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 the rocket ship 100% is phallic. It is a phallic shape.

490
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 You could say like, I mean, what's more effective? A club, which is just like a big lump, a big lump, a big lump, or a sword.

491
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Now, swords, they look dope, but they're very phallic. They come to a point.

492
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 And they're constantly getting dull. They're constantly breaking. It's a parry weapon at best.

493
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Come on, come on, come on, knife nuts out there. It's not the greatest weapon.

494
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I prefer baseball bats to knives, but I can't walk down the street with a baseball bat. That's illegal.

495
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Unless you have a ball and a glove on you, they'd get very suspicious if you're walking around with a baseball bat all day long.

496
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 You're wearing a business suit, but I carry a knife on me everywhere I go, because I can. I can't carry a baseball bat,

497
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 but I prefer the bat. I prefer the club. There's just less that can go wrong. It's a defensive and an offensive weapon.

498
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 You can use it for all sorts of things, knocking down doors, saving babies.

499
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 You know, if the baby's learned how to grab, and I'm not a good swimmer, I can just hold it in the water until the baby, you know, grabs onto the edge of it,

500
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 pull the baby out. You can't do that with a knife. You might be able to, but I don't recommend it. I know where I'm going to.

501
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 So what I'm saying is that, and the rocket ship, going back to that, before this becomes another Jason,

502
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 thinking about what type of ways to rescue babies out of water. I was saying in the other name, the rocket ship is phallic,

503
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 and we're shooting male genitalia into space, like the representation of that.

504
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 We're shooting it from this country to that country. Take that, and really it's just like this phallic thing, because there's other ways you can do it.

505
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Design the ship. What if flying saucers are what their genitals look like?

506
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Now hear me out. Hear me out. As you've already shut off the podcast, you're like, "Eh, maybe tomorrow's episode will be more coherent."

507
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 The first two stories are good, but Jason's obviously lost the plot.

508
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 What if that would explain why there's different spaceships? Like you have the black triangle, so there's an alien race, maybe that's like a butthole?

509
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And then what are the other ones? There's like the big giant cigar-shaped ship. That's very phallic, right?

510
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 That's flying around up there. And then what's the other most popular one? A lot of cylinders.

511
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Which, see, a flying saucer is not very aerodynamic. Like sure, you can throw a Frisbee and stuff like that, but Frisbees can't really go up super fast.

512
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 A flying saucer going up super fast with all that wind resistance, it's not aerodynamic. It's the opposite of aerodynamic.

513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 So are they designing them that way because it reminds them of their genitals? It's their way to present power upon the world.

514
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 And it would explain why you have all these other different spaceships out there. Tic-Tac. Right, you don't want to be a member of that alien species.

515
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 That's why aliens aren't disclosing their existence. Because aliens are coming down like, "We're the ones who have the cigar-shaped mothership."

516
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And everyone's like, "Yay!" And then this alien race comes out, they're like, "Hey, remember back in 2017 or whatever that was, 2013, that Nimitz battle group? That was us."

517
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 We're the Tic-Tac UFO and everyone's like, "Uh, okay, okay." That's my question. Are the different alien ships based on their genitalia?

518
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I guess from now on, whenever I talk about the alien ships and everything, I'm like, and then a long tube landed and they all, you're going to be like, "Oh, that's a good, that's a fun Saturday night for the alien mamas."

519
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Here's some more Jason thinking. So I just had this one today and this is what made me want to do this segment.

520
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 I was talking to a friend of mine and she was telling me about an argument she had recently with her daughter.

521
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And she said, "My daughter swore up and down she told me she was going to go to the play." Whatever it was, I was barely paying attention, right?

522
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 My daughter told me she was going to go to the play, but that conflicted with other plans that I had made. I had already made these plans.

523
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And she never told me she was going to the play and I told her, "You never told me that." And she said, "I did tell you that and we got in a big fight about it over whether or not she actually said that."

524
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 And this is what happens when you hang out with me, right? She's telling me about some fight she was having with someone very close to her.

525
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And I literally, after she got done talking, I'm not going to interrupt her, I turned to her and I said, "What if in an alternate reality she did?"

526
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 I have no idea why any friends left in real life. What if in an alternate reality she did tell you?

527
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 What if we switch back and forth so rapidly between alternate realities? The fact that we can comprehend anything is shocking.

528
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Because we always think of these big events, the CERN thing is turned on and that's what caused the Berenstein bear effect or the Mandela effect, whatever you want to call it.

529
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Or there was a massive nuclear war killed off a bunch of people and we shifted over to this other reality. Or I almost died.

530
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 I'm driving on the road, I swear I'm about to get hit by this car and all of a sudden I'm pulled over to the side of the road and everything's fine.

531
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 We've covered stories like that before, I'll put my favorite one in the show notes. But what if it happens all the time? All the time!

532
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And would explain why we constantly have these really minor disagreements. There was an alternate reality where she goes, "Hey mom, I'm going to the play tonight."

533
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 "Oh okay, then I won't make those dinner reservations." Have fun, have fun at the play.

534
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 But then she ended up in this reality where she swears that she told her mom, it's an interesting thought, right? It could really drive you crazy.

535
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 I'm telling you that after I told you and you're already like, "Oh, second guessing everything now I'm telling you." This might be a cursed thought, but what if every time someone goes, "You never told me that and you know you did."

536
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 It's not because they were inattentive, it's not because they're ignoring you, it's not because Bill Gates melted all their organs and they no longer have a functioning brain.

537
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 It's because they're from their reality where you never said that. So there you go. There you go. I wanted to share those Jason-Thinkins with you.

538
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Kind of something, a different way to end an episode. You're already like, "Oh man, dude, I totally put you just through that last one out." This is an afterthought.

539
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 It is super trippy if you think about it. Because how often does that happen where someone swears, and we always think, "Oh, they're just lying or they're not paying attention. You should have paid attention on me."

540
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 I was going to do this, but it starts this big fight, but what if you're both right? Whenever someone says that, you think, "Wow, maybe you really did say that in an alternate dimension, and maybe in our dimension you didn't, so I didn't know that."

541
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 So we're both right. Your friends are like, "Dude, we are not hanging out. You need to stop listening to that crazy podcast, man, because he's really messing with your head."

542
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 I mean, trust me, I don't think that podcast is a net positive on the world, but it is. Because in an alternate reality, every single person on the planet listens to this podcast, and the world is perfect.
