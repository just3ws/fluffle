1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
 A bridge that makes unusual noises.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,180
 A movie that has been banned from being shown in North America.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:21,460
 And then we travel to Brussels to meet a man who had a close encounter with an alien surveyor.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,700
 But things get really weird when the alien walks away today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:35,380
 [Demonic music]

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,420
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,940
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,020
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,140
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,100
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,500
 So let's hop on board the Jason Jalopy.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,180
 [Demonic music]

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,500
 That's a great acre song.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,940
 Is there an old television show involving a junkie car?

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,260
 Beverly Hillbilly is the one I was looking for.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,740
 How does that song go?

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,020
 [Demonic music]

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,180
 That is my non-copyrighted version of the Beverly Hillbilly song.

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,100
 [Demonic music]

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,420
 So we're all hopping on board.

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,820
 I got my banjo.

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,660
 I'm sitting in the back.

23
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,860
 You guys get to drive the Jason Jalopy today.

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,700
 [Demonic music]

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,660
 Hurry up Jason.

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,820
 Just do the stupid episode.

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,620
 Hold on, I gotta do my solo.

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,340
 Jason, the whole thing's been a solo.

29
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,340
 I'm fine.

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,900
 I'll put my banjo away.

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,060
 You go, where are we going?

32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,060
 And I say, we are going to Heartbreak Bridge.

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,860
 You're like, Jason, it's still not enough info.

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,220
 Just use the GPS.

35
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,780
 [Demonic music]

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,180
 And as you try to figure out how to use my old GPS,

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,060
 you're finally able to find out that we're headed

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,620
 to the town of Portal, Nebraska.

39
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,060
 The car is going down the road.

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,420
 [Demonic music]

41
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,660
 Sun setting.

42
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,740
 That's it for the episode.

43
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,580
 See you guys later.

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,420
 Now, so anyways, we end up in Portal, Nebraska.

45
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,100
 [Demonic music]

46
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,260
 We're going around the corner of the music sites up again.

47
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,100
 Your ears are bleeding at this point.

48
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,180
 You're like, huh?

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,060
 I tell you, my doctor says I have to play this

50
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,900
 if I stop playing.

51
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,380
 My heart stops.

52
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,220
 And you don't believe me entirely,

53
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,780
 but at the same time, you're a little unsure.

54
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,260
 So, boom, boom, boom, boom.

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,140
 But eventually I do, I'm going to put the banjo on my back.

56
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,100
 We're going to walk around Portal, Nebraska.

57
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,380
 Now, Portal is kind of an odd ghost town.

58
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,260
 From what I can gather, it is a town

59
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,460
 that is now surrounded by the suburbs.

60
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,660
 So it was basically like there was a railroad track there,

61
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,180
 a post office, a little town built around the post office,

62
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,380
 and then everything kind of shut down.

63
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,620
 But the buildings are still there,

64
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,300
 but then there's just suburbs around it.

65
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,180
 So it's like an old schoolhouse, an old post office,

66
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,100
 a train stop, maybe a couple other buildings,

67
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,020
 and then there's a great grass yard,

68
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,900
 and then there's Lil Billy's house,

69
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,020
 where he just hangs out, throws baseballs at people.

70
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,900
 So it's not like a traditional ghost town

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,300
 in the middle of nowhere type of thing.

72
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,060
 A town has popped up around this place.

73
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,940
 And for all I know, the buildings aren't there anymore.

74
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,420
 It was kind of hard to tell.

75
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,620
 This place is in Wikipedia.

76
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,020
 It's a legit place.

77
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,900
 But this is pretty much the entire sentence

78
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,780
 in the Wikipedia page.

79
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,140
 "Portal was established on the railroad.

80
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,180
 "A post office opened at portal in 1887

81
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,660
 "and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1898."

82
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,020
 That's pretty much it.

83
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,260
 So why are you wasting my time with this, Jason?

84
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,740
 Why did you drag us all the way out to portal?

85
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,780
 If that's all there is.

86
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,700
 Wikipedia, if that's all there is,

87
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,900
 is there really a story here?

88
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,620
 And I go, "Yes, yes, I wanna waste your time."

89
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,460
 Would I?

90
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,620
 And then you go, "Jason, did you listen

91
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,180
 "to last Friday's episode?"

92
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,180
 And I was like, "Okay, so let's talk about portal Nebraska."

93
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,540
 So in the early 1900s, there was the school there,

94
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,900
 little school there, and at the school was a teacher.

95
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,700
 Can you have a school without a teacher?

96
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,020
 That is a question you should ask a philosopher.

97
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,220
 Or 20 years from now when all teachers

98
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,660
 have been replaced with robots.

99
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,140
 But can a school exist without a teacher?

100
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,980
 As of now, no.

101
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,320
 And especially not back then.

102
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,720
 So you had a teacher and she was coming to class

103
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,160
 and she's like, "Students, today we're going to learn

104
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,360
 "about history.

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,120
 "It's happening right now 'cause it's the 1900s."

106
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,840
 So open your books and the kids are like doing schoolwork

107
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,080
 and then she'd go home and she'd eat soup, home alone,

108
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,960
 doing stuff, burglars trying to break in her house.

109
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,000
 She's like, "Ah, electrocuting them."

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,220
 The next day she comes to school,

111
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,220
 she's like, "We're gonna learn more about math today.

112
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,640
 "It's the new fangled science, math, it just invented."

113
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,920
 So these little 1900 kids, there's not 1900 kids

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,880
 in the 1900s kids, they're reading the books,

115
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,880
 learning about math first time ever.

116
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,920
 She goes home, it's home alone too.

117
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,720
 Now different burglars are trying to break in her house

118
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120
 or maybe the same ones, I don't know,

119
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,960
 I never saw any of those movies.

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,400
 But the stress gets to her.

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,440
 Whether it was the constant break-ins at her home

122
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,160
 or maybe it was the fact that she had to wear

123
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,000
 really, really chafy, old-timey clothing

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,760
 'cause that stuff doesn't look very comfortable.

125
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,800
 It looks thick and woolen and just kind of gross.

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,680
 It'd be like wearing a wool sweater

127
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,420
 but all over your body.

128
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,440
 She eventually snaps, so she's in class one day

129
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,440
 and she's like, "Kids, you wanna learn a real lesson?

130
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,440
 "You wanna learn how I got these scars?"

131
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,920
 Apparently she became a joker.

132
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,420
 She has a mental breakdown.

133
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,600
 She barricades the door, she grabs a hatchet,

134
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,440
 which she apparently has in her classroom.

135
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,660
 You know, in case a bear comes lumbering through,

136
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,480
 there's three little bears standing on top of each other

137
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,400
 wearing a trench coat and a human face.

138
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,120
 Wait, no, they wouldn't wanna be human sized.

139
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,400
 They were supposed to be kids.

140
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,160
 The little bear cubs would be sneaking in

141
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
 with little human masks.

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,800
 She has the hatchet to chase them up.

143
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,840
 This teacher has a hatchet in her classroom.

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
 She barricades the door, shut.

145
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,800
 She jumps up on her desk, starts swinging the hatchet

146
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,840
 over her head, that's not part of the myth,

147
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,160
 but we're just gonna add it in.

148
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,240
 And she proceeds to cut off all the kids' heads.

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:35,160
 (imitates

150
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:53,560
 the head)

151
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,160
 So what do you do when you feel bad after a mass murder?

152
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,080
 You cut their hearts out and walk to the bridge

153
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,200
 and throw their hearts one by one into the water.

154
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,920
 That is the story, that's the origin story

155
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,440
 of what's known as Heartbeat Bridge.

156
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
 Heartbeat Bridge.

157
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,920
 And the legend today, they say,

158
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,280
 if you go to Portal Nebraska,

159
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,880
 if you go to this little tiny parcel of land,

160
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,480
 you can walk across Heartbeat Bridge

161
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,280
 and you can hear the sounds of heartbeats.

162
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,840
 Now that could be a bullfrog.

163
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,480
 Could be a bullfrog living underneath the bridge,

164
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,600
 but supposedly it's the sound of the hearts.

165
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,960
 And sometimes the ghost teacher will show up

166
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,160
 on the bridge as well, mourning the loss of all of her students.

167
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,960
 This story obviously has some huge holes,

168
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,280
 and I'm not talking about the holes in the children's chest.

169
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,120
 And the reason why I was able to make all those jokes

170
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,400
 about kids getting their heads chopped off,

171
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,240
 because the story's not true.

172
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,280
 There's no historical reference of a mass murder

173
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,600
 taking place at a school.

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,560
 But Jason, it happened in the 1900s

175
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,480
 and they weren't writing stuff down.

176
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,040
 Trust me, they didn't have the best record keeping,

177
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,640
 but they would write down,

178
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,280
 "School Marm Kills 12, Throws Hearts in River."

179
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,280
 Like, they had very good records dating all the way back

180
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,920
 to like the 1500s, 1600s.

181
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,040
 So early 1900s definitely would have been in the newspaper.

182
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
 So it didn't happen at all.

183
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,680
 So I feel totally fine making all those jokes.

184
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,640
 There's a couple other questions about it.

185
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,920
 One, nobody knows where this bridge is at now.

186
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,840
 Like, it's weird.

187
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,080
 It's an urban legend in the area,

188
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
 but when people go,

189
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,200
 there's disagreement over which bridge it is.

190
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,480
 Which to me, it should be pretty obvious.

191
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,180
 It's the bridge adjacent to the schoolhouse

192
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,720
 where the kids got murdered,

193
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,840
 and the bridge where you hear human hearts

194
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,120
 beating underneath it.

195
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,280
 It's not an easy thing to confuse.

196
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,440
 You're at another bridge across town.

197
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,280
 You're like, "That's weird.

198
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,560
 I don't hear the tortured souls of a bunch of kids,

199
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,120
 but this might be it."

200
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,440
 Like, it's either the bridge that has the phenomenon

201
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,760
 that's in the area, or it doesn't exist.

202
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,820
 So there's disagreement over which bridge is heartbeat bridge,

203
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,640
 but the bridge supposedly has that horrible sound

204
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
 and a ghost.

205
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,080
 Most important question is, women, okay.

206
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,920
 Let me say this.

207
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,840
 Like, looking at like movies and stuff like that,

208
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,480
 women in the 1900s,

209
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,760
 despite their clothes looking very uncomfortable,

210
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,400
 tended to be, at least in the movies, pretty attractive.

211
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,880
 Would you bang a school marmed ghost?

212
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,040
 Because, hold on, before you shut off the podcast,

213
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,600
 let me make my argument.

214
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
 On the one hand, you would say no,

215
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,960
 because she's probably going to be like super snooty,

216
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
 and she can hit you with a ruler,

217
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,560
 and I'm not into that type of stuff.

218
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,120
 Well, I am into snooty girls.

219
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,760
 I'm into real snatching the other thing.

220
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,600
 That's it.

221
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
 We're putting that.

222
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,320
 She'll hit you with a ruler,

223
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,480
 and she's a ghost.

224
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,320
 Those are the two downsides to her being,

225
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,960
 banging her, right?

226
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,080
 But the plus side is she's super snooty,

227
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,120
 and I love like real bitchy chicks.

228
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,000
 Girls who are like snooty or like bitchy and stuff like that.

229
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,840
 I love that.

230
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,920
 So you get that,

231
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,080
 'cause she's a school marmer in the 1900s,

232
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,160
 and she's hot,

233
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,200
 'cause she's the school marmer from the 1900s.

234
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,480
 Would you try seducing her?

235
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,280
 Now, to be fair, you might have a hard time

236
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,040
 picking up a ghost at the site of her mass murder,

237
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,920
 'cause if that's the only place she manifests,

238
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,520
 it's not like you could then see her at the library,

239
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
 or see her at a bar,

240
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,480
 and be like, "Hey, I read about you in the paper.

241
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,680
 "A horrible thing that happened,

242
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,720
 "but I've lost my temper too.

243
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,680
 "Never murdered anybody, but I've been there.

244
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,520
 "Can I buy you a drink?"

245
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,440
 And she'd be like, "Yes, yes, thank you."

246
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,720
 And you can get her mind off of it.

247
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
 You're sitting at the bar,

248
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,480
 all of a sudden some funny television show comes on,

249
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,800
 you're sitting watching it together,

250
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,520
 close captioning 'cause everyone's talking,

251
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,920
 you're drinking, you're having a good time,

252
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,760
 and then you invite her back to your place.

253
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,720
 That is what I do, generally,

254
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,520
 but because she's a ghost,

255
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,080
 she's trapped at the site.

256
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,240
 Okay, so let's rephrase this here.

257
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,560
 There's a hot girl, she's sitting on a bridge,

258
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,600
 where she, 100 years ago, murdered a bunch of kids

259
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,640
 through their hearts, through their hearts underwater.

260
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,600
 And I show up, I'm like, "Hey, what's up?"

261
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,440
 "Hey, how's it going?"

262
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,320
 "Yeah, my name's Jason, it's nice to meet you."

263
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,800
 And she's like, "Ah, yeah,

264
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,320
 "and she probably gets hit on all the time."

265
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,920
 And I know, but I gotta keep going for this, right?

266
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,280
 Like, this is what I want.

267
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,640
 You don't let up first time, the girl kind of shrugs,

268
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,240
 'cause I get that a lot.

269
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,880
 Kind of shrugs, kind of the shoulder look,

270
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,840
 but I just go, "She's just being snooty."

271
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,600
 So now this has become how Jason picks up women of a certain.

272
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,160
 The, you don't give up the first time,

273
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,400
 unless they, I've had girls say I'm not interested,

274
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,720
 and to me, that's the best,

275
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
 'cause then I don't have to waste my time.

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,480
 They'll just be like, "No, I'm not interested."

277
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,520
 And I'm like, "Okay, I'm out."

278
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,480
 But, and I appreciate that.

279
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,080
 But, I'm like, you know, and I don't walk away first.

280
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,560
 I'm like, "Well, you know,

281
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,960
 "beautiful night out, isn't it?"

282
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,920
 And she's kind of like, "Yeah, it is really nice."

283
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,240
 And then I usually will find some of this,

284
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,840
 another tip I do, I will find somebody else in the vicinity

285
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,760
 to make fun of, that I think that person wouldn't like.

286
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,280
 So let's see me in this,

287
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,320
 definitely has become what Jason picks up women of a certain.

288
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
 I meet a girl at a bar,

289
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,000
 and let's say there's a bad karaoke singer

290
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,560
 or something like that, I'll be like, "Oh my God."

291
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,860
 Like, I guess I'll make a joke.

292
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,640
 I'm not gonna repeat one of the jokes I'll make

293
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,040
 on this episode, 'cause they're usually really bad,

294
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
 but girls tend to find them funny.

295
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,240
 And so, as we're sitting on this heartbeat bridge,

296
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,720
 as we're sitting on heartbeat bridge,

297
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,520
 I see a guy jogging in the distance.

298
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,000
 And I'm like, "Oh, look at that guy.

299
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,240
 "Make a funny joke about what he's wearing

300
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,080
 "or something like that."

301
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
 And then she starts laughing,

302
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,640
 and then I'm hitting on her.

303
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,400
 The whole time we're hearing,

304
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,840
 "Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."

305
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,440
 It's the heartbeats.

306
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,680
 I'm trying to mack on this girl over the heartbeats

307
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,400
 of her dead murder victims.

308
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,880
 But I would still probably try it.

309
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,520
 I probably would still try it,

310
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,280
 because I'm just that kind of guy.

311
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,040
 But I don't remember what my hypothetical question was.

312
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,400
 I don't remember if it's if you should

313
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,240
 or should you hit on a ghost?

314
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
 Or should I hit on a ghost?

315
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,280
 Or I don't remember what the hypothetical was.

316
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,480
 The point is, the story is 100% not true.

317
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,960
 It's an interesting, creepy story

318
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,240
 that I'm sure was passed around the neighborhood

319
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,400
 for a long time,

320
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,040
 because there was a creepy schoolhouse in the area

321
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,120
 that was abandoned.

322
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,520
 And some big brother made this story up,

323
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,840
 and it spread through the neighborhood

324
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,960
 to the point that now it's an internet legend.

325
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,080
 But no, no one was murdered here.

326
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,000
 And the idea of noises being heard

327
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,340
 underneath bridges is very, very common.

328
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,040
 There's been stories of the Supicide Dog Bridge

329
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,280
 and Dublin or Britain or something like that.

330
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,240
 They see a misty figure kind of walking along the bridge.

331
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,340
 It's not uncommon to see mist around bridges.

332
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,120
 It's not uncommon as water is moving underneath stuff

333
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,920
 to make odd noises.

334
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,840
 So there probably is a bridge in the area

335
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,280
 or a bridge somewhere in the world

336
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,640
 that sounds like there's heartbeats

337
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,200
 because of the way the water's shading the rocks.

338
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,320
 But this story definitely didn't happen.

339
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,640
 It's an interesting urban legend.

340
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,960
 And I totally would try to pick this chick up.

341
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,140
 But, but I don't know if I'd bring her home

342
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,220
 because I already have a haunted doll

343
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,980
 and an old man in the closet.

344
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,940
 I don't know, I'd have to say, how about your place?

345
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,860
 And she's like, yeah, sure.

346
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,660
 And then we go into a hellish void.

347
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,540
 I'm like, ah!

348
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,580
 Still, it's, I mean, you know,

349
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,020
 bad ghost sex is better than no ghost sex.

350
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,780
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story

351
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,300
 that to be honest, I'm gonna have to cut a bunch out of

352
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,120
 because I went off in that rant.

353
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,260
 This is a story of a movie

354
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,360
 that's actually lost media in a sense.

355
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,960
 Lost media is the idea of,

356
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
 it's kind of exactly what it sounds like.

357
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,440
 So you have stuff that was filmed

358
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,680
 and then is disappeared or recorded and it's disappeared.

359
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,680
 And now some of the lost media is like Grizzly Man.

360
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,760
 It's a guy who really loved Grizzly Bears,

361
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
 him and his girlfriend in a tent.

362
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,320
 And there's an audio recording of them being eaten alive

363
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,760
 or at least disemboweled by a bear.

364
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,600
 The camera was on, but the lens cap was on as well.

365
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,440
 So you hear this audio.

366
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,580
 That's considered a lost media.

367
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,500
 There's maybe been 10 people who've listened to it.

368
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,780
 Christine Chubbock's suicide video,

369
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,380
 she was a newscaster who said,

370
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,020
 "I'm gonna try to commit."

371
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,020
 Now for the latest in "Blood and Gore,"

372
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,940
 here's a news first in attempted suicide.

373
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,420
 She shoots herself on live television in the 1970s.

374
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,340
 So there was like one VCR in the nation that recorded it.

375
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,820
 These things are considered lost media

376
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,220
 'cause for the most part it's all gone.

377
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,900
 This is an interesting and more lighthearted version of that.

378
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,980
 I found some more lighthearted lost media

379
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,820
 that I'm gonna profile

380
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,420
 'cause I find the idea of stuff disappearing fascinating.

381
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,340
 Like there's a lot of old "Doctor Who" episodes

382
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,480
 that were lost at the time

383
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,620
 because people when they were being made,

384
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,120
 they're like, "Oh, this is just a stupid show for kids."

385
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
 Or this is just a bunch of nerds.

386
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,140
 We'll just shoot the show.

387
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,980
 No one will ever wanna watch it again.

388
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,340
 And so they were like re-recording over tapes.

389
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,580
 So it wasn't just "Doctor Who,"

390
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,220
 but a lot of shows did that.

391
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,420
 But what happened with "Doctor Who" was some fan

392
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,380
 was recording it way back in the day

393
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,260
 with this very first VCR.

394
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,740
 So they were able to reconstruct a lot of old episodes

395
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,460
 and they found episodes in the BBC archives

396
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,420
 and stuff like that.

397
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,740
 So anyways, this one though is basically lost media

398
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,900
 only in North America.

399
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,460
 You can watch it on YouTube,

400
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,180
 but you can't show it to anybody else.

401
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,540
 You cannot, it cannot be commercially shown

402
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,380
 in the United States or Canada

403
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,100
 because of a lawsuit with two of their actors.

404
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,820
 This movie is called "Don's Plum."

405
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,460
 And I watched it in preparation for this story.

406
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,280
 I don't like dramas.

407
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,340
 The first 10 minutes is really irritating

408
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,540
 'cause I hate jazz music.

409
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,500
 I can't stand it.

410
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,100
 I cannot stand jazz music.

411
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,180
 And people go, "Dude, you're a big hip-hop fan.

412
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,400
 You love rap."

413
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,180
 Jazz is the beginning of rap.

414
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,660
 Yeah, I love human women and humans evolved

415
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,900
 from protozoas coming out of the ocean.

416
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,100
 I don't love protozoas.

417
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,500
 Like, I get it that jazz may have influenced

418
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,020
 the music I listen to, but jazz sucks.

419
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,300
 It's the worst music out there.

420
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,220
 I hate it.

421
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,100
 I'd rather listen to "Honky Tonk Country" than jazz.

422
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,820
 And I despise "Honky Tonk Country."

423
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,340
 I don't like jazz.

424
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,180
 So when the movie started off at a jazz club,

425
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,140
 it already was two beats behind.

426
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,980
 But they leave the jazz club

427
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,300
 into some of the worst jazz music too.

428
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,460
 (singing)

429
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,300
 I'm coming.

430
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,420
 He's not coming.

431
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,980
 But it's like, (singing)

432
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,340
 This is a musical episode, apparently.

433
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,300
 Jazz is coming and it's making you feel good, girls.

434
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,020
 You know how I make you feel.

435
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,380
 Make you feel like you're the only one in the world, girls.

436
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,740
 Oh my God, dude.

437
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,420
 I was like, I'm only watching this movie

438
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,340
 so I can do a segment on it.

439
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,420
 They leave the jazz club.

440
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
 The whole movie is basically these characters

441
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,500
 sitting at a Denny's-esque restaurant called Don's Plum.

442
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,100
 Maybe it's supposed to be a fancier restaurant

443
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,260
 but it reminded me of a Denny's with the kind of the seating.

444
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,540
 There's four guys and they each have to bring a girl.

445
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,460
 Each weekend they bring a different girl to this place.

446
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,020
 They sit around, they talk.

447
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,860
 It is one of the most authentic movies like that

448
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,260
 I've seen in a long time.

449
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,500
 'Cause I used to do that.

450
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,900
 I used to go, "Hang out with my friends."

451
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,260
 We'd all show up, we'd go to a Denny's,

452
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,340
 we'd sit around and talk.

453
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,300
 Sometimes we'd talk about normal stuff.

454
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,900
 Sometimes a fight would break out.

455
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,380
 Sometimes someone would bring a girl.

456
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,020
 We didn't bring a different girl each weekend

457
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,140
 but sometimes somebody would bring a girl

458
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,780
 that nobody knew and she started Mouthing Off

459
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,500
 and the confrontation starts.

460
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,380
 Or sometimes one of the dudes would start Mouthing Off.

461
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,740
 Confrontation starts.

462
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,460
 So it's very, very realistic movie.

463
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,540
 A very, very well done movie.

464
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,300
 The problem is, is it strength.

465
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,500
 Is you have an actor.

466
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,700
 All four actors were fairly well known at the time

467
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,660
 and a lot of them have gone on to do certain things.

468
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,900
 But one of the actors, I don't remember,

469
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,260
 we had the actor who was in "Antiraj."

470
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,700
 You're like, "Jesus, that doesn't help me."

471
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,540
 There's one jacket, it was an "Antiraj."

472
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,660
 There's a bunch of people, I don't remember.

473
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,980
 Anyways, there was a guy from "Antiraj."

474
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,780
 But then Toby McGuire and Leonard, Leonard,

475
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,980
 Toby McGuire and Leonardo DiCaprio.

476
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,820
 Leonard DiCaprio is these more commonly known as,

477
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,900
 are in this movie as well.

478
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,260
 This was before "Titanic."

479
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,100
 This was before "The Cider House Rules."

480
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,260
 It's basically total, it's almost all improv.

481
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,340
 It's very, very, it's almost all ad-libbed

482
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,660
 and it's really off the cuff.

483
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,020
 So they make this movie, which apparently was a rid,

484
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,420
 there's a lot of disagreements on what was going on.

485
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,780
 But anyways, this movie is made and Toby McGuire

486
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,700
 and/or his agent is like, "Shut it down.

487
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,100
 "You can't let this movie get released.

488
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
 "You look like a jerk."

489
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,300
 And he does look pretty bad,

490
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,980
 but Leonard DiCaprio looks like a psychopath in this movie.

491
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,220
 And again, very, very real.

492
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,380
 I don't think he's a psychopath,

493
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,380
 but he comes off as a very, very irritating jerk in it

494
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,580
 and he does a great job doing it.

495
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,060
 And that may have been him,

496
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,900
 that may be him now,

497
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,220
 that may have been him when he was younger.

498
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,180
 It could have been acting,

499
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,140
 it could have been a little bit of everything put together,

500
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,260
 but apparently he thought it was great.

501
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,300
 Toby McGuire's people thought it was garbage

502
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,100
 and they didn't want to get released before, you know,

503
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,180
 Pleasantville and all these movies he was going to do.

504
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,300
 'Cause it's very raw.

505
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,700
 It's like a drama version of "Clurks."

506
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,500
 That type of language and stuff like that.

507
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,700
 So Leonard DiCaprio twice threatens to throw a bottle

508
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,580
 at a woman's head and that girl was Tara from "Buffy."

509
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,260
 So again, you had a lot of young people

510
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,020
 before their courage took off.

511
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,020
 So what happened was basically eventually,

512
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,420
 this is all alleged,

513
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,940
 but the producer of the film believes

514
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,480
 that Toby McGuire turned Leonard DiCaprio

515
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,260
 against the movie as well.

516
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,860
 And through various lawsuits,

517
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,340
 the way it is set up right now is that

518
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,660
 the movie cannot be shown commercially

519
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,620
 in the United States or Canada.

520
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,420
 Eventually the producer of the movie went on

521
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,580
 to try to do another,

522
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,460
 was basically blackballed from Hollywood,

523
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,780
 goes on to do another project in Hollywood,

524
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,180
 is told as they're like signing the paperwork,

525
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,460
 someone goes, "Oh wait, you're the guy

526
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,020
 who was behind Don's Plum."

527
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,700
 The guy's name was Dale Wheatley.

528
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,420
 The producer's name was Dale Wheatley.

529
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,880
 So you get ready to sign another project,

530
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,580
 someone goes, "Well, you're the guy

531
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,820
 who did Don's Plum, right?"

532
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,740
 And Dale's like, "Yeah."

533
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,420
 And they're like, "We can't do this deal with you."

534
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,300
 He's like, "What are you talking about?"

535
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,580
 And the producer who he said was a multi-billion dollar

536
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,380
 producer making these huge movies,

537
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,300
 the producer goes, "I can't mess with you

538
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,220
 because Leonardo DiCaprio will shut me down."

539
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,140
 And Dale goes, "You're more powerful

540
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,660
 than Leonardo DiCaprio."

541
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,900
 And the multi-billion dollar producer's quote was,

542
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,180
 "Nobody is more powerful than Leo."

543
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,320
 Now, so basically at this point,

544
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,060
 the movie is made, you can watch it on YouTube,

545
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,920
 but you're not supposed to.

546
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,900
 And you can see it overseas,

547
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,380
 but I mean the movie at this point

548
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,460
 is like 20 years old as well,

549
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,860
 but you got a movie starring two

550
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,980
 of the biggest actors, soon to be actors at that time.

551
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,620
 Leonardo DiCaprio is still a powerhouse,

552
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,820
 Tomy McGuire is still an A-list star.

553
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,340
 The funniest footnote to the story is, yes, it's lost media.

554
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,500
 Until the internet popped up,

555
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,100
 it was really hard to find a copy of this.

556
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,340
 Lars Vontriere, the director who does not care

557
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,860
 about anything, held a film festival

558
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,500
 just to show the movie.

559
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,980
 He didn't show it in America.

560
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,860
 He's not gonna get fined or arrested,

561
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,100
 but he did have a film festival

562
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,420
 and he showed the movie over there.

563
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,540
 And he basically is the,

564
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,580
 he's the Kanye West of filmmaking.

565
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,540
 And Kanye West is the penultimate rock star right now.

566
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,740
 And that's Lars Vontriere.

567
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,900
 He just does whatever he wants.

568
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,740
 He doesn't care.

569
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,500
 I love both of those guys.

570
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,180
 But anyway, check out Don's Plum.

571
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,620
 It's a fascinating film.

572
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,660
 It'll probably make you either really, really mad

573
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
 that people like these exist

574
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:50,060
 or it'll remind you of your glory days or both.

575
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,160
 Yeah, check out Don's Plum.

576
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,620
 It is an example of lost media or semi-lost media,

577
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,860
 media that was pushed to be lost,

578
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,700
 but the producer wouldn't let it go.

579
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,080
 And the producer is actually the one

580
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,800
 who was pushing to have it online for free,

581
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,320
 just so somebody could see the movie he made

582
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,160
 with a bunch of his friends back in the days

583
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,120
 before lawsuit after lawsuit started.

584
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,860
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story here.

585
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,580
 Do I have enough time?

586
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,420
 Do I have enough time?

587
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,360
 I talked so long about being in ghosts.

588
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,240
 Let's see here.

589
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,520
 I'm gonna pull an audible

590
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,920
 'cause I wanna do that alien story tomorrow.

591
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,480
 Let's go ahead.

592
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,080
 We're leaving behind the restaurant known as Don.

593
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,640
 What restaurants named Don's Plum, anyways?

594
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,440
 It's kind of a stupid title for a movie,

595
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,880
 stupid title for a restaurant, but it is a well-made movie.

596
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,240
 We say goodbye to Don's Plum.

597
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,120
 We say goodbye to Leonard de Caprio.

598
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
 See you later, Leonard.

599
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,440
 He's like, "Hey, we're gonna hop in the rabbit rowboat

600
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,120
 "and we're going out to sea.

601
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,600
 "We're not going to Brussels.

602
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,440
 "We're going out to the Atlantic Ocean."

603
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
 You're like, "That's really specific, Jason.

604
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,760
 "Just keep rowing."

605
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,420
 (humming)

606
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,960
 A wave knocks my banjo out into ocean.

607
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,600
 I'm like, "No, banjo."

608
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,440
 I turn to you.

609
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,840
 I picture you as a banjo now and I'm like,

610
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,320
 "Hmm, maybe if I pulled out his veins and his arteries

611
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,440
 "and tied them around his ankles,

612
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,200
 "I could get the right sort of sound."

613
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,960
 You're like, "Jason, you just said that out loud."

614
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,040
 I'm like, "Sorry, sorry."

615
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,560
 So as I'm still trying to figure out

616
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,000
 how to turn you into a human banjo,

617
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,360
 we're going back to the year 1917.

618
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,000
 The date is September 15th.

619
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,800
 And we're gonna sail up and we see a boat on the horizon.

620
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 It's called the Zabrina.

621
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,600
 And there's a dude named Captain Martin.

622
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,080
 His first name is not Captain, but that's weird.

623
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,160
 I wonder what his first name was,

624
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,240
 'cause he's Captain and his last name is a first name.

625
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
 I remember once I watched this show,

626
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,880
 there was like, "Gidget," it was "Gidget Television" series.

627
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,480
 And I learned a valuable lesson on "Gidget" television series.

628
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,480
 There was a surfer guy who always dispensed advice

629
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,440
 and he said, "Never trust someone with two first names."

630
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,920
 And I've always remembered that.

631
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
 I can't necessarily say it's true.

632
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,480
 I don't know why you shouldn't trust someone

633
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,680
 with two first names, but whenever you meet someone

634
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,880
 whose name is like Stanley Martin,

635
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,960
 don't trust someone with two first names.

636
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,480
 Captain Martin, though.

637
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,440
 He's the captain of the Zabrina.

638
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,640
 It's a three-mast schooner.

639
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,280
 And it goes port to port in Europe.

640
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,440
 So basically this was a time where it was built to,

641
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,160
 like, put coal in, and not like a coal,

642
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,840
 not like a coal in like a butthole,

643
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,360
 but put coal, the burning stuff in.

644
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
 And you would just go from port to port.

645
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,800
 So basically it would move around Europe,

646
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,940
 basically like a bus, but on the water.

647
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,000
 And it was a flat bottom boat.

648
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,920
 It was basically like a giant barge,

649
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,040
 but it could also go farther out into the ocean.

650
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,360
 I'm assuming other barges can do that too.

651
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,080
 So anyways, it would basically go from port to port.

652
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,320
 Now it's 1917, so we're in World War I.

653
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,200
 Not a good time to be a boat.

654
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,720
 There's never a good time to be a boat,

655
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,400
 because then you're an inanimate.

656
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,160
 Is a boat an inanimate?

657
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,480
 You knew this was coming,

658
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,680
 for when I said that.

659
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,400
 Is a boat an inanimate object?

660
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,240
 Not a single thing moves on a boat.

661
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,140
 Row boats, sure, you have oars.

662
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,840
 But a sail boat is that an inanimate object?

663
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,600
 A car is animate 'cause the wheels turn, right?

664
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,360
 And a bicycle, same thing.

665
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,320
 Is a plane?

666
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,040
 And then, I wonder, well now I can't say the word,

667
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,880
 but is a plane an inanimate object?

668
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,280
 You're like, Jason, you just said you didn't have time.

669
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,440
 You spent so much time talking about being in ghost marms.

670
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,880
 You had to cut a story off.

671
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,760
 Now you're talking about whether or not,

672
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,440
 puzzle, puzzle for your brain.

673
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,680
 Brain teaser, is a boat an inanimate object.

674
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,640
 Anyways, not a good time to be a boat.

675
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,640
 In 1917, they're getting blown up.

676
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,880
 Captain Martin takes his Sabrina out

677
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 on September 15th, 1917.

678
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,680
 On September 17th, 1917,

679
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,480
 it washes up on a French shore.

680
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,740
 (sizzling)

681
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,240
 That's not a bunch of explosions.

682
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,160
 That's the water hitting the side of the boat

683
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,440
 that's sitting on the beach.

684
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:13,040
 The Sabrina was completely empty.

685
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,240
 There's nobody on the boat,

686
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,280
 which would make sense 'cause it was up on the beach,

687
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,200
 but then the question goes, well where are the people?

688
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,840
 Now, the Sabrina normally had a six-man crew,

689
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,280
 but for this mission, when it was hauling this coal,

690
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,480
 had 23 men, all missing.

691
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,020
 And people started to ask questions.

692
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,320
 They go, why would you need so many more people?

693
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,720
 The theory became that the Sabrina

694
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,880
 on this particular mission,

695
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,280
 most of the time it worked the world's largest slaughterhouse.

696
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,920
 Wasn't in there chopping up cows.

697
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,280
 It was moving meat all over Europe.

698
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,640
 And because it had that flat bottom,

699
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,520
 it could go down those narrow rivers.

700
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,320
 This time it was moving coal

701
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,520
 and it washes up on shore, everyone's disappeared.

702
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,240
 The belief was that it was a cue boat,

703
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,080
 which was a boat used to haul weapons.

704
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,600
 Look like a normal boat, act like a normal boat,

705
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
 drew no suspicion except for the fact

706
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,240
 that it had those sweet, sweet armaments inside its hold.

707
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,800
 But that doesn't explain, if it was a cue boat,

708
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,920
 it doesn't explain where everybody went.

709
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,080
 And after the war, war ends,

710
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,640
 good guys win, bad guys lose.

711
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,760
 Well, it depends on what you're listening to this episode,

712
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,360
 but after the war, people go, hey, you remember that boat?

713
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,320
 Like was there this boat, this Sabrina

714
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,960
 that was attacked on this particular day

715
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,880
 or in these two days?

716
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,400
 And the Germans go, no,

717
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,720
 we don't have any record of attacking that boat.

718
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,680
 We have no record of taking any prisoners war

719
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,760
 from that boat.

720
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,120
 And I've always find it weird

721
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,640
 that people even bother keeping records during war,

722
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,000
 but they do.

723
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,440
 And they go, we don't have any record of these troops

724
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,240
 or these prisoners or anything like that.

725
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,960
 This is the theory.

726
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,880
 And this is kind of a chilling, creepy story.

727
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,520
 So one, you just have possibly a ghost ship.

728
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,000
 Ship goes out, aliens suck them all away,

729
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,520
 or a ghost shows up and kills them off one by one,

730
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,280
 takes them to the hell dimension,

731
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,080
 or they go through some sort of remuner triangle

732
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,720
 and they travel a thousand years into the future

733
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,280
 or 50 years into the past.

734
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,080
 That's all well and good and very sci-fi

735
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,320
 and very apt for this show.

736
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,320
 I think the actual explanation is creepier, to be honest.

737
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,560
 This is the working theory.

738
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,320
 The Sabrina is going through the water

739
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,920
 and a German U-boat, a submarine shows up

740
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,240
 and fires a torpedo at it,

741
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,440
 passes right underneath the boat

742
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,480
 because it's a flat bottom boat.

743
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,320
 It's a barge.

744
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,400
 Now it looks like a normal boat.

745
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,000
 Missile goes, torpedo goes right underneath it.

746
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,240
 So at that point, maybe they fire a couple more,

747
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,520
 I don't know, the submarine then pulls up to the Sabrina,

748
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,000
 boards the ship and takes the crew prisoner.

749
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,400
 Now if there were any weapons hidden on the ship,

750
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,280
 they could have taken the weapons as well.

751
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,240
 'Cause when the ship did wash ashore,

752
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
 there's no idea of whether or not

753
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,680
 there was a bunch of coal found on the boat

754
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,520
 or guns found on the boat.

755
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,360
 And this is a historical event as well.

756
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,400
 The idea is this, that they were captured by the Germans

757
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,440
 and you had these 23 men brought onto this German sub.

758
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,640
 You had these 23 men brought on the German sub.

759
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,440
 But then the sub sinks.

760
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,000
 So you have no record of the prisoners being taken.

761
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 You have no record of the attack.

762
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Everyone who knows about that attack died in the sub.

763
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,280
 I find that honestly creepier.

764
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,200
 You imagine you're on a boat.

765
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,840
 Let's say you're not hauling weapons.

766
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,560
 Let's say you're on this boat

767
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,000
 and you get captured by the Germans.

768
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,200
 Now you may be a sailor all your life,

769
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,120
 but being in one of the first submarines ever used

770
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,920
 would be quite different.

771
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,840
 So you and your 22 buddies are crammed into an enemy

772
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,120
 underwater vessel, still quite alien.

773
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,440
 Plains are still flying around

774
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
 for the first time for crying out loud.

775
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,880
 And you've heard of these subs, these U-boats,

776
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,680
 but now you're being led into this dark, steamy,

777
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,320
 stinky vehicle.

778
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,960
 And while you're down there,

779
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,080
 you can't wait to get back to your family.

780
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,280
 You just wanna get rescued.

781
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,400
 If you get sent to a prison camp, that's fine.

782
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,600
 Eventually the war will end.

783
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,480
 Hopefully you guys will win and you'll go back home.

784
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,320
 But then while you're in this vessel,

785
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,960
 something goes wrong.

786
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,480
 Mismanagement, enemy attack,

787
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,800
 your own people trying to attack

788
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,840
 what they see as an enemy sub that has you in it,

789
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,120
 a torpedo ripping through the hole,

790
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,360
 a navigation error crashing into the sea floor.

791
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,200
 What have you?

792
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,600
 Just two days earlier,

793
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,600
 you were a sailor on a barge hauling weapons

794
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 or maybe just coal.

795
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,840
 And now you're in a vessel at the bottom of the ocean,

796
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,360
 surrounded by your friends,

797
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,720
 and you are all surrounded by the enemy.

798
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,720
 And as water pours into the hole of this strange vehicle,

799
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,840
 you can't help think it would have been preferable

800
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,320
 had you got whisked into an alien dimension

801
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,600
 or met your end of the hand of a vengeful spirit

802
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,560
 than to be trapped here in the dark,

803
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,680
 in the cold, in the wet coffin

804
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,800
 that no one will ever know about.

805
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,920
 Your death is a mystery

806
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,320
 and no one will ever find out the answer.
