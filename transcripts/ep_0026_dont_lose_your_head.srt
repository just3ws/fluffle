00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
 From mysteries debunked to why the Titanic was sunk today on Dead Rabbit Radio

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:17,160
 Hey everyone, thanks for coming back for another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. This is episode 26. I'm very happy about that. I

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,240
 Like I like just chugging along doing this thing. It's 100 degrees and

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,560
 It's like 11 o'clock at night and that is just a crime against nature and

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,240
 It shouldn't be this hot considering I am in the Pacific Northwest in the

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,000
 Creepy tiny little town of Hood River, which I've talked about before the edge of darkness the last

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,160
 Bastion of civilization on the edge of a

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:56,360
 Black void that is nature. It's very weird. I didn't grow up in a very nature-oriented place. I kind of grew up in more

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,280
 More more and I don't want to say industrialized but more developed areas

11
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,400
 And most the areas I grew up with and had it was developed to a point

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,280
 And then there was like undeveloped land that you know, eventually they're gonna put houses there because it was prime real estate

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,480
 But at the time it just you all over neighborhoods just kind of ended into just like weed fields weed fields

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,160
 But you know generally where I grew up. It was relatively flat areas

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,760
 So it's weird for me one of the things that creeps me out about Hood River is you're surrounded well basically on one whole side by mountains and

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,680
 So the other day I was walking to the store and it was probably like 10 o'clock at 9 o'clock at night

17
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,880
 So the Sun, you know, it's the Sun's setting way later, but the Sun had set just enough

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,360
 That there was only some light available from over the mountain range. So what I'm seeing is just these huge

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,880
 Shadowed mounds and the distance and a little bit like a little line of light above them

20
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,280
 I'm walking and I always have these thoughts. I walk everywhere and I love walking, but I always have these thoughts

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,680
 What was this place like?

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,920
 before men

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
 Before mankind came here

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,800
 What was it like?

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,840
 before the native native population came over

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,000
 What was it like before the settlers came over there was no lights

27
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,600
 So nothing is just darkness and those people would look

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,000
 Go what's on the other side of those mountains?

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,640
 It's all mystery to them. We all have the maps nowadays. We know where everything's at everything's well-lit

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,600
 We're surrounded by civilization even if you're in an area that is

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,480
 Not as developed

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,680
 You still know what's on the other side of those mountains

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,920
 You can always

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
 Google it

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,720
 But there was a time when that wasn't the case and that always fascinates me

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,000
 I imagine what the landscape would look like with no buildings no lights or anything like that

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,200
 It's always terrifying to me because again, I like being around I like being in a civilized area

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,360
 And when we talk about civilized areas, it's it's it's often easy to forget how much of the world

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,240
 isn't

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,160
 Isn't developed. There's just like just trees or deserts or ice wastelands

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,320
 Even then we can have satellite view of what is in those areas

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,840
 But when you're on the ground and you're walking through them, you may be even this time you may be the first person

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,560
 Creating a path through that forest fascinating fascinating stuff to me

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,080
 Now I'd said in the beginning about mysteries debunked. There was two mysteries

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,880
 That I was looking at there

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,400
 I have a little folder

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,000
 That I kind of like as I'm going through the internet and I'm kind of like throwing stuff in this folder checking it out seeing what's on there

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,720
 There's two mysteries on there that I was like, oh that sounds really cool. No, that was debunked

49
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,960
 And then I found another one. I'm like, oh, whoa, this is right at my that's fake

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,080
 And then we'll get to the Titanic one which is actually one of the conspiracy theories that I don't necessarily believe in

51
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,200
 But I do talk to people about I always kind of it's one of those like

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:08,080
 Baby's first conspiracy theories, you know, it's not one of the huge popular ones like 9/11 or Newtown and all that stuff

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,640
 I kind of still like to do the obscure ones, but it's kind of one of those conspiracy theories

54
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,080
 I shout throw out to people who are just kind of starting to show some interest in conspiracy theories

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,640
 But first off so sticking with the wilderness thing. I found out about this place and it's called the Valley of the Headless Men

56
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,040
 So I was like that's dope bookmark

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,760
 I'll read that later because I never read stuff at the right time

58
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,120
 But I do read it before I do this show. I did read it at least once kind of so

59
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,840
 Mystery of the headless the headless the the Valley of the headless men is in Canada

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,120
 One good thing to come out of Canada. I guess Brendan Fraser and Zac Efron came out of Canada. Did Zac Efron come out of Canada? I

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,440
 Don't remember but anyways if he didn't then that's another strike against Canada

62
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,760
 So the Valley of the Headless Men men. Yeah is a

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,000
 Valley obviously in the Nahini Park Reserve

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,640
 And the way that it got its name was that several bodies have been found there with their heads chopped off obviously and

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,480
 There's always been

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,960
 suspicions of who or what

67
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,920
 Has been doing this

68
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:21,080
 So to start it off and I'll just do a brief overview because I kind of gave a spoiler alert by saying that this story was debunked

69
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,520
 These people actually did die. So first off there was two brothers who went there to find gold

70
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,320
 They look they located a local tribe in the area who had these huge golden nuggets and they're like, oh, there must be gold here

71
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,400
 So they went

72
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,600
 Into deeper into the valley and they were looking for the gold eventually they went missing and

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,520
 Then the next time they were found their heads were chopped off

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,720
 So a few other prospectors had heard the legend of these guys going and they the stories of these guys finding this a massive

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,200
 Amounts of gold they'd go in there and their heads would be chopped off their bodies were just found with no heads

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,320
 This went on for probably about 30 years and they've never no one else has ever found the gold mine

77
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,560
 There was a tribe of native people up there that it was their land

78
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,760
 They just up and disappeared at one point

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:11,800
 So the tribe was called the Naha tribe and they existed there and they would come out of the mountains to raid lowland settlements

80
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,840
 And then they just mysteriously vanished according to all accounts

81
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,720
 and

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,440
 Then there were other tribes in the area and never were like that area is bad mojo don't go in there

83
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,420
 It's really bad, but white settlers kept going in the area looking for gold and kept getting their heads chopped off

84
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,300
 So I'm reading a couple different sources on this and I'm going from reddit to this source or that source the other thing and everyone's like

85
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,640
 Yeah, these people are getting their heads chopped off. I'm like on a Sasquatch blog and they're like people are getting their heads removed and

86
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,480
 All these bodies are being found with no heads and as I'm doing my research and it's not a huge conspiracy

87
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,320
 But it's a conspiracy where I'm going from multiple blog to multiple blog and at first. I'm like, okay

88
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,320
 This is a really creepy story. This is definitely something I want to talk about

89
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,160
 But again, it's always more interesting. I think when reality intrudes into the fantasy

90
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,120
 So on one of these blogs I can't one of these articles I came across they said

91
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,460
 The two brothers who originally had went in to find the gold pieces. They were found tied to a tree and their heads were removed

92
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,120
 Now this was the fourth or fifth article I had found

93
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,420
 And it was the first time it acknowledged that the people weren't just found laying in the

94
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,260
 brush

95
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
 They were tied to a tree

96
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,440
 So now it's not

97
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,000
 this super mysterious

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,840
 Ghost or paranormal force or

99
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,440
 Gateway opening or Sasquatch

100
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
 Bigfoot doesn't tie you to a tree

101
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:49,000
 So they found these two dudes tied to a tree with their head chopped off and that's tragic. I'm not diminishing that makes it a little more reasonable

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,640
 Then the other people who are also looking for the gold they just find them with their heads chopped off

103
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,200
 This is going on for quite a while and what happens is eventually

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:07,000
 The natives that are still in the outskirts of the area they start getting there. This is in December of

105
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:14,000
 1931 so this is about 30 years after the original brothers got their heads chopped off after they were found tied to the tree and

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,240
 So what happened was the natives in the area? They're putting their traps out for the game and

107
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,160
 They would go to check them every once in a while and the tracks the traps would be broken and

108
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:32,240
 Hung from trees now the natives aren't like oh, this must be the work of Bigfoot. They're like, uh, this must be that

109
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,200
 Crazy guy who lives up in the hills and his name was the mad the mad trapper of Rat River is what he was called

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:45,680
 Albert Johnson was his real name. But anyways, the natives weren't blaming this on any mystical force there because obviously Bigfoot's not gonna be like

111
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,680
 He he he I have all this extra rope left over so I'm gonna tie their traps up on trees

112
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,160
 They go to the Mounties and they say hey man

113
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 Someone's messing with our traps and we think it's this guy so the Mounties come out to this shack and the dudes like I'm not

114
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,040
 Lanyuan Mounties are like dude let us in and he's like no

115
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,920
 I'm not letting you in so then they leave to get a search warrant which is weird because I didn't think those existed back then and I

116
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
 Really didn't think they existed in Canada

117
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,520
 So Mounties show up with some extra people and the search warrant and they're like banging on the door

118
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,400
 And there's a shootout and the Mountie one of the Mounties gets shot and they go and they recover and eventually they grab the guy

119
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:28,080
 They are able to get into the cabin and take down the mad trapper of Rat River and when they catch him they find in his possession

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 gold teeth

121
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Removed from the heads or mouths of local prospectors

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,240
 The Mounties at that point said oh, he's the guy's been chopping everyone's head off

123
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,780
 Case closed. Why did it take me four articles to find that?

124
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,240
 That's the thing and I these articles tend to reference each other

125
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,560
 You read this thing on Reddit about the mad trapper and it links me to this article

126
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,760
 But it took me maybe 20 minutes to find this article and it was on a website called strange outdoors

127
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,120
 It wasn't like this big debunking website, which sometimes I'll get led to those as well

128
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,320
 But guys come on and see that's that I think it's one of the problems with ghost stories and paranormal

129
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,280
 So I would go stories and conspiracy stories and stuff like that is you don't do your research

130
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:19,000
 I'm a hobbyist at this stuff. I'm making no money doing this. I'm doing this for my fun and

131
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,200
 Just to meet new friends to meet people like you and to talk to you about stuff

132
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,760
 I'm not doing this for money and I found this article and you could say well, you know, you can't say case closed

133
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,960
 You don't have any evidence true

134
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,680
 But this is the most likely scenario that it wasn't Sasquatch that it wasn't some sort of demonic portal

135
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,300
 It wasn't ball Barith before he took out XXX 10 Tatian. He was ripping the heads off of prospectors

136
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,320
 This was most likely a fellow prospector

137
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,920
 Who was stealing their gold and their gold teeth?

138
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,840
 And even there were sightings of the two brothers

139
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:03,040
 They people saw them with a third person none of that stuff was available in any of the articles I read guys

140
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,880
 If you're doing this you got to do a little bit of research

141
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,160
 Even if it ruins the story because to me it doesn't ruin the story makes it more interesting

142
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,600
 It makes it more plausible because you can go aha mystery solved now

143
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,680
 Let's look at the mysteries that we don't have an answer to and it makes you more credible too

144
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,320
 I would love to just tell ghost stories all day long

145
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,320
 But if I don't believe in them if I know that stuff is fake and I'm selling it to you, you know

146
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,360
 That's to me. That's not fun. That's trickery now some of these websites didn't do their due diligence

147
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,920
 And some of these websites that I read may have seen this article and said now I like the ghost

148
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
 I like the ghost story better. Yeah, you know, it gives it a bad name

149
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,360
 You got to be able to call like you see and that's one thing I liked about that show ghost hunters

150
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,680
 They would walk into our house. They do an investigation be like your pipes are weakened

151
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,160
 Everything is because your pipes are leaking and I don't know if they continue to do that

152
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,560
 But in the first couple seasons every so often they'd come in our house and they're like, yeah that ghost

153
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,880
 That's a car driving by

154
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,480
 And it let it lent the show more credibility

155
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,440
 There was another thing now. I've talked about this before

156
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,800
 I'm a big fan of the idea of

157
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,800
 Humanities been around longer than we think kind of hidden history type of things. I like those stories

158
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,280
 All right, I don't believe aliens built the pyramids. It may have been done with techniques

159
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,080
 That we don't have anymore

160
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,280
 Or that we've forgotten the pyramids may be older than we think they are the sphinx the sphinx

161
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,120
 Maybe older than we think it is. I've heard a lot of theories like that. I love that stuff

162
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,560
 But again, you don't try to trick me

163
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,880
 Makes it. Uh, so there's this thing called the wedge of iude a iud

164
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,520
 and what it is

165
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,440
 Is there was an archaeological dig in 1974 in romania in the town of iude

166
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,840
 Is that how i pronounce it? I don't remember. Anyways

167
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,680
 It's this there's two mastodontists

168
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,680
 They're doing this archaeological dig and they find a mastodontist and they're like, oh score dude

169
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,080
 I am getting laid tonight from all those cute archaeological chicks named dusty. They're all named dusty

170
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,840
 And then they're digging and they're like, what they find another mastodontist and they're like, dude

171
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,360
 This this is going to be dope. Let me brush something aside

172
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,040
 It's a chunk of aluminum. So basically it looks like an aluminum

173
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,280
 device

174
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,920
 It's a big thick thing. Now the problem is is aluminum

175
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,800
 If i'm saying that right

176
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,840
 Then it wasn't really become a thing wasn't

177
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,640
 synthesized or made or whatever the particular term is forged

178
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 until

179
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,480
 Later in life. I think it was like the 1800s. So we're 1825

180
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,320
 Metallic aluminum did not exist and reading that off of this website

181
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,280
 I didn't just know that i'm not that smart obviously

182
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,560
 They're like, here we go. What is this doing next to two mastodontists?

183
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,360
 It's this this is proof

184
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,600
 That people have been here before and they were saying that based on where it was at next to the mastodontists and things like that

185
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,760
 That the wedge itself could be 11 000 years old minimum

186
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:23,920
 Possibly millions of years old stories ranged everything from ancient humans hidden history stuff like that

187
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,040
 To time travel to spacecrafts

188
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,480
 And i'm like score. This is a great story. It's kind of hitting all of the stuff that I like

189
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,000
 And I googled it

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,200
 And the first article that popped up was on rational wiki, which is a skeptic website

191
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,160
 Which again, I that's not a website that I normally have bookmarked

192
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,280
 It seems it's kind of smarmy to me that every time I've read it

193
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,160
 I've kind of been like they kind of act like they know everything

194
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,200
 Because I don't think there's always an easy answer for everything. But anyways, so I pulled this up and they're like, oh

195
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,400
 Here's an answer. It's the tooth of a tractor

196
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,200
 What's that thing that digs? It's an excavation tool. It's the one with the

197
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,440
 It's the one with the oh here it's an

198
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,360
 Excavator bucket. So it's like, you know, the big I'm making the hand with the claw like you can actually see what I'm doing

199
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,440
 But it's like the big claw that just whatever you'll see the picture, but it digs into the earth

200
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,880
 Now I see that and it's like this is a tooth from an excavator bucket

201
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,360
 And the part of me that wants to believe in the story. I'm like, no way. It can't be that easy and they're like, here's

202
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,280
 Here's a picture of the tooth. Here's the picture of what they dug up

203
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,120
 Here's an illustration showing how that tooth attaches to this excavator bucket. They're like it fell off

204
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,480
 It fell off at some point

205
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,880
 And which would make sense because you know, it's a dig

206
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,960
 It's not like they just were walking across the street and they fell over two mastodon bones

207
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,680
 Someone had to dig deep enough to realize there was something there and then the archaeologists are called in

208
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,680
 And the material that is made that those excavator bucket teeth are made of oxidizes very quickly

209
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
 So it looks old very quickly

210
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,240
 Now here's the thing if it didn't look exactly like a tooth

211
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,800
 I would say well, you know your structure that it looks exactly like the tooth. Don't lie to me, man

212
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,480
 It's an interesting story. I just was looking at an article today

213
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,200
 Saying that the new theory is is that humanity did not evolve in one location and spread across the planet

214
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,760
 That we evolved in several locations on the planet. Boom. That's fascinating

215
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,240
 That's a big article that's going around. I'll go ahead and put that in the links as well

216
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,720
 So you can still have mysteries. You can still have this great stuff. Don't lie to me, man

217
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,480
 Don't tell me that this tooth is from some sort of time traveling

218
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,440
 You know mech where he's like had to punch a mastodon in the face to survive and then he's like warp out

219
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
 And then he ends it back in the year 2400

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,880
 This isn't a mystery bro. It took me five minutes to google that I can understand it was it probably was a mystery back in the

221
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,040
 70s when they figured that out, but this story should not be on any website any mysterious website now

222
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,320
 I know you're thinking jason you're getting riled up. It's just because it's 100 degrees and it's super hot

223
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:17,360
 Maybe you might also be thinking jason are you still taking that pseudofit? Is that amping you up? Maybe

224
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,520
 I am actually doing that. But so here's the thing. I want to end this on a conspiracy theory

225
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,200
 That really hasn't been disproven and it's funny because as I was reading about this

226
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,360
 It's a conspiracy theory I followed for a long time when I was reading the article about this they go

227
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,240
 This theory's been disproven check the link here. It clicked on the link. It didn't disprove it

228
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
 I think this one

229
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,080
 It might be clocked up more to coincidence

230
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
 but

231
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,280
 As garak once said I believe in coincidences

232
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,560
 Coincidences happen every day

233
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,840
 But I don't trust coincidences

234
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,640
 Oh man star trek deep space nine best television show best television show ever made I've watched it all the way through two times

235
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,360
 And I think two and a half times. I love that show

236
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,720
 But anyways, so we all know about the titanic whether you knew about the historical event or the movie

237
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,800
 You know about it. It's the great big boat that got hit by an iceberg or hit an iceberg whatever

238
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,520
 Whichever one is more grammatically correct. But anyways, so

239
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,600
 Hit an iceberg it sank a bunch of people died and at the ending the girl threw the heart of the ocean

240
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,880
 Was it the heart of the ocean? Yeah, heart of the ocean into the ocean

241
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,440
 And then she becomes a ghost that itself is not a huge conspiracy theory

242
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,640
 What is a huge conspiracy theory is why it sank now?

243
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,920
 Of course people have said the boat was supposed to be unsinkable

244
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,200
 And it hit an iceberg and it cut it open and I'm not really arguing with the technical sides of that

245
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
 There were a few titanic

246
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,720
 Conspiracy theories and they're all kind of fascinating the one that I wanted to start talking about was why it sank

247
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,600
 Or who sank it is a better course of action

248
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,280
 I'm not necessarily saying this is true conspiracy, but again, it's just kind of a fascinating story. So

249
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,000
 JP Morgan was the owner of the white star line the boat line that the titanic sailed under

250
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,040
 There was a still called sail if it didn't have any sails

251
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,120
 anyways

252
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,720
 So so what happened was at the time the titanic so it was like 1912 1910 1912

253
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,320
 There's this debate over whether or not to start a federal reserve

254
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,800
 So the united states would have a federal reserve bank that's still controversial to this day

255
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,920
 It's not a so the federal reserve is actually not part of the federal government. It was it was

256
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,320
 It existed because of an act of congress, but it's not a

257
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,680
 It's a it's a private corporation basically

258
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,080
 And if for the most part it can control it says interest rates

259
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,920
 It has quote-unquote like control over our financial rules setting the interest rates a big one because it kind of depends

260
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,360
 Kind of determines how people are loaning money and borrowing money and stuff like that

261
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,600
 But it's not a government organization

262
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,920
 The you know, we can appoint

263
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,320
 You know ben Bernacky or alan greenspan and stuff like that, but it's more set up like a private corporation

264
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,400
 So there are people against the establishment of a federal reserve

265
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,480
 They didn't want they didn't want a federal head controlling money policy and this is

266
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,480
 You know, like I said, we're going back to like 1910 1912 around this time period

267
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,080
 Well and jp morgan was on this side of yes

268
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 We need to set up a federal reserve and there was three people who were against setting well

269
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,160
 There's multiple people against setting up the federal reserve. These are some of the most powerful

270
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,280
 It was benjamin guggenheim who you might recognize his name from guggenheim

271
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,840
 fast food restaurants

272
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,120
 There was issa strauss who is the inheritor of the levi strauss. I'm making that up

273
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,040
 Benjamin guggenheim

274
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,600
 Issa strauss and jacob aster and i know aster and guggenheim. I don't know strauss

275
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,960
 I was making the levi joke up

276
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,640
 But anyways, both of them according to this graphic that i'm looking at

277
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,480
 Were worth a total of 11 billion dollars and that's probably in today's money

278
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,840
 Maybe back then but anyways, they were adamantly opposed to the establishment of federal reserve

279
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,600
 And all three of those men were on the titanic and all three of those men died the night it sank

280
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,840
 So that's a fact

281
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,160
 Those three men died during the sinking of the titanic and jp morgan owner of the white star line

282
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,640
 Was for the federal reserve and they were against it

283
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,360
 So the conspiracy is that the titanic was sunk to eliminate powerful opposition to the establishment of the federal reserve

284
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,080
 Creepy if true

285
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,320
 possible maybe

286
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,760
 so

287
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,640
 And that's a conspiracy theory that's been floating around for a long time

288
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,200
 And it's one of those things that sometimes terrible events happen and they take on a life of their own

289
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:47,760
 You know, we've seen stuff where you know the 9/11 was taken down because there was a bunch of gold in the basement of one of the

290
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,920
 Buildings and someone wanted to steal it or a bunch of money went missing from the federal government

291
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,000
 They wanted to hide that up so they destroyed all that stuff that fairly unlikely, but I could see that if

292
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,720
 you were

293
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,400
 I i'm a powerful man and I have three people who are equally as powerful

294
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,760
 Maybe even more powerful trying to stop me and my side

295
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,680
 From creating this federal reserve, which will benefit me endlessly

296
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,520
 It'll benefit you endlessly too. So why don't you just get on our side and they're like no no no jp

297
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,720
 We're not following your plans and that's all hop on this boat and take a trip and he sinks it

298
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,520
 Now the couple I like that conspiracy theory. I think it's an interesting one some of the problems with it just to be fair one

299
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,800
 If they were in such at such war with jp morgan, why would they ride his boat?

300
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,280
 You know, why would they go on his boat? That's a question I have two

301
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,640
 Bullets are cheaper than sinking a boat

302
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,200
 And you could say well jason

303
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,960
 If the whole boat sinks you can get them all three at once, but then it leads to my third question

304
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,520
 What if they survived?

305
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,720
 You know, what if they hopped on the life rafts right away?

306
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,920
 What if there were enough life rafts? What if the rescue ship showed up early enough?

307
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,520
 So on and so forth. So it's an interesting conspiracy theory

308
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,160
 It's possible

309
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,400
 I enjoy it. I enjoy that conspiracy theory and um, and it does fit the

310
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,640
 idea of what a good conspiracy theory is and I guess when I keep saying a good conspiracy theory is I basically

311
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,680
 I'm saying a conspiracy theory. You can't really disprove it involves time plus distance because it happened in the middle of the ocean a long time ago

312
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,720
 it is a

313
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,920
 Involved a group we don't trust which is billionaires and corporations things like that a little bit of the government

314
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,480
 And it has very few people involved in it

315
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,280
 You would just need well actually now that I think about it. It would basically

316
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,040
 Someone on the boat would have had to steer it into the iceberg

317
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,200
 I never mind that conspiracy theory is pretty ridiculous too now that I've actually put a little bit of thought into it

318
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,920
 You would have had to have you would have had to

319
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,040
 Know there was an iceberg in that area

320
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
 Crash into it on purpose

321
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,360
 And do enough damage for it to sink and I know there's also a conspiracy theory that it didn't even hit an iceberg

322
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
 But at a certain point you kind of got to go

323
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,880
 Yeah, and pterodactyls could have shown up and eaten everybody like at a certain point

324
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,920
 You have to accept a certain amount of facts in any given story. So there we go. There's tonight's episode

325
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,400
 I I guess I actually ended up disproving a conspiracy theory that I've talked about

326
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,920
 I mean unless they really paid him off or paid off the the captain's family

327
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Why would you steer your boat into a?

328
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,120
 Into an iceberg for money to die in the cold

329
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,200
 That yeah, that doesn't really work unless

330
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,840
 No, I got nothing I got nothing

331
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,240
 Well, that is it for tonight's episode. I started off with two debunked stories and pretty much ended with three

332
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,680
 I really do like the titanic story if you have a

333
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,400
 Answer for why someone would purposely drive a boat into an iceberg or go on a suicide mission

334
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,520
 Because again, somebody has to make the boat crash and blow up

335
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,080

338

339
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400

340

 Hope you're having as good as the time as I am

342
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,280
 Doing it. We're going to be looking at doing some stuff in the future with live streams and things like that

343
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,160
 But for right now, I'm just happy to get a podcast out every day

344
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,800
 That's like my news bulletin noise

345
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,560
 As I was editing the episode and I'm looking back over my sources

346
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,880
 There was something that I had read initially. I promise and I'd forgotten to say it originally

347
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,760
 In considering how much I was lambasting people for not fully doing their research. I guess I'm the last one to talk

348
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,360
 Nahini valley the valley of the headless men

349
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,360
 myth busted or was it

350
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,880
 In 1962

351
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,760
 30 years after the event of the prospector having to shoot out with the Mounties and being arrested with the gold teeth taken from

352
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
 the prospector's mouths

353
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,920
 Alone pilot is flying his plane

354
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:31,440
 Smoke billows out of the plane. I don't know smoke bill out of the plane. But anyways, so the plane crashes

355
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,760
 into the valley

356
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
 He survives

357
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,400
 He's a good enough pilot. You can walk away from anything

358
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,920
 He's downed though. He can't contact anyone, but he does have food

359
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
 He has water

360
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,640
 He has shelter

361
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
 He's like i'm just gonna stay here

362
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,480
 Until I get rescued that's the smart play right when you're a little kid you're taught if you get lost

363
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,280
 Stay where you're at and your parents will find you

364
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,280
 Don't do that if you're actually a kidnapped victim you have to get away, but

365
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,680
 We're in a mall and no one's kidnapped you yet. Just stay there parents will find you

366
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,240
 So he stays there and he's bored because he's in the middle of nowhere

367
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,960
 Just like anyone who goes in the middle of nowhere is bored camping might be the most boring possible

368
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,600
 I'm gonna I'm forget that forget that. He's bored. So what do you do when you're bored?

369
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,400
 Keep a diary. You got nothing else to do. You have no television

370
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,240
 So he begins writing about what's going on day to day just kind of keep himself

371
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,240
 Keep himself going and if we see in his diary that planes are flying overhead and he's trying to signal them

372
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,040
 Hey, I'm down here. I'm down here. They just keep flying

373
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
 They don't see him

374
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,640
 He keeps taking his diary, you know

375
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,680
 gets dark

376
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,720
 Snuggles up with a few slides. I don't know. I don't know what pilots like and then during the day

377
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,960
 He's like throwing rocks at squirrels or whatever taking his diary way to get rescued now

378
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,200
 He's actually only six miles from his destination of where he's supposed to go, but he didn't know in which direction

379
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,840
 You know, maybe he's a little shook up from the plane crash. So again best thing to do is to just wait there

380
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,760
 Six months later just on an accident his plane the wreckage of his plane is discovered

381
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,800
 They find his camp. They find his diary which has 50 days of entries in it

382
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,760
 The pilot

383
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
 Was never found

384
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,480
 Is a mystery back on the menu boys

385
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,860
 We don't know we'll keep this one open on dead rabbit radio

386
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:51,860
