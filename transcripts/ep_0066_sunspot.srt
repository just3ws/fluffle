00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 Are YouTubers really ordering mystery boxes off the deep web?

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:11,760
 And was this very podcast responsible for the shutdown of the Sunspot Solar Observatory

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,920
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:23,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
 I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,760
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,480
 There is a beautiful rainbow right outside my window.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
 Absolutely beautiful.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,480
 It's even darker than it was just a couple minutes ago.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,120
 It's amazing looking.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,920
 Still kind of drizzling outside.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,920
 You know, I think it's interesting when you look at the story of Noah.

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,120
 I think most of you are familiar with it, but the general gist of it is that God had

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,980
 to wipe out humanity.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,680
 He told Noah, "Listen, your family's pure.

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
 Build this boat."

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,120
 And they're going away for 40 days and 40 nights.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,640
 The flood destroys everybody else.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,120
 At one point, a rainbow is created.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,400
 And that rainbow is created in its God's word, its God's pact, that he would never destroy

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,440
 the planet again with a flood in particular.

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,240
 But I mean, it was basically like a symbol of a promise between God and man that, you

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,840
 know, he would no longer, you know, rain down billions of gallons of water on them.

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,800
 What I think interesting, so when I read that story as a kid, you're like, "Oh, you know,

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
 that's beautiful."

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:34,840
 And as an adult, I remember thinking logically, does that mean there were no rainbows before

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
 the flood?

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,000
 Does that mean that before the great flood, no one had ever seen a rainbow?

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,960
 Because it particularly makes the rainbow that symbol, that promise between God and

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
 man.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,440
 And it's just kind of an interesting, I mean, here's the thing.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,760
 I meet people who go, "Oh, you know, I just can't logically believe in God or I just can't

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,840
 logically believe in any sort of figure like Christ figure or Muhammad or whatever.

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,040
 And I just can't believe in the afterlife and stuff like that."

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,200
 Fair enough.

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,800
 I'm logical enough that I don't believe in true love, but I can still appreciate a Britney

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 Spears song.

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
 I can still appreciate a romantic movie.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,400
 There's a lot of stuff that I'm like, "Yeah, that just doesn't happen in real life."

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,080
 That's, you know.

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,160
 But I still appreciate it.

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,240
 And I think that there's a lot of interesting stories and parables and lessons in all of

44
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,320
 these religions that can be appreciated.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,760
 Even though you may not buy into it, lock, sock, and barrel, there's still some nice

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
 stories there.

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,280
 There's some not-so-nice stories.

48
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,640
 Like when that, he was a prophet of God, some teenagers were making fun of him, so he's

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,680
 sick to like 10 bears and they mauled the kids.

50
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,640
 That's a weird part of the Bible.

51
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,960
 So yeah, I just think it's kind of interesting.

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,400
 I mean, logically, yes, rainbows existed before the Great Flood, but in the narrative, in

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
 the structure of that story, if it's taken at face value, they didn't.

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
 So what happened when it rained?

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,120
 How did the light reflect through the water and all that stuff?

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,200
 Just kind of an interesting note.

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,080
 You know, I watched a lot of Shark Tank and Dragon's Den, and I think those shows are

58
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
 great.

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,480
 I think they're great because I think it inspires people to get up off their butt and try to

60
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
 make something.

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,120
 The whole show is basically people who have been working in their garage or have been

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,360
 sitting in their living room and drawing notes and staying up late and drinking the coffee

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,880
 and making those sacrifices throughout the day, and they build a product, they start it,

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,200
 they go from just being like a soccer mom or a guy with like, he already has a job, he

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,000
 doesn't really like, so he comes up with this idea that he thinks will make the world better.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
 I think it's fascinating.

67
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,120
 I am always inspired by that show to come up with inventions.

68
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,960
 I have an invention of my own.

69
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,080
 It's called baby weights.

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,280
 Baby weights are biodegradable weights.

71
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,600
 So a woman is pregnant.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
 A woman has a baby.

73
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,520
 So we'll figure it's maybe like three, you're three months into pregnancy, you don't want

74
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,680
 to push the kid, right?

75
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,640
 She would swallow, she's going to swallow the weights.

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,600
 You swallow these little, they're like maybe two of three ounces.

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
 She swallows them.

78
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,480
 Or I don't know if a woman swallows something, if it doesn't go into the baby place.

79
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,120
 Like they get food, right?

80
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,000
 Like when a woman eats stuff, does it, chicken wings fall into the womb?

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,680
 You know, to be honest, I don't know much about female biology, but I also don't know

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,560
 much about male biology.

83
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,360
 But like when you eat something, does it just like nutrients shoot into the womb or does

84
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,080
 like the piece of, there's a hot wing flown around in there, a couple of nuggets.

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,360
 Anyways, so, okay, you slice the pregnant woman open and you can, oh no, no, no, even better.

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,160
 Can't you like go in through the vagina and like, and like, well anyways, somehow you

87
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,680
 attach these little weights to the baby's arms and legs.

88
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,760
 And so when they're like moving around in the womb and kicking, it's slowly building

89
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
 up their strength.

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,960
 You could even probably like put one on their neck to help like build core strength because

91
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,960
 they're always in a ball, but then they're like unraveling and stuff.

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,360
 It's like doing sit-ups.

93
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,800
 And then what happens is the weight slowly dissolve and then you get a few more crammed

94
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,960
 up in there and they're a little bit heavier now.

95
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,200
 And so now the baby's like, you know, like curling five, six ounces.

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,920
 And that's a lot for a baby.

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,200
 Put them on their legs.

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,480
 So when like they're like cycling and stuff, come out.

99
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,640
 The baby's totally healthy.

100
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,880
 The baby will have the most developed muscles of any baby ever.

101
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 Baby weights.

102
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,800
 Now, I haven't put a patent on that yet, but I trust my listeners not to steal that idea.

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 Baby weights.

104
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,480
 Okay, so anyways, we're going to go ahead and get started with the episode.

105
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,640
 We have a lot of cool stories for you today.

106
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,240
 Now I do have to say some of you may have noticed that I did not come out with an episode

107
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,680
 on Friday and there is a very good reason for that.

108
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,680
 And it ties into our second story and my paranoia.

109
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,280
 So we'll save that for a bit, but let's go ahead and get started with this.

110
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,800
 So there's been a new trend on YouTube and what it is, it's YouTubers of all stripes,

111
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,200
 all sorts of channels are doing this.

112
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,560
 They're buying mystery boxes off of the deep web.

113
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,520
 The deep web is a quick overview.

114
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,320
 Most of the time is spent on the Surface web.

115
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,840
 You're hearing this podcast or you're downloading it from the Surface web.

116
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,400
 That's Facebook and Google and email and going shopping at Amazon and all that stuff.

117
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
 That's just kind of everything that you can just do on the Surface.

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,960
 Then when you step down a level to go to the deep web, that's when you need Tor.

119
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,840
 These are basically servers that aren't indexed, I guess is the best way.

120
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,440
 These are servers that are connected to the internet.

121
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,640
 They're connected to a internet, but you need a special browser access them because they're

122
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,360
 not they're not indexed.

123
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,000
 I don't know if I'm explaining that right, right?

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,600
 Because I'm just trying to get it real quickly because that's not the point.

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,160
 The point is it's basically like a hidden internet or it's like a hard to access internet.

126
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,120
 It's generally where you have stuff.

127
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,680
 We've talked about this before like Silk Road, internet hitmen operate on the deep web.

128
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,520
 A lot of horrible stuff like child porn.

129
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,400
 It's all down there.

130
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,680
 Well, not all down there, but I mean like there's stuff of that on the surface web,

131
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,480
 but generally speaking, it's where you would go to indulge in a criminal activity or enterprise

132
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,000
 with less risk.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 It's not zero risk, but less risk.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
 It's basically like the moss isley of the internet.

135
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,080
 It's just kind of this horrible place.

136
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,520
 It's like where all the bad stuff happens.

137
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,400
 So there's been this YouTube trend of people being like, "Oh, I bought this $250 box from

138
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,960
 the deep web and you open it up and I watched a couple of these videos.

139
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,200
 That's how I figured out about it."

140
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,800
 And they're like wearing gloves and they have the box cutter because you don't know what's

141
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
 going to be in the box.

142
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,880
 It could be like a ton of drugs.

143
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,120
 It could be a bunch of like bloody panties.

144
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
 You don't know.

145
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,120
 So they're sitting there with the gloves on, slowly opening the box.

146
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,160
 The creepy stock music is playing in the background.

147
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,480
 And they're like, "Oh, what is this?

148
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,600
 This is a baby doll, but it's head's chopped off.

149
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,160
 Here, let me set this to the side."

150
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,880
 And they're always wearing like a little camera.

151
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,960
 So we're from like their point of view and they're like, "Oh, I see something else.

152
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,040
 It's a USB drive.

153
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,520
 We'll put this into the end of the video.

154
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
 Keep watching.

155
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
 Like and subscribe.

156
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
 Put this USB down.

157
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
 Ooh, what's this?

158
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,960
 It's these Polaroids and they're like a creepy forest.

159
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
 Oh no."

160
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,040
 And like builds this mystery.

161
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,120
 And then the one, I saw one where a guy like puts in the USB drive and then he's like, "Oh,

162
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
 what's on here?"

163
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,720
 And it's just like a picture of like three guys standing in a room.

164
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,160
 And then there's a knock at his door and he turns around.

165
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,760
 He's like, "Oh no, someone's knocking on my door.

166
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,120
 I'm just gonna just pop this mystery box."

167
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,280
 Then he turns back and his computers are all glitchy.

168
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,960
 And then people who were previously just standing in the room are looking at him.

169
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,200
 Now obviously when he turned around, the camera turned around and that allowed anyone else

170
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,920
 able to, you know, hit the mouse and move to the next thing.

171
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,800
 These mystery boxes go anywhere from $250 to $10,000.

172
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,080
 I just dropped $10,000 on this mystery box.

173
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,560
 You don't know what's in it.

174
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
 Watch this video.

175
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
 Like and subscribe.

176
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,720
 It's fake.

177
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,640
 I'm not saying that there's not mystery boxes online.

178
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,760
 There are these weird memes that pop up that I dismissed completely and they're real.

179
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
 This one isn't.

180
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,960
 I was actually able to track it down.

181
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,440
 The earliest reference to this.

182
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,680
 On July 2018, there was a story posted on Wattpad, which is a self-published free site that

183
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,600
 you can publish your stuff as an author.

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
 It's a really good website.

185
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,440
 I don't read much stuff there because again, the gender and the age range really isn't

186
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
 for me.

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,960
 It's really for young women.

188
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,560
 A lot of the stuff is like Twilight fan fiction.

189
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,160
 But anyway, so the earliest mention I could find of this was in July 2018, there was a

190
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,320
 short horror story called I bought a mystery box off the dark web.

191
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,480
 So what did the story is?

192
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,760
 Is that the character in the story buys a mystery box off the internet and in it is

193
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,920
 some photos.

194
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
 There's a bag of Xanax and it has a little note saying, "You'll need these.

195
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
 Trust me."

196
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,800
 And she begins kind of going through the photos and what the photos are are basically of her

197
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
 neighborhood.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,520
 And she's kind of freaking out because she put the order in and then like a week or

199
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,720
 two passed or whatever.

200
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
 She sees some photos and they have dates on them.

201
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
 And then she sees a photo of the house and she's like, "Wait, that's my house."

202
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,040
 She sees a photo of her kitchen.

203
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,480
 And then she's seen like a photo of her sleeping.

204
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,040
 She's showing just all these creepy photos.

205
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,360
 And then the note that said, "Trust me, you'll need these with Xanax."

206
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,040
 She flips it over and it has the next day's date.

207
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
 She's like, "Oh my God, what am I going to do?"

208
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,840
 You know, I mean, it was a good story.

209
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,000
 It's a good idea.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It's creepy.

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,040
 And to show that it's a good idea, it launched this trend.

212
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,520
 Rachel Nilsson is the author of this.

213
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,520
 Now this story on Wattpad only has 98 views.

214
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,360
 Yeah, 98 views.

215
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,600
 But it was reposted to Reddit's forum, NoSleep, which is a collection of short horror stories.

216
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,880
 I go there very often.

217
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
 I'm subscribed to that.

218
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
 I check them out.

219
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,560
 And I don't know if she posted it on Reddit or if someone stole it from her.

220
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,520
 But I think that's where it took off was on Reddit, not necessarily here.

221
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,640
 But this is the earliest version of the deep web box, or the dark web box, however you

222
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
 want to call it.

223
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,440
 There is a video from December 2017 that I saw too called Unboxing a Deep Web Credit

224
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
 Card.

225
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,480
 It's just a video of a guy opening up a letter that has a credit card in it.

226
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,960
 So we had that in December 2017 and then this story in July of this year.

227
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
 And now we have this big thing.

228
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
 No one's doing it.

229
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
 No one's doing it.

230
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,480
 I'm not saying there's not mystery boxes on the deep web.

231
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,600
 There's mystery boxes you can buy on eBay.

232
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,320
 But these YouTubers aren't buying them.

233
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,560
 They're getting a bunch of creepy stuff and they're putting it in a box and they're sealing

234
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
 it.

235
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,120
 I mean, and whatever, dude, it's clickbait.

236
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,480
 Like there's so much stuff on YouTube that is just fake clickbait stuff.

237
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,480
 Anyways, all the Gold Digger videos are fake.

238
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,680
 So I mean, they're just following the trend.

239
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,320
 You know, kids watch it.

240
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,600
 And kids are like, oh my God, that's so spooky.

241
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,600
 Mom, dad, can I borrow $10,000 to buy a box on deep web?

242
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,160
 So again, like, they're out there.

243
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,680
 These YouTubers, the things that are unboxing aren't them.

244
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,400
 I don't recommend really buying anything from the deep web because you're going to get

245
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
 scammed.

246
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,200
 The chances of someone sending you the proof of their murder is incredibly unlikely.

247
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,720
 The chances of you losing $250 is extremely likely.

248
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
 So how are they doing it?

249
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,000
 These kids have bitcoins or something like that?

250
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,280
 So but yeah, all the news articles I've read about this, when I was researching this was

251
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,880
 like, it's a dangerous new trend.

252
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,160
 Kids are buying deep web boxes and they don't know if they're going to get bottles of acid

253
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,600
 or drugs or aborted fetuses.

254
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
 It could be all three.

255
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,520
 And the articles are taking it seriously because it's clickbait for them.

256
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,000
 I clicked on all those articles.

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Other people are clicking on those articles.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,280
 Parents watch out for new trend.

259
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,600
 It's not happening.

260
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,080
 It's really not happening.

261
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,600
 People probably have bought these boxes, but it would be garbage if there's anything in

262
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
 there.

263
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,960
 Again, no one's going to send you the soiled panties of their 18th victim to Judy in Charlottesville.

264
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,840
 It's just ridiculous.

265
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,240
 But it makes for good YouTube, so you'll continue to see that stuff.

266
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
 We're going to go ahead and move on to our next story.

267
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,400
 Now, the episode that was supposed to come out Friday is done.

268
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
 It's absolutely done.

269
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,200
 I sat on it though because what happened?

270
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,520
 It's a good episode.

271
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,480
 I really like that episode.

272
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,120
 And I'm going to release it tomorrow, so it will get released.

273
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,200
 But I wanted to do this one first.

274
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,400
 So what happened was I had gotten communications from a couple different people.

275
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,760
 Veronica was like, "Hey, are you doing the story about this?

276
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,040
 I shouldn't make this sound like that."

277
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,240
 Veronica said, "Jason, are you going to do the story about the solar observatory being

278
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
 shut down?"

279
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,040
 And my friend Mitcham was like, "Hey, you know, have you seen this?"

280
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
 Like they shut down.

281
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,560
 Mitcham was actually the first one to got a hold of me.

282
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,960
 He was like, "Hey, have you seen this?

283
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,600
 They're shutting down this solar observatory."

284
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,840
 No one knows why.

285
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,040
 And I'd seen it on 4chan.

286
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
 I blew it off.

287
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,520
 I was like, "It's not a big deal.

288
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,680
 I just kind of, you know, what's going on with the solar observatory right a bit."

289
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,120
 I was like, "That's nothing."

290
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,320
 And Mitcham was like, "Yeah, yeah, you know, this is going on."

291
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,760
 So I kind of went back and took another look at it.

292
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,680
 I did start looking at it and I'm like, "Okay, there might be something here."

293
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,360
 And then I come home from work and there's probably seemed incredibly minor to you.

294
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,120
 But again, I have a slight paranoid streak.

295
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,440
 I come home from work and there's a note in my mailbox saying, "You have a certified

296
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
 letter.

297
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,000
 You need to come pick it up or, you know, we'll read the liver on such and such date

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 or whatever like that."

299
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,560
 And I'm thinking, "Who the hell has sent me certified letters?"

300
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,760
 And I go, "It's either one of two things.

301
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,480
 It's either some birthday money that somebody doesn't want to get lost.

302
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,040
 My birthday's coming up in about two weeks."

303
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,400
 Or I'm getting sued again.

304
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,120
 It's one of those two.

305
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,160
 And so I'm like, "What?"

306
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,680
 And I start, I'm like, "It could be..."

307
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,080
 And those are the two main ones, but I'm thinking it could be something else.

308
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
 It could be something else.

309
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
 I started to get concerned.

310
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,960
 I'm like, "Because as much as I talk about myself personally on the show, I go, "I don't

311
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,440
 give out my personal email."

312
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,920
 My mind kept going back to the podcast.

313
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,880
 I'm like, "I don't give out my personal address on the show, but it wouldn't be difficult

314
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,840
 for anyone with any sort of skill to find out."

315
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
 So I went down to the post office.

316
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,440
 I said, "Hey, can I pick this up?"

317
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,520
 He said, "No, it's a little too early.

318
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,960
 You have to wait because it was a Friday."

319
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,520
 You know, the mail truck's moving around, stuff like that.

320
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,020
 You have to wait until Monday.

321
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,800
 And I go, "Can you guys at least tell me who it's from?"

322
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 Or like, "What it is?"

323
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,360
 And they're like, "We can tell you it's a letter, but we don't know anything else

324
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 than that."

325
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,760
 And I'm like, "Oh, okay."

326
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,360
 The reason why that prompted me to not release that episode was because a lot of people are

327
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,400
 talking about the solar observatory being shut down.

328
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,560
 And what they forget is the post office in the town was also shut down.

329
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,080
 So I'm thinking, "Did someone try to send me a letter from there?"

330
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,720
 And again, you're like, "Jason, come on.

331
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 That's ridiculous."

332
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,600
 But let me explain why.

333
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,000
 There's basically just a few reasons why this solar observatory was shut down, or this

334
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,440
 area was shut down.

335
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,400
 One, it's absolutely nothing that's been blown out of proportion to the media.

336
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,840
 It's possible there were no FBI or Black Hawk helicopters or anything like that.

337
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,480
 It's just a solar observatory got shut down and the media blew it out of proportion like

338
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
 they always do.

339
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,600
 That's one option.

340
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,240
 One option is there's some sort of contaminant spill.

341
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,080
 There's some sort of mercury in the area.

342
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,280
 There's some sort of radioactivity in the area.

343
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,920
 There is just something going on that they needed to shut down.

344
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,880
 That one I'm a little suspicious of because if it was just a chemical problem, you wouldn't

345
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
 necessarily...

346
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,200
 Let's assume that the FBI has been there.

347
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,760
 I've heard that there were Black Hawk helicopters there, and we're going to table that for a

348
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
 second.

349
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,760
 Let's assume that the FBI actually physically was there.

350
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,560
 They wouldn't really investigate a mercury poisoning, or they wouldn't investigate any

351
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,600
 toxins in the water or black mold infestation or sentient soil or anything like that.

352
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
 You'd see CDC out there.

353
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,760
 You would see people in biohazard suits that were there to clean up a contaminant.

354
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,600
 There's the other option that there is some sort of a criminal activity going on there

355
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,800
 in that area.

356
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:06,440
 So escaped convict, meth lab, overall drug running operation, arm smuggling operation.

357
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
 This is in New Mexico.

358
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,600
 I'm not saying that all New Mexico people smuggle drugs and make meth, but you know

359
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
 what I mean?

360
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,320
 It's kind of in this wilderness type area.

361
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,840
 It would be a good place to cook.

362
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
 So they could have cut...

363
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
 They said, "You know what?

364
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
 We know someone's in this area.

365
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,760
 We're going to shut down 50 miles.

366
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,400
 You guys just happen to be in it.

367
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,720
 The workers leave, sunspot, solar observatory, people get out of here.

368
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
 FBI's coming in.

369
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,920
 We're going to do all this stuff."

370
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 And that would...

371
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,320
 They would use helicopters, not necessarily in Blackhawks.

372
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,880
 I think that's a bit of an exaggeration, but could be someone doing an operation in

373
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,200
 the solar observatory that's criminal or in the post office that's criminal and they're

374
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,800
 doing their investigation.

375
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,400
 Generally in that case, they wouldn't evacuate the people if they're trying to investigate

376
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,880
 those people, but if there was a dangerous criminal on the loose or some big operation

377
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,080
 out there, there's the option.

378
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,320
 People have said that the solar observatory detected a magnetic storm, detected alien

379
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,080
 spacecraft, whatever it is.

380
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,320
 I've heard stories that multiple observatories across the planet were shutting down.

381
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,120
 There was four of them and that story's been debunked.

382
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
 That story's not true.

383
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,080
 So really only the sunspot, solar observatory in New Mexico that we know of has been shut

384
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
 down.

385
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,320
 We don't know what.

386
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:30,960
 But I had another theory, a very ego-driven/paranoid theory, more paranoid than ego-driven, if

387
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,920
 I have to be honest.

388
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,280
 Golf rumors.

389
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,320
 When I did the episode on golf rumors, we covered them.

390
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,200
 We're saying some people thought it was the same worshipping group.

391
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,800
 Other people thought it was the psychic camera thing.

392
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,560
 And my suggestion was it's related to the golf, the global oscillations at low frequency

393
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,640
 device or instrument on the SOHO satellite, which is the solar observatory healistic object

394
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,040
 or something like that.

395
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,760
 It's a satellite in space that is just detecting issues with the sun.

396
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,560
 And the golf instrument is able to penetrate the sun, or not penetrate the sun, but it

397
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,400
 is able to read inside the sun and it can figure out all this stuff.

398
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,560
 And I said, I think that golf rumors is part of this.

399
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,000
 I think that the rumors are things that have been spread around in these observatories where

400
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,680
 they have detected things with the golf instrument and they've talked to each other and they

401
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,200
 have tried to say, there's something going on with the sun or near the sun or something

402
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
 like that.

403
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
 And that's the rumor, not necessarily that it's true, but the readings coming back from

404
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,760
 the golf instrument are not what people expected.

405
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,120
 So that was my suggestion for what golf rumors was.

406
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:48,400
 I thought, what if someone mailed something and see, and this is a thing, if someone in

407
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,400
 the observatory used the post office to mail me something regarding that and they tracked

408
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,640
 it to that observatory.

409
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,320
 What if that episode on golf rumors, which again was always said, use extreme caution,

410
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:10,440
 don't research, and me just blathering about it on a podcast and some guy heard it in New

411
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,280
 Mexico or Gal, you know, and goes, oh, he knows, he knows the truth.

412
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,520
 I tried a letter dropping in the mail, FBI descends on the solar observatory.

413
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
 Shut it down.

414
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,800
 We got investigated.

415
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,640
 So I held off on that episode that had nothing to do with golf rumors or the solar observatory,

416
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,520
 but I go, you know what, if the FBI is going to come knocking at my door, you know, let's

417
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,720
 just take a breather.

418
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,200
 So here's what happened.

419
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,520
 Saturday they read, I signed the little slip on the note.

420
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,200
 Saturday they redelivered the letter to me, the certified letter.

421
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,960
 I opened it up.

422
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,600
 I owe the state of Oregon $70 for past tax dues.

423
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,560
 Okay, fair enough.

424
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,040
 Not getting sued.

425
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
 That's good.

426
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,160
 Wasn't some birthday money.

427
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
 That's sad.

428
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
 But it's $70.

429
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,320
 It wasn't someone mailing it out from the solar observatory.

430
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 However, I still think that's what, not me, forget me.

431
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,080
 I think that it's not a chemical contamination because the FBI necessarily wouldn't investigate

432
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,360
 that.

433
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,320
 The criminal activity there, I don't see the FBI needing to shut down because FBI has

434
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,600
 gone into urban areas, all sorts of areas, and they're not like, they're not like, shut

435
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,000
 this hotel down, Arby's, close for the winter, you guys, get out of here.

436
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,280
 We got to stop a crime.

437
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,880
 Like that's just not the way the FBI works.

438
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,040
 My suggestion, what I think happened, and I think that I was on the wrong endpoint, but

439
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,600
 what I think happened was someone at that observatory was doing something and they were

440
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,160
 mailing stuff out of that office, whatever it was, ricin or anthrax or secured documents

441
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,600
 or anything like that.

442
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
 And they did.

443
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,760
 They said, you know what, everyone clear out because we know all of your names.

444
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,080
 They'll probably know all of the people who work there and they're watching them, but they

445
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,360
 want to see what information is coming out of that area from that observatory to that

446
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
 post office.

447
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,360
 That's what I think happened.

448
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:18,040
 I think it's a criminal matter, maybe a terrorist or espionage matter, but I don't think that

449
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:25,360
 it's aliens or Bigfoot or solar flares or golf rumors, maybe golf rumors, but I don't

450
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,960
 think that it's anything super 40 and I don't think it's anything super weird.

451
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,160
 The thing is, is that, and the thing that's a little frustrating is that we're never going

452
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,760
 to know and no one's ever going to trust it.

453
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,520
 If the FBI clears out and the observatory opens again, oh, I have another theory too,

454
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,280
 but if the FBI leaves and the solar observatory opens again and they go, it was just, we had

455
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,520
 a leak in our lines and the FBI wanted to check it out.

456
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,520
 And or if they're like, oh, no, no, you know, it was totally legit.

457
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,720
 We had a leak in our lines or there was some mercury in the water or no one's going to

458
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,880
 believe it.

459
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,680
 If the FBI is like, oh yeah, there's a dangerous area, a dangerous criminal in the area and

460
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,720
 so on and so on, no one's going to believe them.

461
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,960
 This theory is going to be running around for the next five years.

462
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,200
 People are going to be like, well, you know, they shut down that observatory.

463
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,760
 And then with the golf rumors thing, which I do now, the more I think about it, I think

464
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,400
 that is the most logical answer to what golf rumors really is, is that it refers to the

465
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,680
 golf instrument.

466
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,400
 They're not the observatory that that information is fed into.

467
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,600
 I had to look that up.

468
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,200
 That information, I believe, is fed into a observatory or a computer system on the East

469
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,600
 Coast, not a New Mexico.

470
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,000
 I mean, is it possible that they did, that maybe that was the source of the golf rumors?

471
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,480
 They got that instrumentate, they got that information and they were leaking it out.

472
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,600
 I mean, it's possible like .001% possible.

473
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,360
 They didn't mail me.

474
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
 Thank God.

475
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,880
 I don't want the FBI banging on my door.

476
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,960
 I also have another theory.

477
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,200
 I think it was probably something super minor and now it's a publicity stunt.

478
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
 The observatory is open to the public.

479
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,320
 You know when they reopen, they're going to be mobbed by people and it's just like,

480
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,040
 oh, it's just a learning opportunity.

481
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,440
 They never fuss up to that.

482
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
 They never admit that.

483
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,920
 But it, you know, did you ever know this observatory existed?

484
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,480
 I'm sure people in the area were vaguely aware of it.

485
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,040
 And after this happens, there are going to get so many people going up there.

486
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,920
 So you know, it's possible that it was a minor thing and they just said, you know, well,

487
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,760
 let's say shut a couple more days.

488
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,560
 It could have been two FBI agents walked up there and they said, you know what, can you

489
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
 guys shut this down?

490
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
 We're going to run a train.

491
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
 Oh, I didn't even think about that.

492
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,120
 Maybe they're just running training exercises up there and they don't want people to know

493
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
 that.

494
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,760
 You know what?

495
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,440
 That's I bet you anything.

496
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
 That's it.

497
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,480
 I bet you anything.

498
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,560
 The FBI ran training exercises up there.

499
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,600
 When my dad was a minister, we had a church and this local SWAT team asked, Hey, can we

500
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,480
 run a training exercise in your church?

501
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,840
 My dad's like, Oh yeah, dude, that's totally awesome.

502
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
 Go ahead.

503
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,040
 And we didn't, we weren't, no one is able to go to church that day.

504
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,120
 It was a Tuesday, so it wasn't a whole horrible loss.

505
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,640
 But you know what I mean?

506
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,880
 Like they don't want you video.

507
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,560
 They would clear that's what it is, dude.

508
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,680
 It's a training exercise.

509
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,200
 And the FBI wanted it.

510
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,700
 Yeah.

511
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,240
 That's the answer to that.

512
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,600
 I'll bet you money.

513
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,320
 FBI was running a, like a building to building, like, because it's a perfect area.

514
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,160
 The observatories oddly shaped like any, that's why the church worked because it's such a

515
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,040
 weird configuration.

516
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,960
 The SWAT, you know, if you go into an office building, they're all kind of laid out the

517
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
 same, but churches have weird architecture and weird corners.

518
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,960
 It's not necessarily about functionality.

519
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
 It's about form.

520
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,720
 So the SWAT team could like learn weird maneuvers in there.

521
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,480
 Learn how to maneuver in non-normal or non-traditional environments.

522
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,440
 Observatory would be great for that as well.

523
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,640
 And you would have the post office there, which would give them like, that would be

524
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,800
 where they'd set up.

525
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,560
 And then they could go into the wilderness and practice stuff as well.

526
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,440
 I almost guarantee you that's what that is.

527
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,240
 It's a training exercise.

528
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,880
 Damn.

529
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 You know what?

530
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,760
 I could have started off with that and saved everyone 10 minutes.

531
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,800
 Hey, it's not about the destination.

532
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,600
 It's about the journey sometimes.

533
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
 Yeah.

534
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
 And we'll end again.

535
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,920
 They'll never admit it because what'll happen is they'll want to do it again.

536
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,680
 They'll want to do it again in another location and then people will go out there and they'll

537
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,760
 be flying drones over it and stuff like that.

538
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,720
 They're just going to go do these training exercises and I'll bet you money that's what

539
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,440
 it is.

540
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,480
 Golf rumors?

541
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
 Probably not.

542
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
 I still really like that episode.

543
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,240
 I think that was one of my funnest episodes to research.

544
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,160
 And that is the Solar Observatory story.

545
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,560
 Oh, and I want to say, I want to say right now that today.

546
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,160
 I got a YouTube comment from Ryan ML88.

547
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,480
 And they're like, do you think that the Solar Observatory closure could be due to your golf

548
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,560
 rumors episode?

549
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,560
 And I was like, spoiler alert, dude, I've been prepping that.

550
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,720
 We're going to go with this angle.

551
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,840
 We're going to, I'm going to research this and stuff like that.

552
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,040
 It's like nine in the morning.

553
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,440
 He's like, hey, everyone, this is what Jason's next episode is about.

554
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,080
 But no, Ryan, good looking out because yeah, I didn't respond because I wanted to get this

555
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,520
 episode out, but I'll respond to your YouTube comment now.

556
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,680
 Yeah, that was kind of the angle I was looking at for a while and it's petered out.

557
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,240
 But again, I appreciate that people are listening to the episodes and enjoying the episodes.

558
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,440
 And it means a lot to me.

559
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
 And I read all your comments.

560
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
 I think you guys have seen that.

561
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
 I read all your comments.

562
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,640
 I get back to you guys and a couple of the upcoming stories we're going to do our stories

563
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,440
 to that were emailed to me by a couple of you.

564
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,320
 Hero, Clovis, we're going to do that.

565
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,440
 We're going to do Heliocentrism.

566
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,960
 That's coming up in a couple of weeks, but Hero, Glovis, I think is this week.

567
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
 It's weird.

568
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,600
 Just people take photos of weird cult stuff they find around their city or, you know,

569
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,040
 flyers that are posted up around their college campuses and they're like, hey, Jason, do

570
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,200
 a story on this and they'll take a picture of some cult like meet us up and light candles

571
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,960
 and I love all that stuff.

572
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,840
