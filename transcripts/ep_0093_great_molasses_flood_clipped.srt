1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
 Can a mysterious voicemail help solve the murder of a young man?

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,360
 Was there a movie that was so dangerous the FBI destroyed all known copies of it?

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,660
 And the most important question of the week?

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,120
 Can you outrun molasses today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:27,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,680
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,120
 This is another one of those episodes where you have a lot of stuff to cover.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
 A lot of good stuff. A lot of gold, I think.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,240
 So we're just gonna go ahead and jump right into it.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,520
 Now, so the first story we're gonna talk about is another little murder mystery.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,360
 The last one that I did about Jonathan Luna that got a lot of positive results.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,200
 I actually like murder mysteries more than the gruesome true crime stuff.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,280
 So you'll probably, we'll probably start seeing some more murder mystery stuff on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,720
 So this one is the death of Henry McCabe.

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,720
 Now this happened in 2015, so very, very recent.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,360
 He was 32 years old. He had separated from his wife not too long before his death, unfortunately.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,240
 And so he was having a hard time at work.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,560
 He was having a hard time just in his personal life in general.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,720
 He went out with a couple friends to go drinking.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,920
 And what happens is at the end of the night, his one friend William Kennedy,

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,040
 Henry's like, "Hey man, just, I don't know, just drop me off of this gas station."

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
 Probably maybe he wanted to buy more liquor.

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,840
 But it's like two in the morning, his buddy drives him to,

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,080
 because his buddy wasn't totally sloshed.

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,240
 This guy was super drunk, Henry.

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,720
 Henry gets dropped off at gas station at two in the morning.

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
 Disappears. They don't know what happened to him.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,360
 Now, two months later, his body is found in a lake four miles away from the gas station.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
 They had already been looking for him and they had already been trying to investigate.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,800
 And they were talking to William Kennedy.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,480
 They were talking to his wife that he'd recently separated from.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,520
 And they had some clues to go off of, but it wasn't until they found the body,

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,760
 because you know, they could have thought, well, maybe he just ran away.

35
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,920
 They were investigating it as a suspicious missing person,

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,880
 because they were like, this guy's basically at that point was too drunk to run away.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,560
 But anyway, so after two months had passed, they do find his body.

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,560
 He had no, reportedly had no cuts or wounds to him.

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,360
 He drowned.

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,680
 The area by the lake was densely wooded.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,200
 And that was another suspicious thing.

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,960
 Like how does a drunk guy one walk four miles from the gas station?

43
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,000
 Well, I guess a drunk guy can walk four miles from the gas station to a lake.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
 But apparently this area, Rush Lake.

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,960
 Okay. And I should have said this earlier.

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,640
 This takes place in Minnesota.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,360
 So this is Rush Lake in Minnesota.

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,040
 That mounds view, this, the city of mounds view, Minnesota.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,080
 So anyways, they find his body, drowned, no cuts or wounds.

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
 The friend says, ends up saying, I, okay, okay, I did drop him off at a gas station,

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
 but I told you the wrong gas station.

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,000
 I actually dropped him off at this other gas station.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,240
 So it was closer to the lake, which is a weird detail of it.

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,240
 Now, obviously William Kennedy was a suspect for quite a while.

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,640
 The police had suspects at this point.

56
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
 They've kind of ruled him out.

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,160
 So the other friend who was with them, he had Henry McCabe's wallet on him when the police talked to him.

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,800
 And so he was a suspect and the friend was like, oh, no, no, no, I took his wallet

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,320
 so he couldn't buy more drinks.

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,080
 So that's actually interesting because why was he dropped?

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,880
 Then definitely why was he dropped off at the gas station?

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,880
 Maybe he thought he had his wallet on him.

63
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,960
 But the case is only about three years old.

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,320
 There have been no arrests made.

65
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
 He's just dead.

66
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,440
 Now you're like, Jason, that's kind of mysterious, but that's not like

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,600
 dead rabbit radio mysterious.

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,080
 Like that's just like a guy died and no one knows why.

69
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:04,160
 Well, when the police, again, the reason why the police were investigating it more as a suspicious

70
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:12,240
 missing person case was because the night of his disappearance, he called up his estranged wife.

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,640
 But the recording is pretty chilling.

72
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,480
 The voicemail is creepy.

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,960
 There have been speculation that there is a gunshot heard during the voicemail, which I didn't really hear.

74
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,600
 And at the end of the voicemail, apparently someone says, someone, someone says, stop it.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,320
 They don't know if it's Henry McCabe or somebody else there.

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,080
 We hear like a growling or like some sort of animal noise, which is,

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
 which that's the creepiest part of it.

78
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,440
 Now it's possible that he was so drunk he was mumbling, but the noises don't necessarily

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,760
 sound like it's trying to say anything.

80
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,280
 It just sounds like it's some sort of beast.

81
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,800
 It's possible that he or his phone or both are falling and it's kind of like going through the

82
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
 grass and that's possible.

83
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,320
 Could have been an animal after him.

84
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
 Could have been like,

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,400
 I mean, let's be honest, it sounds like a monster.

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,480
 It sounds like a monster.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,480
 Now I'm not saying 100%, it is a monster, but it sounds like a monster.

88
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:28,320
 It sounds like he was trying to get away from something and dialed his wife.

89
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,760
 And this is basically getting his last words.

90
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,520
 It's possible that he first was called his wife and then this incident happened.

91
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,080
 It's possible he was calling his wife because he knew that he wasn't going to make it out of this

92
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
 situation alive.

93
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,680
 It's possible that he called his wife and fell down a hill, but we don't know.

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
 We just don't know.

95
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
 That's the mystery.

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
 That's that's the creepy part of it.

97
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,040
 A young man passing away, being drunk, his life kind of falling apart and then drowning.

98
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
 That's just sad.

99
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,720
 This is still sad.

100
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,920
 It's still sad because he died and all that stuff did happen.

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,560
 He was having a hard time with his life, but what was going on with that voicemail?

102
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,920
 Now, I will say this as a skeptic, the one thing that concerns me about this story,

103
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,000
 there is no other copy of this voicemail that I could find online except for this news report.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,040
 Normally, when we get weird voicemails, people like there'll be news reports on the weird

105
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,280
 voicemails or on the weird recordings, and then you can also find the raw recording yourself

106
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
 somewhere on YouTube or somewhere online.

107
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,640
 This recording was only broadcast on this show.

108
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,160
 It's never been released to the public.

109
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,040
 So I find that a little suspicious, not saying that it's completely fake,

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,920
 but there could be stuff before or after the voicemail we hear on the news report

111
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,800
 that totally explains it, where he's like, "Hey, honey, I really love you.

112
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,080
 I'm falling down a hill."

113
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
 And they cut that part out.

114
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,360
 So I am a little skeptical that the only and when I'm looking online for it, other people

115
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,160
 are saying, "Hey, has anyone ever found the raw audio?

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
 Like, has anyone have the audio that wasn't broadcast?

117
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
 It doesn't have the announcer talking in it."

118
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,680
 So I'm a little skeptical, but that aside, creepy, walking down the street alone at night

119
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,360
 in an area that's densely wooded and hearing that, whatever was making that noise,

120
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,200
 hearing that behind you, screw drowning, I would just die of a heart attack.

121
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,240
 Okay, so the next story we're going to talk about is...

122
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,600
 This was weird because, you know, I've talked before, I'm a big fan of rap,

123
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,240
 and I'm a big fan of gangster rap in particular, but I'm also a fan of political rap.

124
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,640
 Public Enemy, Paris, Ice Cube, and then Rage Against the Machine is also very political,

125
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,560
 but you know, they're like a rap rock group.

126
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
 I know that they probably don't like that designation, but I was listening to all that music growing up,

127
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,280
 and it was interesting because I had never heard any of these groups.

128
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,600
 I could be wrong on this, but I could never hear any of these groups

129
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,960
 mention this book.

130
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,920
 This book that seems, would seem to be so inspirational to these movements,

131
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,640
 to like Black identity politics or Black nationalism or things like that.

132
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,400
 There was a book that came out in 1969, and a movie that came out in 1973,

133
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
 and it pretty much just disappeared.

134
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,600
 The movie literally disappeared, but the book just seemed to fade out of consciousness,

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,640
 and there's been allegations that it was the FBI who destroyed the movie,

136
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,800
 destroyed the negatives for the film itself,

137
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,120
 and suppressed book publishers and bookstores from carrying this book.

138
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,560
 That allegations been made by several people in the media and by the people involved in the book

139
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,520
 and the movies as well.

140
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,000
 The book is called The Spook Who Sat by the Door.

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,960
 Now, spook is a racial slur towards Black people.

142
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,120
 It's like an old, that's like an old school racial slur in the South.

143
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,760
 You're a spook.

144
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,280
 The spook is also a slang term for spy.

145
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,680
 And what the book is, it's about a young Black man named Dan Freeman,

146
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,280
 who during, so this senator is up for reelection,

147
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,680
 and the book takes place like in the 60s and the 70s as well.

148
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,040
 The senator is up for reelection, and his wife says,

149
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,640
 "You know what, we need the Black vote, so why don't you, I don't know,

150
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,400
 say the CIA is racist because they don't have any Black members?"

151
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,480
 Senators like, "That's a great idea."

152
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,840
 So the senator accuses the CIA of being racist, so he wins reelection, he gets the Black vote,

153
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,640
 and the CIA goes, "Okay, that made us look real embarrassing.

154
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
 Let's get us a Black guy.

155
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
 Just one, we'll even need one."

156
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
 We'll hire him, then they can't say that we're racist anymore.

157
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,280
 So they get, and the book is from the point of view of Dan Freeman.

158
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,360
 He's a vet of the Korean War.

159
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,880
 He's one of seven applicants to apply for the CIA.

160
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,600
 Dan Freeman is looking at these other six dudes,

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,760
 and he's like, "These are like the laziest, dumbest dudes possible.

162
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,200
 But I'm gonna be cool, I'm not gonna, you know, get all uppity for the white man.

163
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,480
 I'm gonna play the role, and I'm gonna get this job at the CIA."

164
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,640
 And so they go through the training procedures where they show them how to fight,

165
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,600
 and show them how to build bombs, and shooting, and all that stuff.

166
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,280
 So Dan Freeman gets the job, they put him in his name,

167
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,800
 the section chief of the top secret reproduction center.

168
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
 So he makes photocopies.

169
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,600
 And what they do is they put him right by the door.

170
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,880
 He has a desk that's right in the entrance of the CIA.

171
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,320
 So everyone who walks in, they'll turn in the look,

172
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,840
 and they'll see a black guy there, and they'll be like, "Oh, that's progressive."

173
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,600
 This book was written in the 60s.

174
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,800
 I have to, I mean, they stuff like this still goes on today.

175
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,360
 But anyway, so he sits by the door, he's the spook who sat by the door.

176
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,240
 And the visitors walk in, and they go, "Hey, look it, that's awesome.

177
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,680
 You guys got one. My company needs one."

178
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
 Now, you're like, "That's not very dangerous.

179
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,640
 That's kind of just a story of racism,

180
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
 and how people use each other, and things like that.

181
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,080
 Tokens, and stuff like that."

182
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,520
 Well, what happens, and that's the first part,

183
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,720
 Dan Freeman spends his time kind of, you know,

184
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,720
 getting trained more, fighting, and building bombs, and stuff like that.

185
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,320
 And then after about five years, he's like, "Okay, you know, that was a good thing.

186
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,960
 I'm going to go back to the city of Chicago and do social work.

187
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,320
 I want to work with the gangs in Chicago,

188
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,120
 and teach them how to be better citizens."

189
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,480
 And they're like, "Oh, that's a great idea."

190
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,280
 And he goes back to Chicago to do social work.

191
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,080
 He finds the street gang called the Cobras,

192
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,720
 and it's like, "You guys are wasting your time selling drugs and doing stuff like that.

193
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
 I know how to turn you into a revolutionary army.

194
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,240
 I've been trained by the CIA for years.

195
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,840
 I know all of their tactics.

196
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,640
 Let's take over America."

197
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,640
 And so this dude, the rest of the book,

198
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,400
 is him building this guerrilla army, like training this street gang,

199
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,520
 to take back the city of Chicago, and eventually the rest of the country.

200
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,720
 It's fascinating.

201
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,280
 It's a fascinating novel.

202
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,800
 So they basically engage in guerrilla warfare.

203
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,160
 They start taking over radio stations and broadcasting their message to

204
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,240
 the poor people in Chicago that, you know, we're the ones on your side.

205
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
 We're going to help take this city back.

206
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,840
 We've been stepped on a long time.

207
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,680
 The book is interesting because it talks a lot about not being a victim.

208
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
 The book isn't about, "Oh, woe is me.

209
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,320
 I've been subjugated forever."

210
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,520
 The book is about not being a victim.

211
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,280
 Now, Sam Greenlee, the author of the book,

212
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,560
 has said, "Listen, I'm not telling people that they need to go out and start shooting cops.

213
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,840
 What I'm trying to get people to do is to be proactive

214
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,960
 and not just sit there and complain all the time."

215
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,680
 He had this quote.

216
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,240
 He said, "One of the things I was trying to say with that book is that gangs could become

217
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
 the protectors of the community rather than the predators.

218
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,920
 And that the purpose of the film was to encourage blacks to create an action plan

219
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,000
 to survive in the belly of the beast rather than always reacting as victims of a racist society."

220
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,560
 So he did believe that society was racist in general,

221
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,680
 but to just sit there and be like, "Oh, no, I'm a victim," he's like, "No, figure out a way

222
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,360
 to work together, quit praying on each other, and survive all this stuff."

223
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
 Now, so I recommend reading the book.

224
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,200
 The movie was good, but it wasn't as good as the book.

225
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,840
 It has the limitations of a book that's this dense, that has this many ideas

226
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,000
 and it being translated to an hour and a half long film.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,440
 The book itself is actually quite slim, but I do recommend reading the book.

228
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,680
 I think it's an interesting look at black culture at the time

229
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,880
 and an interesting book about like building a guerrilla army.

230
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,800
 So obviously from that description of the book, you can see why the FBI would be concerned.

231
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,360
 Now, the FBI, I think it's so funny because nowadays people are like,

232
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,400
 "How dare you disparage the name of the FBI?"

233
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,120
 You're saying that they're deep state operatives.

234
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,920
 The FBI, listen, man, I love Mulder and Scully as much as the next person,

235
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,760
 but they've done some messed up stuff to Americans.

236
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,040
 The FBI in 1969, the same year this book was published,

237
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,960
 they wanted to take down the Black Panthers.

238
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,120
 They went to the Black Panthers and they said, "Look at this coloring book.

239
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,600
 We should put this coloring book out."

240
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,840
 I mean, obviously it was like an undercover operative.

241
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,400
 Went to the Black Panthers and was like, "Look at this coloring book I made.

242
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,600
 We should release this."

243
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,960
 It's like drawings of kids shooting cops that look like pigs.

244
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,240
 Black Panthers like, "We're not releasing this."

245
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,840
 And the undercover agent was like, "Oh, okay, sorry, it's just an idea."

246
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,320
 The FBI then mailed copies of this coloring book out across America and basically said,

247
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,480
 "Hi, this is a letter from the Black Panthers."

248
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,080
 And people opened it up and it was a coloring book for their kids of kids shooting cops.

249
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,200
 Absolutely insane.

250
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,720
 And that helped diminish the Black Panthers reach.

251
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,120
 Because if you got that, you'd be like, "I don't want to listen to these guys.

252
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,960
 These guys are total lunatics."

253
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:25,680
 So the FBI has done some pretty shady stuff and this book came out and the author was like,

254
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,520
 "Listen, I had a really hard time getting it published.

255
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,360
 Book publishers were being warned not to do it and things like that."

256
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,760
 Now, that was much easier than getting the film made.

257
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:44,720
 Because when the film got made, they had an even harder time landing like distribution and theaters.

258
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
 Sam Greenlee said in an interview, I'm paraphrasing here, but he said,

259
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,960
 "The FBI was worried about the book but not super worried because blacks don't read.

260
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,560
 But when the movie came out, blacks do go see movies and that made them very, very nervous."

261
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,600
 So the movie got shown for the opening week and actually did quite well.

262
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,640
 This was before the big black spoiltation genre and films really took off.

263
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,360
 But the movie started doing really well and then United Artists who were distributing the movie

264
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
 started getting cold feet about it.

265
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,600
 The conspiracy is this, the FBI began contacting United Artists and individual theaters

266
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 telling them to pull the movie.

267
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
 Telling them the movie's over.

268
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,920
 Then the theaters were, instead of shipping the film reels back to the distributor, which is normal,

269
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,680
 they were destroying the film reels.

270
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:47,280
 So the conspiracy is that the FBI was either ordering, because if you're like a small time

271
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,920
 movie theater and you get a call from the FBI and they're saying, "Hey, don't show that movie and burn

272
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,800
 the reel." You're not going to be like, "Well, actually, I have a contract to send it back to

273
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,480
 United. You're going to burn the reel." Again, especially back in 1969.

274
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,800
 So the conspiracy theory is that the FBI were destroying the films or ordering the films being

275
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,480
 destroyed and they were all burnt. They were all gone. So you still had the book flown around,

276
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,040
 but you didn't have Amazon back then. Unless you went into the right bookstore or knew the

277
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,720
 catalog or a distributor who was selling that book, it was gone.

278
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:27,680
 In 2004, someone was going through a film library and they found a movie reel.

279
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,840
 The negatives, actually, that had a different title on them.

280
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,840
 And when they watched it, it was "The Spook Who Sat by the Door."

281
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,400
 The rumor is, I wasn't able to find any verification on this, but as the reels were getting destroyed,

282
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,760
 they weren't coming back from the individual theaters. Someone had the bright idea to take

283
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,000
 a copy of the negatives and slap a fake name on it in case the FBI came to the distributor to

284
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,360
 destroy the originals there. Now, they most likely did, because again, the director didn't have a

285
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,680
 copy of this movie. The United Artists didn't have a copy of this movie. The last remaining copy of

286
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,160
 "The Spook Who Sat by the Door" had to be filed away under a different name, so it wouldn't be

287
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,920
 destroyed. Someone had the bright idea. It is quite possible that this movie would have just disappeared

288
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,280
 if it said "The Spook Who Sat by the Door" on it. It's now available for free on YouTube,

289
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,080
 or you can buy it on Amazon. Finding the film and turning it into a Blu-ray has gotten more people

290
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,240
 to go back and look at this book. The author, unfortunately, has passed away. Oh, and the

291
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,640
 director of the movie never directed another film. He ended up doing some television. The star of the

292
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,400
 movie never started another movie or never did another movie. There was a movement to crush

293
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,800
 these people involved in this film. So, "The Spook Who Sat by the Door." The fact that the government

294
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:03,280
 could go in and destroy a book and a movie for 20, 30 years until it popped back up makes you wonder

295
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,080
 how many other books and movies have come out that some guy wrote a book and released it at

296
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,360
 his local bookstores in Minnesota and every copy has been destroyed. It just was too much

297
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:25,840
 for the political powers to allow out there. How often has this happened, really? How often has

298
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,320
 this happened? I'm sure it's happened a lot in other countries, but it's weird to think that it's

299
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,000
 probably happened quite a few times in America as well. Let's go ahead and move on to our last story.

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,240
 Now, I had heard about this when I was a kid and I thought it was hilarious. The visual of it

301
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,720
 is super funny. I went and I did more research on it now and I had to go look at like death

302
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,080
 totals and stuff like that and it's still kind of funny. I'm sorry to say, but it's still kind of

303
00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:00,400
 funny. So, you may not think so, but let's journey back in time. Let's get in Jason's time taxi.

304
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:09,760
 Copyright. And we're going to drive back into time. We're going to the year 1919. January 15th, 1919,

305
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,680
 in fact, and we're pull up. We hop out of the time taxi. Now, this is a great time to be alive.

306
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,280
 It's before the Great Depression. I think the war is over or it's ending. World War One's ending

307
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,360
 if it's not over already. You're just walking around Boston. You're like, "Yeah, you know,

308
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,120
 it's winter time, so that sucks." But, you know, no big deal. Walking around Boston. Now, they had

309
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:45,280
 this in this city of Boston. They had a giant tank of molasses. Now, it was 50 feet tall and 90

310
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,800
 feet in diameter. It contained 2.3 million gallons of molasses. You're like, "Well, how many

311
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,320
 chocolate bars are they eating in Boston?" And probably a lot. But this was used for like,

312
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:08,160
 molasses can also be used to make rum and ethanol. But the, I think prohibition was going on,

313
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,520
 so they weren't drinking the rum, maybe the ethanol. And then you could use it to manufacture

314
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,880
 munitions. So, it was just sitting there in a, and in the area, they also had like a plant

315
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
 that would process it and all that stuff. So, it wasn't just like sitting there as a landmark,

316
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,040
 like it was actually being used. Now, this giant container of molasses had some serious problems.

317
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,760
 It hadn't been tested properly. I guess you're supposed to test tanks by every so often empty in

318
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,240
 it. You know, get all the molasses out of it, and you fill it full of water and you check for leaks,

319
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,760
 and you're supposed to fill it with water all the way to the top to fill for the pressure of it.

320
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:54,880
 This thing had leaks. It actually had such bad leaks that people in town would be like, "Hey, Jerry,

321
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,160
 you hungry?" And they'd be like, "Yeah, sure. They're like, "Let's go down to the molasses tank."

322
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,760
 And they would walk up to the tank and molasses would just drip out of the sides. They would get

323
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,080
 buckets of free molasses. And then they would just walk, I imagine them like, winning the poo.

324
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,000
 They're like, sticking their hands in the bucket and just like, eating it right out of the,

325
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,280
 eating it right out of the bucket. The people who ran the tank were like, "Oh, man, that looks so

326
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,160
 terrible. Look at all those leaks. We should really fix that." And they fixed it by painting it brown,

327
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,600
 so you couldn't see the leaks anymore. They're like, "That's genius. That is such a great idea."

328
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,920
 That would be like if a doctor like saw a dude stabbed and they're like, "Hmm." They like paint

329
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,240
 you red and they're like, "Well, you're not bleeding anymore." So the thing had issues. Now,

330
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,240
 the coup d'etgres on this tank of molasses was that it was an unseasonably warm day

331
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:57,600
 on January 15th, 1919. Unseasonably warm for that area in January was 40 degrees. That was enough

332
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,320
 to cause a little bit of swelling in this tank. Now, people were hanging out, like I said, just

333
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:11,600
 hanging out. It's 1919. What do you do in 1919? You make dresses maybe and run a wheel down the

334
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,240
 street with a stick? Not Diapolio? I don't know. I don't know what people did in the night. I don't

335
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,920
 even really know what people do nowadays. But anyway, so you just do a normal 1919 stuff,

336
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,280
 your flipping coins and stuff, whatever. But anyway, so they hear

337
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,960
 the sound of like metal starting to give. Now, some of the old timers are probably like,

338
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,840
 "I recognize that sound. Something bad's gonna happen." All of a sudden,

339
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:52,560
 it sounded like machine gun fire as rivets start shooting out of the support columns for this.

340
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,840
 Now, even people who aren't that old know that something bad is about to happen.

341
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:08,560
 Now, again, this thing is 90 feet in diameter and 50 feet tall. It smashes into the ground when it

342
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:21,440
 falls. A wave, a wave of 2.3 million gallons of molasses, a wave 20 feet high of molasses

343
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,120
 begins to engulf the city. People just start booking it. It hits with such force,

344
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,680
 there is a building, its bottom story got demolished and then the other two stories just

345
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,640
 crashed into the wave of molasses. Now, you're thinking, "Dude, molasses is like super slow.

346
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,840
 It would lose a race against syrup." True, but the force that it fell at and the pressure that

347
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:56,560
 it was breaking loose, the wave of molasses was going 35 miles an hour. Cars in 1919 didn't even

348
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:05,200
 go 35 miles an hour. People were running, but there was no escape from this thing. The 25 foot wave

349
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,600
 crest quite quickly, but it doesn't matter because the rest of the city was getting engulfed

350
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,960
 in about 2 to 3 feet of molasses. Now, imagine getting hit by a baseball bat going 35 miles an

351
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,240
 hour, but it's only 2 to 3 feet. So, you're only getting hit in the thighs. You're getting knocked

352
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,560
 down. People were running and they couldn't outrun it and they got knocked down and they're not

353
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,720
 falling in water where they just sit up and go, "That sucked." They're instantly covered in sticky

354
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:41,600
 molasses. A train car, a train car got tipped from the impact of this thing. A half mile of sticky

355
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:50,960
 sweet destruction. Death toll. 21 people and several horses killed. This thing was knocking

356
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,760
 over horses. Now, again, you're thinking, "Okay, yeah, a horse gets knocked down and just gets back

357
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,240
 up." But because of the stickiness, because of the slipperiness, because of the texture of it,

358
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,400
 rescue crews showed up and they said, "Let me find this quote." A rescue crew shows up and this is

359
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:13,200
 what this guy says. "Molasses waist deep, covered the street and swirled and bubbled around the wreckage."

360
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,400
 And again, because houses are obliterated by this surge. So, it's not just a bunch of people like,

361
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,120
 it's not like a little rascals prank where the mayor of the town is like, "Whoa." I mean,

362
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,040
 there is... people were getting killed by the debris. Just flying at them, floating down. It was

363
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,480
 horrible. Back to the quote. "Molasses waist deep, covered the street and swirled and bubbled

364
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,240
 around the wreckage. Here and there struggled to form, whether it was animal or human being,

365
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,360
 was impossible to tell. Only an upheaval, a thrashing about on the sticky mass,

366
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,600
 showed where any life was. Horses died like so many flies on sticky flypaper. The more they

367
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,400
 struggled, the deeper in the mess they were ensnared. Human beings, men and women, suffered likewise."

368
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,320
 So yeah, you're just... you're basically glued to the ground. Forget the fact that it's 40 degrees

369
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,880
 out. Forget the fact that you got knocked over by a force going 35 miles an hour. You're basically

370
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,560
 now glued to the ground. 150 people were injured in this. You're like, "Jason, that's really not

371
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:27,120
 funny." It's kind of... it's kind of funny. Because again, molasses, like... so, yes, people died and

372
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:37,680
 horses died and that's that. But it is funny because for years afterwards, so... okay, so for four years

373
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:45,760
 afterwards, whenever it got hot in that city, in that part of the city, all you would smell was molasses.

374
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,240
 It basically soaked into the landscape. You would be... you'd wake up and you're like, "Oh, man,

375
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,880
 good thing that molasses thing happened 10 years ago. Man, that was scary." And you would just

376
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,520
 smell the molasses everywhere. You'd be like, "Ahh." It's like, imagine if you smelled a 9/11 every

377
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,280
 year. That would be the equivalent of that. That might be an extreme example, but, you know,

378
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,160
 people... okay, so you had people escape who did escape it. Successfully escape it, obviously.

379
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,680
 And they left that area of town. They're like, "Screw you, molasses town. I'm out of here."

380
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:25,440
 Then they tracked molasses all over the rest of Boston and rescue workers who showed up and were

381
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,440
 like working in it. They got molasses all over their shoes, all over their hands, all over their

382
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,040
 pants. They would take the subway home. Molasses track everywhere. It basically got to the point

383
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,080
 where anything that was button pressed was covered in molasses because everyone had molasses.

384
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,440
 All the guardrails when you're walking around had molasses. The whole city got basically

385
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,080
 covered in this stuff. Not literally, but there was just like handprints everywhere.

386
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,800
 And you're saying, "Jason, it's still not funny how much people died." Yes, yes, I get it,

387
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,600
 how much people died. The great molasses disaster. Oh, and then of course the company said,

388
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:08,880
 "No, that tank was in perfect order. Anarchists blew it up because we were trying to use our

389
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,360
 molasses to create munitions and those nasty anarchists, those foreigners over there,

390
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:22,720
 are trying to destroy our way of life." So they blew it up to hurt our country. They actually

391
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,880
 got sued. It was the first class action lawsuit in Massachusetts history and they lost it because

392
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,320
 that was the dumbest excuse possible. They did actually come out and admit that it had failed

393
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,520
 several safety tests. They did try to say the anarchist thing, but again, that didn't fly,

394
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,440
 but it had failed several safety tests and they had to pay a bunch of people a bunch of money.

395
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,560
 And I would also say, part of their punishment would they be able to eat and wear nothing but

396
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,160
 molasses for seven years and they'd have to sleep in a molasses next to a thrashing horse.

397
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,720
 Punishment fits the crime, molasses people. So that is the great molasses disaster. The great

398
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,560
 molasses flood, I guess is the official name. It actually is the official name. That's what it's

399
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,200
 known as. The idea of having, if someone said, "Hey dude, you want to outrun molasses?" I would be

400
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:18,480
 like, "Yeah, totally." I would take that bet in a heartbeat. But again, I mean, then I didn't know

401
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,080
 molasses could go this fast. And actually there was a scientific test because people have debated

402
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,360
 whether or not the molasses was actually moving at that speed. Some kids or some college students

403
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,440
 did a test and they used a model version of the neighborhood in poured caro syrup. And they said,

404
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,560
 it actually, it's probably more scientific than how I'm explaining it. But they did this test

405
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,160
 and they said it is actually quite possible that it was going that fast and caused that much

406
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,520
 devastation. It's not just hearsay that it was knocking buildings off of its foundations. So
