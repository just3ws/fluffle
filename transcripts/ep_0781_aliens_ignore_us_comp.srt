1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
 Families. Everyone has a family, some people have good family, some people have bad families,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,480
 but today we're going to take a look at three cases of very unusual families.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,240
 First off, how would you feel if one of your loved ones came back from the dead, only to

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,600
 set your clothes on fire? Then we meet a man who all he ever wanted was companionship.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:32,720
 Instead, he found vengeance, blood-soaked vengeance. And finally, we ask the question,

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:41,200
 "Do we belong to part of a galactic brotherhood? Is Earth part of a Federation of Space Families?

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,000
 Or are we the intergalactic black sheep today on Dead Rabbit Radio?"

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,640
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. You guys heard

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,400
 the intro, we got a ton of stuff to cover, but first off, one of the most important things

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,600
 is our newest Patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command. Everything's all Thanksgiving-y.

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,760
 We got all these Thanksgiving decorations up, which is just a bunch of turkeys, just a bunch

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,160
 of drawings of turkeys. It's Kinsey. Everyone give a round of applause to Kinsey walking

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,960
 into Dead Rabbit Command. Kinsey, put your hand on that piece of paper and trace that turkey.

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:31,960
 While Kinsey's doing that, just a quick reminder, Thanksgiving, November 25th, 10 a.m. Pacific

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,000
 Standard Time on YouTube. If you go to my YouTube channel, Dead Rabbit Radio, we are doing a live stream.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,640
 So I really hope you guys, those are always a lot of fun. We just kind of chat. You can ask me

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,560
 questions. It's pretty freewheeling. I might juggle. I won't. I won't. I'll just pretend I'll have my

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,480
 back to the camera and do dad jokes the whole time. It will be awesome. It'll be awesome. So I really

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,840
 hope you guys join us for that. And then I also want to say this is going to be the last episode

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,880
 for this week. The live streams take a lot out of me for whatever reason. They actually make me

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,880
 quite nauseous. I haven't been able to figure that out. You'd think it'd be the same thing as

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,720
 recording a podcast, but I think it's because I'm looking at myself. I'm looking at a video of myself.

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,760
 It really makes my stomach, it always has. So when you guys see me doing a live stream,

25
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,320
 as much as I love being with you guys and interacting with you guys, understand that I also

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,480
 get motion sickness and I have not been able to figure that out. I'd like to do more live streaming,

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,160
 but I gotta be honest. I look at it in a lot of YouTubers and a lot of podcasters and they get

28
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,200
 that live stream thing going and they no longer put out like tightly edited content. They'll just

29
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,240
 play Minecraft for three hours. That concerns me. That's honestly one of the reasons why I don't do

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:48,280
 a lot of live streams is I don't, I like the podcast. I like the constructed stories. I don't

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,920
 know why I'm bagging on live stream and I want you guys to join our live stream and I hope you

32
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,360
 guys do. And this will be the last episode for the week and I hope you guys have a great Thanksgiving

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,600
 asking you guys to come to a live stream and then bad mapping live streams. But right now, Kinsey,

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,840
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We got a lot of stuff to cover,

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,720
 so we're leaving behind Dead Ravica, man. We are headed all the way out to Middle Ages France.

36
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:21,400
 The reason why we're headed to Old Timey France is we're about to meet a man, a saint really,

37
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:30,200
 a literal saint named Saint Odileo of Clooney. Now this guy is well known for a couple different

38
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:38,360
 things. One of them was that he led one of the first mass peace movements in world history.

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,040
 The Catholic Church was like, "Oh dude, this sucks. There's just people getting killed all the time.

40
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,600
 People weren't gathering in large groups because they were getting murdered. People weren't going

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,760
 to church because they were getting murdered. It was all that warfare in the Middle Ages. You had

42
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,200
 the fall of the Roman Empire and then it was just chaos. You had armies fighting armies. You had

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,480
 brigands fighting local soldiers. You had city states attacking city states and all these feudal

44
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,040
 chiefs in the Catholic Church was like, "Oh my god, dude, we can't get anything done with all of this

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,520
 brutal, brutal warfare." So they started, there's two things that came together with this. The truce

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:23,480
 of God or limited warfare and the peace of God which meant civilians were off limits. This was

47
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:31,720
 989 AD and they're finally codifying this because if you look at the Bible historically,

48
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,920
 there would just, you constantly have stories about the Israelis wiping entire civilizations

49
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,840
 off the map. It was total warfare. It wasn't just a video game. It was something that societies

50
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,920
 actually used to do to each other. So the Catholic Church spearheaded, no pun intended, the very first

51
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,960
 mass peace movement and Odileo was a big part of that. He also was a big part of pushing this thing

52
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:04,360
 known as All Souls Day which is where you pray for the people lost in purgatory. So in Catholicism,

53
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,320
 let's say me and Julia were walking down the street and we're both killed at the same time. A

54
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,800
 steamroller squishes us. I'm the first person to get squished because I'll tell you right now,

55
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 the only thing worse than getting run over by a steamroller is being the second person run over

56
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,600
 by a steamroller because you see what it does to the other guy's guts. But we both die at the same

57
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,800
 time. She was a good Catholic. She spent most of her life helping the poor and giving a charity and

58
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,840
 praying for people and doing all that stuff. While myself, I was like an okay Catholic, right? But I

59
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,480
 spent a lot of time like playing video games, watching YouTube, really not paying attention to

60
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,760
 stuff. Should we both go to heaven? Yes. But should she go to heaven quicker? Because she was a good

61
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,520
 Christian on earth? That is what purgatory is. So purgatory, me and her would both go to purgatory.

62
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,040
 We'd have a brief waiting period. She's no Mother Teresa herself, but she may be in purgatory for

63
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:05,960
 50 years and I may be in purgatory for 400 years, a lifetime of infidelity, overeating, and general

64
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,720
 slothness. That's a rule in Catholicism to make it fair. That's why you should dedicate your life to

65
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,680
 the church now so you have less time in purgatory. But Odileo of Cloney, he pushed this thing called

66
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,120
 All Souls Day and nowadays it's an official holiday in the Catholic religion. On November 2nd

67
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,800
 is a time to pray for the people who passed before you because by praying for people in purgatory,

68
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,160
 it makes it a much shorter time that they're there. And it's really interesting. The reason why

69
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:43,480
 Odileo came up with this idea was he heard a story. This is an urban legend, a creepypasta from the

70
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:51,720
 Middle Ages, because it's so weird. I can't believe that this actually changed and became

71
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,360
 part of official religion holiday. Odileo came up with this because he had a buddy who got lost

72
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,040
 on an island one day. And his buddy's boat crashed on this island and the only other person on the

73
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,560
 island was a hermit. And the hermit goes, "Hey dude, good to see you here. You probably won't be

74
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,880
 here long. We're not really in the middle of nowhere. Apparently the people did get rescued, but

75
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,680
 we're going to be here for a bit. I'm going to tell you this, friar. This island kind of

76
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,080
 sucks because every so often a portal opens up and you hear nothing but screaming

77
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,920
 coming from the other side. And the friar's like, "What are you talking about? How long have you

78
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,880
 been on this island? How many psychedelic mushrooms are growing here?" And the hermit goes, "Only five,

79
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,760
 but that has nothing to do with the portal that opens up." The portal opens up and it's people

80
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:47,800
 from purgatory screaming, screaming out for prayer. And every time it opens up, I just pray that it

81
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,880
 shuts real quickly, but maybe you can do something about it, right? You're a friar, right? So basically

82
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,120
 he told the equivalent of a spooky story and this story would then got to Odileo and Odileo

83
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,360
 wanted this all souls day. It's so fascinating because Odileo of Clooney is a very, very well,

84
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,040
 he's a saint. He's a very well-known in the Catholic faith. There's not a lot of information

85
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,040
 about him. There's not a lot of information about this event. I've seen it repeated several times

86
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,960
 that their portal opened up in the island, but some versions he's on the island and some versions

87
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,160
 he just hears the story, but we don't know what island. Like, I really want to know what island

88
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:34,200
 you can hear purgatory from. That'd be dope. But then we have this. This is really, I mean,

89
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,720
 that's all interesting historical religious trivia, or if you follow that religion, you're like,

90
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,160
 "Jason is not trivia. It's what I believe." But the reason why I wanted to talk about it was I

91
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:51,240
 recently found an article written by Jody Smith for rancor.com. In Rome, there's a little church

92
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,200
 called the Church of the Sacred Heart of Suffrage, and inside the little church, there's a little room,

93
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:06,520
 and that little room is called the Museum of the Souls of Purgatory. Back in 1897, a fire broke out

94
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,680
 in this church, and the fire brigade came in with their buckets of water, and that was the most

95
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,520
 advanced technology they had. They're probably like throwing ice cubes through the window as well,

96
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,080
 and they've put it out. The fire's not still burning to this day. They put it out, but one of the

97
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:31,640
 friars at the church, friar Victor Jote, saw, burned onto the wall, the face of a man,

98
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:39,400
 screaming in pain. Now, it wasn't actually screaming, it just looked like it, but friar had a vivid

99
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,200
 imagination. He goes, "I bet you that that dude's trapped in purgatory," and that's his like, face

100
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,800
 coming through the wall. All the other friars are like, "Oh, great. This guy's just going to tell

101
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,960
 spooky stories the rest of the time he's here," and he probably did, because eventually they said,

102
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,960
 "Hey, tell you what, friar, you leave. We're not firing you. We actually want you to travel around

103
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:07,720
 the world looking for other items touched by purgatory people." Now, how would you even start

104
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,080
 a quest like that, right? Someone said, "I want you to go find items that an angel winked at." You'd

105
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,320
 be like, "Well, you must be out of your mind," but friar Victor took this as a challenge, and actually

106
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,360
 it was his job. If he didn't do it, he'd probably get fired. He traveled the world and actually found

107
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:32,120
 10 different relics that have been touched by people from purgatory. He found a book with three

108
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:39,160
 finger marks burned into it. Sizzle. He found this dude. He goes, "Hey, man, if you're not impressed

109
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,800
 with the book, I got more. I got more." He meets this man and he goes, "Dude, friar, you won't believe

110
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,560
 it. I heard you're looking for some purgatory stuff. This is crazy. I had a dream. My wife,

111
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,320
 she died a while ago. I got a minute. I haven't been praying that much. I've been too busy trying

112
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,360
 to find a new lady for me, but one night she came to me in a dream and she said, "Dude, you're not

113
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,240
 praying about me," and I'm like, "This purgatory thing totally sucks," and I was not a good Catholic

114
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,800
 on earth. I'm going to be here forever. You got to pray for me." In the dream, she snatched the

115
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,800
 sleeping cap off my head because it's old-timey and we still wore those. When I woke up,

116
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,120
 my sleeping cap had burned fingerprints in it and he pulls it out. He pulls it up dramatically

117
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,480
 and waves in front of the friar's face. "Ha-ha, here we go." He's like, "That's perfect. I want that

118
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:35,560
 for my museum." There was one nun, Mother Isabelle Fornari. She sat on all souls day 1731 in Toadie,

119
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,240
 Italy. She was sitting at her desk. She's like, "Dum-dum-dum-dum. How do you be a nun?" No one

120
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,360
 ever gave me a guidebook. I'm just pretending I'm a nun until I retire. Hopefully no one will tell.

121
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,640
 This old priest dude who had died before showed up in her study and she's like, "Ah, you caught me."

122
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,160
 I was playing mind sweeper on this old-timey computer. He shows up and he's like, "You have to

123
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,960
 pray for me. You have to pray for me. I'm stuck. I'm stuck in purgatory and I did some stuff. I did

124
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:09,480
 some stuff that no one knows about. It's pretty awful." He puts his hand on her table. He burns

125
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,560
 his hand print into the table. He burns a cross into the table too, which is a little overdoing it.

126
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,200
 Like, we get your alignment. We get what you're doing here. Then he grabbed her sleeve. He grabbed

127
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:31,160
 like her clothes and burnt the sleeve of her clothes and she began to bleed. It's all coming out

128
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,280
 of her. So he's collecting these relics of these people who said they're seeing people from purgatory.

129
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,480
 And then we have the most mysterious one from, as opposed to the non-mysterious

130
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,440
 people reaching out from beyond the veil. From August to November 1919 at the monastery of

131
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:54,120
 St. Leonardo in Montefalco, Italy, 30 banknotes are dropped off over the course of a couple months.

132
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:03,320
 Each one is about 10 lira. There's no burn marks, but the friars at this monastery believe that these

133
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:10,040
 are being left behind by someone in purgatory, trying to bribe the friars to pray for them.

134
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,280
 That doesn't do any good because he's not leaving the note. You're just praying for general people.

135
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:20,280
 They don't know who this was for. But this was actually delivered. This was another item that

136
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:26,280
 was delivered to the museum. They made photocopies of it and then gave the money back to the monastery

137
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,120
 of St. Leonardo. But if you go to this museum today, it's still in operation. You can see the

138
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:37,240
 photocopy of these bills. And that was the last item to be entered into the museum. Now you go, Jason,

139
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,440
 you said there were 10 items and you've only described three. Well, the other ones were kind

140
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,680
 of lame. And they were just again a bunch of burn marks. I think you got the point. But what's odd

141
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:52,360
 is that since Fryer Victor died, no one has added anything more to the museum. And that fact is

142
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,920
 repeated several times. Like I said, there's some kind of wiggle room and different variations of

143
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,280
 the story, but they constantly say no items have been added since Fryer Victor died. But Fryer Victor

144
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:12,760
 died in 1912. He died in that room. He died in the museum. He died in 1912. And the banknotes

145
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:21,480
 showed up by all accounts seven years later. So is it possible that Fryer Victor is the one who

146
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,680
 was delivering those notes, a final signal that there is life after death? And it's miserable.

147
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:36,280
 He's literally bribing people to get him out of purgatory as soon as possible. So the creepy story,

148
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,880
 creepy museum, I wonder if these items, it's interesting because they stopped adding to it.

149
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,360
 So I'm wondering if the church, the Catholic church was like, this is a little goofy, right?

150
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,920
 This is a little too much. Let's not have the magical ghost stuff adding up the museum because

151
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,480
 you figured there'd be more of it. If you were able to collect 10 items in such a short time span,

152
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,120
 in the time span of one man, you figured there'd be tons of this stuff out there. But really,

153
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:10,520
 really interesting creepy museum, creepy story. And is that portal still out there? That portal to

154
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,520
 purgatory? Who knows? But Kinsey, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit

155
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,560
 Durgible. You're getting sucked into the portal right now. You're like, it's still here. It's

156
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,960
 still here. I'm like, who knows? The mystery will go on forever. Lost another listener.

157
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:30,120
 Kinsey Firebird Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're leaving behind Rome. We're headed all the way out

158
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:39,160
 to Hollywood. This next one, guys, I'm going to tell you right now. It is a mix between a Dead

159
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,600
 Rabbit Recommends and a segment. I'm going to try to keep this short because I could go on and on

160
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,000
 about this. And I do plan on doing a full segment in the future, but I want to give you guys an

161
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,480
 opportunity to watch this for yourself. I saw one of my favorite movies the other day. I had never

162
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,320
 heard of it. I was researching a story and I was researching, it was like three, four paragraphs

163
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,960
 on Wikipedia. I'm researching this into the ending of this narrative. It said, someone made a movie

164
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:16,760
 about this and I watched the movie and it is amazing. It's called Mope. M-O-P-E. Now, I know 10

165
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,360
 of you guys immediately started chuckling because you know exactly what I'm talking about. Mope is

166
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:30,600
 the true life story of two men trying to make it in the porno business. They are, they describe

167
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:42,840
 themselves as the Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker of porn and it is Joker. It is the movie Joker,

168
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:53,240
 but real. It is so fascinating. The character, the lead actor, plays this man named Steven Driver

169
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:00,520
 who wants to be a porn star more than anything, but he sucks at it and he teams up with this

170
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,960
 other guy. They become fast friends. This other guy, Tom Dong, that's his, that's his fake name,

171
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,160
 that's his stage name and he talks him. They're both really love porn and they meet on the set of a

172
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:19,560
 porn gang bang and they are just become quick buddies and you want, you, he, every actor is

173
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,280
 such an amazing job in this movie that you would not want to hang out with, especially the star

174
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,680
 Steven Driver. You would not want to hang out with this guy and yet we've all worked with this guy.

175
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:35,800
 We've all had jobs with people like Steven Driver. The movie is fantastic. I will do a

176
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,160
 segment within the next couple weeks about the story of Steven Driver and Tom Dong,

177
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,920
 but the movie is so well made. It's a super independent film, right? The biggest star is

178
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,160
 David Arquette. He's in it for just a couple of minutes. So if you hate him, you're fine. I don't

179
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:57,320
 mind him. I think the movie's funny. It's hilarious. It's hilarious. I was laughing so hard. I was

180
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,440
 having to rewind it because I was laughing so hard and you're watching it and it is so absurd and

181
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:09,000
 it is true. It is true. I read the Wikipedia page first. I knew it was coming and I was still laughing

182
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,720
 out loud. I was still on the edge of my seat because it is Joker. It is the story of a man

183
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:25,240
 who in a society has nothing and he can't get out of his head and you're watching this movie.

184
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,160
 It's just brilliant. I remember watching it and I was on the edge of my seat and I knew how it

185
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:37,000
 ended because I read the Wikipedia article. Even then, the last five minutes is really,

186
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,920
 it's so good. It's a true story, but there is a scene in it that if the director does not understand

187
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:54,520
 what sex magic is, it was the perfect visualization I've ever seen of sex magic in this movie,

188
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:03,000
 which is just using the human body and sexual activity as a focal point for bending the universe.

189
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,200
 It's such a good movie. Now, when I talk about, when I say it's a great movie, you know, like

190
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,640
 Joker had all the cinematography and the score and all this stuff, it doesn't have that. It has

191
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,800
 the limitations of its budget, but the stars are on point, the script is on point, you will laugh

192
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 out loud, you will be disgusted, disgusted, but it's a great film. It's a great film. If you're into,

193
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,400
 if you're into screwball comedies, it's hilarious. If you're into people on the outskirts of society,

194
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:39,480
 it's a great look at that. I think it's far better than Joker, honestly, I think, because it goes to

195
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,360
 where, and it's a true story. It happened. Even the most ludicrous parts of the movie, there's a

196
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,080
 scene in the middle of the movie that is so outrageous that you're like, they must have made

197
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,800
 this up. And it, not only did he do it, he did it multiple times in front of multiple people.

198
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:01,720
 So we will do a segment on it coming up, but I really want you guys to watch Mope. It's not the

199
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,280
 best Thanksgiving movie. Don't look anything else up. Don't look anything else up. Not the best

200
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,320
 Thanksgiving movie. There's a lot of nudity in it, but it is a, it's Joker. It's Joker if

201
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:21,960
 Joker was real. So great move. The final shot is, the final shot is almost Twilight Zone-esque.

202
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,840
 It's so creepy. The movie's funny. The movie's creepy. Mope. Dead Rabbit recommends Mope, and

203
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,920
 I'll go more in detail. I know this episode's a little freewheeling. I probably should have taken

204
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,680
 a shower before I started going, but I don't have time. Kinsey, I'm going to go ahead and

205
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,520
 toss you the keys of the carbon orcopter. We are leaving behind Hollywood. We're leaving behind

206
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,160
 this porno set. I definitely do need to take a shower now. We are headed all the way out

207
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,040
 to ancient Egypt.

208
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:58,280
 And we're back there. We're back in ancient Egypt. We're watching the pyramids get built,

209
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:04,360
 but we noticed something. The Prince of Egypt, that movie lied to us. There's no slaves

210
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,040
 building the pyramids. We don't see Moses punching some dude in the face and then knocking the

211
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:18,360
 nose off the sphinx. We see just these alien craft floating overhead and tractor beings

212
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:26,760
 moving the giant rocks from place to place. And I look at you and I go, I guess I owe you five

213
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,600
 bucks. I'm not a big believer in ancient aliens, but here we go. It only took a time machine for

214
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:39,480
 you to earn five dollars from me. And I had this thought the other day, and I'm not a big believer

215
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,960
 in ancient aliens, but I'm open to stuff, right? I'm not going to say that I would never believe

216
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,960
 in it. I just don't believe the evidence I've seen, but I had a thought the other day, really

217
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:54,520
 kind of depressing thoughts. Well, depressing might not be the right word, but let's take a look.

218
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,520
 We've already talked about souls trapped in hell and a real life story about a man who just

219
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:08,360
 wanted a little friendship and ended up doing horrible things. But what if? I think this question

220
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:15,000
 people ask all the time when you're like religious or not maybe, but you believe in aliens. Why is it

221
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,640
 that back in the days, miracles used to be commonplace? Like if you look at religious stories,

222
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,000
 there's miracles constantly happening. And then even if you look at, let's say, through up to the

223
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,360
 middle ages, even in the middle ages, you had stories of shapeshifters like openly told stories

224
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,040
 about shapeshifters and witches and you had the entire church looking hunting for devil worshipers.

225
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,280
 You were flying around the sky on brooms or turning into werewolves and we don't see any of that stuff

226
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:52,200
 nowadays. Or if we do, it's relegated to the back page of some obscure website or podcast,

227
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,560
 but we're definitely not seeing it in the grand scale that we saw in the past, and especially

228
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,640
 when you look at religious stuff, burning bushes, entire movements of people being

229
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,280
 directed by God, manna coming from heaven, all this stuff. We don't see, there's no corollary to

230
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,280
 that. And when we look at aliens, the ancient aliens' belief is they came down to us. The

231
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:20,440
 aliens were openly engaged with humanity and directed us to build these monuments, helped us

232
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,160
 build these structures, gave us technology, gave us culture, gave us civilization.

233
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,760
 But not anymore. Now, the best you will get is some guy saying he got abducted with absolutely

234
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,240
 no evidence. Maybe his sleeping cap was burned off by a plasma ray or a blurry photo.

235
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:51,320
 So why was it the entire Egyptian civilization was created by these aliens or the civilizations in

236
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,280
 South America were created by these aliens? Why aren't they coming back anymore? You could say,

237
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,720
 Jason, they're here all the time. We got these photos of these UFOs. We got these people being

238
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,320
 abducted. They're no longer creating great works on Earth. If you believe in the ancient alien

239
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,720
 theory, and so for the rest of the segment, I believe in that. Again, I'm skeptical towards it,

240
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,280
 but for the sake of argument, if we believe in the ancient alien theory, why aren't they building

241
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:21,000
 cities now? New Orleans gets wiped out by Hurricane Katrina, and then a mothership shows up, and

242
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,480
 they're like, we will help you rebuild a better New Orleans. No more of that horrible jazz music.

243
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,320
 We're actually banning it, and everyone agrees, except for a few jazz influenced freedom fighters

244
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,560
 who I quickly rat out. I'm like, it's those guys. I'd recognize those trumpets anywhere.

245
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,800
 How come they're not doing that? And then I thought of something.

246
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,200
 What if they don't like us anymore?

247
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:58,200
 Like, haven't you ever had that friend? And again, this kind of reminded me of Mope, too.

248
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,200
 But haven't you ever had that friend? Or sometimes we are that friend, right? I've been on both sides

249
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,800
 of this. I've been a friend, and I've been the other... Let me explain what it is. So it's where

250
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,800
 you just start to grow apart. You don't necessarily dislike the person. Just your interests have

251
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:20,520
 grown apart. I have some great friendships. I'm very, very proud. One of the things I'm most

252
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:28,600
 proud of is the friendships I forged over the years. Time, distance. Usually they do get strained,

253
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,520
 just physically. But of all my good friends, I can run into at a bar tomorrow and we're talking

254
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,080
 about old times. Did you hear Patty Jenkins not directing the new Star Wars movie anymore?

255
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,040
 Start talking all that nerd stuff we used to talk about. That's true, by the way, she got...

256
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:50,760
 She quit. But we also have those friends that we just outgrow. And sometimes I've been that friend.

257
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,000
 I've been the friend that someone I'm close to, they just go to a different level of their life,

258
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,920
 and I'm no longer part of that. And it hurts, right? And I have also done that. I've been like,

259
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,760
 "Well, you know, I'm kind of moving past that. Like, I'm not that type of person anymore, so I'm

260
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,960
 not going to be hanging out with this dude. I haven't done it a lot, but we do it." And what if

261
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:17,400
 that's where we're at with aliens? What if they don't want anything to do with us anymore?

262
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:27,160
 Such an interesting thought. Because I was thinking this, and I go, "What if we were more advanced

263
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:35,240
 in ancient Egyptian times than we are today?" But everything today is just sugar. Everything else

264
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:43,000
 today is just a frosty coating covering up the horribleness of what we've become. Sure,

265
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,920
 technologically we're more advanced, but are we more advanced spiritually?

266
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:55,960
 Are we more advanced on a metaphysical level? Because we can go from horse and chariots

267
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:04,520
 to hypersonic missiles. But that gulf is nothing to a space faring race. Like, that's nothing.

268
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,000
 That would be the equivalent of an ant going, "Well, sure, yesterday I was only carrying

269
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,760
 one piece of sugar, but today I'm carrying three." We'd be like, "Who cares? Get out of my house."

270
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,880
 I wouldn't say that. I love ants. I'd give them some extra sugar. But that would be us going from

271
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,720
 the horse and chariot to a hypersonic missile that can fly around the world twice and then land

272
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:33,080
 in the ocean. Aliens are like, "That's really all you got?" On a spiritual level, on a metaphysical

273
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:39,880
 level where we were in direct communication with the gods back then. Have we peddled back

274
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,760
 where, "Oh, I don't believe in gods. I'm gonna look through this microscope and see a little germ.

275
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,640
 That means gods don't exist. Now I have a cell phone. We're more advanced than we were back then.

276
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:56,840
 What if that is all window dressing and we're no longer interesting?" The alien showed up for a

277
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:03,880
 period of time in human history where we were at the top of the game. We had mastered the elements.

278
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,400
 We were able to build shelter. We were able to hunt game. We were able to control fires. All of

279
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:15,720
 these things that were huge leaps from being a monkey in a tree, eating roots that would take

280
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,440
 you six hours to chew, just to be able to get some nutrients out of it, to building a sphinx.

281
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:29,880
 That's massive. That's two different species. Building a sphinx to building the Empire State

282
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:38,360
 building, the only difference is the material and the ease that we do it. What if that was our

283
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,720
 peak and aliens were like, "Dude, this is dope." And they come down there and they help us build

284
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,080
 these structures and they trade information with us and they give us these stories of God and creation

285
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:55,400
 in the universe and man's place in the world. And then we just got lame. And the aliens saw that.

286
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,760
 Haven't you ever had a job you're passionate about or a hobby you were passionate about or

287
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:09,720
 anything? And you are doing it and eventually it's just not as cool as it used to be. And then you

288
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,640
 kind of force it for a while because you don't want to give it up. The sunken costs fallacy.

289
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,680
 Then you just got to go, "I'm just not having fun, kiteboarding or I'm not having fun quilting or

290
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,120
 whatever." Or my job. The job started off really cool but now my heart's not in it. And then you leave.

291
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:34,040
 What if aliens have done that to us? And all of this technological stuff, it's boring to them.

292
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:41,480
 They, first off, it's not advanced to them at all. And they're like, "You guys used to be cool way

293
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,520
 back in the day. We staying out with you." But now you guys are just, you guys think you know everything

294
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,040
 and oh, rockets. You have a rocket. Woo. It was way better when you guys could look up and just

295
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:59,240
 see the galaxy. There are no lights. No electricity. You guys had it figured out. Sure, sure disease

296
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:06,360
 and warfare killed a lot of you but you guys are, you guys are still doing that now. The alien ships

297
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,720
 we see, maybe even UFO sightings, modern UFO sightings are almost some sort of prehistoric memory.

298
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:18,840
 We're looking up and it's like an evolutionary fluke that we're actually not seeing these things.

299
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,600
 Or the aliens we do run into are just checking in on us. Oh yeah, they're still dumb. They're

300
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:31,640
 still fighting with each other over meaningless things. Ripping up the earth for these minerals and

301
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,840
 these rare earth metals and just scarring the planet to have the newest piece of phone that's

302
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,760
 made by slave labor of their own species. They're enslaving one part of their species

303
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,000
 to help another part of their species. It's barbaric. I mean, sure, the Egyptians had slaves

304
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,920
 but they were far, there was a newer civilization. We figured they'd grow out of it in say,

305
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,760
 3,000 years. But here they are. There's more slaves today than there ever were back then.

306
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,880
 I'd argue there's more slaves now than there was entire human population back then.

307
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:14,200
 So the question might not be, are we alone in the universe? The question may be, how come they

308
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:21,320
 haven't come back? They were here once. They interacted with humanity on such a level that we

309
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,480
 can look at structures on earth and we can look at these myths that all talk about beings coming

310
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:35,240
 from the sky that is universal from across the planet. They used to be here and now we suck.

311
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,840
 And they've stopped coming and they may have not have come for a while. Every so often a ship may

312
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:50,760
 show up. Every so often a ship may crash. But we may never see them come back in any real substantial

313
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:55,720
 way. Because if you believe in ancient aliens, they were here and they left their mark on the

314
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,720
 planet in a very positive way. They helped societies grow. How come they're not doing that now? And I

315
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,760
 think we might have to come to a realization that the truth is not out there. The truth used to be

316
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:19,320
 here. But they've left us just like a dad walking out on a family. They left us. You may want all

317
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:28,040
 your life for that dad to come back in, but he's not coming back. Maybe you see a dad-shaped silhouette

318
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:39,320
 walking through a crowded Kmart. Your dad? That's not him. Maybe your dad is making crop circles

319
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,760
 one day. You're like, "Oh, dad, maybe he's in the cornfield." You go, "There's just a bunch of crop

320
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:49,320
 circles, but your dad still is not there." Maybe someone takes a blurry photo of your dad walking

321
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,000
 through the forest. I think the analogy is run its course. My point is that what would be worse,

322
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:01,480
 never ever ever having any proof that aliens ever existed and always being a theory. Or

323
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,440
 knowing they used to be here, they used to interact with humanity, they used to love us as

324
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:18,520
 intergalactic neighbors, and now they're gone forever. They dislike us so much, they have left

325
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:30,840
 the solar system alone. What's worse, never having been loved or losing that love? It comes down to

326
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,920
 that immortal statement, "It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all."

327
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:42,120
 But would it really be better to know that aliens used to embrace humanity and used to guide us

328
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:50,040
 and now they don't? Because we're just not impressive, we're not cool, we're not on the

329
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,680
 right path, we're so far from the right path, they don't even want to come back and show us.

330
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:03,320
 What would be more heartbreaking? To never know whether or not aliens exist, to constantly live

331
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,440
 in a universe where we don't know if we're the only ones around, or to know without a

332
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:15,400
 shadow of a doubt that we used to be worthy of intergalactic neighbors, that we used to be worthy

333
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:24,280
 of a cosmic brotherhood, that we as a species used to be so loved that aliens would travel the cosmos

334
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:31,320
 just to hang out with us and guide our society. I honestly don't know what's worse, I don't know

335
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,600
 if it would be worse to never know if aliens were out there and to just figure we were alone,

336
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:43,240
 or to think at one point we were worthy of a cosmic brotherhood, but we no longer are.

337
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:52,440
 It's like that child who keeps trying to be better at everything, trying to impress a parent,

338
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,120
 being better at piano, getting better grades, getting a better job, finding the perfect spouse,

339
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,120
 and they're not doing it for themselves, they're doing it to impress somebody else, and that other

340
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:11,000
 person is not paying attention. Another person is in another galaxy. Is it truly to cut, is it truly

341
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:20,040
 better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all? And the only proof that we lost that

342
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:29,000
 love is the monuments and the myths that survived the ancient world, relics of a time when humanity

343
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:36,120
 was accepted into a cosmic brotherhood. They also are constant reminders

344
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:42,600
 that for whatever reason we are now alone and ignored,

345
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:59,480
 silently and forever, floating through the darkness of an unforgiving galaxy.
