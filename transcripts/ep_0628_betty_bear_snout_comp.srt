1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,860
 What happens when the community you create to fight the powers that be?

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,800
 Turn on you?

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,440
 And then we travel to the Soviet Union to meet a woman who foolishly made fun of a saint.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,760
 Her punishment?

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
 The infrosin?

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
 In place?

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:33,680
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,280
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,760
 That was supposed to be talking but I can't with my mouth.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,520
 But it sounded more like she turned into a robot.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,400
 Like that creepy robot from Superman 3.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,840
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so first off let's give a shout out to one of our legacy

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,280
 Patreon supporters coming in writing a golden griffin it's Bjorn S.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,720
 It's not a baby.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,080
 Bjorn S is not a baby.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,600
 This is the sound a griffin makes.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
 I apologize to all new listeners of the show.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
 It's normally not this fanatic.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,040
 This is not a word.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
 It's normally not that.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
 It's Friday.

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,280
 It's like chill out day.

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,760
 Bjorn thanks for supporting the show.

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,760
 You can't support the Patreon or if you're not super manic right now.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
 That's fine too.

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,720
 Just helps spread the word about the show.

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
 Really really helps out a lot.

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,560
 You guys will also see it's Fan Art Friday.

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,680
 Right now we have some fan art, a meme provided to us by Mayher Shalasha Baz.

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,600
 So thank you Mayher Shalasha Baz for this.

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,160
 It's a classic Hans meme.

36
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,840
 Hans is still gone by the way.

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,640
 I always try to check on him.

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,960
 I always open the door and see that he's still sleeping in bed.

39
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
 Oh Hans.

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
 Hans if you don't know.

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,880
 If someone we've covered a couple times on this show, he is a YouTuber who dabbles in

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,320
 the most bizarre conspiracy theories.

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,360
 Namely, all men are women and all women are men.

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,040
 For the most part, he's actually a man.

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,320
 But Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are actually the reverse.

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,080
 Brad Pitt's a woman and Angelina Jolie is a man.

47
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,080
 And even more famous than that, monkeys don't exist.

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,560
 He believes that primates are actually people in suits to fool us because of some reason.

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,200
 Oh the color orange is evil and space is fake.

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,600
 But that's really like, it's so funny because you don't want to beat a dead horse and I

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,480
 don't think Hans is a bad person.

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,800
 I see a lot of YouTube videos that popped up recently or in the past couple months just

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,200
 kind of saying how stupid he is and stuff like that.

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 I don't think he's dumb.

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,640
 I think his critical thinking skills are a little off.

56
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,040
 I think he's smart enough to look at facts and he's smart enough to ask questions.

57
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,160
 But it's the conclusions that don't really land properly.

58
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,320
 I don't think he's an idiot, but he has retired.

59
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,760
 One of my YouTube listeners, Calvin Wallmer, actually sent me a video of his a while back

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,000
 to watch called "Time Ain't What It Used To Be" with the theory that time used to be

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 slower.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,080
 It used to be way, way slower.

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:09,000
 His proof of this is when you watch old timey movies, everyone moves really fast.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,720
 That is actually, I might be getting it wrong.

65
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,680
 Calvin Wallmer is saying that people move faster in the past and when you see old timey

66
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,200
 movies and they move fast that's actually how people move in the past.

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,640
 Or they move slower and we have to speed up the film otherwise we would know they move

68
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
 slower.

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
 It was one of the two.

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
 It was hard to make sense.

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,000
 He has a whole video about how in the past if you counted one Mississippi it was slower

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,120
 than if you counted to one Mississippi today.

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,520
 Thanks for sending that over by the way Calvin.

74
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,720
 I didn't have, I don't know if I can make a whole segment out of this stuff.

75
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,800
 A lot of his stuff come off like little jokes.

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,160
 Like you can make quick jokes about it.

77
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,640
 He has a video that I'm looking at here entitled "Send This Video To People Who Believe In

78
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,040
 Pinquins" and it is behind the scenes footage from "Bandman Returns" and it's them setting

79
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,160
 up fake pinquins.

80
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,320
 So he has like the, he has, he's looking at stuff and goes "Wait a second, if Hollywood

81
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,560
 can make a fake penguin how can I prove a real penguin exists?"

82
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
 That's a question.

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,400
 He's not allowed to ask questions but I just think his answer, Batman's not real.

84
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,680
 Actually no he does believe Batman.

85
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,400
 Batman is a Jewish word for daughter so he thinks Batman is daughter man.

86
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,240
 That's, this is 100% true.

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,720
 Batman is daughter man and that goes into the whole idea that men are actually women

88
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,560
 and women are actually men except for a very few of them.

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,200
 If you're a chubby man like myself I'm actually a woman.

90
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,320
 But he has retired and this is super long intro but you know I wish him the best.

91
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
 I wish him the best.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,120
 He's no longer making YouTube videos like "Top 10 Fake Animals" the very first picture

93
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,360
 of the male is a snake strangling a woman.

94
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,200
 Yeah, so we wish you the best Hans.

95
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,240
 All of our memes and the episode, we've done two episodes on you.

96
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,400
 They're all in good fun.

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,240
 I'm not part of the hate Hans wagon.

98
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,640
 I, at least as far as I know I haven't seen anything that would make me hate you.

99
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,200
 You seem like a pretty chill guy.

100
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,360
 I think that you just come to different conclusions.

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
 I think they're wrong conclusions.

102
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,520
 I'm not going to sugarcoat it.

103
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,560
 I do think time moves the same now as it used to.

104
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,640
 But I hope everything's going okay.

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,960
 I guess I'm a little, I guess I'm saying along about why I'm a little concerned.

106
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,320
 Usually he said he was retiring just because he got tired of doing the same thing over

107
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,600
 and over again but I hope that's all.

108
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,000
 Hans, if you're listening to the show and I know you have checked out episodes in the

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,480
 past we do, even though we'll disagree about stupid stuff, whether or not the color orange

110
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,720
 is evil, we do care about you here at Dead Rabbit Radio and we hope that you are okay.

111
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,760
 Bjorn is standing there nodding his head.

112
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,920
 He's like, "Yes, I love Hans the most."

113
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,680
 He has a little Hans fan club button.

114
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,880
 We know you live Hans the most.

115
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,200
 Bjorn, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgeable we are going to leave

116
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,720
 behind Dead Rabbit Command and we are headed out to the East Coast because I didn't write

117
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,320
 down, I didn't write down exactly where we were going.

118
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,640
 Or headed on out there.

119
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,280
 It doesn't really matter the specific state.

120
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,520
 This is more of a state of mind.

121
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,760
 Very, very fascinating story but I have to do a bit of lead up to it.

122
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,840
 We're going to talk about a man named Preston Nichols.

123
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,000
 We've actually talked about him twice on this show.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,960
 I'll give you quick overviews and the episodes that you want to watch are in the show notes

125
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
 if you want more information but we'll cover enough to make this relevant.

126
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,200
 We talked about him on episode 543 and that was the first time we met him.

127
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,920
 He was running around with a guy named John Ford.

128
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,040
 They were both UFO researchers.

129
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:39,480
 Preston Nichols believed that he saw himself from the future in the past so he saw a videotape

130
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,240
 of a younger version of himself recovering a UFO.

131
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,480
 So just right off the bat, right off the bat.

132
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,440
 That's just bizarre.

133
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,560
 He was hanging out with John Ford who ended up going to prison for trying to assassinate

134
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,600
 a couple of Republicans with radioactive material because he believed they were either part

135
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,040
 of the UFO cover up or he just didn't like them or both.

136
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
 It was just this super bizarre thing.

137
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
 It's a really good episode.

138
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
 Episode 543.

139
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,080
 And Preston Nichols is a side character in that story.

140
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,840
 I read this article written by Michael Colton.

141
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,720
 It was an article called "Out There" for the Washington Post.

142
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,200
 Michael Colton actually, immediately afterwards, Nickelodeon knocked on his door.

143
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,440
 He went from writing, being a journalist, to writing for the Penguin's a Madagascar,

144
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,720
 that cool cartoon on Nickelodeon.

145
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,320
 I actually really like that cartoon.

146
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,840
 He wrote this though about Preston Nichols.

147
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,880
 I love this quote because it really says a lot about how the media portrayed UFOologists

148
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
 when I was growing up.

149
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,680
 This article came out in the 90s.

150
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,120
 This is how UFOologists used to be treated.

151
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
 Fairly or unfairly.

152
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,200
 Again, Preston Nichols and John Ford, they were doing some really goofy stuff and had

153
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,080
 some really bizarre and in the end dangerous theories.

154
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,960
 At least John Ford's theories put people in danger.

155
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,760
 Preston Ford believed he saw a videotape of himself, a younger version of himself,

156
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,120
 who would come from the future.

157
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
 How does this even work?

158
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,120
 A younger version of himself from the future came back in time to capture a UFO.

159
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
 And he's watching my video.

160
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
 They're just...

161
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,960
 Anyways, this is this quote.

162
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,560
 I love this quote about Preston Nichols.

163
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,800
 "Portly and absent-minded.

164
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,400
 He lives with his father in a small, shoddy house, cluttered with electronic equipment,

165
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,120
 books, videotapes, and a rock collection."

166
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,000
 I'm not saying rock collections are nerdy, but the journalist didn't have to put that

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 detail.

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,360
 It didn't have to put any of those details in there, right?

169
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,840
 Portly and absent-minded.

170
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,480
 He lives with his dad.

171
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,360
 So right there, you're like, "Great."

172
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,520
 Now none of those things are necessarily bad.

173
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,440
 They're building a profile of "Coco, Coco, look at this guy, he has a rock collection."

174
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,240
 I mean, rocks are cool.

175
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,680
 I don't have one, but I'm just saying.

176
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,120
 You can picture from that exactly the story that Michael is trying to lay out.

177
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,440
 Portly and absent-minded.

178
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,160
 He lives with his father in a small, shoddy house, cluttered with electronic equipment,

179
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,720
 books, videotapes, and a rock collection.

180
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,320
 Then it goes on.

181
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,560
 In his living room, while his fat dog snores, which is probably one of the best...

182
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,360
 That's like he's making fun of the guy's dog as well.

183
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,520
 The dog has nothing to do with this UFO stuff.

184
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,680
 So anyways, I just love that quote.

185
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
 He was bas...

186
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,480
 And that's not in a site against Michael Colton.

187
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,760
 That is how UFOologists were portrayed in the 90s and before.

188
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,040
 It's only been very, very recent where they've been given any sort of respectability in the

189
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
 media.

190
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,160
 But that was the first time I had really come across the name of Preston Nichols.

191
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,920
 Or so I had thought because it actually turns out that Alex F. Longtime Dead Rabbit Radio

192
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
 listener.

193
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,280
 I don't know if they still listen to the show, but back on episode 214, Alex F. Name

194
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,280
 dropped Preston Nichols and said, "Hey, have you ever heard the story about Preston Nichols

195
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,520
 and a couple other people?

196
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,400
 They actually believe that Stranger Things is based on their life story and apparently

197
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,240
 they tried to sue Stranger Things?"

198
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
 And I go, "Oh no, that's totally weird."

199
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
 And I kind of looked into it and didn't see much.

200
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,240
 For the first time I heard the name Preston Nichols was back when Alex F. left that comment.

201
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,440
 Then when I see the name again in this article related to John Ford, I still didn't even

202
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,600
 put it together.

203
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,320
 But then I started looking into Preston Nichols more and realized he had gone from being a

204
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,720
 side character in the saga of John Ford to one of the main characters, like Alex F. said,

205
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,440
 in the story of the Montauk Project.

206
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,080
 And I covered that on episode 577.

207
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,400
 The Montauk Project in a nutshell is time travel, portal to alternate dimensions, and

208
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,240
 the creation of super soldiers.

209
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,640
 This is conspiracy theory goulash, right?

210
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,080
 Everyone wants a big taste of this and they're throwing every possible conspiracy theory in

211
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
 there.

212
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,600
 Someone haunts us trying to sneak in, orange is evil and everyone's like, "What?

213
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 There's nothing to do with that."

214
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,520
 He's like, "No, no, but it's really evil, guys."

215
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
 It didn't get put in.

216
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,880
 You put it into the goulash.

217
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,520
 You have all this other stuff.

218
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,440
 And Preston Nichols becomes a huge proponent of the Montauk Project.

219
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,800
 And episode 577 was about another man who claimed he was a super soldier.

220
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 He wasn't.

221
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,300
 Spoiler alert, he was not.

222
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,720
 But he believed Preston Nichols was trying to expose this program, trying to expose the

223
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
 truth.

224
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,320
 And now on that episode I said, "I wonder what Preston Nichols is up to today."

225
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,120
 I said, "He's probably still just kind of making money off this whole brand.

226
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,240
 He's still figuring out a way to scam people out of their hard earned money.

227
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,920
 And their mental processing power.

228
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,080
 Because there's no such thing as super soldiers in the sense that Preston Nichols is selling

229
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
 them."

230
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,160
 I found out as I was editing the episode, he's dead.

231
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
 He's actually dead.

232
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,000
 He's not doing any of that stuff anymore.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
 Unfortunately he has passed away.

234
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,720
 As much as I think that it's pretty scummy to be selling lies about, "You may be a super

235
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,040
 soldier and you may be a super soldier and you may be a super soldier."

236
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,440
 And getting people lost in this fantasy world, I don't wish that he was dead.

237
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
 But he's dead.

238
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
 He's dead now.

239
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
 So is that the end of the story?

240
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,160
 Jason, why are you doing a recap on a man who has passed away?

241
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,280
 Well, a super soldier, this is 100% true.

242
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,680
 I just happened to stumble across this a while ago.

243
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:21,040
 A super soldier contacted a psychic and the psychic contacted Preston Nichols from Beyond

244
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
 the Grave.

245
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,320
 B.R., now you see why we're just flying into a state of mind as we're up in this dirgeable.

246
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,440
 Because we are now in the afterlife.

247
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,960
 I hope you guys brought your afterlife pants.

248
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,280
 They make you look like you have little wavy legs.

249
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,440
 Like a ghostbuster ghost.

250
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,240
 Woo, we're just floating there with no legs now.

251
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
 Here's the story.

252
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,920
 So, on November 14th, 2018, a video went up from a super soldier known as James Rink.

253
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,120
 And this is for a website called Super Soldier Talk, which is not as interesting as Super

254
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
 Soldier Fight.

255
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
 Like, what did you rather see?

256
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
 What did you rather see?

257
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,160
 A fight club of a bunch of super soldiers?

258
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,680
 The idea of, I should tell you this too, the idea of a super soldier is that children are

259
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,840
 being kidnapped and taken to these underground laboratories all over the United States.

260
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
 We've covered them a lot on this show actually.

261
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,760
 Max Spears, claimed to be a super soldier.

262
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
 John Storm, claimed to be a super soldier.

263
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,680
 He actually met Spider-Man.

264
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,720
 He met Peter Parker in Vietnam.

265
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,280
 But that's one of my favorite episodes.

266
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,560
 That is one of my favorite episodes.

267
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,200
 But anyway, so we run into these super soldiers quite often.

268
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,120
 So the theory is that they're kidnapped as kids.

269
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,680
 They're taken to these underground layers.

270
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
 They're beat up.

271
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,800
 Their bones are broken over and over and over again until they become hard as iron.

272
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 That's not how that works.

273
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,080
 That's not how that works.

274
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,000
 Your bones just become super brittle and you have fractures everywhere.

275
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,720
 They get tortured and abused and they eventually get released as super soldiers and they're

276
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,160
 dispersed to Vietnam and Cambodia and places where we're actually fighting wars nowadays.

277
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,320
 And then eventually they break free of their super soldier programming.

278
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,200
 They go away, handleers, and then they sit in front of a computer and start a YouTube

279
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,060
 channel and they never get stopped by the US government.

280
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,920
 Even though the US government's committed multiple crimes and had these people go out

281
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,920
 and murder civilians all over the world, they're now able to start a YouTube channel.

282
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,840
 And just talk about it, just talk about all of those horrible crimes.

283
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
 That's what's going on.

284
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,320
 John Storm is very famous for saying the government can't shut him down as he uploads

285
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,240
 videos regularly.

286
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,760
 So we have James Rink and then we have a channeler known as Jessica Morocco.

287
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,440
 According to James Rink, this is the story.

288
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
 He was kidnapped as a little boy.

289
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,040
 He was taken to the Montauk project where he was forced to become a super soldier against

290
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,280
 his will and Preston Nichols was there.

291
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,000
 Preston Nichols, who we have been told was one of the people trying to expose this whole

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,160
 program who used to run with John Ford and his fat dog, was actually a member of the

293
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
 Montauk project.

294
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,040
 He wasn't a whistleblower so much as he was a director of it.

295
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,800
 He not only ordered the abuse of James Rink, he partook in it.

296
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,840
 Preston Nichols personally abused James Rink.

297
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,680
 According to James.

298
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,640
 Also, they- here's a segue for you.

299
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,920
 Also, they both met George Washington.

300
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,400
 Preston Nichols and James Rink- James Rink's the little drummer boy.

301
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
 They go back in time.

302
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
 He's like, "You know what?

303
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,280
 I've been breaking your bones all day long.

304
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
 Let's take a break.

305
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,200
 How would you like to go back and meet George Washington?

306
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,280
 Do I get a wheelchair?

307
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,640
 You get a period appropriate wheelchair?"

308
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,960
 So no, you don't.

309
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,840
 So he's all wobbling, wobbling on little stick- little stick crutches.

310
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,160
 In between having his bones broken and having his mind warped so he could go kill a bunch

311
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
 of people in Vietnam.

312
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,520
 You know, just go back in time.

313
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
 Meet George Washington.

314
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,160
 I don't know why he didn't do Super Soldier stuff back then.

315
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,800
 So he's- it's super bizarre.

316
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,880
 So he's talking about Preston Nichols to this channeler and she apparently knows this back

317
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,880
 story as well and this is part of this YouTube video and she says, "I don't think that's

318
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
 true."

319
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,080
 Now she's not calling him out on the fact that he went back in time and met George Washington.

320
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,400
 She totally let that one slide.

321
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,800
 She goes, "I think he was more of a witness and less of a participant."

322
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,200
 And it's interesting because he doesn't really have a reaction to that.

323
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,400
 Imagine if you were insistent that someone had abused you and someone sitting across

324
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,920
 from the table goes, "Nah, I don't think so."

325
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
 And then you just move on.

326
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,220
 So you figure maybe it's a defense mechanism, but he does just move on.

327
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,480
 So what's this message from beyond the grave?

328
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,620
 She's saying she's talking to Preston Nichols since he passed away.

329
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,360
 This is what he's told her.

330
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,560
 He says, "Listen, I don't have anything to tell you about the afterlife.

331
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,440
 If you want to know the secrets of the universe, you want to know anything that people actually

332
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,200
 want to know about death, I can't tell you that.

333
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,880
 However, I can tell you a bunch of information that I've said several times that you can

334
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,240
 just look up on Google.

335
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,280
 When I was alive, the government was after me.

336
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,600
 They put implants in me.

337
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,880
 They spied on me.

338
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,800
 Make some vague prediction about Tel Aviv.

339
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,240
 This video came out in 2018.

340
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,040
 I mean, if you want to go, if you want to say anything, you can be like something is

341
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,960
 going to happen in the Middle East soon.

342
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,120
 And people are like, "Oh my God, something totally just happened in the Middle East.

343
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,440
 That's the easiest prediction to make."

344
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:28,440
 But then she says that Preston Nichols had a special message for James Rink, and it was,

345
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,080
 it was not me who harmed you.

346
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,160
 They have a way of getting us to fight against each other when they thought we were getting

347
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,120
 too strong.

348
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,680
 So James sits there for a second and he goes, "So was it a clone?

349
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,680
 Was I abused by a lookalike?"

350
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,240
 Like, I'm not laughing at the abuse.

351
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,960
 I don't think the abuse happened.

352
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,080
 So I totally feel fine because Cheat was not actually kidnapped and taken to an underground

353
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,080
 facility and had all of his bones broken for months and months and months.

354
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
 Or anything else.

355
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,040
 It's not like they even took him down there and gave him a lollipop.

356
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,700
 It didn't happen.

357
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,760
 So I have no problem joking about it.

358
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,920
 And she says that he goes, "So was it a clone or a lookalike?"

359
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:17,000
 And she says that he said, Preston Nichols said, "It didn't happen at all.

360
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 He wasn't him.

361
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 It wasn't his clone.

362
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,880
 His clone was doing his taxes."

363
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,720
 And his lookalike was on vacation that week.

364
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:30,360
 And he just kind of nods his head and he just changes the subject.

365
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
 Now here's the thing.

366
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,640
 Did he, I don't think he actually got kidnapped at all.

367
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,060
 I don't think that there's a thousand other ways to build super soldiers.

368
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,980
 That's not any of them.

369
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,140
 That's not any of them.

370
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,340
 And if that was true, they wouldn't be on YouTube.

371
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
 It's one or the other.

372
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,380
 Either they're actually doing this and you're never allowed on YouTube that's part of the

373
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,820
 training, that's part of the super soldier training.

374
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,540
 You would never be able to reveal this stuff.

375
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,940
 Or that it's a flight of fancy.

376
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,220
 But it could be a flight of fancy that you believe.

377
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,060
 Whether or not Jessica's talking to Preston in the afterlife.

378
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:08,280
 I have a little more belief in mediums and ghosts than the super soldier program.

379
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,600
 But who knows to that?

380
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,320
 I do think it's very interesting that she's defending him.

381
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,240
 What I think is the most interesting about this is Preston Nichols built a monster that

382
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,080
 is devouring him.

383
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
 He's dead.

384
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,520
 He can't change his legacy at all.

385
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,880
 But the legacy has been crafted that he is an abuser of children.

386
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,380
 And that is the narrative now.

387
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:39,900
 This man, this portly absent minded man who sat in his dad's house with his fat dog.

388
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,220
 Who made himself the hero of this story that involved time travel and hanging out with

389
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,700
 George Washington.

390
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,580
 And exposing the truth.

391
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,500
 Now the same people that he inspired are calling him a child abuser.

392
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,820
 He created this fanciful fictional world.

393
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,540
 And the thing with the fictional world is anyone can modify it.

394
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,960
 Because there's no facts behind it.

395
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,960
 I just can't show up and go "The bill's won the Super Bowl" and you're like "What?

396
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
 No they didn't."

397
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,080
 They never won the Super Bowl.

398
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
 People would go "No that's not true."

399
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,360
 But if it was some made up sport, if it was like humble warped or some stupid thing like

400
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,720
 that I could make up whatever I wanted.

401
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,920
 And this is a made up story.

402
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,720
 And the guy who made it up can't defend himself and the story is morphing where he's actually

403
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
 the bad guy.

404
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
 I find that super super fascinating.

405
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,320
 There's no way to defend it.

406
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,020
 You can have a psychic come on and say she talked to him.

407
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,540
 But James' response to all of it was like he wanted to believe some of it.

408
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,940
 But he really wasn't taking it in.

409
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,100
 It's a very odd video to watch.

410
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,820
 It's a very odd video to watch.

411
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,060
 I tried watching it a couple of times to see his facial reactions to being told "That's

412
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,220
 not true."

413
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,180
 And there was like nothing there.

414
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,300
 So odd story and it's the story of a man who created a monster, a real life monster.

415
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,400
 Not a monster from Stranger Things, a real life monster, this story that sucked in young

416
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,720
 men like James Rink and Max Spears and many many others.

417
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,520
 And he will be remembered by segments of the Super Soldier Society not as a whistleblower,

418
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,320
 but as a man who actively abused children.

419
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,920
 And in the end that might be the truest part of the story.

420
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,060
 Because if he fed on the emotional trauma of young people, maybe he did abuse children.

421
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:30,940
 And not in an underground facility, but on the internet by telling them lies.

422
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,660
 I don't have a time to tell the story about the woman turning a stone even though that

423
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,140
 was the joke in the beginning, but because I spent too much time talking about Hans.

424
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,340
 But that's okay, I found another story we're going to talk about.

425
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,700
 Bjorn, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter.

426
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,540
 We are still headed to Russia.

427
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:58,500
 Specifically, we are going to Weiborg, the entire region, half land, half machine, all

428
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,300
 Weiborg.

429
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:09,500
 It's in the Leningrad region of Russia and it's July 26th, 1989.

430
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,220
 These kids are riding on a moped, driving down the road, and there's a forest on one

431
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,740
 side of the road.

432
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,140
 They're looking over at the forest, they see something moving through the trees.

433
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,260
 It's not a dog, it's not a dog running for the gravy train.

434
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,300
 Someone's running through the trees there, and it's just a black figure is how they

435
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300
 describe it.

436
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,260
 And then they see another one.

437
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,620
 That one's not making any breathing noises.

438
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,380
 I don't know if the first one was either, but there's a reason why this one isn't making

439
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,340
 any breathing noises.

440
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,140
 This one doesn't have a head.

441
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:51,820
 It's just torso, arms, and legs running behind the other black figure that has a head.

442
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,060
 So the kids SHH!

443
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,540
 Stop the moped and they get off.

444
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,020
 Now there's two types of kids in the world.

445
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,540
 Kids who have not gone off the moped, who would have just kept driving and being like

446
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,460
 "I didn't see it, I didn't see it."

447
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,780
 Or these knuckleheads.

448
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,460
 And us, we probably would have done the same thing.

449
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,220
 They begin picking up rocks and throwing them at the figures in the forest.

450
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,220
 Now it could be anything.

451
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,060
 Could just be some guys running a marathon.

452
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,740
 One guy doesn't have a head.

453
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,740
 That's the new thing.

454
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
 You try running without a head.

455
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,220
 It's great for the cardiovascular system.

456
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,580
 It could be anything from people running a marathon and one of them is headless to aliens

457
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,180
 or ghosts or a bunch of other stuff in between.

458
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,180
 It's aliens.

459
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,180
 That's this one.

460
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,540
 Supposedly aliens, most likely aliens.

461
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,340
 Because what happens is as they start throwing rocks at these unknown people, one of them

462
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,660
 turns, looks at the kid, and shoots a beam at them.

463
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,020
 Shoots a laser beam at them.

464
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,180
 Ghosts tend to not do that.

465
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,580
 Neither do marathon runners.

466
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,740
 It hits about 32 feet away from the kids and it kicks up a bunch of dust.

467
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,700
 And I'm gonna add little sparks, little flashcord and special effects.

468
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,700
 As well.

469
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,500
 When the dust settled, the figures were gone.

470
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
 Very very interesting story.

471
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 That's not all.

472
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 That's not all.

473
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,500
 But it's a very very interesting story because the kids stayed around after they got shot

474
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,780
 at with the laser beam.

475
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,980
 They stood there waiting for the dust to settle.

476
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,820
 And the aliens were like, "Okay, we didn't scare these kids and we don't want to murder

477
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,580
 these kids so let's just leave."

478
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,940
 They won this battle for now.

479
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,380
 That happened on July 26, 1989.

480
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:31,180
 Around the same time in mid-July, I got both of these stories from ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

481
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,940
 Around the same time in mid-July, about 5700 miles away.

482
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,420
 That's how big Russia is.

483
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,700
 They're gonna have two stories, 5700 miles apart.

484
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
 Same country.

485
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,780
 B.O.R.N. take that carbonicopter, we're going to Solanechi.

486
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,740
 That's in the Perm region in Russia.

487
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,740
 There's a summer camp there.

488
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,060
 Kids are roasting marshmallows.

489
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,460
 They're playing tag around while they're roasting marshmallows.

490
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,500
 They're like, "No, no, I don't want to be hit."

491
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,100
 We fall in the fireplace and a new serial killer is born.

492
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,100
 Burn face.

493
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,900
 He's all covered in marshmallows.

494
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,500
 His hockey mask is made of marshmallows.

495
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,980
 They're at this summer camp.

496
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,860
 They see some humanoids walking through the forest.

497
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,620
 These ones they get a good close look at.

498
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,580
 They're described as having large eyes.

499
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,380
 So I'm assuming both of these had heads because they have eyeballs.

500
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,660
 They see these figures walking through the forest and these kids start throwing rocks.

501
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,660
 These kids are legit.

502
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,660
 Pick up rocks.

503
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,340
 This is a totally different group of kids, by the way.

504
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,740
 One kid didn't go like, "That was fun.

505
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,660
 Let's take this moped, 5600 miles across the country."

506
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,780
 They start throwing rocks at these figures in the forest.

507
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,740
 One of these figures, once again, turns and looks at these kids.

508
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:51,620
 Around the same time in the same region, some people are driving down the road roasting marshmallows

509
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,620
 in their car.

510
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,060
 They're all getting carbon dioxide poisoning.

511
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,820
 Oh, but these marshmallows are gonna taste so good.

512
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,060
 They're driving down the road and they see a young woman walking down the street.

513
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,560
 They drive up to the girl.

514
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,760
 The girl turns.

515
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,000
 She turns super slow.

516
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,500
 So first they see the back of her head and then the car is coming.

517
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,940
 Now they see the side and you're like, "Jayce, you didn't have enough time to tell the Stone

518
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,340
 Woman story, but you're dragging on this?"

519
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,340
 Yes, I am.

520
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,500
 The car is coming up and now they can see like half of the back of her head and now they see

521
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,100
 her ear and her hairs gently blowing in the wind.

522
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,820
 The car is driving ever so slowly.

523
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,820
 Ever so much.

524
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
 Time moves slower back then.

525
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,100
 So the car is moving slower and the girl turns and they see like an eye and they're like,

526
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,100
 "Oh, okay.

527
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
 She has a human eye.

528
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,100
 That's good."

529
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,500
 She keeps turning and turning and she has a bear snout for her mouth.

530
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
 But you didn't expect that.

531
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,620
 I don't know if she actually made that noise.

532
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,620
 You wouldn't have to make that noise, right?

533
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,860
 If you were driving down the road, she could have said, "Hello, good gentleman."

534
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,860
 She had a bear snout.

535
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,980
 It doesn't matter what came out of it.

536
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
 That was terrifying.

537
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,860
 They peel out and they drive away from bear snout beddy.

538
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,180
 That's not what she's called, but it should be.

539
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:06,340
 Then also in that same region, there's another group of kids just walking around.

540
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,220
 They are looking for marshmallows.

541
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,820
 They got left out of camp.

542
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,060
 They couldn't afford it.

543
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,940
 So maybe we'll find some wild marshmallows.

544
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,220
 Joey, I've told you there's no such thing as a wild marshmallow.

545
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
 Don't tell me that.

546
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,460
 They're looking for the marshmallow fields.

547
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,860
 They see a UFO landed in a field.

548
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
 Just sitting there.

549
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,100
 Typical UFO apparently.

550
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:31,140
 It's just listed as UFO in the story, but imagine a saucer with the little landing pads.

551
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,700
 And walking around the UFO.

552
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
 Take a guess.

553
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,700
 Take a guess.

554
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
 I'll give you a second.

555
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,700
 What do these kids see?

556
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
 I'm going to take a sip of Sprite Zero Sugar.

557
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,900
 I didn't have enough time to tell that last story, but I can play a game like this for

558
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,260
 this story.

559
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
 What did the children see?

560
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,580
 What did the children see?

561
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,140
 If you answered Minotaurs, you're right.

562
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
 You're right.

563
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,020
 Which I have to say is awesome.

564
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,860
 I don't think in any UFO story we've ever come across Minotaurs.

565
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,540
 And it wouldn't make sense.

566
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,980
 Like Zeus could have been an alien.

567
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,860
 He's always constantly banging animals.

568
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,620
 Maybe that's some sort of parallel to hybrids.

569
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,500
 I know I've lost all my listeners in Greece.

570
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 Who now?

571
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,060
 They're like, "Oh, you're insulting our gods."

572
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,940
 You're next, Odin.

573
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,420
 You figure those gods could have easily been parallels for aliens.

574
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,140
 They're constantly doing alien stuff.

575
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,260
 They're constantly banging humans and making humans bang animals.

576
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,260
 Yeah.

577
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,780
 And so Prometheus bringing down fire.

578
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,340
 Maybe that was him bringing down a laser gun.

579
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,700
 He's like shooting cavemen's logs.

580
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
 Minotaurs are walking around.

581
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,140
 So that's pretty dope.

582
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,900
 But that story just ends with them singing Minotaurs.

583
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,220
 And Minotaurs don't chase them off.

584
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,100
 Minotaurs don't have bear snouts.

585
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,260
 They're not dating that young woman who's walking on the street.

586
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,020
 They're like, "Oh, here's bear snout Betty."

587
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,340
 And she's like, "Woohoo."

588
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,900
 Walking and meeting the Minotaurs.

589
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,620
 All of this stuff's going on in the same region.

590
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,260
 And I left you with a little bit of a cliffhanger.

591
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,540
 Those kids who were throwing rocks at those aliens at the summer camp.

592
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,420
 This was all happening in this little part of Russia.

593
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,580
 They're throwing rocks at the summer camp.

594
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,700
 I said the alien turned to look at them.

595
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,900
 That wasn't the end of that story.

596
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,020
 He turned to look at them.

597
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
 Shoots a laser at those kids as well.

598
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:17,140
 But I don't know if this is the same alien that just landed 5600 miles away.

599
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,740
 Probably like a day earlier.

600
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,060
 That one just kicked up dust.

601
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,380
 This alien's not having it.

602
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,660
 He sets the field on fire.

603
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,180
 He shoots them with his beam.

604
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,020
 And the ground just catches on fire.

605
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,460
 The grass catches on fire.

606
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,460
 The kids run off, scattering all directions.

607
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,580
 I'm sure one of them, the bravest of them all, grabbed some marshmallows and tried roasting

608
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,700
 it and the aliens started fire.

609
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,540
 No children were hurt if they were.

610
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,580
 It totally wouldn't have been covered up by the KGB.

611
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,900
 But that is those events.

612
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,540
 I got this from ThinkAbout@Docs.com.

613
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,740
 They got them from Russian UFO organizations newsletters.

614
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,460
 One of them was from the Yaroslav Group.

615
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,140
 It was FSR Volume 35 Number 3.

616
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,140
 That's their newsletter.

617
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,460
 The other one was from UFO Zone Russia.

618
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,580
 But I know ThinkAbout@Docs.com is pretty legit.

619
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,420
 Actually they're the ones that's so interesting.

620
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,580
 ThinkAbout@Docs.com was how I found the story of John Ford.

621
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:18,060
 Because ThinkAbout@Docs.com had the story and it said "No one fraud" listed in the story

622
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
 and I go "What?

623
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,100
 That's interesting that they're calling it out like that."

624
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,740
 And I clicked on it and it took me to the story of John Ford, which took me to the story

625
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
 of Preston Nichols.

626
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,260
 I love that story though of the Russians versus the aliens.

627
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,540
 Because and I'll wrap it up like this.

628
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,340
 I think it's super interesting.

629
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,940
 They're completely fearless.

630
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,380
 We have so many stories of Russians constantly shooting at aliens or provoking them in all

631
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,100
 sorts of ways.

632
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,860
 And we've seen so many interesting stories come out from behind the Iron Curtain during

633
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:52,060
 the Soviet Union that don't conform to the western view of aliens.

634
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:58,260
 I don't think I've ever come across a Russian alien story where they talk about the environment.

635
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,340
 There have been stories about like universal brotherhood but they're so much more rare

636
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,100
 than we have in the west.

637
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,860
 In the west a lot of times the aliens are seen as like this enlightened group in Eastern

638
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
 Europe.

639
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,340
 They're shooting lasers at kids.

640
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,780
 Now we have had stories like that in the west and we've talked about those on the show

641
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,060
 like the Casa Blanca invasion which is one of my favorite episodes.

642
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,820
 Where the aliens are a very evil or malevolent or they're kidnapping kids or doing stuff.

643
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,540
 So I just figured that was a good story to end the week on.

644
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,540
 It was a short story.

645
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,540
 I could fit it.

646
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
 That was the main thing.

647
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,540
 I was like what's an interesting short story that I can tell to end off this episode that

648
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:42,260
 doesn't end with me accusing a dead man of psychologically damaging children.

649
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,900
 I know a story where an alien opens fire on children.

650
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,540
 But no kids were hurt.

651
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
 So that's okay.

652
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,340
 And I think it's an interesting story of people fighting back against aliens.

653
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,020
 Actually now that I think about it they weren't necessarily fighting back against aliens.

654
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,180
 They were throwing rocks at people they didn't recognize.

655
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,140
 They didn't know who these guys were.

656
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,260
 They could have been anyone and they were just throwing rocks at them.

657
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,020
 Actually now that I think about it throwing rocks at aliens probably isn't the best idea

658
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,460
 because aliens may have been thinking hey you know that rock technology is really good.

659
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,660
 How do we master that?

660
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,020
 How do we beat them?

661
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,660
 Sure our laser guns and our ability to travel in time and walk through people's walls and

662
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,580
 appear in their bedrooms at night.

663
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
 That's all good.

664
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,060
 But how do we master this rock technology and they're steady in the rock.

665
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,780
 They're sitting in geology class and they're like hmm the teacher's like shaking their

666
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
 head.

667
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
 It's a montage all of a sudden.

668
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,220
 The teacher's like shaking their head and they're playing the song "Hot for Alien"

669
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,220
 teacher.

670
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,140
 And the kids are like trying to figure out more about rocks and then they're like drawn

671
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,140
 rocks and they're doing all this stuff and then in the end right when the song fades out
