1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
 account is like exists I don't really know what more to say it's just weird

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,520
 we'll talk about it and then we'll meet a man who got abducted by an alien now

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,960
 we've covered a lot of men like that why is it always men now that I think about

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,280
 it usually dudes right but we've met a lot of men who have been abducted by

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:29,320
 aliens however this one met his soulmate on a UFO today on Dead Rabbit Radio

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:38,040
 hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio I'm your

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,680
 host Jason Carpenter I'm having a great day I hope you guys are having a great

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,000
 day - I really do I really mean it it's funny that intro was kind of informal

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,060
 compared to how I normally do them why is it always that men are getting

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,800
 abducted by aliens I bet you if you looked at the statistics of it and I'm

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,440
 not going to I got other things to do I got a read stories about ghosts and

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,880
 goblins flowing around math what I bet you if you looked at the statistics I

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,440
 bet you it's like a 70/30 split 80/20 maybe and then this is anecdotal this is

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,600
 just going off of the hundreds and hundreds of UFO stories that I've read

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,320
 over the course of my life usually the female ones the ones where women are

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,040
 abducted it's horrifying it's really bad medical experiences they're getting

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,520
 poked and prodded and have an alien babies put in them or taken out of them

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,720
 every show often you'll get a woman who's like happy she's given birth to

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,320
 aliens but interesting I'll see if I can do some research on that I that is kind

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,440
 of my job is kind of my job I wonder if there really is a division of the sexes

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,280
 as far as it goes men versus women getting abducted but before we do that

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
 let's go ahead and get started with this episode this episode that I've

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,440
 prepared let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,560
 patreons Dalton Ogden Dalton thank you so much you've been supporting the show

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,480
 for a really really long time really appreciate that Dalton we're gonna give

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,040
 you the keys of the carbonar copter but we're not taking it anywhere right now

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,080
 so just just sit just don't move now for our first story let's travel to reddit

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
 now I know a lot of you guys don't like reddit I'm not a huge fan of reddit

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,320
 myself but I do find the fact that the information is permanent interesting as

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,080
 opposed to like 4chan where the information just did it and then it's

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,640
 gone the thing I like about reddit is that it's permanent things I hate about

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,400
 reddit take another podcast for me to mention the karma system and all that

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,200
 stupid stuff but let's take a look at reddit there is a reddit board it's

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,320
 really interesting one called RVI or reddit bureau of investigation where

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,680
 people go help help I saw like this weird fox walk by and I'm trying to figure

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,600
 out what type of fox it is or help help my family's being stalked it's weird it

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,400
 there's this weird it has a really wide swath of mysteries but it's a place that

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,840
 you can go to to post weird stuff not even weird stuff but just like sometimes

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,440
 it is like I'm getting crank calls from this number but I don't know how to

40
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,360
 track it down and sometimes it's like I saw this there's a butterfly in my

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,960
 apartment but my apartment's hermetically sealed how could it get in I'm the boy

42
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,280
 in the bubble and I'm especially allergic to butterflies help help please

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,440
 it's a place where you can post stuff on reddit and reddit will help figure it

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,600
 out now I found this one today this is from a user named fishatron3000

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,040
 fishatron tells this story on RVI looking for this advice I'm hanging out

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,880
 with my girlfriend she gets an ad on her Instagram account this sounds okay to be

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,080
 fair this starts off sounding like a horror movie from like 2015 when the

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,320
 technology was brand new and they're like what if the apps downloaded you

49
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,200
 remember all those horror movies you had like ring and phone and app and killer

50
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,640
 app there's a whole spate of horror movies that was based on your phone other

51
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,880
 than scream which did it right then you had like ring and vibrate and what was

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,800
 the one do not call no that was no no was it do not answer the caller not

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,760
 available something like that the Japanese horror movie that you would look

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,920
 at your phone and it would say like you hung up or something like that anyways

55
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,760
 let me fishatron3000 hanging out with your girlfriend she gets an ad from a

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,800
 weird Instagram account called @deepfrycrust the only picture on @deepfrycrust

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,760
 his account is a close-up of a patch of skin you know maybe it's like a creepy

58
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,160
 ARG something like that that's what I think a lot of you guys might think this

59
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,960
 is but it is this is kind of creepy so and I'll kind of go into a why it's

60
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,560
 creepy but anyways there's a patch of skin there's a close-up photo of a

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
 patch of skin so the boyfriend is like what that's kind of weird and there's a

62
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,560
 linked account on deep fry crust that takes you to an account called sour

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:56,920
 crust at sour crust so at sour crust has probably about well it's hard to say but

64
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,240
 at the time of me recording this I think has about nine images on their

65
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,600
 Instagram account quite a few of them are videos so I'm gonna play some audio

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,640
 clips here for you this first clip is footage it's handheld camcorder footage

67
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,560
 walking through a graveyard looking at gravestones

68
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:39,720
 burial site of the Sunter County does so weird right maybe like an ARG maybe a

69
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,960
 weird art project and you maybe think it's kind of a lot to throw at you first

70
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,040
 time you're like Jason I'm super creepy I'm listening to this at one of the

71
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,840
 warning sorry guys but it gets creepier so and also you might want to turn to all

72
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,880
 to warn you you need to turn the volume down on the next audio clip because it's

73
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,120
 kind of scared me and he's talking about in this video you just heard he's

74
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,920
 talking about the Sunter County does Sunter County does now I'll talk about

75
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,880
 them in a second but let me play you this second audio clip and be prepared

76
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,240
 for listening with headphones you might want to turn it down a bit this next

77
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,080
 clip is a video clip of a guy and the reason normally I don't do this because

78
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,880
 the video the video component of this I actually don't think is super important

79
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,320
 the audio is disturbing right I don't know why I don't know why maybe I'm just

80
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,000
 big old baby just agree that it's super disturbing yeah Jason that's super

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,960
 creepy kept me up all night long your podcast so spooky yay just agree with

82
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,080
 me for a second this next is a footage of a again it's handheld camera footage

83
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,440
 just like an old-school camera footage of a man narrating first he's walking by

84
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,240
 the gravestones of the Sumpter County does now he's walking down a dirt path

85
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,000
 this is Locklair Road near Sumpter South Carolina dirt road frontage road is the

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,160
 murder scene summer 1976 of the Sumpter County does young couple shot to death

87
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 just after bodies found by a trucker the next morning it's been an ongoing

88
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,480
 baffling mystery not so much who the perpetrator was but the identity of the

89
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,080
 young couple now that horrible noise you heard at the end that kind of jumps

90
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,160
 scary thing at that point an image flies by and I'll tell you what that is in a

91
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,800
 sec tell you what that is in a second I know it's hard to talk about a video on

92
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,600
 a podcast but this all it actually all works so the first thing he's walking

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,040
 through the graveyard he's like these are the graves of the Sumpter County

94
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,080
 does second video he's walking along this road and he's like this is where the

95
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,320
 Sumpter County does were found and when that weird noise cue hits the floating

96
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:54,680
 head of Jane Doe enters the picture for just a second now the head of Jane Doe

97
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,240
 is really going to be an introduction to who are the Sumpter County does who are

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:07,160
 the Sumpter County does back in 1976 August 9th 1976 in Sumpter County South

99
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,520
 Carolina his dude was just kind of hanging out in the middle of Sumpter

100
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,080
 County just kind of walking over along walking along that dirt road that that

101
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,720
 guy was subscribing in that video and he sees two bodies dead laying there each

102
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,960
 one had three gunshot wounds both of them were dead obviously they just weren't

103
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,520
 picnicking and they're like oh these know we're going to the doctor later these

104
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,520
 two people were dead and of course the cops come out pick them up start

105
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,240
 investigating it obvious murder the way they are both killed they're all had

106
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,000
 where shot through the throat through the chest through the head kind of hard

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,960
 to commit suicide that way so anyways the cops start investigating it as a

108
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,120
 murder but one of the first things you really need to you have the victims but

109
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,960
 you don't know who they are and a big thing about solving a murder is you

110
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,880
 know who they are they knew who they're last seen with where they work who their

111
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,920
 enemies they couldn't figure out who these people were this young man and a

112
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,720
 young woman anywhere between they think they're in their mid-20s but the corner

113
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,760
 goes they could be anywhere between 18th to 30 I'm gonna think they're like 26

114
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,880
 27 but based on these facts they can kind of figure out a couple different

115
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,320
 things one they did they weren't they were from out of town and they were

116
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,320
 visiting the area and a tow truck driver heard the guy call himself as Jacques or

117
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,640
 Jacques I like okay they have that and he was found with a ring that had the

118
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,720
 initials I believe JRS on it so they go maybe his name was Jacques he had a

119
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,400
 ton of dental work done and then the they had to bring in a dentist and he goes

120
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,000
 they whoever had this dentist work done spent a lot of money and actually looking

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,320
 at it it seems foreign it was weird it was weird he was able to say this is the

122
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,760
 procedure they use up in Canada so they're like okay his name might have been

123
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,000
 Jacques might be from Canada that would kind of make sense looks like he came

124
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,960
 from money he had a line on like one of those bulgoli watches bulgova whatever

125
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,120
 you call it now the girl they go this is probably a sister they kind of look

126
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,600
 alike but we just don't know much about her either they they had took all of her

127
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,440
 jewelry off took photos of the jewelry took photos of her shoes and then had

128
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,840
 no idea what her name was what they did was they took photos of their dead

129
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,040
 faces and begin to circulate them around the area saying do you know who these

130
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,720
 people are also all over sour crusts Instagram page there's photos of this

131
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:33,160
 dead woman's face now sometimes it's just her face flying onto screen sometimes

132
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,560
 it's her face sitting in a car as hip-hop music is playing that's a video

133
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,000
 where it's just like the car is a gif and it's moving up and down there's like

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,640
 and her head is in the picture kind of move in there he has one this was weird

135
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,800
 this shows me that this account is active one he had a post go up 10 minutes

136
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,000
 after I started looking at the page and that was a picture of a wanted poster or

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,760
 a missing persons poster in Asia and then he had a picture of the boy in the

138
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,520
 box which is a really tragic true crime story back in like the 1950s five-year-old

139
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,040
 kid was found dead in a box and they've never identified him to this day they

140
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,040
 don't know who killed him how he died I think they might know how he died but

141
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,440
 they don't know who he is he had a picture of the because that the boy in

142
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,560
 the box was another photo that they took a photo of his face and they circulated

143
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,760
 it all over the country really back then he had a photo of the boy in the box but

144
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,360
 the boy in the box mouth was replaced with a photo of Sumter County do Jane

145
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,600
 Doe's head while I was investigating the story that photo was removed so this is

146
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,400
 an active Instagram account eventually they kept they with the Sumter County

147
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,360
 Does they circulated the pictures everywhere people who had missing kids

148
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,560
 would come out and they go that's where I wish that was my kid because at least

149
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,760
 there'd be some closure but it's not my kid and they ended up when they buried

150
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,080
 them they didn't bury them when they put them in coffins they were glass the

151
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,120
 coffins had a glass lid it was an airtight coffin and for a year both

152
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,960
 these people were available for viewing you could just be like hey I family we're

153
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,840
 bored live what do you want to do Jane do John do yeah yeah we'll go see the

154
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,960
 Does again yeah you could go see these corpses at your local morgue and then

155
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,560
 after a year of that they buried them now they've done DNA testing they're not

156
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,880
 brother and sister they're not brother and sister they know that for sure but

157
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,120
 they still have no idea who these people are where they came from so and I

158
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,360
 guess this should say this they don't know who murdered them whoever murdered

159
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,480
 them is still on the loose Henry Lee Lucas kind of alluded to him that he

160
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,800
 might have done that he was a prolific serial killer but people have said now

161
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,280
 he's making it up because he made a bunch of stuff up he didn't know any

162
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,320
 details about it he was just like well I was in the county that day but so there's

163
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,520
 no leads on who killed him there's no leads on who these people were his out

164
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,760
 found dead in the middle of a field by side of road so what does any of this

165
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,400
 have to do with anything I don't know now you could go Jason you this is just a

166
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,920
 lark or some creepy pasta that you fell for and that's definitely possible

167
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,760
 definitely possible people fall for stuff all the time myself included but

168
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,320
 this is also the way this is the way that weirdos communicate nowadays right

169
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,240
 like yes it could be an art project and someone's like I'm gonna pick the super

170
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,760
 obscure case make much of heads float around and stuff like that this guy

171
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,080
 could also be super mentally deranged now people on the reddit Bureau of

172
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,800
 Investigation were like maybe it's the killer for this guy to have killed him

173
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,360
 back then let's assume most serial killers let's assume they're the youngest

174
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,280
 kills are around their mid to late teens so let's say this guy was 18 and 1976 who

175
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,760
 murdered these two people that would make him about 60 something now which I

176
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,600
 guess isn't too old to use Instagram but it's possible that the person who did

177
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,500
 this is now posting this stuff and learned basic photoshoppers getting his

178
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,400
 nephew to do it yeah uncle why do you want me to do all this creepy stuff oh I

179
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:12,680
 don't know son brings back memories and if he's like no I'm glad I'm getting

180
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,920
 paid enough to get a new computer and then I'm out and the uncle's hiding oh

181
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,200
 you'll be out all right you'll be out of sight if he's like dude I can hear you

182
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,400
 stand right behind me click I'm all done dude leaves nephew runs out another

183
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,600
 victim I don't know why I'm doing creepy uncle now look anyways the point is it's

184
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,960
 possible that the killer is announcing this on Instagram it's possible they

185
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,560
 never caught him it's possible that it's just an ARG someone which is an all

186
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,400
 alternate reality game for people who don't know it's some sort of like puzzle

187
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,280
 that the internet supposed to figure out and there's just like a interactive

188
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,080
 crime or something like that but it's also possible that there is someone who's

189
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:01,480
 obsessed with this crime and is reaching out about it is putting it out on the

190
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,880
 internet is adding random people to this because the guy was like I don't know why

191
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,040
 my girlfriend got added to this account it's definitely creepy I'm creeped out so

192
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,520
 is this just a someone looking for some weird marketing gimmick what are

193
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,640
 they what are they selling they for Halloween be this deceased woman's

194
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,920
 face weave his mask could be some weirdo looking for attention could be a serial

195
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,840
 killer he's letting the world know that he's never been caught or it could be a

196
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,360
 budding serial killer someone who's always been fascinated about the two

197
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,640
 people found at the side of the road the killer never caught the identities of the

198
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:44,480
 victim never known could be some crazy kid he's been obsessed with that case

199
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,760
 since he heard about it and now he's trolling Instagram looking for his next

200
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,200
 victim I don't know it's probably it's probably the ARG but I do think it's

201
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,160
 creepy do you think it's creepy let's go ahead and go on to our next story go to

 the chase we're going out to Mormon Mesa Nevada it's four in the morning spooky

213
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,680
 right super spooky time it's July 27th 1952 and there's a man named Truman

214
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,200
 Bethrom Truman Bethrom 55 years old he's a mechanic who works for a road

215
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,280

221
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,600

222
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,880
 totally awesome work with this guy maybe not work with them I would just show

223
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,800
 up at the work site and be like oh dude this is so funny I imagine everyone

224
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,960
 else is wearing like mechanic those onesies what are those called like

225
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,160
 unitards the overalls the coveralls whatever unitards they're walking around

226
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,600
 I would have loved to see much mechanics and unitards wait no I wouldn't I'd want

227
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,640
 to see that at all all these guys walking around and their coveralls he's

228
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,280
 walking in big shaman robes they keep getting caught in the gears of machine

229
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,240
 Truman anyways Truman road construction mechanics slash spiritual

230
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,760
 advisor he has a hobby he loves to collect seashells so where would you want

231
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,120
 to collect seashells the most you're right in the middle of Nevada which sounds

232
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,600
 stupid right but this whole thing about this guy sounds stupid but he wanted

233
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,760
 these seashells because you know it used to be like a ocean because Lena like back

234
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,320
 in time on the other's water everywhere and then there's like they went away it

235
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,920
 is like there's a bunch of icebergs melted and then it filled up the world

236
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,960
 full of water and then the icebergs came back I don't know but the water went

237
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,200
 back away so there's hope you like that you like that geology lesson kids who

238
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,000
 are at home for learning at home like mom dad please let the schools are open

239
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,280
 I don't want to learn science from this guy anymore anyways take it taking kids

240
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,600
 that's your science lesson for today you get an A all the water goes away now you

241
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,560
 have seashells everywhere because they were there for millions and billions of

242
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,040
 years he's hanging out now he's walking around this flashlight he's finding

243
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,720
 seashells now my question is when I'm reading this why is he doing this at

244
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,040
 night right like wouldn't wouldn't it be easier to look for miniature dead life

245
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,200
 forms during the day but whatever maybe it's his only time off so he's looking

246
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,000
 for seashells eventually he's like I was born this is stupid hobby I shouldn't

247
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,480
 have done this my life it sucks he go he gives up he goes to sleep in his truck

248
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,720
 and then he should be alone right it's middle of nowhere no one else is

249
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,320
 collecting seashells everyone ever literally everyone else has a better

250
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:50,840
 hobby than that and he hears a mumbling talking outside his car he's like what

251
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,440
 now he it's a foreign language doesn't he can't make it can't make it out but

252
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,600
 he comically pokes his little eyes and nose up over the door thingy so he can

253
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,920
 look out the window you know the the driver's side window and he sees ten

254
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,520
 people or are they people now he describes them he goes they look like

255
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,400
 normal people but they were short they're all either they were all four to five

256
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,760
 feet in height he says they weren't dwarfs they just were short humans and

257
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,840
 he sees them kind of gathered around his truck mumbling in this foreign language

258
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,240
 and then he kind of shakes his head and then he hears them perfectly talking

259
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:40,320
 English opens up his car door jumps out apparently he's five hundred pounds on

260
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,920
 the car shakes when he gets out and when he jumps out and now he sees about 75

261
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,160
 yards away now that he has full vision the roof of the cars not blocking his

262
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:54,640
 vision 75 yards away he sees a UFO floating there so he takes he's a go

263
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,960
 get it right he's a mechanic / spiritual advisor he doesn't wait for no one he

264
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,520
 jumps out of the car and he goes which one of you is the captain the guys look

265
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,640
 at each other and they go well huh our captain is on that ship over there that

266
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,400
 that's yeah I know what the only UFO within within orbit right now that yeah I

267
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,760
 know what ship you're talking about aliens are like yeah that one would you

268
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,600
 like to go and meet the captain it's like yeah totally let's go there this is

269
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,200
 how to describe the aliens quote Latin types that is with complexion something

270
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,800
 like Italians oh so you know those little just little dark-skinned dudes

271
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,720
 walking around it's so funny because that's pretty specific it's like you

272
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,560
 know they're kind of dark-skinned specifically those from northern Italy

273
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,200
 I would say more around the province of Vo like dude like okay fine there's just

274
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,480
 dark-skinned humans but or darker skin humans compared to him but anyways then

275
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,160
 he goes on quote all were neatly dressed in uniforms we've heard that before

276
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,120
 right up not finished all were neatly dressed in uniforms similar to those

277
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:11,520
 worn by greyhound bus drivers now come on like you have interstellar travel right

278
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,280
 you have the ability to bend the universe and you're like you're wearing

279
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,000
 like a gray suit little clip-on tie little collar and stuff like that these

280
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,840
 are elements that would make me think this is a dream at least with like grey

281
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,440
 aliens on the holographic suits the armor plating or the robots we've seen

282
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,200
 stuff that seems out of this world that makes you think oh maybe it might be

283
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,000
 something to it this guy's brain seems to be picking stuff out of his subconscious

284
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,960
 however there are arguments that aliens are so bizarre that sometimes you'll

285
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,200
 look at them and your brain can only perceive what you could recognize and

286
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,760
 things like that so we're gonna assume the story is true though just for the

287
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,080
 sake of how bonkers this whole man's life gets anyways he says they're all

288
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,440
 beautiful they didn't look old at all they had no creases or wrinkles or

289
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,760
 nothing which actually makes me think they kind of look like Odo from Deep

290
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,920
 Space Nine which is not an attractive looking alien he passed away then and

291
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,040
 not the alien he's still alive in the books but that actor Renee Aubrey

292
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,960
 Jonas yeah that sucked it early like that guy he's on Vincent I used to watch

293
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,360
 him way back then and Deep Space Nine is one of my favorite shows anyways and I

294
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,920
 wonder why my episodes get longer and longer he gets on to the UFO

295
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,240
 now he's hanging out with these ten dudes on the ship classic UFO layout

296
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,560
 bunch of like blinking lights and control panels and stuff like that but then we

297
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:40,560
 meet someone that we meet very rarely in UFO lore we meet a bombshell

298
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:50,560
 [Bomb Shell]

299
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:59,520
 aura, rain, tight, skirt, dressed in all red, big ol' alien boobies, long black

300
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,400
 flowing hair, perfect olive Latin complexion with not a wrinkle or a crease

301
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,200
 but she's sexy she doesn't look like Odo she looks like a goddess she liked

302
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,720
 that music there so anyways that's aura reigns now you know true man he's a

303
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,840
 married man but come on man when you meet the most beautiful woman in the

304
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:31,280
 universe what are you gonna do he immediately falls in love with aura

305
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:38,480
 reigns now he's thinking this chick is super hot this chick and he turns to the

306
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,960
 camera is out of this world and the audience is like yeah yeah yeah and he

307
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,720
 goes okay so can I meet your captain and she's kind of stares at him dumbfounded

308
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,320
 for a second she goes oh no no no I am the captain turns to the camera beauty

309
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,080
 and smarts yay audience claps so anyways she's the captain of this spaceship the

310
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,440
 hottest chick in the universe is also in charge who doesn't like that so basically

311
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,520
 then we get the kind of UFO backstory stuff she says the aliens are from the

312
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,120
 planet Clarion that's from the opposite side of the Sun there's another planet

313
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,000
 on the other side of the Sun which is actually an old myth because if something

314
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,600
 was on the other side of the Sun we would never know it all of our satellites

315
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,880
 orbit Earth like we can't technically we can but we've never really like as far

316
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,760
 as I know launch the rocket to see the other side of the Sun that people said

317
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,200
 that if there was something on the other side of the Sun we would detect the

318
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,880
 gravity of it but that's been a myth that there's an other Earth this one's

319
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,240
 called Clarion it's an earth where they have listen to how amazing this place is

320
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:52,440
 no wars no strife no juvenile delinquency they said that planet Earth is the

321
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,320
 only planet in the galaxy that has strife and the reason why we can never do

322
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,920
 interplanetary travel is because of our strife once we learn to be peaceful we

323
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,800
 can travel the universe with beauties like ororanes now you're thinking Jason

324
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,360
 that sounds brilliant I want to go there right now I'm gonna jump off her I'm

325
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,600
 gonna get on space soon I'm gonna jump off Earth and we're gonna stay there so

326
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,240
 the planet Clarion floats and I'm gonna land on there that is a good idea and

327
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,080
 100% scientifically accurate but let me finish telling you now now that is a

328
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,080
 great thing right I shouldn't mind my no wars who are those lame those dude I

329
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,200
 love stabbing guys with sticks yeah war is awesome war does is not fun it's

330
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,280
 fascinating as it is to read about in history books it's not fun I love a

331
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,960
 planet where they was just all in history but before you go that sounds

332
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,400
 awesome you got it also remember those the 1950s we're talking about 1950s so

333
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,280
 this is their paradise in the 1950s when this story is happening so Truman has

334
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,560
 some other tidbits of how amazing this world is with no juvenile delinquency no

335
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:03,160
 war no strife every single person on the planet is Christian there is no liquor

336
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:09,040
 at all on the planet at all and you're like Jason that's fine I'm born again

337
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,840
 Christian and I don't drink yeah yeah me too but that might get us to jump off

338
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,840
 earth and float around but then we get to these next two ones the only music is

339
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:27,880
 polka and the only type of dance is square dance so for Truman that might

340
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,280
 have been a complete paradise people are like honey pack the bags we're going to

341
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,880
 Clarion it sounds amazing I don't think I can be on a I absolutely know for if

342
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,320
 I'm Christian but I cannot be on a planet where everybody was Christian you

343
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,760
 gotta have like some sort of like diversity and stuff like that right but

344
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,640
 anyway so that was Truman's that was Truman's most amazing society I wonder

345
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,000
 if they had like marijuana he's like no liquor but methamphetamine for everyone

346
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,400
 there's just meth needles falling from the sky you're like ah I'm a Christian but

347
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:03,240
 I'm so I am tweaking tweaking for Jesus yeah like why just no liquor like there's

348
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,680
 so many other damaging drugs out there that are worse than liquor there's no

349
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,040
 liquor but here's some crocodile everyone's limbs are rotting anyways the

350
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,920
 point is that it was this paradise so this newspaper so he has dropped back off

351
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,360
 on earth right everything's hunky-dory has to tell us a story now that rhyme now

352
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,280
 he tells the story he does tell the story to the media there's a newspaper in

353
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:34,040
 the redondo beach called the Daily Breeze in September 25th 1953 they published

354
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,640
 this story and it was such a huge hit such a huge hit I wish other newspapers

355
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,360
 said this is kind of awesome they had a vote for who what was the best story we

356
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,200
 had this year and we'll reprint it and this story won a best story of the year

357
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,160
 so on October 3rd just like a month later they reprinted it in whole people

358
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:01,080
 loved this story back in the day now usually when people get abducted by

359
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,440
 aliens it kind of affects their life like they get abducted by aliens and they

360
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,200
 realize that we're all interconnected and there's a universal brotherhood and I

361
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,880
 shouldn't hate people based on things like race or nationally stuff like that

362
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,280
 we're all connected sometimes and it leaves them with a deep-seated fear of

363
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,360
 the beyond sometimes they remember it sometimes they just have visions of it

364
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:30,840
 terrifies them he just gets super horny he decides that he's totally in love

365
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,880
 with aura range that that is his soulmate now he was already a mechanic

366
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,840
 spiritual advisor now he's going full bore to be the spiritual advisor and his

367
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,920
 1950s wife is up to here Truman I'm up to here with your Babylon and your UFO and

368
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,640
 your aura this and your aura that she actually divorces him she specifically

369
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,840
 divorces him because he's in love with another woman he's in love with aura

370
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,360
 Reigns he cannot let her go now he's just kind of hanging out doesn't have

371
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,880
 anyone in his life except his secretary he hires a secretary because now he

372
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,800
 started a cult called the sanctuary of thought in Prescott Arizona he has this

373
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,960
 compound he hires a secretary to work with him she walks in the interview room

374
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,680
 he's looking down at the paper he's like what are your qualifications miss looks

375
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:31,360
 up curvy all of skin woman hires her simply because she looks like aura

376
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,800
 Reigns now guys you shouldn't be thanking with the lower half of your body

377
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,480
 you're gonna make bad decisions now I would like to say that because he hired

378
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,560
 her she was comically inept and she's like you told me to balance the books

379
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,360
 boss but I was walking over the Grand Canyon and they fell down

380
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,640
 secretary I love you but I don't know maybe she was actually competent at her

381
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,880
 job and looked like a hot space alien but he went on to start writing books

382
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,560
 because he got a lot of publicity out of this thing a lot of publicity out of

383
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,880
 this thing started writing books about Clarion started writing books about

384
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:16,360
 UFOs and spiritual and stuff he ends up passing away like all men do 1969 he

385
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,560
 lived to be 70 years old and he never became reunited with the true love of

386
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,200
 his life sure he hired a woman who looked an awful lot like her but it's not

387
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,720
 the same right however however

388
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,920
 we're gonna do it to be continued on this episode because not only do I have a

389
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:48,120
 story that's not very well known of him meeting aura Reigns again but possible

390
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:56,140
 proof possible proof that the aliens not only met him on Mormon Mesa but they

391
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:03,400
