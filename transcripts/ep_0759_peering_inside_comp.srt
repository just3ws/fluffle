1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Is it possible that the South Koreans have found the cure for beautiful, perfect skin?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,640
 And then we travel to Mansfield, Louisiana to take a look at a house that so haunted,

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,120
 reality may have wiped it off the map.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,120
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:29,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,480
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,080
 Hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,480
 Whatever the fluffle did, I'm sure it was totally great.

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,280
 Until I start seeing crime scene reports where people were shouting "Dead Rabbit Radio!"

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,480
 over the corpses of their newly fallen foes.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,680
 Don't do that, don't do that.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,760
 When I say promote the show, that's not what I mean.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,480
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now wiping blood off of his hands.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,240
 One of our newest Patreon supporters and a longtime supporter of the show.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
 It's Lars Dudesnein.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,680
 Everyone give a round of applause to Lars Dudesnein.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,440
 Shake his hand, get some DNA all over you.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,960
 Lars, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,920
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
 Just help spread the word about the show.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,480
 Really, really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,280
 Remember, that does not involve crime scenes.

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,800
 If you're writing the name of the podcast in blood, that is not going to help me.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,600
 Lars, let's go ahead and we're gonna take, I think it's time for a new vehicle.

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,120
 I think it's time for a new vehicle.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
 Let's see.

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
 Nah, never mind.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,920
 To Lars, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,400
 We're gonna take a nice leisurely journey all the way from Dead Rabbit Command to South

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
 Korea.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:51,440
 As we're flying out to South Korea, everyone's like, South Korea's hot right now, right?

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,320
 You got the band, BTS, they're actually old now.

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,440
 They're like, they're like in their 20s.

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
 They're like 25, 26.

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,600
 I don't even know if they're still technically a boy band, but they're still running around.

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
 You got Squid Games.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,360
 Squid Games is hot.

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,760
 You know, people like eating candy and getting shot in the back of the brain.

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,120
 It's not just a normal day in America, but in South Korea they make a television show

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
 about it.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,960
 But that's not why we're in South Korea.

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,080
 We're not in South Korea right now, because it's super hot.

44
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,800
 I came across, I was just falling down the rabbit hole of research, I came across some

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,160
 really cool South Korean health recipes.

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,400
 Because I know that's what you think of.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,280
 When you think of South Korea, you look at those boys from BTS, you look at those grown

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,960
 men from BTS and you go, they have really good skin.

49
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,960
 You're like, Jason, no.

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,760
 Well, first off, why are you watching BTS videos?

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,240
 Secondly, why is that your go-to thing?

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,480
 It's not about their music.

53
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
 It's not about their fashion.

54
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,720
 It's about their skin.

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,360
 Well, guys, listen.

56
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,600
 You wonder how you like BTS.

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,960
 They do have pretty good skin.

58
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,440
 And I'll say this.

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,640
 I did not find out about these stories, because I googled, "How do South Koreans have such

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
 great skin?"

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,440
 I actually stumbled across these stories.

62
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,960
 Okay, we're just going to stop.

63
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,000
 We're going to stop talking about how I got the stories.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,160
 Let me tell you these stories.

65
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,440
 In South Korea, there was this young woman and she didn't have perfect skin.

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,800
 Like the grown adults from the band BTS.

67
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,440
 And she's like, oh man, if only I could spend $10,000 a day on makeup to look like this.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
 But she can't.

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
 You know, she's a young girl.

70
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,960
 High school, I think it was.

71
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,600
 But she hears from this old lady on the street.

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,080
 She's like, "Psss."

73
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,480
 The old lady says, "I overheard you talking about wanting crystal clear skin.

74
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,480
 I have the perfect treat for you."

75
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,000
 And she holds out a big bag of sesame seeds.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,160
 And she goes, "Are you telling us another fairy tale?

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
 Hold on."

78
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,320
 She holds out this big bag of sesame seeds.

79
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,400
 And she goes, "I overheard you talking to yourself about wanting to be beautiful.

80
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
 This is the tip.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,080
 You go home and you draw a bath.

82
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,880
 And then you fill it full of sesame seeds.

83
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,080
 And then you get in the bath and the sesame seeds, I don't know.

84
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,880
 She didn't really explain this part.

85
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,280
 She said, "That'll work."

86
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,720
 But imagine like the sesame seeds slowly caressing your skin.

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,360
 It's like a defoiliation thing.

88
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,000
 So like all the grody skins floating away.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,520
 And then the seed, you just kind of like move around the bathtub and the seeds are like rubbing

90
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
 up against you.

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
 And you're like, oh, I can actually feel.

92
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,720
 It's like basically imagine sleeping in liquid pumice.

93
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,880
 So you're like, Jason, that sounds like the most uncomfortable thing ever.

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
 Maybe, but your skin would be smooth.

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,120
 So she takes this beauty tip from this old crone living on the street and she buys this

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,760
 bag of sesame seeds.

97
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,680
 She goes home, she makes the bath and she's, "Oh, this is so relaxing."

98
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,360
 She's kind of moving around and the seeds are rubbing up against her.

99
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
 And she loves it.

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,040
 She feels like her skin is instantly becoming smoother.

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,160
 Psychosomatic, maybe, right?

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
 Maybe it's actually working.

103
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,000
 And so she starts taking these baths more frequently and she starts taking them for

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,600
 a longer amount of time.

105
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,040
 And so one day though, her mom's sitting in the living room reading a book.

106
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
 She goes, "That's weird.

107
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,920
 My daughter's been taking a bath for an awfully long time.

108
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,920
 I should go see what she's up to."

109
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
 The mom, she gets up.

110
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,920
 I don't know why I'm so much.

111
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
 I turned it.

112
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,840
 This is actually like a two paragraph story.

113
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,480
 I've turned it into an Ariel Stein novel.

114
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,280
 The mom slowly creeps up the stairs.

115
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,840
 Eat, eat, eat.

116
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,360
 And she sees the bathroom door and on the other side of the door she hears sobbing.

117
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
 Her daughter sobbing.

118
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
 Oh, no.

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:06,280
 And the mom reaches for the door knob and opens the door.

120
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,560
 And inside the bathtub sits her daughter sobbing.

121
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,600
 Half through pain, half in terror.

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:26,720
 She had taken such a long bath this time that her pores opened up.

123
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,320
 Her pores opened up and the sesame seeds slid into her pores.

124
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,720
 She's covered in these little seeds sticking out of almost every inch of her body.

125
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:47,040
 She's sitting there in blood soaked water with a toothpick as she pops seed after seed

126
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:55,200
 after seed out of her completely mangled skin.

127
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,040
 So I know you're going, "Whoa, Jason.

128
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
 That's amazing.

129
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
 What news?

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
 What newspaper?

131
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,800
 Did you get that totally true story out of?

132
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,400
 Or are you reading creepypasta?

133
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,680
 Has that rabbit radio just become creepypasta?

134
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
 Wait.

135
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,440
 It has not become creepypasta.

136
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,240
 Technically, that's an urban legend.

137
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,160
 So I'm allowed, that's the rule.

138
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,280
 I'm allowed to tell urban legends on this show because we can investigate them.

139
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,800
 In South Korea, this is a big urban legend.

140
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,720
 About the young woman who got sesame seeds stuck in her.

141
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,800
 Now I wasn't able to find any real proof of this.

142
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,200
 What's interesting is South Korea really, really believes in urban legends.

143
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:44,280
 Like in America, we have the vanishing hitchhiker and then on the border we have LaLorna and

144
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,640
 they pronounce it correctly.

145
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,600
 And even like Bigfoot, Wendigo, that stuff would be considered urban legends at a certain

146
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
 point.

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,520
 But no one has ever passed a law regulating the vanishing hitchhiker.

148
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,800
 In South Korea, the elevators used to not have stop buttons.

149
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,960
 There's a very, very popular urban legend about a young woman who lives on the 14th

150
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,120
 floor of the building.

151
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,480
 And so this handsome man gets on the elevator with this young woman late at night and they're

152
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,480
 going up and his floor is the 13th floor and hers is the 14th floor and he's charming.

153
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,720
 He's really taking her off guard.

154
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,880
 Really likes this guy.

155
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,160
 And then the elevator dings and he gets off on the 13th floor and then he turns around

156
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,440
 and he goes, "See you on the next floor.

157
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,320
 I'm going to stab you to death."

158
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,920
 And he runs down the hallway and then the elevator door shuts and there's no stop button

159
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,000
 on the South Korean elevators.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,080
 So it's slowly going up and for the time between the 13th floor and the 14th floor she has nowhere

161
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 to go.

162
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
 She's completely panicked.

163
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,680
 She knows she's going to be brutally murdered when these doors open and sure enough the door

164
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,920
 is open and the man rushes in and stabs her to death.

165
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,040
 Because of that, that's a very popular urban legend, there are now stop buttons installed

166
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,760
 in South Korean elevators.

167
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,320
 Now I said, I imagine they always had stop buttons, but then we didn't have a long time

168
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,920
 ago about a South Korean train caught on fire and it turns out like they're like, "Oh, we

169
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,760
 don't need fire extinguishers on a train."

170
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,880
 So they do have some weird safety stuff, but and there's an urban legend about a woman

171
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,800
 who puts a tampon up and there was a cockroach egg.

172
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,400
 There was like cockroach eggs on the tampon and when she inserts it, she then gives herself

173
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,120
 cockroach eggs all throughout her guts.

174
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,640
 And that's an urban legend, but to this day apparently, because I saw like screen grabs

175
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,640
 of this, to this day whenever any sort of insect is like photographed on a tampon or

176
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,200
 a sanitary pad, it's in the news.

177
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,600
 It's such an urban legend that people, they talk about it in the news, they're like warning,

178
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,040
 women do not use tampons this month.

179
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,560
 Here's a photo of one tampon with a cricket on it.

180
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:06,080
 So it is an urban legend about the sesame seeds, but they take urban legends super seriously

181
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
 over there.

182
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,800
 And then you're wondering if there is, if that is a beauty tip, soak yourself in sesame

183
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,400
 seeds and then someone goes, "What if your pores open up?"

184
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,840
 When I say somebody a six year old, because obviously if your pores are opening up so

185
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,280
 wide that sesame seeds can go into them, I think you have it.

186
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,440
 Wait, sesame seeds are the tiny ones, right?

187
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,600
 Oh, I don't know.

188
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,280
 Those might fit in you.

189
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,000
 I was imagining like a little sunflower seed, like when you pop it open and blah blah blah

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,880
 but sesame seeds are the ones on the like the hamburger buns.

191
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,360
 Those, those can totally, oh my God, this story's ten times more scary.

192
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,160
 Those can totally fit in your pores, I think.

193
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,440
 I think, right?

194
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,560
 Crazy urban legends that actually like affect society.

195
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,240
 People don't pick up hitchhikers because of the story of the vanishing hitchhiker.

196
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,720
 People don't pick up hitchhikers because of the totally true stories of people getting

197
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,320
 murdered by hitchhikers, not because, oh, and then I'm afraid the hitchhiker might disappear

198
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,040
 before I get to their destination.

199
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,240
 But in South Korea, you have a different issue.

200
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,040
 And while we're in South Korea, I said I was going to give you beauty tips.

201
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
 Beauty tips, right?

202
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
 I only gave you one.

203
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
 I got to give you another one.

204
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,160
 There, there was this, there's this young boy in South Korea.

205
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,240
 We're walking down the street and we see this young guy and he's kind of kicking a can down

206
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,000
 the street and he's like, oh man, not having the best day.

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,480
 He's first off, my sister was in the bathtub all day.

208
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,760
 And then they had a rush out of the emergency room.

209
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,360
 I don't know what's going on.

210
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,200
 I just heard her screaming in pain and the mother was sobbing and I was like, oh, you

211
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
 drama queen.

212
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,000
 They pull her body out of the blood-soaked bathtub, whatever.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,360
 Always looking for attention.

214
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,520
 But I get unwanted attention because I have acne.

215
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,720
 I have like acne scarring on my face.

216
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,160
 This young man is very, very self-conscious about that.

217
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,240
 So he's walking on the street and he sees this hideous old woman.

218
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,760
 She's putting away her stalk of sesame seeds and she sees this young man walking by and

219
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,960
 she goes, young man, you look like you're self-conscious about your facial acne.

220
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,600
 And he's like, yeah, it does bug me a lot.

221
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,760
 And she goes, I have the perfect cure for that.

222
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,960
 What you do is you catch a cockroach.

223
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,800
 And that was the sound of nearly everyone shutting off the podcast at once.

224
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,920
 Except for one South Korean guy being like, go on.

225
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,360
 I need to know this beauty secret that obviously will not end badly.

226
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,160
 The old lady goes, catch a cockroach.

227
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,920
 You catch a cockroach and you put it on your pillow and then you go sleep.

228
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,680
 When you wake up, your face will be perfectly smooth.

229
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,080
 Like nothing happened.

230
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,360
 Now this is great, right?

231
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,280
 Wouldn't we love beauty secrets like this?

232
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,480
 I was watching a YouTube video the other day and it said, the way you prepare your coffee

233
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,760
 can make you lose 30 pounds in a month.

234
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
 Now obviously I know it's a scam.

235
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,800
 That's not how it works.

236
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,680
 But wouldn't that be great, right?

237
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,720
 You just like, people are super emaciated all the time.

238
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,520
 They're like, oh, I've been making my coffee the wrong way this whole time.

239
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
 Oh, an accident.

240
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
 No.

241
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,920
 But anyways, it'd be great if you could just grab a cockroach and then your face looks

242
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
 the way you want it to.

243
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,560
 Well, this young man, he catches a cockroach, goes to sleep.

244
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,560
 When he wakes up the next day, the cockroach is gone.

245
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,360
 He's like, oh, call me later, so he'd hard.

246
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,800
 Cockroach ran away in the middle of the night.

247
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,240
 But he wakes up and before he can be sad that his new buddy's gone, his face is perfectly

248
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,320
 smooth.

249
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,080
 Like all of the acne scars have been filled in.

250
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,920
 He has this full face.

251
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,480
 He's like, yes, this is awesome.

252
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,000
 That old crone was right.

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,800
 And so he's at school later that day and he's itching.

254
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
 Oh man, I don't know.

255
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
 I don't know.

256
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 My face does itch.

257
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
 It looks beautiful, but it's a little itchy.

258
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 That's weird.

259
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,800
 And as he's itching and he starts to feel something like move under his skin.

260
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,200
 And he's thinking, did the cockroach get under my skin?

261
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,760
 Is that why my face is so smooth?

262
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,840
 And then he looks, the cockroach is not in his skin.

263
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,880
 It's not the cockroach why his skin is itchy.

264
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,040
 He's like, oh, that's a relief because I was afraid this story would end with a cockroach

265
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,840
 crawling around my face.

266
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,200
 And I could feel its little legs on my muscle tissue and I can actually watch it like my

267
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,960
 face shift as its wings flutter.

268
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,000
 Instead, as he's itching his face, he realizes that all of the places where his face is now

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,640
 puffy are full of cockroach eggs.

270
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,880
 They're slowly moving.

271
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,280
 They're starting to wake up.

272
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
 Okay.

273
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,240
 Technically, technically, that it's not creepypasta.

274
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
 It's not creepypasta.

275
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,760
 That it's an urban legend.

276
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
 And it's great, isn't it?

277
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
 Isn't that terrifying?

278
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,200
 I remember a long time I heard the story about the woman who was licking.

279
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,320
 I think I told this one before in the podcast.

280
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,800
 Is one of those urban legends that totally freaked me out.

281
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
 I still don't do it to this day.

282
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,000
 She was licking envelopes for her wedding and wedding invitations.

283
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,040
 It wasn't her whole ceremony.

284
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,400
 She's like, yay, I'm the happiest woman alive.

285
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,120
 She's putting wedding invitations and she got a paper cut on her tongue.

286
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,280
 And long story short, her tongue started throbbing and no one can figure out why.

287
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,280
 And then like she went to the oral, I guess the long story is not short, but she goes

288
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,120
 to the oral hygienist, she goes to the dentist, she's going to all these different people.

289
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,180
 Finally, she goes to the doctor and he cuts her tongue with a scalpel and two cockroaches

290
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,880
 fly out of her tongue.

291
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,160
 And it turns out that there are cockroach eggs on the, on like the adhesive.

292
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,520
 You can't tell me cockroach eggs aren't on adhesives.

293
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,280
 That's why I don't use tape.

294
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
 I only use nails.

295
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,920
 I only use nails, tacks and staples or everything.

296
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,640
 If there was, if there was a cockroach egg on a piece of Scotch tape, I don't care, but

297
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,200
 if there's cockroach, I'm not licking Scotch tape.

298
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,360
 You can't tell me that.

299
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,840
 I don't think they turn into full grown cockroaches and two cockroaches fly out of your mouth.

300
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,480
 I don't care if it's just one cockroach.

301
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,200
 I don't care if it's just cockroach eggs.

302
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,760
 I don't want them in my tongue.

303
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,040
 I don't want them in my body.

304
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
 I don't want them under my skin.

305
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
 It's super gross.

306
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,640
 Yeah, I just read an article today.

307
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:29,920
 There's some new flesh eating STD going around Britain.

308
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,640
 And they go, there's only 60 cases so far.

309
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,840
 Way too many cases of any flesh eating STD.

310
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,520
 And what makes this, you got like these little red ulcers all over your genitals.

311
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,720
 What makes this one horrible, other than the fact that in quotes words like red ulcers

312
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,000
 and genitals, this one can be spread through nonsexual touch.

313
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,920
 So if someone is having a particularly aggressive day with their flesh eating STD and they're

314
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,880
 itching it and then they go cantaloupe shopping.

315
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,080
 This is in England by the way.

316
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,080
 I'm not super worried about it right now.

317
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,760
 But in the UK they have 60 cases of this.

318
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,880
 You go to get, you think you're just buying a cantaloupe.

319
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,400
 Instead you got big red ulcers on your fingers.

320
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
 At best, right?

321
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
 I don't know.

322
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,040
 Would you rather have ulcers on your fingers or any genitals?

323
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,540
 I use my fingers more often.

324
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
 So I don't know.

325
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,560
 Put that in the comments.

326
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,680
 Comment, like and subscribe.

327
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,800
 Let me know where you want your flesh eating ulcers.

328
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,240
 Lars, let's go ahead and leave behind South Korea.

329
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,960
 We are going to hop in the carbonar copter.

330
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,600
 Let's call that bad boy in.

331
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:47,240
 We're headed all the way out to Mansfield, Louisiana.

332
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
 It's funny.

333
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,600
 I have been watching Squid Games.

334
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
 Not done yet.

335
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
 I got two episodes left.

336
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
 I thought the South Korean tourist board must hate this show.

337
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,000
 It makes South Korea look like the biggest cesspool.

338
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,040
 I've seen movies that make North Korea look better than Squid Games make South Korea.

339
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,880
 My first two episodes are about people having their organs removed against their will to

340
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,800
 pay off a debt.

341
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,280
 And I looked at the exchange rate.

342
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,040
 We're talking like $20,000.

343
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,520
 They're like, "First we'll take one of your eyeballs."

344
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,560
 This woman is so poor her feet are going to fall off.

345
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,360
 I mean, it's insane.

346
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,160
 I'm watching them.

347
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
 I'm like, "What?"

348
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,120
 If I was in the South Korea tourist board, I'd be like, "We have to start counter-programming

349
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
 right away."

350
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,720
 Our country is not run by organ-stealing mafias.

351
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,880
 And old women, you can keep your feet.

352
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,800
 If you come to South Korea, we will not take your feet.

353
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 It's bleak.

354
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,300
 It constantly rains.

355
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,300
 It's horrible.

356
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,320
 I never want to go to South Korea.

357
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,800
 And you're the horrible cockroach problem as well.

358
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,840
 Apparently, you can just walk down the street.

359
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,480
 If I had to capture a cockroach here, it would take me a long time to find a cockroach.

360
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,920
 Apparently, some high school kid can just pick one up walking down the street.

361
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,760
 So South Korea is not the place to be.

362
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,880
 But where the place to be is, is Mansfield, Louisiana.

363
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,240
 Lars, go ahead and land that carbonicopter here.

364
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,760
 The story starts around the 1960s.

365
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,560
 The story was posted online.

366
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,520
 So we're trying to like piece together like actual dates.

367
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,920
 And it was posted by a young woman.

368
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,120
 And this is the story of her grandparents and her mother.

369
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,800
 So we're going to take their point of view going into this.

370
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,760
 But I want to give a shout out to Natty Cakes for sharing this story.

371
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,640
 It's found it quite creepy.

372
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,840
 Good Halloween story.

373
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,680
 Mansfield, Louisiana, there's this beautiful house.

374
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,120
 And we're going to sign these names.

375
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,480
 We don't know the people's actual names.

376
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,800
 But Paul and his wife Eileen and Eileen's sister Susan, they all move into this beautiful house.

377
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,480
 And Paul is the Baptist minister in town.

378
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,920
 And they already have a family that is pretty growing up as well.

379
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,280
 This isn't a starter home.

380
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,360
 This is a home where they're just going to spin the rest of their days.

381
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:18,520
 But shortly after moving in, Susan started to lose her mind.

382
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:26,200
 Now looking back, we may be able to see some of her behavior as early Alzheimer's or dementia.

383
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,720
 In the 1960s, these things weren't commonly known.

384
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,880
 All the family really could say was she went nuts.

385
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
 She went crazy.

386
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,680
 She was acting oddly in the house.

387
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,440
 And she passes away.

388
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,720
 Tragic, tragic event.

389
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
 But life goes on.

390
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,040
 After Susan dies, Eileen started acting weird as well.

391
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,080
 One day Eileen is sitting in the kitchen table and her daughter Judy is there.

392
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,640
 She's kind of talking.

393
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,760
 Now her mother had been acting weird for a while at this point.

394
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,920
 But again, what do you chalk it up to?

395
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,160
 "I'm just getting old, getting senile."

396
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,000
 That was the word we used as a kid, senile.

397
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,200
 But as Judy is sitting there, looking at her mom and they're just having this conversation,

398
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:26,440
 she sees a shadow standing behind her.

399
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,440
 Trick of the light?

400
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
 Maybe.

401
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,360
 But the shadow begins to move.

402
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,880
 The shadow begins to dance.

403
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:45,280
 This rhythmic motion behind Eileen.

404
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:53,640
 And then as Judy is sitting there watching this happen, she sees the shadow crawl into

405
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,840
 her mother.

406
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:07,200
 That is when the story stopped being, I think, mom is going crazy.

407
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,320
 I think mom's getting senile too.

408
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,440
 Mom may have been possessed.

409
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,560
 This is Louisiana.

410
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,640
 Paul's a minister, a Baptist minister.

411
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,840
 So you believe in this stuff.

412
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,960
 You believe in possession.

413
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,080
 You believe in the battle between good versus evil.

414
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,040
 It's not just a physical one, not just a moral one, but a spiritual one.

415
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,680
 These beings are out there.

416
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,920
 Eileen, when she gets in her moods, when she gets senile or crazy, however you want to describe

417
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,000
 it, she talks in a different voice.

418
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,840
 The family starts to worry because it's one thing to have someone in the house who forgets

419
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,840
 to take their medicine every once in a while or forgets to put the tea kettle off.

420
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,240
 But when they're actively angry, when they have these bursts of wrathful vengeance and

421
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,160
 their voice changed and you just don't know what's going to happen, now you're really

422
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,520
 dealing with a powder keg situation.

423
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:10,680
 The family starts to tell Paul, because again, their children, Judy is an adult.

424
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,280
 The families have spread off.

425
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,200
 Their kids have had kids at this point.

426
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,920
 So they're not living in the house with Paul and Eileen.

427
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,400
 But their kids are saying, "I think something's wrong with the house."

428
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,200
 And they're directly talking to their father, Paul.

429
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
 Something's wrong with mom.

430
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
 "I know, I know.

431
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,840
 No, no, no, we think it's spiritual, dad."

432
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,320
 Paul thinks about this for a while and he goes, "I know.

433
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,720
 I know there's something wrong with this house, but we're not going to leave this house."

434
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,840
 So Paul and Eileen continue to live in this house.

435
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:53,040
 One day Paul shares a very troubling story with his daughter, Judy.

436
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
 He says, "I know you have these issues with mom.

437
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:02,040
 She's acting weird and you think it's something spiritual."

438
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,920
 Something happened a couple of nights ago.

439
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,040
 She figured she should know.

440
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,920
 I woke up in the middle of the night.

441
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,360
 Eileen was already awake.

442
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,520
 She was standing over me while I was sleeping.

443
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,520
 She had a knife in her hand.

444
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,800
 Judy is like, "Okay, this has gone to a totally different level.

445
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,800
 Dad, if you're not going to work within the system, i.e. the church to try to, I don't

446
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 know.

447
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,200
 I don't believe in exorcisms."

448
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
 That's the thing.

449
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
 I'm Southern Baptist.

450
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,400
 We don't really believe that there's some sort of right.

451
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,280
 A power of Christ compels you.

452
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
 The whole ritual, that's not something Baptist believe in.

453
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,200
 So this would be par for the course.

454
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,240
 You'd be like, "Well, we're just going to pray and we're just going to keep doing our

455
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
 thing."

456
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,720
 But Judy goes, "Listen, I don't feel safe for my mom or my dad."

457
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,720
 So she consults a psychic, which is a big no-no in Baptist culture.

458
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,360
 But she consults a psychic and a psychic does this investigation and the psychic comes back

459
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,560
 and says, "That house is a portal to hell and the only thing you can hope to do is burn

460
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,440
 it to the ground."

461
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,000
 But of course no one's going to do that.

462
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,640
 Skeletons could be walking out of your closet.

463
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,880
 You're still going to want your investment back from buying the house.

464
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,280
 So they don't do that.

465
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,680
 Shortly after the psychic gets involved in the investigation, her own son dies in an

466
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:38,680
 accident and the psychic blamed that house for it and said, "Don't ever contact me again.

467
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,920
 I'm not going to help you guys.

468
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,840
 I want nothing to do with your family."

469
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,520
 Considering most psychics are scam artists and they only want your money, that alone

470
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,160
 is very telling.

471
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,560
 The odd incidents just start piling up in this house.

472
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:09,360
 One night Judy was sitting in the kitchen late at night.

473
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,120
 And it's one of those kitchens with the back door and they have the window that looks out

474
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,480
 into the darkness.

475
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,960
 And as she's sitting in the kitchen, she looks out that back door.

476
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,520
 Something draws her eyes there.

477
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:27,800
 She's looking out that window into the unforgiving night.

478
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:36,440
 And she sees Susan staring in from the darkness.

479
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:46,200
 Susan, the older sister who had passed away years before, creepily staring inside the kitchen.

480
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:54,520
 That was the word they actually used that she creepily stared into the kitchen.

481
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,320
 Judy and two of her brothers were there visiting as well once.

482
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,720
 They were in the guest room.

483
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,800
 Brothers were sleeping on the floor and she was on the bed.

484
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,920
 And in the middle of the night, Judy wakes up.

485
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,480
 She smells a scent, a familiar scent, a beautiful scent.

486
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,000
 Her grandmother.

487
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,720
 It was a smell that she associated with her grandmother who had passed away long ago.

488
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,080
 She's sitting in this guest bedroom and she can smell the fragrance that she would most

489
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,160
 associate with her loved one.

490
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,360
 And she gets this sense that even in the chaos of this house, her grandmother's spirit is

491
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,760
 here to protect her.

492
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,320
 She's here to watch over her.

493
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,040
 And then, clear as day, she hears a voice in her head.

494
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,680
 That's not your grandmother.

495
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,200
 Judy is telling her daughter all of these stories.

496
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,280
 The daughter is Natty Cakes, the one who posted this online.

497
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,640
 And the daughter's like, "We have to visit this house."

498
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,960
 She had gone to it as a young child, but she refused.

499
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,160
 When she was first born, they took her to go visit the grandparents and she flat out

500
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,800
 refused to go in the house.

501
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,840
 At any point, she'd scream and cry.

502
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,920
 She wouldn't go in, she wouldn't go in, she wouldn't go in until eventually that night

503
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,840
 she had to sleep in the car with her mother and father.

504
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,280
 She would not go into the house.

505
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,080
 That was her first introduction there.

506
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,400
 And Natty wants to revisit this house.

507
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,400
 You get older, you get a little braver, you're no longer a toddler.

508
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,240
 You can speak, you can use words.

509
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,000
 She wants to go visit this house.

510
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,360
 And her mom wants to visit the house as well.

511
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,560
 Not necessarily as some sort of paranormal investigator, but it is the house of her parents.

512
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,000
 But her mom's not in the best of health right now.

513
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,720
 And it's a four hour drive to Mansfield, Louisiana from where they're at.

514
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,520
 She's hearing all these stories.

515
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,400
 Her mother's telling, she goes, "Mom, I'm gonna look it up on Google Maps.

516
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,200
 I at least kind of want to like see the house.

517
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,440
 It's been so long since I've been there."

518
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,800
 So the mother gives her the address.

519
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,800
 She can't find the house.

520
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,840
 She gets as close as she can.

521
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
 She goes, "Is this it?

522
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
 Is this it?"

523
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,440
 And the mom's like, "No, no, it's this address."

524
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,320
 But Google Maps is not showing that house.

525
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,240
 Now she says, "Maybe my mom got the address wrong.

526
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
 My mom is adamant."

527
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,160
 I mean, this was a house she was at a lot.

528
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,200
 This is where this house was.

529
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,800
 But they cannot find it on Google Maps.

530
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,440
 Both of Judy's parents have passed away by now.

531
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,040
 In 1985, Paul passed away.

532
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,280
 And so that left Eileen to live in the house by herself.

533
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,800
 But obviously that wasn't going to work.

534
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,400
 Whether it was mental decay or demonic possession.

535
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,880
 Either these people live together, right?

536
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,320
 If it's mental decay, they're just gonna like fall down the stairs and mix up their

537
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,720
 medicine and be like, "Uh, if it's mentally possessed,

538
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,520
 they're gonna be like, 'Kinaping little kids.'

539
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,720
 I'm like trying to sacrifice people to the old gods and things like that."

540
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,760
 So I mean, you don't want either of these people to have their own layer.

541
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,320
 So they take in Eileen.

542
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,960
 For a brief time, Eileen lives with Judy and Natty.

543
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,920
 And then, you know, that doesn't work out eventually.

544
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,560
 Not because she was trying to kill the kids and she's like, "The old gods must be satiated."

545
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,880
 It was because of more, like, you know, you just can't take care of an old person by yourself.

546
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,200
 Like cleaning and bathing, chasing them down, destroying the necromon before it destroys

547
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
 us all.

548
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,080
 So they put her in a retirement home, a care home, really.

549
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:48,000
 And while she was there, one day the staff called the family and said, "Hey, we had an

550
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,720
 issue last night with Eileen.

551
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,920
 We don't really know how to describe this."

552
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,520
 She got out of her room last night.

553
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,440
 And she walked down to the dining area.

554
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,560
 It turns out that she snuck out of her room in the middle of the night, went to the dining

555
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:10,360
 room area, removed all the wallpaper from the walls, and neatly rolled them up and set

556
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
 it on the floor.

557
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,720
 And they go, "We have no idea how she did that."

558
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,600
 And the amount of time and no tools is just a weird thing.

559
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:24,640
 Even removed from the house, Eileen was continuing to do bizarre things.

560
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,080
 She also has passed away at this point as well.

561
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,720
 She passed away in the 90s.

562
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
 A creepy story.

563
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,440
 A haunted house story like no other.

564
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,280
 A story where it's not just a few things are happening in the house, a chandelier moves

565
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:49,680
 when there was no windows open, or a cold spot in a house built back in the 1800s.

566
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
 Nothing like that, right?

567
00:31:50,680 --> 00:32:01,880
 We have some serious interpersonal interactions over the course of years and years and years.

568
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,920
 And honestly, I left out some of the more sensational stuff.

569
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,360
 Because honestly, it makes the story sound completely ludicrous.

570
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,200
 Like apparently one day the boys woke up and they went to the backyard and the entire

571
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,880
 garden was three feet higher.

572
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
 Everything had sprouted up.

573
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
 They're like, "Guganzo!

574
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,280
 Look at that big thing of celery!"

575
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,400
 That might have happened.

576
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,720
 It sounds super dumb, but it might have happened.

577
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,760
 So we're talking about some crazy events.

578
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,480
 And also we're getting it through the filter.

579
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,240
 We're getting stories passed down from generations.

580
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,400
 So the story's being written by Natty.

581
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,280
 She's getting it from her mother who experienced a lot of the events firsthand.

582
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,720
 But we do have that game of telephone and stuff like that.

583
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,600
 So you have events going on, a lot of activity.

584
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,000
 And most likely, if we're in the paranormal world, a demonic possession of not just one,

585
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 but two people.

586
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,280
 It was possible that Susan also fell prey to this.

587
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,600
 That's what was driving her crazy.

588
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,080
 And we don't know where the house is now.

589
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,520
 But someone's probably living in this house, right?

590
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,400
 You may not be able to find it on Google Maps, but it exists.

591
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,200
 And there's a family in it.

592
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,400
 They're making it their home.

593
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,360
 Now if someone from Judy's family moved in, they would already know all of this backstory.

594
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,600
 But a new family moved in and they would not know any of this stuff.

595
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,000
 They would simply go about life.

596
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,360
 But as the matriarch of that household starts to exhibit some anger issues, starts to lash

597
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:41,200
 out at the children, starts to pace down the dark hallways late at night.

598
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,880
 There'd be no context for it.

599
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,840
 The people in the neighborhood, back when Paul and Eileen were living there, the people

600
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,640
 in the neighborhood said, "We didn't really like the feeling that house gave."

601
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,280
 But back in the 1960s and 1970s, neighbors talked to each other.

602
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,800
 Each house now is almost like an island separated by miles of water.

603
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,480
 You may have a little bit of communication with the house closest to you, but a lot of

604
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,840
 neighbors don't know each other.

605
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,880
 And this new family that's moving there, do they know any of these stories?

606
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,600
 Do the neighbors know any of these stories?

607
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,640
 If everyone just moved on or passed away at this point and a family moves into this house

608
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,800
 and they don't understand what's going on.

609
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,720
 Is my wife having some sort of difficulties?

610
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,480
 You know, COVID, it's been really stressful.

611
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,560
 And the kids haven't been able to go to school and all this stuff.

612
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,440
 Is that what's going on?

613
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,720
 And this woman is starting to act more and more erratic.

614
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,960
 This family doesn't know how to deal with it, but they're dealing with it the best they

615
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,960
 can.

616
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,240
 While all this chaos is going on in the house, as this young mother is trying to go about

617
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:49,280
 her day while a shadowy form dances behind her.

618
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:57,920
 There's two sisters standing outside the back door of the kitchen.

619
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,960
 Both of them waiting for this third woman to finally join them.

620
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,120
 Another soul trapped in this cursed house.
