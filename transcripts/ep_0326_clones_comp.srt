00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,480
 Welcome to the Illuminati Clone Center.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,480
 Sci-Fi elevator opens up,

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,980
 leads into a sci-fi hallway,

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,480
 walking, clip, clip, clip, clip.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,480
 We apparently have horseshoes on,

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,980
 clip, clip down the metal hallway.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,980
 Hello!

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,480
 My name is Meredith,

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,480
 scientist here at the Illuminati Clone Center.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,480
 Is that what you actually call it?

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
 The name of your super secret organization

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,480
 is in the name of the Clone Center?

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,480
 Yes, yes, we've been meaning to change that.

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,480
 But we've been so, so busy.

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,480
 Look to your left.

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,480
 You can see all of these celebrities

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,480
 that we have cloned.

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,480
 Look at them, they've all been cloned.

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,480
 Even the lame ones, especially the lame ones.

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,480
 You idiot!

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,480
 They have to clone them all!

24
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,480
 Oh, that's interesting.

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,480
 You mind if I take a Britney Spears clone home?

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,480
 You Mr. Coppenter.

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,480
 This is going to be an awesome episode.

28
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,480
 Clip, clip, clip, clip.

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,480
 Hey, what's this?

30
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,480
 Oh, don't worry about that, Mr. Coppenter.

31
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,480
 We'll keep walking.

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
 No, no, no, no, no. I want to see it.

33
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,480
 It looks like some sort of gladiator arena.

34
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,480
 Are you guys cloning people

35
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,480
 and making them fight in the arena?

36
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,480
 Scientists, sexy scientists.

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,480
 I should have said that earlier.

38
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,480
 Sexy scientists adjust their glasses,

39
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,480
 unbutton her blouse a bit.

40
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
 And she goes, she's trying to distract us.

41
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,480
 But we are investigators.

42
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 We're not going to be distracted by her sexy scientist outfit.

43
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
 She goes,

44
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,480
 "I can't show you the arena."

45
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,480
 Why not?

46
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,480
 Because that belongs to Donald Marshall.

47
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,480
 He's a legend of the arena.

48
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,480
 He's a legend of music.

49
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
 And he is our greatest enemy.

50
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,480
 And you will find out about them today.

51
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,480
 Let me finish it.

52
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
 Let me finish the intro.

53
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
 And you will find out about them today.

54
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
 Let me finish the intro.

55
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,480
 And you will find out all about clones today.

56
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,480
 On Dead Rabbit Radio.

57
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
 [Music]

58
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:09,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

59
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

60
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 I'm having a great day.

61
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,480
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

62
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
 Yesterday, I loved that day episode.

63
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,480
 I go, "Hey man, I ran out of time

64
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
 to talk about clones."

65
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,480
 And the episode is one of my shortest episodes ever.

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,480
 I think it clocks in around 22 minutes.

67
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
 I ended up trying to do the clone stuff.

68
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,480
 At least the first half of it.

69
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 And it went way over.

70
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,480
 And then by the time I had chopped everything out,

71
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,480
 it was a very, very short episode.

72
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,480
 So today we're actually going to be a special.

73
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,480
 A clone special.

74
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,480
 It's going to be a little bit longer to make up for the short episode yesterday.

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,480
 Also, just to give you guys a heads up,

76
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,480
 I'm going to do this episode, the Halloween episode.

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,480
 So that episode comes out on October 31st.

78
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
 And then that'll be it for the week.

79
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
 So we're going to have four episodes this week.

80
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,480
 So we're going to have a special today.

81
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,480
 We're going to have an extra long special tomorrow as well.

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 And then we're going to just go into the weekend.

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
 So there's only going to be four episodes this week.

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,480
 And also, once again, if you are in the area,

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,480
 Halloween night, 9.30pm,

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
 my buddy's band, Sundiver,

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,480
 is doing an album release party at River City Saloon here in Hood River.

88
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,480
 So if you've got nothing else to do on Halloween

89
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,480
 and you want to come down to party with me and listen to some great music,

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
 I will be there.

91
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
 Swing on by.

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
 I'm also thinking about doing some sort of like live stream,

93
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,480
 Instagram, YouTube thing.

94
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,480
 I guess I kind of got to figure out what I'm going to do.

95
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,480
 So if you guys, I just can't do, just hop on an app and start recording myself.

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,480
 And then be like, hey, sorry, you guys didn't join in.

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
 Like, I guess I got to figure that out by tomorrow.

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
 What I'm going to do.

99
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
 But I think that would be cool.

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 But anyways, let's go ahead and get started with our clone saga.

101
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
 [imitates clone sound]

102
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 That's us going in an elevator.

103
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
 [imitates clone sound]

104
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,480
 We're in the underground Illuminati clone facilities.

105
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,480
 It's a very, very fancy Illuminati setup.

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,480
 So everything's like super slick metal and shiny silver,

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
 kind of that blue polished silver.

108
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
 It looks like the future.

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
 And we step out of the elevator.

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,480
 And first off, we're going to turn to our right.

111
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,480
 And we see clones of our latest Patreon subscribers.

112
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
 Two little vials there.

113
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
 They're little infants.

114
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
 These are brand new clones.

115
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,480
 They're a little like, what are those things called?

116
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
 Incubators.

117
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
 So we see, we're looking at the labels.

118
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,480
 One of them says Michael Hunt.

119
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
 It might be his real name.

120
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
 I don't know.

121
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,480
 I'm like, oh, look at little, little, little fetus breathing.

122
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
 I guess he's not breathing.

123
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,480
 What do you do when you're in ambiotic fluid?

124
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
 I guess you breathe.

125
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,480
 But anyways, and then we go to the next one.

126
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
 And it's Debo, little baby.

127
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,480
 Little baby Debo floating around in these clone chambers.

128
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
 So thank you Debo and thank you Michael Hunt.

129
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,480
 You guys are now Illuminati clones.

130
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
 And hopefully you're not psychotic

131
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
 and you actually take that to heart.

132
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
 You're not really Illuminati clones.

133
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
 You're Patreons.

134
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
 But anyway, Endless Center's show.

135
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 And if you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

136
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
 Just get the word out about the show.

137
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
 That really helps a lot as well.

138
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,480
 So let's go ahead and throw Michael Hunt and Debo in our backpacks

139
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
 because we don't want to leave them in this.

140
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
 We'll let them incubate at home.

141
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
 We don't want to leave them in this chamber of horrors

142
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
 that we're about to encounter.

143
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,480
 So we're going to continue walking through this Illuminati hallway.

144
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,480
 This illuminated Illuminati hallway.

145
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 And we come across, we go down this alleyway

146
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,480
 and we see a clone of Marshall Mathers,

147
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,480
 aka Eminem, aka Slim Shady.

148
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,480
 Just in this green fluid.

149
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 It's Fago, ironically.

150
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
 And he's in it and we're like knocking on it.

151
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,480
 We're like, "Mr. Mathers, Mr."

152
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
 I actually got on Marshall Mathers or Eminem, whatever you want to call him.

153
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
 I actually got on his tour bus.

154
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,480
 Me and these two girls were able to talk our way into sneaking on.

155
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
 I don't even know if we talked our way in.

156
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
 I think we just walked in.

157
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,480
 Because when I worked at Best Buy, they parked their tour bus.

158
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
 I think it wasn't up in smoke.

159
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,480
 It might have been, or whatever Slim Shady's tour was at the time.

160
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480
 This was back in '98, '99.

161
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,480
 They parked their tour bus in the parking lot at Best Buy.

162
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,480
 And I remember me and these really too hot chicks walked up to it.

163
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
 I think we did talk our way in.

164
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
 I think we'd go, "Hey, do you mind if we step inside and quit?"

165
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
 Because I'm with these two hot girls.

166
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
 They're like, "Yeah, sure."

167
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
 Now we walk in.

168
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
 "Did we talk our way in?"

169
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
 We just teleported into this bus.

170
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,480
 And while we're in the bus, it was just like a really nice tour bus.

171
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,480
 One of the bodyguards goes, because there was two guys on the bus.

172
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
 We had to have talked our way in.

173
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,480
 Anyways, one of the bodyguards or one of the roadies or whatever you want to say,

174
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
 they were really big, so I'm assuming they were bodyguards.

175
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
 One of them goes, "I'm Eminem's dad."

176
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
 And I go, "That's not true. Eminem hasn't seen his father in years.

177
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
 I don't think he even knows who his father is."

178
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,480
 And the bodyguard looks at me and goes, "Whoa, you're a nerd."

179
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
 I was like, "Yeah."

180
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
 I knew that much about Eminem at the time.

181
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
 I don't really follow him anymore.

182
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
 But anyways, they're like, "Okay, guys, off the bus, off the bus."

183
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
 They weren't on the bus at the time.

184
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
 There's no way we would have gotten on the bus if they were there.

185
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
 But we got to walk around Eminem's bus.

186
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,480
 If Eminem ever listens to this episode or his clone does,

187
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
 he's probably gonna fire his bodyguard.

188
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
 He's like, "Why'd you let some random dude walk on my bus?"

189
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
 Yeah, it was just a random tour bus.

190
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,480
 It was the first tour bus I'd ever been in, but I mean, it wasn't like crazy.

191
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,480
 It wasn't like there was a stripper pole and weed everywhere.

192
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
 It turns out it was just like a gray one.

193
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
 But anyways, no, it was actually his tour bus.

194
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,480
 Anyways, we see Eminem's clone.

195
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
 And I go, "Oh, I've been on your tour bus."

196
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,480
 And he's all brrr shaking his head brrr, "How did you get on my tour bus?"

197
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
 And we let him out, brrr, "Psssh."

198
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
 "Taking pickaxes that we brought with us for some reason."

199
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 Well, I guess there's a reason to do this.

200
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
 "Psssh."

201
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,480
 Break open the clone juice and he comes out.

202
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
 He's like, "Thanks for letting me go."

203
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,480
 Although to be fair, I'm only half-cloned.

204
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
 So I don't know how much long I'll live.

205
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
 I feel like my organs are gonna fail.

206
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
 You know, let me incubate long enough.

207
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
 We're like, "Sorry, bro."

208
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
 We wanted it.

209
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
 We thought we were doing the right thing.

210
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
 And he goes, "Yeah, you kind of are."

211
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,480
 So anyways, Eminem supposedly has been cloned.

212
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
 This is the story.

213
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,480
 Back in 2006, he died in a car accident.

214
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,480
 And then he got cloned because the music industry...

215
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
 You know what?

216
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
 This is a really interesting thing.

217
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
 The theory is always this.

218
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,480
 A celebrity dies or a celebrity gets killed because they go against the Illuminati's plans.

219
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
 And then they are replaced.

220
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
 Sometimes they're replaced with a lookalike.

221
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,480
 Sometimes they're replaced with a clone, depending on how stupid the person is believing in the theory.

222
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,480
 Because the idea of Miley Cyrus dying and then finding a girl who looks like Miley Cyrus,

223
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
 that's believable.

224
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,480
 That's not true, but it's believable.

225
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 The idea of Miley Cyrus dying, murdered, whatever, and then them cloning her, that's completely ridiculous.

226
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 But Jason, they clone cats and dogs.

227
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,480
 They clone cats and dogs, but they are not clones in the idea of the sixth day, which is a great clone movie, by the way.

228
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
 Let's see if I can sneak in some Dead Rabbit recommends.

229
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
 Six Days is a really, really good movie about cloning.

230
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,480
 One of Art of Fortune Ager's best films, honestly.

231
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
 Totally.

232
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
 I really, really enjoy that movie.

233
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,480
 But anyways, they clone your cat and your dog, but your cat and your dog, it's not the same dog.

234
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,480
 It may look like the same dog, but it's not the same dog.

235
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,480
 And they use, and this is a weird thing about cloning, too.

236
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
 They figured this out with Dolly the Sheep.

237
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,480
 If you take an animal that's 10 years old, that's actually really old.

238
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,480
 If you take an animal that's 5 years old and you clone it, that animal, when it's born, will be a tiny little baby animal.

239
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,480
 But it will have the genetic makeup of something that is already 5 years old.

240
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,480
 And that was the problem they were running into with Dolly the Sheep.

241
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:52,480
 Yes, it doesn't come out of the womb already 5 years old, but it's like, its body will start breaking down like a 5 year old kitten's would.

242
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:01,480
 So you have to clone, the only way you could really clone cats and dogs and make them completely healthy is to clone them at birth.

243
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,480
 And keep them in jars, and then that way when that one dies, you can have another one.

244
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,480
 Because if you're taking hair off a 10 year old cat and you're putting it in a baby cat, that cat is going to have like 2 years left.

245
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,480
 3 years left. The baby will only live 2 or 3 years.

246
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
 Anyways, you can't really clone a human is what I'm saying.

247
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,480
 As the technology is right now, you just can't do it.

248
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
 You could, no you just can't do it.

249
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
 There's really no wiggle room for that right now.

250
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,480
 And if you were able to, it wouldn't have the same personality, you wouldn't be able to replicate all of that stuff.

251
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:38,480
 It may look like them, but if you clone M&M at 40, you're going to have a baby that's going to have the health problems of a 40 year old.

252
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,480
 It's not going to be like, oh I need a cigarette.

253
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,480
 It's genetic makeup, it's going to be that of an adult male who's 40.

254
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480
 So the heart's not going to be the healthiest, stuff like that.

255
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
 Knees are going to hurt.

256
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,480
 Stuff that would break down, that's not necessarily an issue with wear and tear on their body.

257
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,480
 It's just an issue of like cell division type of things.

258
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
 So, it wouldn't work.

259
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,480
 But anyways, so these lunatics believe that M&M died in 2006 and he's actually what we're looking at is a clone.

260
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:17,480
 It's not true, but people believe it and one of the things is they go, look at these pictures of, here's a picture of M&M back when he did Encore.

261
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,480
 And here's a picture of M&M back when he was dissing the president of the United States, which was what, 2 years ago when he did that video on BET.

262
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,480
 Look at these faces, they're different people.

263
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,480
 They're all, people age.

264
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,480
 And I think this is a fascinating thing too, a lot of times people go, look at this young sexy picture of Avril Lavigne when she's like 22.

265
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,480
 Now look at this gross photo of Avril Lavigne when she's in her 30s.

266
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,480
 She's still a beautiful woman, but they'll go, she doesn't look the same.

267
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480
 And a normal rational person goes, of course not.

268
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,480
 One of them is 10 years younger and people change, fatty deposits move around in their face, they get skinnier or fatter.

269
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:06,480
 But I think it's, I think this actually points to some sort of glitch in the way we see ourselves.

270
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:15,480
 I look in the mirror and I don't feel that I look any differently than I did 10, 15 years ago.

271
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,480
 I've lost weight and I can see that's very obvious when I look in the mirror.

272
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,480
 I'm like, oh, like I can tell I've lost weight.

273
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:32,480
 But on the other hand, when I was looking in the mirror all the time, I couldn't tell that I was gaining weight when I was putting on at tons and tons of pounds.

274
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:41,480
 So I think there's some sort of mental block in our heads that keep us from seeing long term changes in our body that we don't want.

275
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,480
 Because I want to see weight loss because I'm on that weight loss journey.

276
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:54,480
 So when I look in the mirror, I want to see that if you're on a weight gain journey, if you're lifting weights, you're going to look for every single muscle that's getting a little bit bigger.

277
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,480
 So I think now obviously if I look at a picture of me when I'm 20, I can go, whoa, I look like a 10 year old boy in that photo.

278
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,480
 But if I don't remember like looking in the mirror and being, I don't remember looking in the mirror and looking like that guy.

279
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
 I think it's a weird mental trick.

280
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,480
 So, but when I look at other people walking on the street, I go, oh, this person has aged since the last time I saw them.

281
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
 They're like, dude, you only saw me five minutes ago.

282
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
 I was like, yeah, I know it was a rough five minutes for you.

283
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
 Wasn't it?

284
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,480
 I can tell obviously when I look at people that they've aged.

285
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
 So I can understand humans age.

286
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
 It's a timeline issue.

287
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 But to someone who's already suffering from some sort of delusion that clones exist in the Illuminati has these giant underground cloning centers and they have that glitch where they look in the mirror and they go, well, I don't age.

288
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
 And I'm looking at a photo of Avalovine.

289
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
 Avalovine still is really hot.

290
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
 It's kind of weird.

291
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
 Maybe she has some sort of clone.

292
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,480
 But the issue is can they like, I don't think they can make that distinction.

293
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
 Like, I don't age.

294
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
 This person's aging.

295
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,480
 Therefore, this person must have been replaced by, I think.

296
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,480
 But what's interesting is this whole, so this really all recently started.

297
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,480
 The story came back that he died in 2006, but the story about him being a clone came out.

298
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,480
 Oddly enough, I think it's all viral marketing that simply got out of hand.

299
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
 Tom McDonald.

300
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,480
 Tom McDonald is a rapper and he released a song called Cloned Rappers.

301
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,480
 And he's talking about rappers being cloned, the Illuminati's taking them and you can do it to a cat, you can do it to a dog, so you can do it to a human, blah, blah, blah.

302
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
 And then it just kind of goes on.

303
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,480
 The video is him escaping from an Illuminati breeding center, cloning center.

304
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,480
 One of the most poorly acted videos I've ever seen in my life.

305
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
 The song itself is pretty good.

306
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,480
 The song itself is decent, but the video is so poorly acted you'd think it was done on purpose, but it's done so earnestly.

307
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
 I don't think so.

308
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 Hilarious.

309
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
 Watch the video.

310
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
 It's going to be in the show notes.

311
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:58,480
 That video inspired a bunch of people to go, "Oh!" because he mentions Eminem by name as a rapper who has been cloned.

312
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,480
 And then all these articles started popping up.

313
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
 Is Eminem a clone?

314
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
 I think it's viral marketing.

315
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 I think that people, there obviously are idiots out there who believe people are cloned, but I think that Tom McDonald released the song.

316
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,480
 And then honestly I think his people started planting these articles and then it kind of took off.

317
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,480
 Because it's just one, and I could be wrong on that.

318
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:30,480
 I could be having too much faith in humans that they didn't hear this one line and then organically start to believe this stupid theory.

319
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,480
 I believe that someone had to push it, but I could be wrong on that.

320
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 Now the interesting thing about Tom McDonald, this song, is that you can take it one of two ways.

321
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:48,480
 You can take it literally, that Illuminati is kidnapping people and cloning them, and that's the reason why these artists have changed or sold out.

322
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
 It's because they're actually clones.

323
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,480
 The other one is just when you reach a certain level of success, you sell out and you're no longer the artist you used to be.

324
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 So it could be an allegory as well.

325
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
 It can work in both ways.

326
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:07,480
 So I think that he went out and did clone rappers with the intention of being confusing about what he's talking about.

327
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 So again, on an artistic level, it's very, very interesting.

328
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,480
 On a level of people actually believing this stuff, well, it's interesting.

329
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
 That's interesting too.

330
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,480
 It's slightly dangerous, but it's interesting as well.

331
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,480
 What I think is fascinating is when I was delving into the world of clones.

332
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
 This is going to be a long episode.

333
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
 I hope you guys enjoy it.

334
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:38,480
 While I was delving into the world of clones, we get into all of this stuff about artists being cloned.

335
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,480
 Like you have Eminem who used to be like, "Yo, yo, I'm a rapper. I'm a rapper. I'm a white dude.

336
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
 I don't know why he's from the Bronx all of a sudden."

337
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:52,480
 He's doing all that stuff, and then his music starts to, it's not as aggressive as it used to be.

338
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,480
 I think my biggest problem with Eminem nowadays is that it's all about the fast rapping.

339
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
 When you listen to his old stuff, it was just like very relatable.

340
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,480
 You could listen to it as you were drinking a 40, hanging out at a party, and now it's like,

341
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
 "Look how good I am. Look how fast I can go."

342
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
 I'm just not into that stuff.

343
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,480
 But when you look at it, there is a difference between his music, and I get it.

344
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,480
 He stopped using drugs, and he's gotten older, and your music, your art is going to change.

345
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,480
 The clone stuff usually comes from your career, how you started off your different now.

346
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,480
 Miley Cyrus used to be a bubblegum pop star.

347
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,480
 Now she's a sexy, sexy singer singing about sex and sexy stuff.

348
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
 Must have been cloned.

349
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,480
 "Well, no, you grow. You're under contract with Disney. You can't do that type of stuff."

350
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,480
 What I think is interesting is Demi Lovato, she started off with the Disney Channel.

351
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,480
 She's had her own issues with substance abuse, but I remember reading early interviews with her

352
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,480
 when she was still with Disney Channel, and she said she liked listening to

353
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
 hardcore rock music.

354
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,480
 Hardcore might not be the right one, but she would talk about liking to listen to dark music.

355
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,480
 Dark rock music, I think, was the terminology.

356
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,480
 But she was under contract to do Disney, so she couldn't do that stuff.

357
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,480
 And now that she's a pop star, she's still doing that stuff.

358
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,480
 She's not out there growling into the mic for Cannibal Corpse, but she might want to.

359
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
 But that wouldn't fly.

360
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
 Maybe when she's in her 40s she'll do that.

361
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,480
 But my point is that the careers that people have, especially when they're young,

362
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
 don't always reflect who they are.

363
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,480
 So as they get older, as they get more power in the industry,

364
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
 they may start to change things up.

365
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
 It doesn't mean that they're cloned.

366
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
 But we see that a lot.

367
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,480
 You used to believe that you used to be this, and now you're a clone.

368
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
 And it's not just that.

369
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,480
 It's that you're a clone for the Illuminati, and now you're spreading the Illuminati messages.

370
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,480
 I remember when Eminem had his comeback, he had his recovery.

371
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
 I think that was the name of one of his albums actually.

372
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 But when he was actually going through recovery from opioid addiction, when he came back,

373
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,480
 he was one of his album covers, or one of his, it wasn't his album covers,

374
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
 like publicity for this album coming out.

375
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,480
 He was doing the Devil Horn hand signal, and he was holding it up to his forehead.

376
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,480
 And at the time that was going on, I was really involved in the conspiracy theory community.

377
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 I was on like Godlike Productions, Above Top Secret, all of this stuff.

378
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,480
 Constantly researching conspiracy theories, I believed in a lot more of them.

379
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:26,480
 And everyone lost their mind when he did this, because Eminem was considered like a soldier against the Illuminati.

380
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
 Eminem was speaking the truth.

381
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
 Eminem was one of the good ones.

382
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,480
 It was kind of the general consensus among conspiracy theorists at the time.

383
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
 He hadn't sold out to the Illuminati.

384
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
 It's kind of weird.

385
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
 That was the Britney Spears.

386
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
 That was the Christine Aguileras.

387
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
 That was them.

388
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
 Eminem was one of us.

389
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,480
 And now at this point in time, and this is coming out, I was starting to realize how stupid everything was.

390
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,480
 But I remember when I saw that photo, I thought, "Ooooh, people are not gonna like that."

391
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
 And it started a huge debate.

392
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
 Huge debate on Godlike Productions.

393
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,480
 Godlike Productions is probably one of the premier conspiracy theory forums.

394
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,480
 The Nobody, the meme going around about the Nobody.

395
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:15,480
 I may cover that at some point, but the Nobody is this idea that there is an individual among us, a Nobody, a person with no notable achievements,

396
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,480
 who the Illuminati is deadly afraid of.

397
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,480
 And that's been going around 4chan for a couple months now, and that's taken over 4chan.

398
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
 People want to find out who the Nobody is.

399
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:32,480
 Really, the trick is to trick you into thinking you're the Nobody, because there's this vague list of descriptors.

400
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,480
 And it's like, he may not even know who the Nobody is.

401
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
 He may not know how powerful he is and blah blah blah.

402
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,480
 So people sitting there go, "Oh my God, maybe I'm the Nobody. Maybe I'm special. Maybe I don't just work at Denny's.

403
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,480
 Maybe I'm destined to fight the Illuminati."

404
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,480
 And I meet up with the woman of Scars, who is this other character who shows up in this mythology.

405
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,480
 All of that started on Godlike Productions.

406
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,480
 There was a forum on Godlike Productions said, "The Illuminati was given an offer they couldn't refuse.

407
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,480
 I think it was the name of the forum."

408
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,480
 And it started this story about there was a guy named the Nobody who was confronted by the Illuminati,

409
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
 and he did something to them.

410
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,480
 And it was so vague that it could have been you walking through the supermarket and someone walks up to you and says,

411
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
 "Ooh, nice avocados."

412
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
 And then you turn and you're like, "What?"

413
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
 And then the person right--

414
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,480
 It was written to be so vague that you could see yourself as the Nobody.

415
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,480
 Probably one of the greatest modern myths going on right now.

416
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,480
 I think it'll only get bigger and bigger as time goes on, because I thought it was over with that.

417
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,480
 That is from like 2008, 2009, the Nobody.

418
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
 And now it's gotten re--

419
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,480
 Now there's just huge resurgence on 4chan and it's just going from there.

420
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,480
 But anyways, so Godlike Productions, the number one forum, really, for Conspiracy Theory,

421
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,480
 it's actually also the most patrolled, and I don't mean that by outside CIA/FBI.

422
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,480
 It's one of the most heavily modded paranormal conspiracy forums out there.

423
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,480
 And I think it's-- I think the reason it's so modded, there's a lot of conspiracy theories,

424
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
 and why it's so modded.

425
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,480
 Some people believe that it is controlled by the government.

426
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,480
 Some people believe it's controlled by some corporate entity.

427
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
 But anyways, the fact that it's so modded actually think helps it,

428
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,480
 because it gets rid of all of the garbage stuff, like our butthole's paranormal,

429
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
 that type of stuff we see on 4chan.

430
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
 It doesn't have that stuff.

431
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,480
 But anyways, so, all that being said, where was I going with that?

432
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
 What was I talking about?

433
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,480
 Oh, Godlike Productions, Eminem, Devil Horns on his head.

434
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
 They flipped out, and there were some people who were like,

435
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,480
 "No, no, no, no, no, he's pretending to be one of them.

436
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
 He's going to destroy them from the inside."

437
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,480
 The amount of Eminem fans-- there's like a Venn diagram of Eminem fans in Conspiracy Theory--

438
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
 Conspiracy Theorists.

439
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,480
 It used to be really, really connect-- like, there was a huge connection between those two,

440
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,480
 but until recent.

441
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,480
 And they were like, "No, no, no, he's in the-- he's going on the inside.

442
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
 He's going to fight them from the inside.

443
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
 He's still one of us."

444
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
 And other people were like, "No, he's still dead.

445
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
 He's doing the Devil Horns.

446
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
 He's no better than Rihanna and Jay-Z."

447
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,480
 Then it became the real-- the Eminem that we loved, the Eminem that we knew,

448
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,480
 must have died, must have been dead, and this is his clone.

449
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 But again, there's no evidence to that.

450
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,480
 There's no science to back any of that up at all.

451
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,480
 But I think it's interesting, and I'm going to say this,

452
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
 and then we're going to move on to our final segment,

453
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,480
 because this episode is running really long, even longer than I thought it was going to.

454
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,480
 We see people cloned because they're different than who they used to be,

455
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,480
 and the Illuminati clones them because they can't control them,

456
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,480
 and they're going to use them for nefarious purposes.

457
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,480
 What I find-- and I'm not getting political here,

458
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,480
 but what I find interesting is one of the people who seems to have changed the most

459
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,480
 in recent times is President Donald Trump.

460
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,480
 Like, if you go back just 10, 15 years, his mannerisms, his physical appearance,

461
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
 has radically changed.

462
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
 It's bizarre.

463
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,480
 Now, I get it. Like I've said, people get older, people change.

464
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,480
 If you watch an interview of him, like that interview of him doing that with Oprah,

465
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
 and it was like 20 years ago or something like that,

466
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
 looks like a completely different person.

467
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,480
 Sounds like a completely different person.

468
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,480
 But even watching The Apprentice,

469
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,480
 you can see the in-between between the Oprah Trump and President Trump.

470
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
 You see like that in-between there.

471
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,480
 But still seems very, very, very different person.

472
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,480
 So why aren't there conspiracy theories that Donald Trump is a clone?

473
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,480
 I found one, and it never really gained traction,

474
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
 and I think it points to the reason.

475
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,480
 I think it points to the conspiracy behind clones in general.

476
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,480
 The people who are saying that the clones are being created by the Illuminati,

477
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,480
 but Donald Trump is considered to be someone who fights against the Illuminati,

478
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,480
 who fights against the deep state and all of these power structures?

479
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,480
 It's weird because he, if anyone is proof of radically changing their personality,

480
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,480
 speech patterns, and physical appearance in a short period of time, it's him.

481
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,480
 But to believe in cloning, you have to believe in the Illuminati.

482
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,480
 And to believe in the, not if you're a cloning scientist,

483
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
 but I mean obviously we're talking about this,

484
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,480
 if you want to believe in people being replaced by clones,

485
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,480
 then you have to believe in the Illuminati, and the Illuminati is the bad guy,

486
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,480
 but Donald Trump is considered one of the good guys against the Illuminati.

487
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
 So it all falls apart, and that's the problem with conspiracy theories.

488
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,480
 It should be as a conspiracy theorist to have to, like any historian or scientist

489
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
 or anything has to look at their evidence every so often and go,

490
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
 "Oh, this new piece does not work."

491
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,480
 If the fact that Eminem has slightly higher cheekbones now than he did 20 years ago

492
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,480
 means he is a clone, but everything from Donald Trump's speech pattern

493
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,480
 to the way that he looks has changed radically over the past 20 years in that same time span.

494
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,480
 But he's not a clone? Either you're totally wrong, Eminem's not a clone,

495
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,480
 nobody's clones and you've been wasting your time believing in this stuff,

496
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,480
 or he's a clone as well.

497
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,480
 Now I'm not saying he's an Illuminati puppet, he could be.

498
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
 He could be, I don't know. I don't think he's a clone,

499
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,480
 let me just make sure that's on the table, I don't believe he's a clone.

500
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,480
 It's just weird. It's just weird.

501
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,480
 Now if Donald Trump ever did the devil horn signs,

502
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,480
 like on his forehead, or did anything to make people think

503
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,480
 that he was compromised by the Illuminati,

504
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,480
 within a heartbeat people would be saying, "I knew he was cloned all along."

505
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,480
 I just think it's weird how conspiracy theories have been completely compromised like that.

506
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,480
 And it really should show you how ridiculous all of this stuff is.

507
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,480
 Because again, if in science you have a bucket and you have a fish

508
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,480
 and then you throw another fish in, now that analogy's stupid.

509
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
 You guys understand what I mean.

510
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,480
 You have two ideas of people who have radically changed over the past 20 years.

511
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,480
 One person, because he put up devil horns on his head,

512
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,480
 is an Illuminati clone, because some rapper said

513
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,480
 he's an Illuminati clone sent to destroy us and enslave us.

514
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,480
 And the other guy who changed radically over 20 years

515
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,480
 was elected President of the United States against all odds.

516
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,480
 He's not a clone.

517
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,480
 That is 100% a legit human accomplishment.

518
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
 Very, very weird behavior.

519
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,480
 Because obviously, if I was going to clone somebody,

520
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,480
 I'm going to put all my money and resources into somebody

521
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,480
 who can actually do stuff, not who can sit on a couch and play Xbox,

522
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,480
 and then go, "Oh, I got to record an album," and then go, "I record an album."

523
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,480
 I could not sneak onto Donald Trump's tour bus.

524
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,480
 If I can sneak onto--that's the new litmus test.

525
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,480
 If I can sneak onto your bus or get invited, again, I don't remember.

526
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,480
 If I can get onto your tour bus, you are not a clone.

527
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,480
 Let's go ahead and get started here with the main event.

528
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,480
 Let's go ahead and get started here with the reason why we're all here.

529
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
 You're like, "Why am I here? I didn't know that.

530
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 I thought that last segment was why I'm here." No.

531
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
 We're going to the arena.

532
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
 [sighs]

533
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,480
 You hear this chanting? That's not chanting. That's a roar of a crowd.

534
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
 [sighs]

535
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
 There we go.

536
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
 It's the late '70s, early '80s.

537
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
 You're like, "Where did these bell bottoms come from?"

538
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
 They just magically appear on you.

539
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,480
 I'm wearing a slick business suit, skinny tie.

540
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,480
 I'm like, "We are in this late '70s, early '80s,

541
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
 and you got stuck with the late '70s part."

542
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,480
 And we see a arena.

543
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,480
 This is actually like the size of a hockey arena.

544
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,480
 It holds about 300, 400 people with a dirt floor in the middle.

545
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,480
 We're walking in.

546
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,480
 We're still in the underground cloning facility, by the way.

547
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
 This is all underground.

548
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,480
 So we're walking in, and there's a bunch of bodyguards, cloned bodyguards.

549
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
 We know they're cloned because they all look alike,

550
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
 and they're like, "Tickets."

551
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
 And we're like, "Dude, we're members of the Illuminati.

552
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
 We don't need tickets." And they're like, "Yes, that was the password."

553
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,480
 So we walk into the arena.

554
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
 [sighs]

555
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,480
 And what we see in the arena is what you would expect to see in a gladiator arena.

556
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
 You see people stabbing each other.

557
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
 [grunts]

558
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
 [imitates gunshot]

559
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
 Cuts off an arm.

560
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
 [imitates gunshot]

561
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,480
 Dude's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

562
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
 No, he's not doing that. The crowd is doing that.

563
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
 "Yeah."

564
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
 Yeah. Guy turns around.

565
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,480
 The gladiator dude who is just using the sword turns around, faces us.

566
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
 It's a young John Travolta.

567
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
 We're like, "What? That's kind of weird."

568
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
 "Yeah, yeah."

569
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,480
 And then he leaves, and we're like, "Oh, that's..."

570
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,480
 And so John Travolta was a gladiator combatant before he started Saturday Night Fever.

571
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,480
 And so we're sitting there, we go, "We wonder where the next fight's gonna be?"

572
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,480
 And then we see a gladiator guy come out and takes his helmet off.

573
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,480
 It's a young John Travolta. And we're like, "What? That sucks."

574
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
 Like, he just won that battle. Why is he fighting again?

575
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,480
 And then the other, his opponent comes out, takes his helmet.

576
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
 I don't know why they're taking their helmets off for the fight.

577
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
 It's just something to do.

578
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,480
 Take the helmet off. That guy is also a young John Travolta.

579
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,480
 And these clones are just ching-ching, fighting.

580
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,480
 Doing dance moves, just skewering each other.

581
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,480
 The winner, John Travolta. Everyone's like, kind of confused.

582
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
 They're like, "Yeah."

583
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,480
 This is a cloned gladiator arena.

584
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,480
 And what happens is people are getting cloned to fight on a good day.

585
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,480
 There's also a lot of, like, just torture in the arena and a lot of rape.

586
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,480
 A lot of times people are being cloned and then raped in this arena.

587
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,480
 In the middle of this arena, though, they have, they bring out a young five-year-old boy.

588
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
 And at this point, we've already seen a lot of stuff.

589
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
 We've seen people just brought out and getting chopped up.

590
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,480
 We've seen sword fights. We've seen horrible stuff.

591
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,480
 And when they bring out a five-year-old boy, we kind of look at each other and we're like,

592
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
 "We should probably leave. Like, this is gross."

593
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,480
 And as we go to get up, we see a bodyguard being like, "Mmm-mm."

594
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,480
 Shaking his head at us and we're like, "Oooookay. This is not good."

595
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,480
 Because we notice some other people in the stands are kind of terrified.

596
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
 Some people are really into it.

597
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
 And really, we probably should have left in the first place.

598
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,480
 We probably shouldn't have been in here in the first place.

599
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,480
 We still got Debo and Mike sitting in our backpacks, those little clones we stole.

600
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
 And we're like, "You know what? This is kind of dangerous.

601
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,480
 We hope we don't get thrown in the arena ourselves."

602
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,480
 If we do, we'll just throw Debo and Mike in.

603
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,480
 We'll just throw them at people, splash all over their face.

604
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
 See you later and then we'll bounce.

605
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,480
 But before we can do that, see a little five-year-old boy led into the arena.

606
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
 And these guys come out.

607
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,480
 Now he's surrounded by four or five John Travolta.

608
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,480
 He's surrounded by a bunch of clone gladiator warriors.

609
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,480
 They're going to come out and they're going to start attacking them.

610
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,480
 And as they're moving through the gladiator arena with their swords held high,

611
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,480
 little boy is kind of cowering and then he looks up and he goes,

612
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:11,480
 "Life is a mystery. Everyone must stand alone."

613
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
 Everyone's kind of looking at each other.

614
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
 We're like, "What is this?"

615
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:30,480
 ♪ I hear you call my name and it feels like home ♪

616
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
 The whole arena is silent.

617
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,480
 John Travolta, the army of John Travolta's look up and they're like,

618
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
 "What, are we supposed to hack this kid to death still?"

619
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
 That was the most beautiful song we'd ever heard.

620
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
 Should we murder this boy?

621
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,480
 And someone goes, "No, don't murder him.

622
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,480
 That was the most beautiful song I've ever heard as well.

623
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,480
 That is the boy of the Golden Songs. That's boy.

624
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
 Bring him to me."

625
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,480
 So anyways, the boy gets brought to this person

626
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:04,480
 and we find out that this guy, this boy, is named Donald Marshall.

627
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,480
 So what happens is he was cloned in this facility.

628
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,480
 Little Donald Marshall was cloned in this cloning facility.

629
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,480
 And every day they used to kill him and then they would clone him back to life

630
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
 and he would wake up and be like, "Oh, my guts!"

631
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,480
 And he'd look down and they'd be totally fine in his body.

632
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
 And he realized something.

633
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,480
 If he could sing a song on the spot, they would stop killing him.

634
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,480
 And then he started singing "Every Song Ever."

635
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,480
 Every song you've ever heard, for the most part, he's written.

636
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
 He hasn't written the lame ones.

637
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,480
 If you're a Michael Jackson fan, early Michael Jackson fan,

638
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,480
 this boy wrote him in an arena covered in human blood.

639
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,480
 Fan of Madonna, like a prayer, like a virgin, all that stuff, he wrote him.

640
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,480
 His first hit song, when he was five years old, he wrote a song called "Lady"

641
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,480
 for Kenny Rogers. Never heard of it. He wrote it.

642
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,480
 There's actually a list of all the songs he's written online.

643
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
 He wrote "Single Ladies" for Beyonce.

644
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,480
 You know, at the end of the video, when she went, you know that little wave motion?

645
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,480
 That's to him. Beyonce met Donald later on and said, "I wanted to say thanks for writing that song for me."

646
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
 He wrote that.

647
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,480
 He also wrote a song, so he wrote a song, "Single Ladies" for Beyonce.

648
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,480
 He also wrote a song called "Monster" for Boom Docs, rappers, some Southern rapper.

649
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,480
 So that makes sense. You know, I can see that.

650
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,480
 You write, you know, "Thriller." You write all the songs on "Deaf Leopards Pyramania."

651
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,480
 And then, you know, why not write a song for Boom Docs, a rapper that I'm sure a lot of my listeners have heard of.

652
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
 I've never heard of him.

653
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
 Have you ever heard of the famous song "Duck Sauce" by Barbra Streis-- I hadn't.

654
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
 I didn't even know that was a song.

655
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,480
 He wrote "Duck Sauce" for Barbra Streisand. I swear that's a typo on the website.

656
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,480
 I don't think that's a real song.

657
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,480
 "Was your heart broken when you heard Goatye, somebody that I used to know?"

658
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,480
 You know what? It's funny. I watched that music video for Goatye.

659
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,480
 The song's okay, but that music video, that girl, Kimbra, and that music video,

660
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,480
 looks like every ex-girlfriend I've ever had.

661
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,480
 And she doesn't. She doesn't look anything like every ex-girlfriend I've ever had.

662
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,480
 But in your mind, when you-- except for the ex-girlfriends who were totally nuts,

663
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,480
 that you couldn't wait to ghost, like whenever your heart's broken,

664
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,480
 when I look back and think of that girl, they look exactly like Kimbra.

665
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,480
 They're blondes or brunettes or redheads or whatever. They're tall or short.

666
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,480
 It doesn't matter. But Kimbra in that video looks like the sole essence of an ex-girlfriend.

667
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,480
 It's a very, very brilliant video. Kimbra's really good by herself, too.

668
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,480
 "Unforgiven" by Metallica-- great song.

669
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,480
 But don't worry, Metallica didn't write it. It's actually the life story of Donald Marshall.

670
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,480
 He also wrote "Silent Lucidity" by Queensrike, or for Queensrike.

671
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
 I forgot that song even existed.

672
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,480
 But anyways, he wrote all these songs, tons of them, in this arena, in this blood-soaked arena.

673
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,480
 So you go, "That's stupid, Jason. Why are you wasting my time reading off a list of songs

674
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,480
 that obviously weren't written by one person?"

675
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,480
 That's just the start of where we're going. It's interesting.

676
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,480
 A couple of weeks ago, I recommended the movie "Under the Silver Lake."

677
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,480
 I did recommend that movie, right? "Under the Silver Lake," for Dead Rabbit recommends.

678
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,480
 A huge plot point in that movie is that one person's written every song.

679
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,480
 And that movie is all about-- it's a really good movie, but I thought that was an interesting connection.

680
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,480
 One person's pretty much written every song you've ever heard.

681
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,480
 But what happens to Donald Marshall is eventually he runs out of songs.

682
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,480
 They eventually stop, like, stabbing him, because he's able to bust out these songs.

683
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
 He writes them on the spot.

684
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,480
 So he's sitting there in the dirt, and he's like, "All the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies, all the single ladies."

685
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,480
 And they're like, he comes up with this stuff on the spot.

686
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,480
 So they stop murdering him and cloning him.

687
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,480
 What happens is he ends up not coming out with any new good songs.

688
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,480
 So they throw him back in the arena and start stabbing him again.

689
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,480
 So that's where we're at now, with him getting stabbed again and again and again.

690
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,480
 Now, it's really weird reading his story.

691
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,480
 But this episode, like I said, it's going to be long, because I'm going to go through some excerpts of what he's written.

692
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,480
 This is one of those guys that I really want to get into what he wrote himself,

693
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,480
 because just the way he puts things really shows where his mindset is.

694
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,480
 When you listen to him-- I've watched YouTube videos with this guy--

695
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,480
 he seems very, very lucid.

696
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,480
 Hey, guys, what's up? Donald Marshall here.

697
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,480
 I just wanted to talk to you a little bit about this mega-death album cover.

698
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,480
 So anyways, let's go with a very, very normal speech pattern.

699
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,480
 But when you look at what propelled him to fame, this writing that propelled--

700
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:53,480
 this guy's quite famous in the conspiracy clono-sphere.

701
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,480
 But anyways, he believes that Queen Elizabeth runs all this stuff.

702
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:05,480
 She's a boogeyman, and it's all rife with torture, rape, child abuse, murder, and so on and so forth.

703
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,480
 And if you become famous, they will clone you, or can clone you.

704
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,480
 And if you do damage to the clone, it can actually do damage to who you are.

705
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,480
 So he's a clone, apparently, or he was raised in the cloning facility.

706
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,480
 It's, again, the ramblings of a madman, but he was cloned or raised in the cloning facility,

707
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,480
 but they still clone him, and they will torture the clone.

708
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,480
 And sometimes they torture him directly, and it's really hard to determine whether or not he's still in the cloning facility.

709
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,480
 Because in the YouTube video, he's obviously sitting on his couch in an apartment.

710
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,480
 But then he talks about, well, the other day it was down in the cloning facility, and I'm thinking,

711
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,480
 "Why are you still alive?" And he doesn't answer that question, either.

712
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,480
 Let's take a look at-- I gotta read this stuff.

713
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,480
 In 2011, he wrote a Facebook post that propelled him to fame.

714
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,480
 A lot of people believe in this.

715
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:02,480
 Elizabeth, it's Queen Elizabeth, secretly owns a few music companies, Universal and others,

716
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,480
 with bands under contract. She forces me while under the knife to compose music for them.

717
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:17,480
 And if I can't, she will stab my clone, burn me, have her pervert thug smash my body there.

718
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,480
 It's causing me some kind of heart damage and severe debilitating headaches.

719
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,480
 So, yeah, and he's-- so if you do damage to the clone, it damages you.

720
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,480
 So as long as they have clones of you that you're kind of screwed.

721
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,480
 So he was a hitmaker, he was making all this music, getting cloned,

722
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,480
 and then getting tortured, and the music wasn't doing so well, so he's getting tortured, cloned, getting tortured, all sorts of stuff.

723
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,480
 He eventually starts saying, "I am going to reveal all to the world.

724
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,480
 I'm gonna reveal that I am the songwriter everybody loves."

725
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,480
 There's a meme of him that says, "Oh, you like that song? You're welcome."

726
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,480
 And it's just a picture of him. And the meme has to be-- I mean, I get that he's popular,

727
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,480
 but he's not that popular. It's hilarious.

728
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,480
 I would-- if I had just come across that meme in the wild, I'd have been like, "What is this?

729
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,480
 Oh, that song you like? You're welcome. I'll see if I can use that for my profile photo.

730
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,480
 I don't know if I can for copyright reasons, but it's hilarious nonetheless."

731
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,480
 So he's going-- he says, "I'm gonna expose all of this to the world."

732
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
 And people are like, "You better not."

733
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,480
 And it started a huge base of uprising in the arena, in the cloning facility.

734
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:35,480
 So here's part of his blog. Here's part of his note that he wrote on Facebook in 2011.

735
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,480
 "One good person there, Bernie Mac comedian."

736
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,480
 And this is why I wanted to read it to you, because the grammar shows some serious issues.

737
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,480
 Now, I get it. You can have bad grammar and not be insane,

738
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:55,480
 but if you have bad grammar and you're believing in Bernie Mac clones, then you're probably insane.

739
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
 Okay, here we go.

740
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,480
 "One good person there, Bernie Mac comedian and actor, tried to stand up for me, speak up for me,

741
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,480
 saying it's not right to do to a human being."

742
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,480
 That sounds like the beginning of a standup special.

743
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,480
 You know what's not right, guys? You know what's not right to do to a human being?

744
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,480
 You can't clone him! Everyone's like, "Yeah! You can't clone a human being."

745
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,480
 So anyways, Bernie Mac tries to stand up for him.

746
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,480
 Tried to end this back to the quote here. Tried to have others join him in speaking out against the clone torture zone while there.

747
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,480
 Elizabeth and Philip, that's Prince Philip.

748
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,480
 So Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip had him tortured so badly there as an example of their power,

749
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,480
 he had an aneurysm the next day and died.

750
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,480
 Now, no one will speak up. They're all afraid of suffering the same fate.

751
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:52,480
 So now we know why Bernie Mac died, because he was a good man trying to help out Donald Marshall.

752
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,480
 He gave his life in the... what was it called again? The clone torture zone.

753
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,480
 He got up and gave the speech and he goes, "You know what's not right? You know what's not right?

754
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
 Torturing a clone."

755
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,480
 And Donald Marshall's given us our best songs ever. You like that song? You're welcome.

756
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,480
 "Ugh! Ugh!" He just tortured his clone. Killed him in real life.

757
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,480
 He also knows how a Diana, Princess Diana, was killed.

758
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,480
 Here's the quote from his blog.

759
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:32,480
 "Also, Elizabeth had Princess Diana Spencer killed by having someone shine the brightest light known to mankind through the window side onto the car."

760
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,480
 So, not... it's very easy to make someone die in a car crash.

761
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,480
 You don't have to use a sci-fi device.

762
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,480
 A simple bright light would do. If you're simply trying to blind somebody, you can just shine a flashlight in the face.

763
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
 They're like, "Ugh!" and crash the car.

764
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,480
 You don't need to get the brightest light. Can you imagine them testing that device?

765
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,480
 Like, they're like, "We need to kill the princess, but it has to go completely right."

766
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,480
 "Let's build this." And someone shines and they're like, "You idiot! That's the second brightest light known to man! Make it the brightest!"

767
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
 Nothing can go wrong here.

768
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,480
 Ah, I'm blind. There we go. I mean, basically, it would be the sun.

769
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,480
 And even if it was the brightest light known to man...

770
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,480
 I'm not a scientist, but I'm pretty sure light can't exist with some sort of heat.

771
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,480
 So if it was the brightest light known to man, the heat would have been quite intense as well.

772
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,480
 But you have this device. It's foolproof, right?

773
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,480
 Shine the brightest light known to man through the window side on the car.

774
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,480
 They swerved away from it and hit the divider. It was no paparazzi.

775
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,480
 Diana survived, though, and while either on the way to the hospital or in the hospital,

776
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,480
 it was injected with a high concentration of salt, which is near undetectable and died.

777
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
 So it didn't even work!

778
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,480
 Why would you go through the trouble of building a device that is the brightest light known to mankind?

779
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,480
 And then just be like, "Okay, plan B, just inject her with salt."

780
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,480
 Which I don't know if being injected with salt would kill you. It definitely would not be a fun afternoon, though.

781
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,480
 He's writing this letter, right? This is so... This is probably one of my favorite parts.

782
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,480
 He's writing this... Remember, this arena, he says it can hold about three to four hundred people.

783
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,480
 So it's not like this massive Colosseum.

784
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,480
 So you figure, just world leaders and A-list actors, you easily have more than four hundred people.

785
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,480
 Like, if you just took all the world... There's what, like, 250 countries on the planet,

786
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,480
 and I could be lowballing it, but if you had every world leader, just the presidents or prime ministers,

787
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,480
 you were already packed-house.

788
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,480
 And then you figure there's going to be some senators in on this, Hillary Clinton's eating a baby in the corner, all sorts of stuff.

789
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:50,480
 So you figure it's going to be cream of the crop who are at this Colosseum, this murder clone, the torture zone,

790
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,480
 the clone torture zone, you figure it's only going to be cream of the crop.

791
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,480
 I got to this part of the article, this is probably my favorite part.

792
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,480
 Halfway through making this document.

793
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,480
 And when I read that, I thought, "Oh, please tell me he's making a documentary."

794
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,480
 No, he meant writing this up, writing this document up.

795
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,480
 Halfway through making this document, they brought me there, so they're taking him back to the clone facility,

796
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,480
 and introduced me to a man named Troy Landry.

797
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,480
 Now, before I start saying this, this "I do not believe that Troy Landry" has done any of this,

798
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,480
 I don't know who Troy Landry is.

799
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,480
 He's a celebrity, but I don't watch the show.

800
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:34,480
 Do not try thinking that I actually believe Troy Landry, a guy that I've never ever seen, is somehow responsible for these acts.

801
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,480
 Okay, don't beat me up, Troy.

802
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,480
 Introduce me to a man named Troy Landry.

803
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,480
 He is an alligator trapper from Louis-- cut, that was a weird way to pronounce that.

804
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,480
 He is an alligator trapper from Louisiana on the TV program Swamp People.

805
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,480
 I remember it's so funny, I remember once I was-- I remember once me and my little brother were flipping through the channels.

806
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:05,480
 Just a couple years ago, we were flipping through cable, and we were on the TV guide, like, you know, the digital TV guide on the cable,

807
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,480
 and he goes down to-- he's looking at the shows, and one of them said Swamp People, and he turns to me and he goes,

808
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:17,480
 "You know, five years I would have turned this on, but I'm sure this is probably some really bad reality show."

809
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:24,480
 Because five years ago, you'd be like, "Dude, there's a show about Swamp People, and monsters coming out of the muck."

810
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,480
 But it had gotten to a point where now we just all know that that is some reality show.

811
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,480
 Anyway, so, Swamp People, it's a reality show.

812
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,480
 He said-- back to the quote here-- he said Troy being he,

813
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,480
 "He said if I sent this letter out, he would take a power drill to my shin bone."

814
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,480
 Okay, that's gross.

815
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:47,480
 "He would take a power drill to my shin bone and suck the marrow from my bones."

816
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,480
 Kind of like a spinal tap.

817
00:46:49,480 --> 00:47:05,480
 I would imagine the amount of suction you would have to have to suck the marrow out of a living man's bones would be enough to, like, pump up a car tire.

818
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:15,480
 Like, to be like, "That's it, Donald!" Put the drill down, and then you're holding up his ankle, and you're like, "It's eating time!"

819
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,480
 I don't think it works like that. I don't think your marrow is made of spaghetti noodles.

820
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:28,480
 I don't think your juicy, meaty bone part will just go, "Wooah!" Come out like it's from a Play-Doh factory.

821
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,480
 But anyway, see, threat-- now, to be fair, I've made threats.

822
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,480
 Like, "Dude, I'll cut out your liver and make you eat it." I've made threats like that, that were obviously not possible.

823
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,480
 But anyways, a power drill to-- so maybe he's being hyperbolic, maybe he's speaking in hyperbole.

824
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:49,480
 And anyway, so I would say you want to drill him in with the shin bone and suck the marrow from my bones, kind of like a spinal tap.

825
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,480
 One of the worst things you can do to a clone besides burning-- we'll get to burning in a bit.

826
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,480
 This is going to be a very long episode.

827
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,480
 Then back to the letter. I said the letter will be going out, I have to escape this place, and so he did just that.

828
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,480
 So he actually does suck the marrow out of his shin bones.

829
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,480
 It was excruciatingly painful, everyone just watched Slack John the crowd.

830
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,480
 I don't-- I'm assuming that Donald has never met Troy Landry in real life.

831
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:23,480
 He must have watched the show Swamp People one day and had-- what seems to-- because he talks about dreams.

832
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:30,480
 He talks a lot about dreams. What I'm thinking is-- I think he does have some sort of issue, mental issue,

833
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,480
 but I'm thinking he must have these weird dreams and he's building this connection.

834
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,480
 He might have seen-- Troy Landry is not Cream of the Crop.

835
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,480
 Troy Landry is not sitting there next to Queen Elizabeth and Beyonce and being like,

836
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,480
 "You know what I could go for right now? Some shin meat. Yeah, let me at him."

837
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,480
 Like, he is-- he's not even a list among reality stars.

838
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,480
 He's probably a lovely person. I don't know him, but you know what?

839
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,480
 He's not even a Kardashian or on the Hills or anything like that.

840
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,480
 He's a swamp person. He's a swamp person.

841
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,480
 So the fact that he can hobnob with the most powerful people on the planet is ridiculous in and of itself.

842
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:13,480
 And then he goes on to make all these other horrible allegations about Tom Landry, not Tom Landry, Troy Landry.

843
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:20,480
 Anyway, so he does decide to keep doing this letter and Troy Landry says,

844
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,480
 "You gotta stop it or next time I'm gonna do it to your pelvic bone."

845
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:30,480
 And he did it and then he got the meat sucked out of his pelvic bone as well.

846
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,480
 He said that he did the pelvic bone every day. Sucked the meat out of his pelvic bone every day.

847
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,480
 Troy Landry, star of swamp people.

848
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:44,480
 So I'm thinking this guy is having-- I don't know if now he's still having nightmares about Troy Landry

849
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,480
 holding him down and sucking the meat out of his pelvic bone.

850
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,480
 Anyway, so that's the type-- that's who we're talking about here.

851
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,480
 That's not the only encounter he's had with a celebrity though.

852
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,480
 We can get down to here. Here's another quote.

853
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,480
 "Pheefy Dobson." I have no idea who that is. "Pheefy Dobson and Kurt Russell."

854
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,480
 I know who that is, an actor. So he writes in this letter,

855
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,480
 "Pheefy Dobson and Kurt Russell told me specifically to include in my letter

856
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,480
 that they don't like the place and didn't torture me.

857
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,480
 Then said not to mention them, but I just have."

858
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,480
 What?

859
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,480
 Hey man, can you write a letter and say that I, Kurt Russell, didn't like molest you

860
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,480
 and drill the meat out of your shin bones?

861
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,480
 Oh, but don't use my name.

862
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,480
 Why are you asking me to put you in the letter?

863
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,480
 But anyways, that's not-- I love this part.

864
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,480
 Mila Kunitz. She is-- he spells it "kunitz."

865
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,480
 Kunitz. Mila Kunitz.

866
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,480
 And I'm not knocking him on his spelling.

867
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,480
 At one point he calls it "Jean Benet Ramsey."

868
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,480
 And I'm not-- I'm like, whatever.

869
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,480
 I'm not gonna knock him on the spelling.

870
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,480
 But I'm gonna point it out and make fun of him.

871
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,480
 I don't think that makes him crazy. I think everything else does.

872
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,480
 Mila Kunitz from that '70s show.

873
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,480
 Mila Kunitz from that '70s show recently stabbed me a bunch of times.

874
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,480
 It apparently really happened, guys.

875
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,480
 Now, I said I don't believe in the allegations against Troy Landry.

876
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,480
 I do believe Mila Kunitz. Mila Kunitz did this.

877
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,480
 Mila Kunitz from that '70s show recently stabbed me a bunch of times

878
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,480
 while I was rendered a mobile for saying she's a slimy scumbag

879
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,480
 for hanging out with these people and--

880
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,480
 [laughs]

881
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,480
 and saying she has enormous eyeballs and looks like a lemur.

882
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,480
 Then begged me not to mention her.

883
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,480
 Then said she doesn't want to go to the clone zone anyway.

884
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,480
 And then she left, her body going limp and looking dead.

885
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,480
 She was gone.

886
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,480
 Now, I'm sure that Mila Kunitz,

887
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,480
 famous actress Mila Kunitz, was walking around and he goes,

888
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,480
 "Hey, lemur, hey, lemur, hey, isn't your next movie Ice Age?"

889
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
 And she's like, "Ugh, she starts stabbing him.

890
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,480
 Ugh, you slimy scumbag.

891
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,480
 I don't even like the clone zone.

892
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,480
 Ugh." That 100% happened.

893
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,480
 That is the only part of Donald Marshall's story I will--

894
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,480
 [crickets chirping]

895
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,480
 Does she have enormous eyeballs?

896
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,480
 I actually like big eyes.

897
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:16,480
 My favorite thing is girls who wear giant sunglasses.

898
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,480
 Like, there have been a lot of girls that I've met

899
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,480
 who have giant sunglasses on.

900
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,480
 I was like, "Hey, you know what's up?"

901
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,480
 And then eventually they take them off and I'm like, "Aw."

902
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,480
 Of course you have to take them off.

903
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,480
 You're not going to shower in them.

904
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,480
 I love those big bug-eye sunglasses.

905
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,480
 Anyways, so--

906
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
 but she may or may not have giant eyeballs,

907
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
 but she's-- I don't think-- I mean, I saw--

908
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,480
 what was the book of Mila? I think that's really--

909
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,480
 I never liked that 70's show.

910
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,480
 So that's neither here nor there.

911
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
 Next Celebrity, I love it because--

912
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,480
 long as this episode has gone on for it.

913
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,480
 [whistles] Long.

914
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,480
 We're going to be wrapping it up soon.

915
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,480
 The interesting thing is a lot of conspiracy theorists

916
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,480
 have an obsession with celebrity.

917
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,480
 You do have some who don't like--

918
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,480
 9/11 conspiracy theorists, flat earthers, not so much,

919
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,480
 but with Illuminati conspiracy theorists, I should say.

920
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,480
 There seems to be an obsession with celebrity and fame and power.

921
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,480
 Flat Earth, 9/11, you don't really have that.

922
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,480
 With Illuminati, it seems to be like they have something I don't have,

923
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,480
 therefore they must be doing something that I wouldn't dare to do.

924
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,480
 It's not because I haven't pushed myself hard enough to succeed,

925
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,480
 or I've just been unlucky, or I haven't visualized my success,

926
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,480
 or a combination of the three.

927
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,480
 It's that they must have had access to something,

928
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,480
 or done something that I would never do.

929
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,480
 So I'm actually more morally good since I'm not famous.

930
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,480
 Very weird thing, because a lot of his stuff has to do with celebrities.

931
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,480
 We're going to go back onto here.

932
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,480
 Steven Spielberg, here we go. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas members.

933
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,480
 That's what it says. George-- George Lucas members.

934
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,480
 It's not George Lucas, it's actually his member.

935
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,480
 Steven Spielberg, George Lucas members.

936
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,480
 George had them-- this is so funny.

937
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,480
 George had them light me on fire for the end of his movie, Revenge of the Sith.

938
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,480
 Said he wanted Hayden Christensen to scream realistically.

939
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,480
 Hayden watched me, listened to me scream and groan in pain,

940
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,480
 and copied the sounds exactly.

941
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,480
 He knows all about it.

942
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,480
 As does Natalie Portman, and a quarter of the cast.

943
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,480
 Not all of them, just 25%.

944
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,480
 Just 25% of the cast of Revenge of the Sith.

945
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,480
 Why? Only 25--

946
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,480
 Who are the other 75% who have no idea about the clone zone?

947
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,480
 And also, again, I love Hayden Christensen to death.

948
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,480
 I think he's a really, really good actor.

949
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,480
 I think he got his shot to fame was the prequel movies,

950
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,480
 and people hate the prequel movies, so people don't really give him a shot,

951
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,480
 but I loved Jumper.

952
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,480
 I loved-- what was that one? He ditched Glass? Shattered Glass.

953
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,480
 I think he's a really good actor.

954
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,480
 He's not, again, he's above swamp people.

955
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,480
 He's above swamp people, but he's not Queen Elizabeth Beyoncé level either.

956
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,480
 So the fact that he's getting introduced into the clone zone,

957
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,480
 the clone zone, is utterly ridiculous.

958
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,480
 The fact that you would take a clone and set it on fire,

959
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,480
 and then bring in a young actor and say, "I want you to scream like him,"

960
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,480
 you could just, you know, go to Live Leak.

961
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,480
 And he didn't really scream in Revenge of the Sith.

962
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,480
 He just kind of rolled around on the dirt for a bit.

963
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,480
 Maybe that's the director's cut, maybe they edited that scene out.

964
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,480
 But, you know, this is all-- this was all labeled Part 1 on Facebook, Part 1.

965
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,480
 And apparently there was a Part 2 coming out that was going to reveal even more.

966
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,480
 And what's interesting is it never did.

967
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,480
 So did he die? Was he taken out by the Illuminati?

968
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,480
 No, he's still active.

969
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,480
 He still has a Twitter, a YouTube channel.

970
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,480
 It doesn't seem to be updated that much.

971
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,480
 The Twitter was last updated, I think, in March.

972
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,480
 So where do we stand with this?

973
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,480
 There's two other little things I want to talk about real quick, you know,

974
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,480
 because again, he's fairly popular in this world, in this clone world.

975
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,480
 And everything I read you is bunkers, right?

976
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,480
 None of that stuff really makes sense, but a lot of people read that and go,

977
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,480
 "I knew it," because they don't trust celebrities anyways.

978
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,480
 They already believe that these people are successful,

979
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,480
 they must have done something evil to get there.

980
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,480
 And when someone comes out, no matter how ludicrous the claims were,

981
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,480
 people believe it.

982
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,480
 And it's shocking to me, but again, I used to believe in conspiracy theories.

983
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,480
 Nothing this-- nothing this lame.

984
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,480
 But I used to believe in more conspiracy theories than I do now.

985
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,480
 But there's forums, there's a lot of talk of him on forums, stuff like that.

986
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,480
 Eventually his sister pops in.

987
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,480
 Someone gets ahold of one of his sisters.

988
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,480
 Name Joy Melanson Geyser, is the sister.

989
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,480
 Sister-in-law, sorry, sister-in-law.

990
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,480
 And this is what she wrote,

991
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,480
 "My brother-in-law has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia for several years now.

992
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,480
 We no longer wish to have any communication with him.

993
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,480
 I'm well aware what Donnie is saying.

994
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,480
 The RCMP, he's Canadian, so a lot of his conspiracy theories took place in Canada,

995
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,480
 so that's the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,

996
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,480
 have been notified, are very familiar with him,

997
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,480
 and all organizations that I am involved with are also aware of his stories.

998
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,480
 I have no doubt he believes what he says.

999
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,480
 It is a symptom of his illness."

1000
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,480
 Now you could say that that could be a troll,

1001
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,480
 someone could be imitating his sister-in-law.

1002
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,480
 That's what I thought when I first read that comment on a forum ago,

1003
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,480
 someone was just imitating it.

1004
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,480
 I think it's interesting because you can tell how lucid that was.

1005
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,480
 It is real because Donnie, or Donald,

1006
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,480
 actually ended up responding to it.

1007
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,480
 Responding to that comment, and this is what was written.

1008
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,480
 Joy Geyser is a ho-- and let me say this too.

1009
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,480
 Joy Geyser, she is a private citizen,

1010
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,480
 so this definitely is not, like, I'm not badgering her at all.

1011
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,480
 This is what he says about her.

1012
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,480
 Joy Geyser is a host.

1013
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,480
 She is not my sister-in-law.

1014
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,480
 She married someone I thought was my half-brother,

1015
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,480
 but we aren't even related.

1016
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,480
 So there is some sort of connect--

1017
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,480
 he is admitting that she has some sort of family connection to him.

1018
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,480
 So he could have come out and said, "I have no idea who this woman is."

1019
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,480
 Now he can say, "Well, it's my half-brother, but we're not really related."

1020
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,480
 Anyways, it is someone who he knows personally,

1021
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,480
 and probably is a sister-in-law.

1022
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,480
 She married someone I thought was my half-brother,

1023
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,480
 but we aren't even really related.

1024
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,480
 My father wasn't his as was thought.

1025
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,480
 Her and her ex-husband and a few of their kids

1026
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,480
 attended the cloning center and get really gross.

1027
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,480
 She tortured me herself with a power drill.

1028
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,480
 So there are people out there who know him personally

1029
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,480
 who say this guy has some mental problems.

1030
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,480
 He goes on to say, "In Canada, if you have mental problems,

1031
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,480
 you have to take medication. I'm not taking medication."

1032
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,480
 There go, "Therefore, I don't have mental problems."

1033
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,480
 There is one weird thing about this whole story.

1034
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,480
 One weird thing.

1035
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:43,480
 And I don't know how it fits in.

1036
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,480
 He pointed it out, and I was like, "Whatever."

1037
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,480
 I rolled my eyes and put up a big W sign.

1038
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,480
 I'm like, "Uh, whatever."

1039
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,480
 And then I went to look at it, and I was like,

1040
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,480
 "That is weird. Very weird."

1041
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,480
 Very weird. That's my Kermit impression.

1042
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,480
 Everyone says I sound like Kermit anyways,

1043
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,480
 but I can actually do a Kermit impression.

1044
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,480
 The Megadeth album, which he wrote, by the way,

1045
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,480
 that song you like, you're welcome.

1046
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,480
 Megadeth album, The World Needs a Hero.

1047
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,480
 It's an album cover of a skeleton busting out of a human body.

1048
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,480
 And he goes, "I was the model for that album cover. That was me."

1049
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,480
 And I was like, "What? Whatever."

1050
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,480
 I mean, I get to that part after reading tons and tons of stuff.

1051
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,480
 There is so much written about this guy

1052
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,480
 that I probably will revisit him when I have more time to look into this

1053
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,480
 more of his nonsense, but maybe not.

1054
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,480
 I think we might have covered all.

1055
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,480
 But anyways, Megadeth album cover, there's a skeleton jumping out of a guy.

1056
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,480
 And he goes, "I was the model for that album cover."

1057
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,480
 And I was like, "No, you weren't."

1058
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,480
 And I'm reading this after I'm reading about swamp people

1059
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,480
 and Mila Kunis looking like a lemur and all this sort of stuff.

1060
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,480
 And so I go and I look at the album cover

1061
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,480
 and then there's like a photo of him next to the photo of the album cover.

1062
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,480
 It looks like him.

1063
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,480
 It looks like this random guy who's saying that he was connected to the music industry.

1064
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,480
 It looks like him.

1065
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,480
 Now, to be fair, there's 7 billion humans on the planet

1066
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,480
 and I'd say probably 80% of them all look like each other.

1067
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,480
 People get me confused for people all the time.

1068
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,480
 I have a very universal look.

1069
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,480
 I've walked up to people in restaurants and go,

1070
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,480
 "Dude, we look the same. Isn't this weird?"

1071
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,480
 They're always like, "What? No, please go away. I'm eating."

1072
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,480
 I'm like, "No, look it! Take a picture with me. We look the same."

1073
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,480
 But it is weird.

1074
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,480
 If he had found a photo of himself like as an astronaut

1075
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,480
 and he's like, "Look, I was also an astronaut."

1076
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,480
 You'd be like, "Yeah, it doesn't fit with the theme of you being a musician."

1077
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,480
 But the fact that he has some sort of psychological issue

1078
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,480
 believing that he's part of the music industry

1079
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,480
 and then an album comes out in 2001

1080
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,480
 and it looks like him

1081
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,480
 is bizarre.

1082
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,480
 And we talked earlier about how people age.

1083
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,480
 People change over the years.

1084
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,480
 The album came out in 2001.

1085
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,480
 There's video of him from like 2015,

1086
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,480
 so about 13, 14 years after that,

1087
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,480
 he looks the same.

1088
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,480
 He looks like he hasn't aged in the past decade.

1089
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,480
 I believe Donald Marshall has these dreams

1090
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,480
 or these visions, whatever you want to call them,

1091
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,480
 where he's in this gladiator pit

1092
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,480
 and he's having the bone marrow sucked out of him by Troy Landry.

1093
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,480
 I believe that Donald Marshall has these weird delusions

1094
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,480
 that make him think that he wrote all of these songs.

1095
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,480
 When he hears these songs on the radio

1096
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,480
 and there's one line that reminds him of some experience that he imagined,

1097
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,480
 he then retroactively remembers writing the song.

1098
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,480
 I believe that Donald Marshall has these beliefs.

1099
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,480
 And other than rational thought being a rational human being,

1100
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,480
 I can't prove that his stories aren't true.

1101
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,480
 I don't believe they are. I don't believe they are.

1102
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,480
 I think they're all made up, but I can't prove them.

1103
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,480
 Other than plot holes like how does he keep getting out of the cloning facility,

1104
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,480
 the cloning facility beginning in the first place

1105
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,480
 and the ability for humans to clone each other.

1106
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,480
 And Troy Landry hanging out with Queen Elizabeth.

1107
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,480
 There's a lot of plot holes.

1108
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,480
 But the one piece of physical evidence that he actually can show us

1109
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,480
 is oddly compelling.

1110
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,480
 Now again, let me reiterate, I do not believe that Donald Marshall

1111
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:23,480
 is actually a clone gladiator who wrote the greatest songs of all time.

1112
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:31,480
 But he might have been the model for the album cover of a Megadeth album.

1113
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:38,480
 And if he was a model for this album cover in 2001,

1114
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,480
 compared to what he looks like today and he looks the same,

1115
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,480
 he might be a clone.

1116
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,480
 Now I'm not saying he is,

1117
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,480
 but either he ages incredibly slowly, which is fine,

01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,480
 because a lot of people age incredibly slowly.

01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,480
 And his last piece of evidence is also debunked.

1120
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:04,480
 Or somewhere just a few miles underneath our feet

1121
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:10,480
 is row after row after row of Donald Marshall clones.

1122
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,480
 And while we sit up here and we laugh and we make fun of this story,

1123
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:45,480
 another pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
