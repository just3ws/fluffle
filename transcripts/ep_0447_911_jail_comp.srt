1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A secret code is uncovered involving gas stations spread across the country.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Is it possible that the next time you see a cup floating down a river, you might not want to grab it?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And then we take a look at the story of a woman who says that she was put in a mental hospital,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 because she believed in conspiracy theories.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 But is there more to the story today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I don't know, actually I'm a walkie-talkie.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter or I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We got a ton of stuff to cover. So no dilly-dallying, no lolly-gagging.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 We're gonna get right to it. First off I gotta say thank you to our newest Patreon, Brian Kim.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Brian Kim, BK for short, British Knights. Remember those shoots?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I don't know if he does. He might be way too young to remember British Knights.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 But Brian, thank you so much for supporting the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 You are gonna be our captain this episode. You can't support the Patreon.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 You know what I'm gonna say? That's okay too. Just help get the word out about the show.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 That really, really helps a lot.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Hey Brian, I'm gonna flip you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're going on a road trip.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So let's put in the soundtrack to Britney Spears Crossroads, the ultimate road trip movie.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 We're gonna drive from Little Hood River. It's getting hot. It's getting hot up here.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Actually, so good. We're leaving here and we're just gonna keep driving south.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Now, this is a story that was recommended to me by Stealthy Steve via Instagram.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Really, really appreciated Stealthy. He's been sending a lot of stuff lately.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 He sent me this clip. Now, Brian, let's pull up into this Love's gas station and we're gonna get out.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Now, we're gonna go in, buy some chips, some beef jerky. Oh my God.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I'm eyeing the nicotine. I'm eyeing the nicotine behind the counter.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 You guys are like, "Mmm-mm, don't." I was like, "But maybe I can just try a can and I won't get addicted again."

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And you're like, "Mmm-mm, I was like, "Okay, fine. I guess I'll just have to eat a bunch of beef jerky instead."

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 You're like, "Mmm-mm, shake your head."

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 As that narrative is going on, as you guys are tisking me for my addictions, let's play a clip from Instagram that Stealthy Steve tagged me on.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Let's listen to this clip here for a second.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 My theory was that there's a secret society on the travel the highways, same paths truckers do.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And they use audiobooks to hide secret messages.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And you just have to know which audiobook to pick up and listen to to hear the secret message.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And they're only available at Love's truck stops.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Could be a whole child smuggling ring.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Or could be something righteous and pure.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Some new form of the crusader knights or something.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Some crazy hedge wizards.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Some like ecoterrorist hedge wizards using esoteric spiritualism.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So, that guy, this is an interesting one.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And Stealthy, thank you so much for letting me know about this.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 This is an interesting one for me, because obviously it sounds insane, right?

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 That the audiobook layout, or the way that the, if you know which rack to look on, like let's say you know the code.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 So you know the Love's, all the Love's in Arizona.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 If you go to the third rack, eighth cassette down for the audiobooks, or that shows my age, they don't put them in cassettes anymore.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Third rack, eighth to the side from the left.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And that CD audiobook that contains a code that either is for satanic groups, or crusader knights, or whatever the war.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I don't know what these guys are, but I have to look them up.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Ecoterrorist hedge wizards.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Now I know what an ecoterrorist is.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I know what a hedge is, and I know what a wizard is, but I've never seen those words in order ever.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Ecoterrorist hedge wizards.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I mean that's pretty dope. I'm gonna see if I can look those guys up.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 But it could be child smuggling, or it could be a bunch of good guys. Who knows?

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 What's interesting, so I have mixed feelings about this, because one, that sounds absolutely insane, right?

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 But, but, I'm gonna tell you guys, I've talked about stuff like this a couple times on the show, and it's so funny because Stealthy tagged me in this,

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 and then later that day an episode came out where I was like, this is true, this is true about another code.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I forgot what I was talking about.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Here's a tip from an old salty conspiracy theorist.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Predictive programming, Simpsons, predicted 9/11, all this stuff.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 That's not real. This type of stuff is real.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 This is 100%-- Now I'm not saying that loves, I'm not saying that loves, and the audiobook industry are complicit in this.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I don't know if this example is real, but these are how the codes are.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 It's not, oh, I watched a Beyonce video and she held up a triangle, and then it cut to an image of like a goat.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Like, that's just weird, or that's just like seeking extra views, like Rihanna declaring herself queen of the Illuminati and all that stuff.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 This is how-- These are the real codes, and here's the old tip.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 If you know about it, it's probably fake.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And not necessarily you, because I guess you researched this stuff, you're like, what?

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 If it's out there in the ether, if it's out there as a big conspiracy theory, it's fake.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 It's the stuff that normies, or just even in the conspiracy theory circles, a lot of people don't know about this stuff.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Conspiracy theory is overrun by predicted programming, which has never been proven, and it can only be cited as far about like the people who invented it, the people or in their words discovered it.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It only goes back to like, they came out, they broke out of the Illuminati like in the late 90s, early 2000s, so it's very, very recent.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 You can't go back to shows in the 1920s or radio programs in the 1920s or books in the 1920s and see hint after hint after hint involving World War II or Vietnam or the Bilderberg group or any of this stuff.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 It's all super real. It's a false flag. The predicted programming is not real. This type of stuff is real.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Again, I'm not saying that loves, that this one is real, but this is how you would communicate with other members of your group.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 You go into this establishment and you know which item to order on the menu, and the person of that establishment is also part of this network.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 That's 100% how they do it.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So as much as this guy sounds like the ramblings of Illuminati, and it very well may be. This broken clock can be right twice a day, right?

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 But this thing is far more believable than I saw back to the future part two, and it told me that 9/11 was gone. That's a myth.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 That is the mental illness. This may be mental illness, but the other one definitely is.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I think it's an interesting thing, but again, most people don't know about it, and even knowing about it, you're never going to be able to know the codes.

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And the fact that it's real doesn't make it any easier to solve. You'll never solve it without the key.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 It's like knowing somewhere in your house there's a safe full of a million dollars, but it's hidden, and even when you find it, you can never figure out the combination.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 That's how these codes work. So, and interesting, fine. Again, this guy might know some eco-terrorist hedge-whisperers personally and know the code.

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Most likely he's in the...going through something, but that is more accurate than predictive programming.

86
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 So thank you for that. That was a great example of that, Stelthi. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

87
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Brian, let's go ahead and hop in that carbonar copter. We are headed out to Mexico.

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 We're headed out to a place called Lake Texcoco. Lake Texcoco.

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Now, there is one episode I have wanted to do since season four, and actually that's a good reminder.

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Next week is the last week of season nine, and then I'm going to take a week off. So you're going to get one more week, then I'm going to take a week off.

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 There's been an episode I've wanted to do for almost like a year and a half now, and I might do it next season.

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 That's what I have to do with this region. That's a little spoiler alert if you're familiar with the history of Lake Texcoco.

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 But anyways, Lake Texcoco. It's this...it's funny because it's not even a lake anymore. I guess they have to drain it because Mexico City kept getting flooded.

94
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 But you had this lake, and you had all these little rivers, and way, way back in the day. So we're headed back in time, and now we're walking around Mexico.

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 There's a bunch of Mexican dudes hanging out, and they're like native Mexican dudes. Like this is before the Spanish showed up and all that stuff.

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Like fishing, and like, I don't know what they did. Growing crops, which I think is what every human did.

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 We're in Mexico. There's a long time ago. Mexicans are growing crops, and fishing, and doing stuff.

98
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And this one kid is like running off from the farm day, and they're like, "Come back here, Johnny!" And he's like, "No, no, I'm gonna go hang out by myself."

99
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Whee! He goes and he plays. Now Johnny's hanging out by the river, and we're hiding in the bushes.

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 This is not going to get creepy. What? The kids are not going to have a good day, but we're not going to do anything.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 We're hiding in the bushes. We're watching. And this kid's playing by the river, and he's like throwing rocks and picking up sticks.

102
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And then a little chocolate cup goes floating down the river. And he's like, "Huh? We're going! Huh? Where in the world is that?"

103
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 The little chocolate cup is floating down the river. And Johnny's kind of following it along the river bank, and he's watching it kind of bobble down the river.

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And then it kind of seems to be in a whirlpool. It's kind of just floating there for a second.

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Johnny starts to reach in. His little hand, little hand tries to grab the chocolate cup. His foot starts to slip in.

106
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 "Oh! Oh! An adult showed up and grabbed Johnny by the arm."

107
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 "Johnny! What are you doing?" The little Johnny points to the chocolate cup. The adult goes, "They would be really creepy!"

108
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Jason told a story where something happened to you, and he realized that halfway through.

109
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 "So you go home, kid! I will take over this narration. Me, this strong man, who's lived a good life, and Johnny runs home."

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 That's weird. I wonder why he said that. So now, now, because I realized that way through, I didn't want to finish that story.

111
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Chocolate cup's in the river. This old man, he's lived a very good life. He's like, "Hmm! A chocolate cup!"

112
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 He reaches in to get the chocolate cup and moves just out of range right before he can reach it.

113
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 [imitates sound of a chocolate cup]

114
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And as the old man is drowning in the... Aren't you glad I changed that?

115
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 As the old man is drowning in the river, every time he goes under, he sees a chilling sight.

116
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 A chocolate snake spinning faster around him, making the water even harder to swim in,

117
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 because there's a bunch of bubbles and stuff, and you can't see where he's going.

118
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 He's accidentally swimming down, and he drowns.

119
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 So this is the legend of the... I don't know how you pronounce the letter X.

120
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I think it's "zeh"? "Zeh", right? Like a zombie?

121
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 A zicotl. Zicotl. This is zicotl. This is... Zicotl literally means, in the Aztec language, "chocolate cup snake."

122
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 So I guess, now that I've looked farther in my notes, probably shouldn't have been calling him "Messican's" this whole time.

123
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 These are Aztec people. "Chocolate cup snake." Very very... That's a good name.

124
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 You know what it is. Like, Bigfoot, you know what it is.

125
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 "Chocolate cup snake." You know what it is. And it is exactly what it sounds like.

126
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 It's a water-based snake, a little chocolate cup on its back.

127
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And it actually... It's interesting because it's one of those things that people believed was an actual creature.

128
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It wasn't a water spirit, but it falls into that same category of a lesson. Stay away from...

129
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 There's so many cryptids that are, "Stay away from the woods, kids. Stay away from the water, kids."

130
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Not, not "stay away from the kids in the woods."

131
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 But telling children, "Stay away from the woods, stay away from the water, stay away from swamps."

132
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Don't go out late at night. Don't talk to strangers.

133
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So many of these stories are based on lessons to teach kids.

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Be a good kid or something's gonna tear your skin off and make you...

135
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 What was that one legend? There was that one legend in Germany that if he caught you,

136
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 he would turn you into a Spanish dude and you'd wake up in Spain.

137
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 I forgot. It was some, like, Christmas myth. And kids are like, "No, no, I'll be okay. I'll be fine. I don't want to go to Spain."

138
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 So all of these myths, or so many of these myths are based on that.

139
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 It's really, really interesting to look at. That's where this one comes from.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Stay away from the water. But they also believed it was a real thing and they would talk about it as if it was a real snake.

141
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And the cup on its back would look like a ceremonial vase.

142
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And sometimes we'd even have designs on it that would look like a real...

143
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Someone had made a cup and it's flown down the water. Now I gotta wonder, were they so in need of cups that they were willing to jump into a lake to grab a cup?

144
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Like, that seems like an odd piece of bait. Like, if it was a shiny piece of gold or something like that, or a Nintendo Switch,

145
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 floating down the river, I could totally see that. But I mean, I'd be like, "Ah, I got enough cups at home and I do. I have a whole cabinet."

146
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I live by myself and I have an entire cupboard. I have, like, 30 cups. Ah, whatever.

147
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 What's interesting is, like I said, so they ended up draining the lake because Mexico City kept flooding.

148
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But the legend didn't disappear. Now, obviously, it would be really easy. You're just walking by a dried riverbed and there's just a snake slithering there.

149
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 The giant cup on his back. The snake has disappeared.

150
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Now, it's turned into an evil fairy.

151
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Because, again, this is one of the things I love about this stuff is how the myth evolves, how things change over time.

152
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Because they still want the lesson taught. Don't mess with the water, dudes, guys, kids. Stay out of the water.

153
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 But now, instead of having this snake with a cup attached to its back, almost like an evolutionary trait, almost like we're being tricked,

154
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 we're the prey. Just like a lanternfish would have that on its head.

155
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 But now people are like, "Oh, that's impossible, right? And we don't need cups. We can go to the dollar store and we can go to the dollar store."

156
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 "And we don't need cups. We can go to the dollar store and get all the cups we want."

157
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Now it's an evil fairy, but what's weird is it still involves a chocolate cup floating down the river.

158
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Or a lake or a bog or anything like that. But instead of telling kids there's a giant snake in there, they go, "Oh, no, no, it's a fairy."

159
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 So she can magically make them appear and then the parent just goes, "Listen, dude, I'm just going to be honest with you. There is no fairy. There are no chocolate cups.

160
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Just stay out of the water, you idiot. Just stay away from the water. Okay? We're done."

161
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And then the dad walks away. I'm super disappointed. But as the dad's walking away, he turns and looks at the camera.

162
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 He has snake eyes. He has a chocolate cup on his back. He's like, "I left that life behind. I gave it up and I evolved to be a human."

163
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Totally indistinguishable from the rest of these Homo sapiens except for the chocolate cup on my back. It's like the size of a 32-ounce serve from McDonald's.

164
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 He's always wearing a cloak. And now, now my own son, my own son's trying to fall in the water and I can't control myself. I want to be a snake so badly.

165
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 No! Anyways, that's the story of the chocolate cup snake. I just love that name. I love that it's just that blunt.

166
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 But let's go ahead and move on to our last story. I want you to take that carbonar copter up one more time this episode, Brian.

167
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 We are headed out to New Zealand. Now, this story happened back in 2006. And it is all from the point of view of one woman.

168
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 So everything I'm saying is alleged. She's going to be talking about these other people and things that they did and events that happened.

169
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 We only have her side of the story and what a story it is. We're headed back to January 20th, 2006 and TVNZ, which is a New Zealand channel, aired a program about Osama bin Laden and George Bush.

170
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Specifically about the 9/11 attacks. Now, I've talked about this several times on the show. I used to be a 9/11 true through.

171
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 When I realized that the footage that we were being shown was fake, the footage of Tower 7 falling down was doctored. It was edited.

172
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And when the people, I understand the government is going to lie to me. I think everyone with half a brain understands their government lies to them.

173
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 That's just something that happens. Your boss lies to you. Everyone in any position of power is going to lie to you.

174
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 So when someone goes there lying to you, you're like, "Yeah, duh." And then they start showing you proof of the lie. You're like, "Whoa."

175
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 This is bigger than I thought. This goes all the way to the top. But then when I find out the conspiracy theorists are doing the same things that the government's doing.

176
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Doctoring evidence lying to me, saying half truth, saying no truth, just lying. Then I was like, "Well, this is a lie too."

177
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 I get the government's going to lie to me. And I can factor that in when the government tells me something. I go, "Eh."

178
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 But then when someone is supposedly on my side presenting the truth, when you lie to me, I didn't factor that in. I feel like even a bigger rub.

179
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 The biggest thing everyone says is, "Investigate Tower 7." I spent a lot of time investigating Tower 7.

180
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Found out the footage was doctored. You guys have all seen the footage of Tower 7 collapsing on its footprint. That is not the way that it happened.

181
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 That footage is edited. We've talked about that on the show before. But I want to say that I used to be a 9/11 truther.

182
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And I was on 9/11 truther for quite a few years from about 2001 to maybe 2008, 2009, somewhere around there. It was a long time.

183
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 So on one hand, I sympathize with the events that this woman's going to go through. Her name is Claire Swinney.

184
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 On the other hand, she definitely takes it to the inf level. TVNZ, I was a truther, but I also didn't really care if anyone else believed it.

185
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Because I totally understood how crazy it all was. And I was a truther in the event that there was control demolition in the building.

186
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 That type of guy. I didn't believe in space lasers and believe in hologram planes. Just stuff like that.

187
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Sounds foolish to say now, but I've got to be honest. And I think it gives me a different insight to how this all works.

188
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Rather than just being like, "Oh, I was too smart to fall for it from the beginning." Kudos to you if you were.

189
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But anyways, Claire Swinney watches this program about Osama bin Laden and George Bush in 9/11 and the official story and all that stuff.

190
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 She begins to basically write to the news network saying, "You guys need to give airtime to the other side."

191
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I have this documentary called In Plane Sight. Remember all those? The road to tyranny, loose change. Remember all those?

192
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Anyways, anyways, it really made YouTube, I think what it was today was all that stuff.

193
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 But she was sending out DVDs of this to the network. She was talking to people.

194
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 She then begins to believe she's being stalked. And I think the actual, more accurate term is gangstalked.

195
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Where she believes that government agents are trying to silence her. She's getting vaguely threatening emails.

196
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And it culminates in, and that's fine. It's not fine she's getting threatening emails, but she's getting emails like, "Shut up.

197
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 You don't know what you're talking about." Stuff like that.

198
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And again, this is all from her point of view. There's two types of emails you can get. You can get emails like, "I told you, you need to shut it."

199
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Or, "I'm going to cut your head off and feed it to your dog and then I'm going to cut your dog's head off and feed it to your cat and we're going all the way down."

200
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 That's an outright threat.

201
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 So, I mean, she's not posting stuff like that in her article. She's not saying, "I was told that I was going to be shot if I continued."

202
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 It's always these fake threats. It culminates in, and you're thinking, "Well, Jason, maybe she was getting threatened."

203
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 It's interesting because from her point of view, this is the most menacing story she has. She was walking out of the street one day,

204
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 and a guy in a business suit walked past her and almost bumped into her.

205
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And then was kind of looking over his shoulder at her and then got to a stoplight before she did.

206
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And he clinched and unclynched his hand four times.

207
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And then walked across the street. So that is the level of the threats that are coming to her.

208
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I.e., she's over-analyzing, I believe, what the actual threat to her is.

209
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 She believes it's a New Zealand group called the SIS, which is like their version of the CIA or something like that.

210
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 But I'll push back on that for a second. There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of conspiracy theorists who believe 9/11 was an inside job or space lasers and stuff like that.

211
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Intelligence agencies would be spending all their time investigating everybody if they're investigating her.

212
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 But anyway, she perceived to be under threat. Whether or not that was true, that's really not what's interesting about this story.

213
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I mean, hopefully she wasn't. Hopefully she was-- I guess that's-- I don't want to say hopefully she wasn't, because then that probably means that she was going crazy.

214
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 But you know what I mean? Hopefully she was blown stuff out of proportion.

215
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Anyways, she begins to talk to her friends and family about her being stalked.

216
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 All of her family knows about her thing about 9/11. She would talk about it all the time.

217
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And when someone would be like, "Oh, I don't know about that." She'd give them a DVD.

218
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And there's one of those. Remember, that was really how these people made their money.

219
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Wrote to Tyranny with Alex Jones and in plain sight, they would get you to buy the DVDs in bulk and then hand them out.

220
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 It's a money-making thing. It's a money-making thing.

221
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Anyways, she's handing out these DVDs.

222
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 She tells a relative, because she's talking about being threatened, "I would rather overdose on pills than be shot."

223
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Now, the relative is very alarmed by that, because the relative doesn't think she's under any threat.

224
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 But now she's talking about, "Oh, I don't-- if I think I'm going to get shot, I'll take pills."

225
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And the relative's like, "But you're not going to get shot, but you think you might get shot, so at any point."

226
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 So she calls mental health.

227
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Now, you could say that she probably shouldn't have.

228
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 The relative probably regrets it considering what will come, but we're going to move on to June 6th.

229
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 So this is a good six months after the program was aired and she began writing these letters and sending these DVDs to the network.

230
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 June 6th, there's a knock at her door.

231
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And let me be frank, too. She does not believe in the craziest of the crazy theories with 9/11, either.

232
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 She doesn't believe in time travel or-- oh, she might believe in the theory of time travel, but she doesn't believe 9/11 was a time travel experiment.

233
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Holographic planes, space lasers, all that stuff.

234
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 She believes the most common one, which is it was an inside job, control, demolition, all that stuff.

235
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 So not-- it's still nuts, but not super nuts, right?

236
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 June 6th, knock at her door, she gets picked up by mental health.

237
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 There are police there and they said, "The police are here in case you run."

238
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And she's like, "I'm totally fine."

239
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 And they go, "We got a report that you were talking about killing yourself, so let's just come down.

240
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 We're going to do an interview. We'll tell that you're not suicidal. You'll be allowed to go."

241
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 She brings her roommate with her because she's like, "Can I bring my roommate because at least he knows that I'm not suicidal?"

242
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And they're like, "Yeah."

243
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 At the hospital, she goes to Wangari Hospital.

244
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 She's put in Ward 7, which is a high-risk ward.

245
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And there she meets Dr. Zuberon.

246
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Now, Dr. Zuberon's a very, very interesting character in this story.

247
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And I don't even think that Claire understands how interesting this character is.

248
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 When this story's over, let me go ahead and continue this.

249
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 So she meets Dr. Zuberon and they're doing an intake test.

250
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Her roommate is nowhere to be seen right now. They're just doing an intake test.

251
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 They're asking her questions.

252
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Now, one of the questions they ask, "Are you hopeless about the future?"

253
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And she says, "Yes." But she clarifies, "I'm hopeless about the geopolitical future of a world where the U.S. government could kill 3,000 of its own people and blame it on Osoma bin Laden."

254
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 So she's trying to, Claire, first off, you should be honest with your healthcare worker.

255
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 But if you don't want to be honest with your healthcare worker, don't say yes to that, right?

256
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Because I understand where she was coming from. She's feeling, "Yes, I am hopeless."

257
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 But that's not what that question's designed for. That question is designed to tell whether or not you're suicidal.

258
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Not whether or not you agree with the foreign policies of a country that you don't live in.

259
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It'd be like, "Right now, do you feel hopeless for the future?"

260
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And you'd be like, "Well, yeah. You could continue, you know, a lot of people have lost their jobs and I'm concerned about how the economy will grow."

261
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It doesn't matter. You got that. Yeah.

262
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I'm not giving you tips on how to lie to mental health officials. She was like, "I'm not suicidal. My roommate doesn't think suicidal.

263
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I've never thought I was suicidal. I made this offhand comment. I want to get out of here."

264
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 She, at a certain point, you just got to shut up, right? But anyways, so he writes down, "Yeah."

265
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 She says the test is done really quickly. Now, she starts to talk about, because she knows why she's in there.

266
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 She's in there because she's exposing the truth about 9/11.

267
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 So she begins to talk to Dr. Zabarin about this and she's like, "Listen, control demolitions. Building 7. Trillion dollars missing from the Treasury the day before when Donald Rumsfeld gave that speech."

268
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 All this stuff. She's laying all this stuff out. And he's just sitting there writing and taking notes.

269
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 She brings up the emails that she got, the threatening emails. She's writing this stuff down.

270
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 She's like, "You die clenching his fist four times." She's writing this all down. He goes, "Those letters are totally normal. I don't consider those letters threatening at all. I think you're delusional.

271
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 I think that you are delusional and we're going to keep you here for five days." Now, she says, "No, absolutely not. I have a right to leave."

272
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And the doctor's like, "You don't. You're delusional." Now, he does not believe that 9/11 is an inside job. He's making that very, very clear.

273
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 He's saying, "Watch this DVD. Here, look at this foot. No, I'm not going to do it. I'm not. You're delusional." And he doesn't want to play into her delusions.

274
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 She's going to stay there for the next five days.

275
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Next day, she has her room. She's not specific on this, but somehow she gets a cachet of DVDs and printouts.

276
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 So, I'm thinking her roommate brought him to her. She begins to give them, now she's physically giving this stuff to the doctor.

277
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 She's in a very, very large form. Look at this article about the architectural. It's from the engineers and architects from 9/11.

278
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Just look at this stuff. And the doctor is, "You are delusional. 9/11 was not an inside job. It was brought down by airplanes. Those people died.

279
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I'm not going to feed into your delusion. In fact, I'm going to up your medication."

280
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And the nurses are put in a really weird position because according to Claire, the nurses do not believe she should be there.

281
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 To the point that at one point a nurse goes, this interesting statement, the nurse says, "The doctors are so used to looking at daisies,

282
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 that when they see something that's not a daisy, they don't know what to think."

283
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 But the nurses were saying, "We don't think you should be here."

284
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 They are working with people who should be in Ward 7 all the time. They don't think she should be there.

285
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 They're not commenting on whether or not 9/11 is an inside job, but they definitely don't think she's delusional.

286
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 To the point where they say, "I'm going to give you this pill. If you don't take it, I'm not going to say anything."

287
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 So according to her, the nurses believe her. Dr. Zubaron does not.

288
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 And there's a hearing, after the five days, there is a hearing about her being released.

289
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And her father is there, and one of the nurses is there on her side to be like, "I don't think she's delusional. I think she's totally fine."

290
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 On the other side, you have Dr. Zubaron, and you have a judge.

291
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 And the reason why she was put in there in the first place was because she was suicidal.

292
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And everyone in that room agreed to the judge. She is not suicidal. Even Dr. Zubaron goes, "She's not suicidal."

293
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 However, she is delusional. She believes that 9/11 was an inside job, and we know as a matter of fact that it was not.

294
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And the judge's father stands up, "I believe 9/11 was an inside job. I don't believe the official story, and I'm not locked up in here. My daughter should not be here."

295
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 The nurse is probably looking a little embarrassed at this point, but she goes, "I'm not going to talk about 9/11, but I do not believe she is delusional."

296
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 She does not seem to be delusional. The judge extends her stay. The judge also believes she is delusional.

297
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Day 11, another nurse comes up to her. At this point, all the nurses think she should be free.

298
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Another nurse comes up and says, "This is what you need to do. You need to call for a consumer rights advocate. That's the way we'll have another hearing. It's not just going to be this judge. It's not going to be this type of thing.

299
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 We're going to get someone to come in. You can present your case. Dr. Zubaron can present the case again. We got to get you out of here. You shouldn't be here."

300
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 So she does. On Day 11, she's been locked up for almost two weeks now. Day 11, she's in there. She walks into the room. Dr. Zubaron walks into the room.

301
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 The consumer rights advocate is there. They begin talking.

302
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And this is where one of the most interesting twists in this story takes place, and it totally goes right over Claire's head.

303
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Like, I had to do a double take when I read it, and I go, "What?"

304
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So this whole thing has been about. Originally it was because she was suicidal. She always saw it as she was a 9/11 truther, and the government was trying to silence her, and that's why she was inside.

305
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Which that logic should have went out of the window. She should have realized that really wasn't true when the nurses were trying to help get her out if it was this giant conspiracy.

306
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 The nurses would have just drugged her up. She'd be locked in a loony bin still.

307
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 But she's sitting in this room with Dr. Zubaron. Consumer rights advocate is there.

308
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 And she makes her case, and she again has these DVDs and these letters and all of this stuff, proving that 9/11 was an inside job.

309
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Don't believe the official story. Da-da-da-da-da. She's making her argument.

310
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And in this moment, and this is really a key moment in this story, she learns for the first time in 11 days, Dr. Zubaron was at ground zero.

311
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Dr. Zubaron had been visiting New York City on September 11, 2001. He was there. He watched the towers fall with his own eyes.

312
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 All the panic, the fear, the death. She could watch video after video online. She could get those DVDs and bulk and put them in and go through her head.

313
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 He was there. That is why he could not believe what she was saying. It was the ultimate disrespect.

314
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 You know, we all see it on video, but he was there. He watched the towers fall. He smelt the dust and the debris.

315
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Everything that we see, he smelt and felt and heard right there. They would traumatize any human.

316
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And then fast forward, he's this doctor sitting in his office five years later, and a woman comes in, suicidal. It's normal.

317
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 It's unfortunate, but it's normal, and he's doing paperwork. He goes to interview her, and she begins to sit right across from him and say to his face,

318
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 "9/11 was not what we think it was. It was George Bush trying to kill people." And you can almost imagine the pencil scratching across the paper when she first brings that up.

319
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Now, she drops that at the very end of her narrative, because this is the end of the story. She finds out that he was at ground zero.

320
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 She totally brushes over it in her story. He's like, "Oh, I found that out." And he makes his case. He goes, "I believe she's delusional. 9/11 was not an inside job.

321
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 We have all of this stuff." But he's not bringing up engineering reports and stuff like that. He's just saying she's nuts. It's not true.

322
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 And the consumer rights advocate sides with Claire, and says, "While I personally don't believe that 9/11 was an inside job as well, I don't believe she's delusional."

323
00:32:47,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And then Claire passes a DVD over to Dr. Zuberan and asks him to watch it. Asks him to replay footage of an event he was there at over and over and over again.

324
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 She goes, "I think this will help you come to terms with this." And he just kind of shakes his head, and she goes, "You should watch it." And he goes, "I don't think I will."

325
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 She was allowed to leave the mental health hospital.

326
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 On the 26th of August, she gets a letter from the Northland District Health Board, and they apologize to her for keeping her there.

327
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Because what happened was it's against the law in New Zealand and in a lot of places to put people in jail for their political beliefs.

328
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 And of course the legal system would always find a way to kind of weasel around that. But that is the law. You can't just lock people up because they're one political striper or another.

329
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 And that was her argument. I'm a political prisoner. My political belief is that the Illuminati is trying to take over the world, and they created 9/11 so George Bush could do this, that, or the other thing.

330
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Like that is a political belief, really. I mean, it's not affiliated with any particular party, but she was not considered delusional. The hospital actually apologized to her, and she ends the article going, "I never got an apology from the doctor."

331
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Now it's funny because reading the article, I don't think she was delusional. Like I said, I think a lot of people believe this stuff.

332
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 I don't think she did herself any favors by continuing to mail out DVDs to people. I'd be really shocked how many people's minds she changed by doing that. That seems to be a constant thing. Sharing videos, sharing documents, and stuff like that.

333
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Eh. If it's word of mouth, maybe. If it's word of mouth, meaning "I'm talking to you as my friend," and I say some crazy conspiracy theory, you might be more willing to buy into that.

334
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 But if you just got crazy conspiracy theories mailed to you, dude, I should start a loot box that's just insane stuff. Like you pay me $20 a month and I send you a box of the most insane ramblings.

335
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 I don't steal my idea! Don't steal that idea! But anyways, while I'm formulating that, I don't think she was doing herself any favors by that. She definitely was hyper-vigilant.

336
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 The guy closing his fist a couple times, you know, but you also have to see the other side. You have to be willing when you talk about this stuff to understand the other side.

337
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 She's constantly trying to get this guy to believe in her conspiracy theory that she's only seen via video. She's trying to get a guy to believe it, who was there, who watched the towers fall.

338
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 And that was a rock in a hard place. He was never going to give up his spot. He was completely disrespectful to the victims of 9/11 to have these crazy conspiracy theories.

339
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 While she, on the other hand, has the argument it's more disrespectful that they died and no one knows why they died, or the real reason why they died.

340
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 So truly a rock in a hard place, that's not the term. Unstoppable force versus an immovable object.

341
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 The conspiracy theory that she saw on YouTube, and watched videos on, was real to her, she saw it over and over and over again.

342
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 But he was there, in the middle of it, not knowing what would happen next. No rewind, no slow motion, no freeze frame, just utter terror.

343
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 He was never going to agree with her, and she was never going to agree with him. Because their reality was so different.

344
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 And in the end, she just kind of brushes off the fact that he was there.

345
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Her audio-visual reality, splayed across the television set, was more real to her than what he saw that day.

346
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 People are saying that we've gotten to a point in society where everyone has their own facts. That's not true.

347
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 We've gotten to a point in society where everyone has their own reality. And that is far more dangerous.

348
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
