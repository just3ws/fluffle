1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
 Is it possible that ghosts, ghouls, goblins, elves, leprechauns, and the assorted list

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,760
 of goodies and baddies in the paranormal world are actually friends with each other?

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
 Interesting story.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,400
 And then we'll take a look at the final story of Season 20, when a man hosts a little girl's

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,600
 birthday party.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,920
 At his house he's just expecting a bunch of kids running around screaming at their top

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,200
 of their lungs.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,000
 Little did he know he would be the one doing the screaming.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:50,400
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,040
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,320
 I hope you guys are having an absolutely fantastic day.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,880
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,280
 So first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now everyone turn to the front entrance

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,840
 and give a salute and a round of applause at the same time.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
 For our newest Patreon supporter, Matthias Gamara.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,320
 Woohoo!

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
 Yeah!

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,200
 I was actually trying to do the salute and the applause and I hit myself in the nose.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
 Don't do that.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,040
 Please don't sue me if everyone else hit themselves in the nose as well.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,040
 I thought it was just a joke.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,480
 Matthias you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,120
 Thank you so much for supporting the show via the Patreon.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,880
 You guys can't support the show via the Patreon.

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,360
 If you guys can't support the show financially we also have a merch store as well.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,440
 But if you can't afford any of that stuff or maybe you can't afford it and just don't

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
 want to that's totally fine.

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,040
 That really really is.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,480
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,240
 That helps out so much.

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,760
 You have no idea how telling your friends and your family whether they're people online

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,560
 or people you know in real life or maybe both.

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,400
 Maybe you have a gaming crew and you're also friends in real life.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,920
 The point is, is that get the word out, that always helps so much.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,880
 That's something you can do to help the show grow.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,240
 Matthias you're going to stand there on standby.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,720
 Go ahead and help yourself to the fridge.

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,240
 I got some, I don't know there's actually nothing in there.

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,960
 I got a bunch of Diapepsy but I don't know maybe like Diapepsy.

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,160
 There's some Sprite Zero in there as well.

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,200
 This is the end of season 20.

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,920
 This is the end of season 20 and I feel like this season went on for a really long time.

45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
 I'm pretty sure that it did.

46
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,480
 This was a season I got COVID.

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,080
 So that put us back a week and all that stuff.

48
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
 But pretty eventful.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,000
 It is the season I got COVID so pretty eventful.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,640
 As far as that goes but it's been a really good season.

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,680
 I think this has been a really good season and I'll tell you guys that's a little behind

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,400
 the scenes tip.

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:56,040
 This is the first season in probably 20 seasons where I haven't ended the season going.

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,680
 I don't know if I want to continue the show anymore.

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,520
 Because not because of you guys, not because I think the show is running thin on material.

56
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,360
 It's just I'd be so exhausted by the end of that 20 weeks.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,640
 Luckily I got COVID and I got a break in the middle of it.

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,280
 No I don't know.

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,040
 This was the first season that I've been like okay I'm going to take my break and then we're

60
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,000
 just going to come back to doing more Dead or Abra Radial.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,080
 Pretty much every season before this I was so burned out by the end of those 50 someod

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
 episodes.

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
 Some seasons would go longer.

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,400
 I don't know if I'm coming back.

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,160
 I always came back because I love the show and I love you guys.

66
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,200
 But this is the first season where I haven't even had that thought.

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
 So that's good.

68
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,920
 I'm sure that that is good for the future of the show.

69
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,080
 I haven't been doing my YouTube shorts, my true crime TikToks, nothing like that.

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,280
 I was like okay I am done doing these.

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,960
 I need a break from these.

72
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,760
 That's a ton of extra work but we are at the end of season 20 so we will be back April

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,480
 3rd.

74
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,560
 April 2nd, April 3rd around there.

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,760
 That is when we'll be back season 21 of Dead or Abra Radial.

76
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,680
 It's a bit of a longer break than I normally take by only two days because one last pitch

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,040
 for the Oregon Ghost Conference in Seaside, Oregon March 24th at 6pm.

78
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,000
 I will be a present tourer.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 A what's a speaker.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,840
 You're like I'm going to go just to watch you mispronounce words in real life.

81
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,400
 What was that first word?

82
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,280
 What was the present for?

83
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,800
 I'm going to be a speaker at the Oregon Ghost Conference.

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
 I'm giving a...

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 Oh it's going to go great right?

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
 I can't even say what I'm going to do.

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
 Imagine me.

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 It's 50 minutes long.

89
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,280
 It's longer than an average episode.

90
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,400
 My presentation is on why are there no fat ghosts.

91
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,440
 And I know we covered that on an episode a while back but I've been doing even more

92
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,800
 research finding all sorts of crazy ghost stories that I've never talked about before

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,400
 on the show that I'm going to present live.

94
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,440
 I will talk about some of them in the future but all sorts of stories about why ghosts appear

95
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,040
 physically one way burst the other.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,000
 What does that mean for us as we inch closer and closer to death?

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,440
 You're like I want to leave a ghost that is cool looking.

98
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,160
 You're getting scarred up by a bear.

99
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,280
 You actually just have really bad stomach ulcers.

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,800
 Doctors are like these are going to kill you in like 1400 years.

101
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
 You're actually not going to die stomach ulcers when you run out in the forest.

102
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,440
 You're going to have some cool scars in the afternoon.

103
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,160
 We're going to talk about that so it would be really cool if you guys could show up.

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,320
 If you guys don't show up, if you guys can't show up, that's fine too.

105
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,520
 I'll probably cover some of those little ghost stories in future episodes that are

106
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
 ever ready to.

107
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,000
 But for those of you who do show up, it's going to be like 99% all new material.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,040
 So I think it would be really cool.

109
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,480
 And then I'm going to hang out at the ghost conference and be attending.

110
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,400
 Geez, I don't know how I.

111
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,120
 I almost want to sit in the audience and listen to myself just stumble on stage.

112
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,800
 Also, I know this is a lot of intro stuff but last episode of season 20, hopefully you

113
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
 guys are being patient with me.

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,480
 One of the speakers at the Oregon Ghost Conference is going to be Dr. Kelly Schutts.

115
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,360
 She recently interviewed me for her Paranormal Encounters podcast series.

116
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
 I'll put links to that in the show notes.

117
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,280
 There's an episode where she interviewed me.

118
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,760
 I talked about a lot of my personal ghost stories and that was very fun.

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,560
 Also, if you're looking for another podcast to listen to in the next two and a half weeks,

120
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,160
 Paranormal Encounters podcast series has a ton of interviews with people in the field

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
 of paranormal research.

122
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,320
 And also, if you're looking for a podcast to listen to, try the Asylum Case Studies.

123
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,240
 It's a podcast I've been on twice with fan of the show, Tressa Slater.

124
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,760
 She does the podcast, The Asylum Case Files.

125
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,360
 Is it Case Files or Case Studies?

126
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,440
 I'll put the link in the show notes but I'm pretty sure it's Case Files.

127
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,040
 Anyways, I could be wrong.

128
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,280
 Great podcast all around.

129
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,440
 She reviews Asylum Movies.

130
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,760
 The Asylum Movies.

131
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
 Not Movies.

132
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
 People trapped in the Asylum so that'd be so depressing.

133
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,560
 You're like, "Here's a documentary from 1942.

134
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,200
 One of the worst Asylums in America.

135
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,440
 We're going to watch this footage of horribly depressed people."

136
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 No.

137
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,800
 Movies like Megapurana and Transmorphers, they review those movies.

138
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,720
 The Avengers, Grimm, all that stuff.

139
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,520
 I'm going to see if she wants me back on the show.

140
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,040
 I'm going to see if she wants me back on the show because I'm itching to talk about

141
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,680
 Shark Side of the Moon, the Asylum's recent Asylum film.

142
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,520
 But anyway, so those are podcasts if you're looking for something to listen to in the

143
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
 meantime.

144
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,920
 I'll put my episodes in the show notes and then you can listen to that.

145
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,360
 Maybe find a brand new podcast.

146
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
 Maybe find fun.

147
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,760
 But you got to come back to this one.

148
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,960
 You just can't go, "Oh, I love these podcasts way better."

149
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
 Thanks, Jason.

150
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
 Unsubscribe.

151
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
 Matthias.

152
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,160
 I think that's everything we have to talk about.

153
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,120
 I don't think there's anything else big coming up.

154
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,560
 So, Matthias, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're going to

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
 leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

156
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,200
 Drive us all the way out to Ireland.

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,720
 And don't forget to hit that time travel button because we're going back to the year 1914.

158
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,880
 We're actually going to Scotland.

159
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,520
 Sorry, I read that wrong.

160
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,600
 You're like, "Oh man, it's St. Patrick's Day.

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,760
 It would be so cool to go to Ireland.

162
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,600
 Do you want to go to Ireland?"

163
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,440
 We're going to Scotland.

164
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,840
 So make a left.

165
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,600
 Now we're in Scotland and we're in the year 1914.

166
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,480
 Specifically we're in Inverary, Scotland.

167
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,440
 And it's a sunny afternoon.

168
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
 We're sitting there in the car.

169
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,880
 We see a little boy riding his tricycle on the outskirts of Iverary.

170
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,320
 Now it doesn't say how old this kid is.

171
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,640
 I'm assuming he's pretty young.

172
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,520
 If he can't ride a bike.

173
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,640
 If he's riding a tricycle, I would assume six or under.

174
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,840
 He doesn't specifically say, he doesn't give his name either.

175
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,720
 We're going to go ahead and call him Jake.

176
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,600
 But he's on trike all by himself in the middle of Scotland.

177
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,240
 And who would have guessed something bad is going to happen to this tyke?

178
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,560
 This little kid, so Jake, is riding this tricycle.

179
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,960
 And all of a sudden he bails, which again would be quite hard.

180
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,040
 Generally the tricycle is designed so it can't tip over.

181
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,560
 But he does.

182
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,280
 He's on the trike and he's six.

183
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
 He's outside.

184
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,440
 He's on the outskirts of town on this tricycle by himself.

185
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,720
 He has a hard tumble and it's so hard.

186
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,040
 He breaks his arm.

187
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,800
 Maybe a tricycle means something different in Scotland because I can't imagine.

188
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,080
 I guess it means three wheels.

189
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
 Maybe the three wheels are in the wrong order.

190
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,240
 I can't imagine what sort of bicycle accident you would have that you could break your arm.

191
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,160
 I remember once when I was a little kid, I was on a tricycle and we were moving into

192
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,440
 a new house.

193
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,200
 And listen, and I probably was younger than six, so it's probably like four or five.

194
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,440
 I was a jerk and I would just do stuff to make people mad all the time.

195
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
 I thought it was hilarious.

196
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
 I still do.

197
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,600
 I repress it more nowadays.

198
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,880
 We were moving and I decided I knew what I was doing.

199
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,280
 I was not innocent in this.

200
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,960
 I got on my tricycle, which is like the widest of all child vehicles.

201
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,560
 I'm on a tricycle and I begin tricycling up and down the hallway of this new house.

202
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,000
 I'm like, oh, that's fine.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,960
 That's like childhood innocence.

204
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
 That's a very sweet image.

205
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,760
 Well, remember, we're moving in and I'm fully aware that people are trying to go back and

206
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,240
 forth down this hallway.

207
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
 I was blocking them.

208
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,280
 I was doing it on purpose because I'm a jerk.

209
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,840
 Even at four or five, I was like, oh, you know, it'd be super funny if I ride this tricycle

210
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,240
 super slow down this long hallway.

211
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
 Parents are trying to move stuff in.

212
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,000
 Well, I don't know, maybe like three hours later, I'm still doing this.

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,320
 My mom was carrying a heavy box down the hallway and she said, she goes, Jason, you were on

214
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:11,600
 the tricycle going slow and in a mocking tone was going, la-do-da, la-de-da-da-da-da.

215
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,200
 She goes, you were doing it to aggravate us.

216
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,440
 You 100% were going as slow as possible and she was carrying this super heavy box and

217
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,920
 my mom wanted me to move.

218
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
 That's all she wanted me to do.

219
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,600
 They were telling me, you're going to go down the hallway, go down the hallway quicker.

220
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,800
 She's carrying a freezer.

221
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:37,440
 Put on the hallway, go down the hallway, la-de-da-da-da-da-da on my tricycle and my mom got so frustrated.

222
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
 She put her foot on the back of the tricycle.

223
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,120
 You know, you have those like stairs on the back of the tricycle, so an even smaller kid

224
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,640
 can ride on the back for whatever reason.

225
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,600
 She put her foot on the back of the tricycle and she goes, Jason, move.

226
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,560
 And she went to push me forward with her foot.

227
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
 So I would go, wee, down the hallway.

228
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,960
 That would encourage me to do it more.

229
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,360
 Now that I'm getting an assist, she put her foot on the back of the tricycle.

230
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
 She's carrying this heavy box.

231
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
 I'd been doing this all day long.

232
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
 She finally had enough.

233
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,920
 She put her foot on the back of the tricycle and she goes, Jason, move.

234
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,320
 And she pushed it with her foot to propel me forward, but instead it flipped the tricycle

235
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,760
 backwards and I landed on my head in the hallway and I'm like, now I'm screaming at the top

236
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,240
 of my lungs, the indignation of it.

237
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,880
 Oh, here I was.

238
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,840
 Just making people physically discomfort.

239
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,560
 That's all I was doing.

240
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,160
 All I was doing was holding up the process of moving into a new home and how dare, and

241
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
 also, you know, I hit my head.

242
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
 I did hit my head.

243
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,040
 I was a little kind of hit my head, but oh man, I made such a ruckus and then all of

244
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,560
 a sudden everyone had to stop moving stuff and pick me up and little baby Jason had to

245
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,040
 be taken care of.

246
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
 So I got my way.

247
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,560
 I was still, I was still irritating people, but now I was crying and probably got like a

248
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,680
 bowl of spaghetti with the little hot dogs in them as a reward or to shut me up or both.

249
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,720
 But the reason why I tell that story is because I myself am a veteran of tricycle accidents.

250
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,520
 My mom kicked me off of one, but I, it would be hard to break your arm.

251
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,640
 I think it would be pretty hard to find.

252
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,140
 I'm not doubting this dude.

253
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,720
 This is the weirdest part of the story.

254
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
 I'm not like, whoa, isn't that crazy?

255
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,480
 Have you been around with tricycle?

256
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,920
 Our next story, I'm not doubting his story.

257
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,640
 I'm just trying to figure out physically.

258
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,720
 Maybe it was like those old tiny tricycles that were taller.

259
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,400
 They used to see it like the dude with the mustache writing.

260
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
 Maybe it was one of those.

261
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,280
 Maybe the kid was like 10 or 12 writing a giant tricycle.

262
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
 I don't know.

263
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,560
 But anyways, I probably could have Googled how big a tricycle was in 1914 and saved us

264
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:54,400
 all 10 minutes, but instead he falls off a tricycle and breaks his arm and he goes,

265
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,000
 listen, I'm such a little kid.

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,920
 I couldn't tell you for a fact that I broke my arm.

267
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,840
 But looking back on it as an adult, I swear that's what happened.

268
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,440
 I actually broke my arm when I fell off his bicycle.

269
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,120
 And he falls on the ground and he's crying because he's in a lot of pain.

270
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,520
 And Jake realizes, oh, wait a second, nobody knows.

271
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,280
 Nobody knows that I'm out here on the outskirts of town, not even like in the middle of the

272
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,840
 city where a concerned adult could look out of the window and be like, ah, be gotten.

273
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,640
 There's a little kid out there.

274
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
 No.

275
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,760
 He was on the outskirts of town and he's just like a path that he was on and he's crying

276
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,360
 and he's crying and no one's coming and he's crying and crying and no one's coming and eventually

277
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,040
 he's like, uh-oh.

278
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,920
 Like I don't know how I'm going to get home.

279
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,120
 I'm in a lot of pain.

280
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,400
 Pretty sure my arm's broken.

281
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,960
 I don't know because my tricycle is ready to go.

282
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,360
 I don't know how much damage the tricycle got.

283
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,840
 Even if it didn't have a bent wheel or a busted steering bar, you wouldn't want to get on

284
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
 it with a broken arm.

285
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,600
 You just, this thing just betrayed you.

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 You'd be afraid.

287
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
 So anyways, he's like, oh no and he's crying.

288
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,520
 He's like, I'm kind of in a pickle here.

289
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,080
 I don't know how this is going to resolve itself.

290
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:24,200
 And right when he was thinking that, out of the bushes jumped a little man.

291
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,080
 This man, Jake said, was about two and a half feet tall and he just appeared out of nowhere.

292
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,960
 Like Jake had been crying for a couple of minutes and all of a sudden this little dude

293
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,440
 shows up and he's like, hey, can I help you with something?

294
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,680
 And Jake's like, oh dude, my arm, I fell off my tricycle.

295
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,440
 Don't, I can't explain how that happened.

296
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
 But my arm hurts.

297
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
 I hurt my arm.

298
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,120
 And he said this little man walked up to him and began to tend his injury, tend to his

299
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
 injury.

300
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,680
 He doesn't go into a lot of detail, but he says he begins to tend to my injury and almost

301
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,120
 immediately all pain went away.

302
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,320
 Like, I don't know what he did, but almost immediately the pain went away and I felt

303
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,640
 that what had ever been done.

304
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,160
 That's why he says as an adult, I don't know for sure that I broke my arm.

305
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,800
 I look back on it and swear that must have been what happened, but it was healed in like

306
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
 a minute.

307
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,600
 I'm sitting out here, this two and a half foot tall guy comes out of the bushes and

308
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,360
 heals me instantly or almost instantly.

309
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,120
 Jake goes, who, who are you good sir?

310
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,280
 And this little man goes, I'm a gnome.

311
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,880
 And Jake looks at this gnome.

312
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,880
 You say you're a gnome, but you actually look a lot like a leprechaun.

313
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,040
 And the gnome goes, well, I will assure you that I am a gnome.

314
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,520
 I am not a leprechaun.

315
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,760
 And around this time, off in the distance you hear Jake's parents go, Jake, Jakey boy,

316
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,560
 where are you?

317
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,880
 Oh, we miss you so much.

318
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,120
 Oh, that boy's probably out.

319
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,760
 Boy's probably out breaking arms like he always does on Wednesdays.

320
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,880
 I have to tell that kid he needs to stop breaking stuff.

321
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,440
 He hears his parents off in the distance coming towards him.

322
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:23,560
 And at that point, the little man jumped back into the bush.

323
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,160
 When the parents came up, they see Jake just sitting there on the ground next to his tricycle.

324
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,800
 And the parents are like, oh my God, what happened to you?

325
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
 And he goes, you will not believe what happened.

326
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,480
 But I'm going to tell you everything.

327
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
 I fell off a tricycle.

328
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
 The dad's like, OK, wait, stop, stop.

329
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
 That was that first Friday.

330
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
 He goes, I listened.

331
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
 I fell off a tricycle.

332
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,120
 It did hurt my arm really, really badly.

333
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,760
 And the little man showed up, fixed it.

334
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,600
 And he wasn't a leprechaun.

335
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
 He was a gnome.

336
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
 Did you know that?

337
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
 He wasn't a leprechaun.

338
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
 And the dad's like, what are you talking about?

339
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,920
 He was possibly tired.

340
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
 That's it.

341
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,600
 No more outskirts of the city for you, young man.

342
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,600
 He said his parents didn't believe him that any of this happened.

343
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:10,600
 Now, that story, while simple, raises a super interesting question.

344
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,240
 We'll get to that in one second.

345
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,320
 First off, I want to give a shout out.

346
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,520
 This was-- I found this on ThinkAboutItDucks.com.

347
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:24,840
 They got it from a book called Hidden Neighbors by a guy named W.M. Michael Mott.

348
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,200
 W.M. is a big W and a little M. I don't know if that's a signifier for anything, like

349
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,680
 sir or madam.

350
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
 I don't know, but it's weird.

351
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,880
 Not the weirdest part of the story.

352
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,640
 I was like, man, look at this guy's signature.

353
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
 Is that paranormal?

354
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,120
 W.M. Michael Mott, he writes a lot of books about faithful and fairy lore, which long

355
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,280
 time listeners of the show know I'm not a huge fan of either of those things.

356
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,320
 But gnomes and leprechauns, what a perfect time to talk about it, is we're leading up

357
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,600
 to leprechaun day, also known as St. Patrick's Day.

358
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,480
 This story when I read it, I thought this is super interesting because let's dissect it

359
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
 here.

360
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
 This guy was magical.

361
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
 This little gnome was magical.

362
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,560
 He was able to heal the wound of this boy.

363
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,080
 And when the boy said, "You look like a leprechaun," they didn't say-- like, again, not a lot of

364
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
 details.

365
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,560
 It took place in 1914.

366
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,720
 The guy probably didn't tell the story to the author or to anyone until he was like

367
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
 in his 70s, right?

368
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,160
 Because otherwise people would be like, "Hey, look at this leprechaun guy."

369
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,520
 He'd be mocked around town.

370
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,600
 Is it the man who was saved by a leprechaun?

371
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,400
 He's like, "It's actually a gnome."

372
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,000
 They're not saying, like, was he dressed like a leprechaun?

373
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,520
 Did he have on the black shoes and the striped underwear, the stockings, whatever that is,

374
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,480
 and the black shorts and the little green vest?

375
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
 We don't know.

376
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
 A little hat.

377
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,800
 Little hat, little black hat as well.

378
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 We don't know.

379
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,240
 Or was he just thinking he looked like a leprechaun because he was a tiny guy?

380
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,880
 I imagine that-- well, because leprechaun-- I would imagine that they would probably

381
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,360
 have to be some green involved.

382
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
 I don't know.

383
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
 Maybe not.

384
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,360
 Maybe a little kid would just see a tiny guy and go, "Hey, look, it's leprechaun."

385
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
 But here's my thing.

386
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,240
 So he asked the gnome, "What are you?"

387
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,480
 The gnome says, "I'm a gnome," and the boy says, "You look like a leprechaun."

388
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,720
 And the gnome corrected him patiently.

389
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,680
 That's the term that's used in the story.

390
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
 Corrected him patiently.

391
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
 He's like, "No, not-- gnome.

392
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,400
 I'm a gnome."

393
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:33,120
 The reason why that's interesting is it makes me think, "Do these beings know each other?"

394
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,800
 Not just leprechauns and gnomes.

395
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,360
 We can extrapolate this so far.

396
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,040
 And yes, we will get to the ghost cake in this episode.

397
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,440
 But I'm wondering-- let's take Western Europe, for example.

398
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,800
 We have fairies.

399
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,120
 We have gnomes.

400
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,480
 We have leprechauns.

401
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,600
 Do they know of each other?

402
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,200
 Probably the term "faithfulk" is in this big, encompassing term.

403
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,960
 But a gnome would have knowledge of a leprechaun.

404
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
 The gnome would be like, "What are you talking about?

405
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
 What's a leprechaun?

406
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,760
 Tell me about your human words.

407
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,920
 Who is this very handsome being you speak of?"

408
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,120
 I'm sure he's quite dashing.

409
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,360
 If you say it, look like him.

410
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,840
 Fairies and gnomes and leprechauns.

411
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,920
 You go, "Jason, yeah, of course they know each other, but I think some of that's from

412
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,200
 our media, right?

413
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,680
 We watch cartoons and there's like the leprechaun sitting on the toadstool and David the gnome

414
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
 walks up and he goes, "Get off.

415
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
 That's my house.

416
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,680
 That's my house.

417
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
 Get off of that."

418
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,600
 Leprechauns like, "Nope, squatters rights.

419
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,960
 That was a two-parter on Nickelodeon."

420
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
 But would they?

421
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,720
 And then you extrapolated out from there because they weren't the only paranormal beings in

422
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
 Western Europe.

423
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,320
 And I'm just picking that as an example.

424
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,360
 Would a gnome talk to a ghost?

425
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,680
 Would they be on good terms?

426
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,240
 How far does the world of the paranormal go?

427
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,800
 Is it possible that a leprechaun, if you caught a leprechaun, if you're lucky enough to catch

428
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:03,080
 a leprechaun this March 17th, could you take him back to your house and time up to a little

429
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,120
 chair and then ask him, "Where's Bigfoot?"

430
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
 He's like, "What?

431
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
 Don't you want my gold?

432
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
 I'll give you all the gold, bro."

433
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
 I don't know what you're talking about.

434
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
 Who's Bigfoot?

435
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
 Bigthings scare me.

436
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
 I'm a leprechaun.

437
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
 Where's Bigfoot?

438
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,760
 I don't know Bigfoot.

439
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,880
 Have you ever heard of the Chupacabra?

440
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,120
 He's like, "What?

441
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,960
 Would he be like..."

442
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,400
 This is where it gets trippy because with the leprechaun, the leprechaun's going to tell

443
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,920
 you whatever he thinks you want to know because he just wants to get home to his family.

444
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,520
 He wants to get untied.

445
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,320
 But while he's still trying to gnaw at the rope so when you're not in the room, he could

446
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:50,200
 say, "Listen, I know of Bigfoot because I obviously live on the planet Earth.

447
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,920
 I'm an interdimensional being, but I have knowledge of things."

448
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,520
 This gnome didn't come out and go, "Oh my goodness.

449
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,320
 What is this three-wheeled metal construct right on this road?"

450
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,080
 He's like, "Oh, that's a tricycle."

451
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,240
 He wouldn't know what that was.

452
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,240
 He wouldn't, every time a gnome popped out, he wouldn't be like, "What year is it?

453
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
 What year is it?"

454
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
 And they're like, "2023?"

455
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,720
 He's like, "Tell me everything that's happened since between now and 1914."

456
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,440
 You're like, "I barely remember most of the details of my life, let alone world history.

457
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,000
 I might want to skip the 30s and 40s though.

458
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,880
 I think we'll gloss over that part."

459
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
 Gnomes like, "What?"

460
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,280
 Yeah, it gets kind of bad.

461
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,840
 We'll probably skip over the Vietnam conflict."

462
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,720
 He's like, "Ah."

463
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,400
 So they would have modern knowledge.

464
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,120
 Not only we've ever come across this story where, obviously we assume aliens know everything,

465
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,400
 aliens because they're above us, not just physically, but just technologically wise,

466
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,680
 just technology wise.

467
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,960
 We don't ever have to keep them abreast of the news.

468
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,200
 But yeah, like a fairy or gnome or leprechaun, would they know about the, oh, first thought,

469
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,000
 would they know about the Gulf Wars?

470
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,160
 Would they be like, "Oh, Saddam Hussein, man, we had to remove them from power.

471
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,000
 They're total war hawks that are like, "Oh, you don't know, we're behind all the wars.

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 We're the true Illuminati."

473
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 You're like, "Ah."

474
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,520
 But they would probably know current events.

475
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,600
 But would they know?

476
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,960
 And they may know of Bigfoot.

477
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,440
 You might be able, and that's the thing, you could have asked the gnome, "Are you a leprechaun?"

478
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,840
 And it's funny because the gnome could have been like, "No, leprechauns aren't real,

479
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
 dude.

480
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
 Leprechauns aren't real.

481
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
 I'm a gnome."

482
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,120
 And I know in your books, you talk about leprechauns and cylinder gold and stuff like that.

483
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,560
 He actually might have been a leprechaun now that I think about it.

484
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
 He didn't want to get jacked or all of its gold.

485
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
 He's like, "Ah, I'm just a gnome, bro.

486
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,960
 Let me go."

487
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,960
 You wonder, like, he might go, "I know of leprechauns.

488
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,760
 I know of the stories of Earth."

489
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
 Right?

490
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
 I know of leprechauns.

491
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
 I know of Bigfoot.

492
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,360
 I go, "Squatch in from time to time myself."

493
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,440
 But he doesn't exist.

494
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,440
 Or as far as I know, like, I've never seen Bigfoot.

495
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,200
 There's no proof that I know of Bigfoot.

496
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
 I am a gnome.

497
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,600
 I am a mystical creature.

498
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,760
 You can move beyond the veil of what you call reality, but I don't know if Bigfoot exists.

499
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
 Chubacabra?

500
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
 What?

501
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,000
 I don't know if any of this stuff is real, but I've heard these terms before and I know

502
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,640
 what you guys are into.

503
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,200
 Or would they know Bigfoot?

504
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,720
 Does a gnome know why he looks like a leprechaun and he's tired of being compared to leprechauns?

505
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,400
 He corrected him patiently because the boy doesn't know any better, but he's like, "I'm

506
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
 not a leprechaun."

507
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,000
 Every time I jump out of a bush, the rubber boy's arm.

508
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Someone thinks I'm a leprechaun.

509
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,320
 I'm not a leprechaun.

510
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,760
 But he personally knows leprechauns.

511
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,000
 He knows they're really, really skeevy dudes.

512
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,280
 He's like, "Oh, come on."

513
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,480
 They're comparing me to them.

514
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,200
 And then would they know Bigfoot?

515
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,400
 Would they know ghosts?

516
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,640
 Like, do ghosts know Bigfoot?

517
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
 We know that there's a connection.

518
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,160
 Now, I'll put the episodes in the show notes.

519
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
 It's really weird.

520
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,280
 There's a connection between Bigfoot and UFOs.

521
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,920
 Really weird connection between Bigfoot and UFOs.

522
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,240
 A lot of encounters with that.

523
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,480
 But like, is a Bigfoot aware of ghosts?

524
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
 Do ghosts know of Bigfoot?

525
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
 Do ghosts know leprechauns?

526
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,840
 This is interesting.

527
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
 Where is this?

528
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
 Because I think I'm in the...

529
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,680
 And I will wrap it up here.

530
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,520
 Not the episode, although we're already at like 30-some-on minutes, but we got a lot to

531
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
 talk about.

532
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,400
 And Ghostcake Story, finally.

533
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:38,160
 You wonder when we're paranormal researchers, we have like UFO researchers, cryptid researchers,

534
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,760
 ghost researchers, faithful researchers, things like that.

535
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,880
 And there is starting to become more of a crossover between them all, which is good for the research

536
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
 community.

537
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,720
 But is there also a crossover in that world as well?

538
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,880
 Like, do ghosts know leprechauns?

539
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,280
 Do demons know of Bigfoot?

540
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
 Super interesting question.

541
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,160
 It comes from a very simple story, but it does make you wonder, like, how much of this

542
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,200
 stuff is interconnected.

543
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,280
 Ghost is kind of a hard one, because a lot of ghosts are just like a psychic imprint.

544
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,120
 They don't know anything.

545
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
 It's just a...

546
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,000
 And something repeating over and over again, we're catching a glimpse of the young widow

547
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,600
 standing at her window waiting for her lover to come home from the Civil War.

548
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,680
 Like, that's not one.

549
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,600
 You can't show up and be like, "Would you like some cookies?"

550
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
 And she turns around.

551
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
 She's like, "Oh, I love cookies."

552
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,000
 And you guys are friends.

553
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,360
 No more than you can walk up to a Madonna cassette from 1988 and start listening to

554
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,760
 Cherish and go, "I love you too, Madonna."

555
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:44,440
 And Madonna shows up at your door, because it's just the recording of Madonna's voice.

556
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,600
 But there are ghosts that you can communicate with.

557
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,960
 And would those ghosts that do have intelligence...

558
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,360
 I think that's going to be the theme.

559
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,520
 If I get invited back to the Oregon Ghost Conference, I think that might be my theme.

560
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
 New ghosts, no Bigfoot.

561
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,560
 I mean, sometimes you just need to have a Kenji title.

562
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,720
 It's an interesting question.

563
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,760
 This gnome knew what a leprechaun was.

564
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,000
 He didn't go, "What's a leprechaun?"

565
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,360
 The question is, does he personally know leprechauns?

566
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,600
 Or does he know of the story of leprechauns that humans have made up?

567
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,640
 It's a very, very interesting question.

568
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,720
 And just another reminder that the world of the paranormal is weird.

569
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,480
 Jason, that's the last thing.

570
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,440
 That anyone needs a reminder of.

571
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,160
 It's called paranormal for a reason.

572
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
 Mephaeus.

573
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,080
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world, a famous carpenter copter for our last

574
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,880
 flight during season 20.

575
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,440
 We're leaving behind Scotland.

576
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,360
 We're waving goodbye to this gnome.

577
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,160
 We freed the leprechaun from our basement.

578
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:56,120
 And we're headed out to a house in the suburbs.

579
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,000
 The year is 2018.

580
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,320
 And we're at this dude's house.

581
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
 He didn't give his name.

582
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,680
 We're going to go ahead and call him Sean.

583
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,800
 And his niece will call her Rose.

584
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,320
 Just turned six years old.

585
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,360
 And Sean's brother goes, "Hey dude, listen, our apartment is super small."

586
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,640
 And Rose wants to have a big birthday party.

587
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,120
 She's apparently really popular at school.

588
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,000
 So can we have her birthday party at your place?

589
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,680
 And Sean goes, "Yeah, sure dude, that sounds great."

590
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,320
 That's exactly what I wanted to do this week and clean up after a bunch of little kids.

591
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,400
 So 15 to 20 kids show up at this place.

592
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,000
 I'm sure he expected like three, right?

593
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,160
 You'd have to be pretty popular to pull 15 to 20 kids to your sixth, not sixth grade

594
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,040
 birthday party, six year old birthday party.

595
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,680
 You're like, "Of course, Jason."

596
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,560
 No one has a sixth grade birthday party.

597
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,840
 You're like, "I want everyone.

598
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
 I've graduated.

599
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,680
 I guess that's just called a graduation party anyways."

600
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
 Mom was done.

601
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
 Mom was done with the season.

602
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,160
 Keep it together.

603
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,120
 Six year old birthday party.

604
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,200
 She's turning six.

605
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,800
 And 15 to 20 kids shows up to Sean's house plus parents.

606
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,400
 It must have just been a madhouse.

607
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,520
 It must have just been absolutely insane.

608
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,960
 Maybe Sean had a good time.

609
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,920
 All the friends are there, all the presents, all the presents stacked up in the corner

610
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,880
 and cake.

611
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,360
 Of course, delicious cake for a six year old girl that's sitting in the kitchen every

612
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,960
 so often Sean's looking in going, "He's like the big bad wolf in a red riding novel, but

613
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
 he just wants to eat cake.

614
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,080
 I can't wait to give me some of that delicious cake."

615
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,800
 Oh, guys, your bulging out of his head.

616
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,320
 The big birthday party is going on.

617
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
 Huge birthday party.

618
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,320
 I imagine it was bigger than he thought.

619
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,520
 And it goes on for a couple hours.

620
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
 That's crazy.

621
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,960
 That's a long party for kids, right?

622
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
 You get bored.

623
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,600
 You're all taking a nap in the middle of the party.

624
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,440
 Taking 30 minute nap.

625
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
 Wake back up.

626
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
 Be energized again.

627
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,960
 Clown shows up.

628
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,200
 Eventually though, party comes to an end.

629
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,080
 People are cleaning everything up.

630
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,560
 Rose had a great time.

631
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,080
 That's what matters, right?

632
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,580
 You only turned six once.

633
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
 She had a great time.

634
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,880
 Sean feels really good that he was able to help out his brother, help out his family.

635
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,560
 Everyone's cleaning up and it's time for everyone to go.

636
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,080
 So bye, bye, everyone.

637
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,920
 See you guys later.

638
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,240
 Then Rose and her parents leave.

639
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
 They walk out.

640
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,760
 Sean is left alone with the cake.

641
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,800
 Now when I was looking over this post, apparently Sean, I don't know where this story takes place.

642
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,040
 Sean, because someone goes, "Why did they leave the cake behind?"

643
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,080
 People were really intrigued about this cake and Sean goes, "Well, in my culture it's normal."

644
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,520
 This should be normal for every culture.

645
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,160
 This actually sounds pretty dope.

646
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,800
 He goes, "In my culture it's normal that when you bring food over, let's say that you're

647
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,960
 going to host a party at your house and you're having all these people come over and they

648
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,680
 bring over food.

649
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,200
 When they leave, they leave the food with you as basically a thanks for letting me use your

650
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
 place."

651
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,280
 That's super reasonable, right?

652
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,200
 I mean, assuming you like the food.

653
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,560
 It's like a bunch of veggie platters you can take with you.

654
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,160
 I don't want that stuff.

655
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,600
 But who doesn't like cake?

656
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,960
 Who doesn't like cake?

657
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,760
 And so there's some cake left.

658
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,480
 I don't know how big this cake was too.

659
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,760
 15 to 20 kids plus parents.

660
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,320
 Apparently, there's some cake left and not a small amount.

661
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
 And the whole time Sean and Vinay balling that cake.

662
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,640
 He's all kicking kids off.

663
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
 They're all riding tricycles.

664
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
 He's kicking them out the door.

665
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
 See you guys later.

666
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
 See you guys later.

667
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
 Cake's all mine.

668
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,920
 He has that cake in the kitchen and he's thinking about it.

669
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,720
 Everyone leaves and about five minutes pass.

670
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,640
 All of a sudden, ding dong.

671
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
 Turned door bell rings.

672
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
 Sean's like, "Huh?

673
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
 What?"

674
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,240
 Someone must have forgot a present.

675
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
 Someone must have forgot a purse.

676
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
 I don't know.

677
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,160
 So he opens the door and standing there on his front porch is Rose.

678
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,160
 His six-year-old niece.

679
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,040
 And he kind of looks side to side and doesn't see her parents anywhere.

680
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,400
 And he goes, "Rose, what are you doing here?

681
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,960
 Where are your parents at?"

682
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,200
 And Rose goes, "Uh, they forgot me.

683
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,440
 They forgot about me."

684
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,600
 You just drove away.

685
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,160
 They're like, "You're six now.

686
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,920
 You can fin for yourself.

687
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
 Test the one.

688
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,920
 Find your way home."

689
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,160
 She goes, "My parents forgot about me.

690
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,960
 They actually drove off and left me here."

691
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:36,760
 And Sean goes, "Well, let me call your parents and I'll have them come pick you up."

692
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,520
 And Rose said, "I'm actually really hungry.

693
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,360
 Can I come inside and eat some cake?

694
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,680
 Can I come inside and get some of that delicious cake that's left behind?"

695
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,200
 And Sean's like, "Yeah, sure.

696
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,040
 You can come in and get some cake."

697
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,320
 Little tear dropy turns away to hide his tear dropy.

698
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,920
 He's like, "Oh, less cake for me."

699
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,200
 He goes, "Rose, yeah, sure.

700
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
 Come on in.

701
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
 Have some cake.

702
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
 I'm going to call your brother."

703
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,640
 I'm a little disappointed that he forgot about you.

704
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,720
 Forgot you existed and on all of all days your birthday.

705
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,480
 This is definitely going to be some therapy in the future.

706
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,440
 Come on in, get some cake.

707
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,120
 And he cut her a slice of cake and put it on a plate, set it down, and then he went

708
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:20,400
 to call her brother and goes, "Hey, dude, why in the world is Rose still at my house?

709
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,880
 It's not that I don't like her.

710
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,440
 I have spent the last couple hours with her screaming at the top of her lungs.

711
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,920
 But she should be with you.

712
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,360
 You drove off and you left your daughter here.

713
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,640
 You're going to come pick her up or what?"

714
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
 She's eating my cake.

715
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
 Hurry up.

716
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,440
 Get back before she eats it all.

717
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,120
 And his brother goes, "What are you talking about, dude?

718
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,360
 Rose is with me right now.

719
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,840
 She's sitting right next to me."

720
00:34:52,840 --> 00:35:00,720
 And at that point, Sean said, like his heart physically skipped a beat.

721
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,520
 Like there was no like, "Dude, quit messing with me, bro.

722
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
 Quit messing with me.

723
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
 Always pull these pranks."

724
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,200
 He always pulled these pranks, dude.

725
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,720
 It was, he immediately realized something was wrong.

726
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
 There was no debate.

727
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,400
 He realized his brother was right.

728
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:23,600
 That Rose was not in the kitchen eating cake.

729
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,400
 She was with her parents.

730
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,080
 So Sean walked into the kitchen and when he gets into the kitchen, no one's there.

731
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,600
 The kitchen is completely empty.

732
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,400
 Sean is the only person in the entire house.

733
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,000
 All that's in there now is him.

734
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,520
 The kitchen is completely empty, but sitting on the kitchen table is a plate with a slice

735
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:55,520
 of cake sitting on it and it's been half eaten.

736
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,960
 Now he said, I looked a little bit further in my notes, he does say what culture he's

737
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
 from.

738
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
 It's Hmong.

739
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
 It's Hmong culture.

740
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,960
 I don't know where the story takes place, if it takes place in America or in other region

741
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,520
 of the world, but he's Hmong.

742
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,120
 So he said it's typical in his culture that they do leave the food behind, which again

743
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,320
 is a great tradition.

744
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,600
 We should all share that.

745
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,640
 He goes, I never told the story outside of my immediate family.

746
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,480
 Never told anyone about it.

747
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,800
 He's posting about it now like five years later.

748
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,880
 He goes, I never told the story outside of my family and neither myself nor anyone else

749
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,360
 in my immediate family has ever had any paranormal activity, ever.

750
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,880
 This was the very first time we have anything that was even close to this.

751
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,680
 He goes, but in the Hmong community we do believe in shamans or your parts of the Hmong

752
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
 community.

753
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,800
 We talked about that in an earlier episode.

754
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,800
 We did an episode about Hmong shamans, but he goes, we did contact to Shaman and he came

755
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:04,320
 out and he cleansed the house after this encounter.

756
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,240
 I'll put the episode about the Hmong shamans in the show notes.

757
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,200
 It's a really interesting one.

758
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,720
 It's actually one of my favorite episodes.

759
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,280
 It's one of the episodes we've done a classics on and I'm going to start doing the classics

760
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,400
 again, not this season break for the next one, but it was the story about the movie

761
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,920
 A Nightmare on Elm Street is based on a true story.

762
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,640
 As clickbaity and as insane as that title sounds, the film A Nightmare on Elm Street

763
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,840
 is for a fact based on a true story.

764
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:42,400
 Wes Craven was reading a series of articles in the LA Times about Hmong refugees leaving

765
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:52,200
 Laos and Cambodia during the Purge, during the huge genocide going on over there in the

766
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,520
 wake and during the Vietnam War.

767
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,720
 They were spread across the country and their shamans would randomly be placed in different

768
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,240
 cities because the US government is like, "Yeah, you can come over here, but we're going

769
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
 to put you here.

770
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
 We're going to put you here."

771
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:15,720
 It really disrupted the spiritual needs of that community and a dream demon showed up.

772
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,880
 It sounds so insane, it sounds so insane, but it actually is based on a true story.

773
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,600
 I'll put that episode in the show notes because it has nothing to do with this story.

774
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,760
 I just love that episode.

775
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,600
 It's creepy and the shot, it's so creepy.

776
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
 I'll put that in the show notes.

777
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,960
 But anyways, let's get to this story, which also it's not necessarily creepy.

778
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,400
 I think it's a good way to end season 20 for two reasons.

779
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,800
 One, it's one of those stories that I talk about where I love the mundane paranormal

780
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,200
 stories because something like this could happen to anyone.

781
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,960
 You go, "Chase, I don't have a six-year-old niece."

782
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,640
 Well, okay, maybe the same details won't happen.

783
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,720
 But the visitation, it doesn't have to be like a super evil demonic spirit throwing books

784
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
 at you.

785
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,040
 It could be something that simple.

786
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,840
 What I find interesting is a little girl asks for permission to come in, which is what

787
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:10,920
 we see in the stories of vampires and to another extent demons having to be invited into your

788
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
 body.

789
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,840
 But the little girl asks to come in and you wonder, was that a rule she had to follow or

790
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,120
 was she simply being polite?

791
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,240
 Did she really just want to slice a cake?

792
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,560
 Did she have more nefarious motives in mind?

793
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,800
 I don't know.

794
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,840
 I honestly think she just wanted to eat some cake.

795
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,560
 We've covered stories about kids eating candy.

796
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,560
 There is a bridge.

797
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,360
 I don't remember exactly what state it took place in.

798
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,080
 Tennessee or Mississippi or something like that, where if you leave a candy bar on a

799
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,560
 bridge, ghost children will crawl out from underneath it and take a bite.

800
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,600
 Then you have half of a whatchamacallit bar sitting out there.

801
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,560
 Now of course, where I skipped a goal is maybe it was a raccoon.

802
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
 Maybe it was me.

803
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
 Maybe I got hungry.

804
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,280
 I'll make ghost hunt.

805
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,080
 But I'll put that episode in the show notes.

806
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,920
 We do have stories of ghost eating things.

807
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,160
 That might be a raccoon.

808
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
 That's Robbie.

809
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
 I'm like, look at this.

810
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
 It's evidence.

811
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
 It's really Jason.

812
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,000
 But maybe this ghost just wanted a bite of some cake.

813
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,680
 Maybe it was a little hungry for it.

814
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,840
 It's also possible that this ghost assumed the shape of Rose or the spirit, whatever it

815
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
 was.

816
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,440
 I keep saying ghost because that's kind of how I feel.

817
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,920
 But it could be obviously a spirit.

818
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,320
 It could be a darker entity like a demon or something like that.

819
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:35,880
 It might have assumed the form of Rose, but it's also possible it was at the party as

820
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,600
 well as a different child.

821
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:48,680
 Like it was invited in by the joy of 15, 20 children just having a blast and it invoked

822
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,960
 this spirit.

823
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,480
 And it was also there having fun.

824
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,280
 In the corner you're all playing in the town of Donkey.

825
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,920
 There's this dripping wet girl facing the corner just standing there.

826
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,040
 I'll twitch and they're like, aren't you going to give her a try?

827
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,040
 And they're like, what?

828
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
 They turn.

829
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
 There's no one there.

830
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
 It's just a puddle of water.

831
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,360
 You're like, someone put something in this cake.

832
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,680
 It's a spooky Samara ghost.

833
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
 It could have been a ghost.

834
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,760
 It could have been a spirit that was brought there by the party.

835
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,640
 And then when all the kids left, it left as well.

836
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,640
 But then it goes, you know what?

837
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,480
 I'm going to shape shift into this little girl.

838
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
 Okay.

839
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
 Maybe I'm going to give it.

840
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,840
 And maybe it left when all the kids left, but then thought, you know what?

841
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
 I want a little more cake.

842
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,840
 So she changed her appearance back to someone who could gain access to the house.

843
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
 Do I have any proof for that theory?

844
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,200
 Do I have any proof for that theory?

845
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
 No.

846
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
 I just think it's fun.

847
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,360
 I just like the idea that there was a ghost attending the whole party and they just wanted

848
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,640
 a little more cake.

849
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,320
 But you know, it could have not been that.

850
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,920
 It could have just been just a regular spirit, not a spirit that's breaking into parties.

851
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,400
 It's a party crashing ghost.

852
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,440
 But it's a fascinating story because it's so mundane.

853
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,840
 I mean, it would terrify you, right?

854
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,320
 Like that probably is the right course of action to bless the house because at the end

855
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,760
 of the day, he invited it in.

856
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,760
 That's the tricky part.

857
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,560
 I mean, there are some people that any ghostly activity, they're going to call their spiritual

858
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,120
 advisor to have it taken care of.

859
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,120
 And that's fine.

860
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,800
 That's, you know, the decision that they're making.

861
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,200
 I don't think all ghosts need to be kicked out of the house, but some I'm sure do, right?

862
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,880
 Ghosts that are definitely interfering with your ability to concentrate or keep your health

863
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
 going.

864
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
 We did that episode.

865
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
 This almost feels like a best of wrap up.

866
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,120
 We did that episode by that woman who was losing her mind and she couldn't get her act

867
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
 together.

868
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,800
 She couldn't even get her act together enough to sell her house.

869
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,400
 She was trapped in that house.

870
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,680
 And it was a very interesting look at like that mental and physical decline of a traumatic

871
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,440
 haunting.

872
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,480
 He did invite it into his house.

873
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:57,040
 So you would be a ghost just seem to show up.

874
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,360
 They don't necessarily need an invitation.

875
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:05,360
 The invitation waiting to be invited in does give it a sense of menacing.

876
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,480
 But again, it could have just have been polite.

877
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,680
 It's possible that Rose herself wouldn't just walk into somebody's house.

878
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,160
 So she was just mimicking what a little girl, especially a little girl in that community

879
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,880
 may do in the Hmong community.

880
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
 So who knows?

881
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
 It could have been a dark spirit.

882
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,200
 It could have just been a run of the mill ghost, which is kind of funny term because

883
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,680
 they're so wacky and so bizarre to begin with.

884
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,960
 But a run of the mill ghost or spirit just wanted a little bit of cake.

885
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,200
 But it would be a story.

886
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,440
 It's one of those stories that you would have a hard time telling.

887
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,800
 You tell your immediate family because you might be concerned for the real Rose.

888
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,160
 But outside of this, it's not something you're really going to talk about at work because

889
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,480
 people may make fun of you for it.

890
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,640
 I don't think it's cool to make fun of people, even though I do spend every 10th episode

891
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,080
 highlighting the absurdity.

892
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,520
 I know yesterday we spent 55 minutes talking about a woman who believes reptilians were

893
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,640
 invading Santa Fe.

894
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,600
 So I do make fun of people, OK?

895
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:07,120
 But what I'm saying is that I also want people, even though I make fun of some people, I want

896
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,760
 other people to share their experiences.

897
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,800
 The second reason why I wanted to cover this for the ending of season 20.

898
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,400
 Well so, say funny, I say I wanted to use the story.

899
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,400
 It was an accident the story ended up as the last story of season 20.

900
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,400
 It really is.

901
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,120
 I was supposed to do it last week.

902
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
 It got bumped back.

903
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
 I was supposed to do it yesterday.

904
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:35,120
 It got bumped back because I was having so fun with that crazy lady in Santa Fe.

905
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,040
 The story is about a celebration.

906
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,600
 The story is all about this party with this delicious cake sitting there.

907
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:56,920
 Not to be schmaltzy, but this podcast, you guys, we're going on five years in June.

908
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,520
 I mean that's crazy.

909
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,720
 That's really cool.

910
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,120
 Like after I hit episode thousand, I go, "What's the next milestone?

911
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,120
 What's next?"

912
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,120
 Like we hit a thousand episodes.

913
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,640
 Like that's a huge achievement.

914
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,920
 And little did I realize that we were just a couple months shy of five years, a daily

915
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,480
 podcast.

916
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
 It's crazy.

917
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,360
 And guys, it's all because of you.

918
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,760
 It's 100% because of you guys.

919
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,440
 It's really awesome.

920
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,000
 This might be your first episode and you may feel like, "This doesn't really apply to me."

921
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,400
 This is your first episode.

922
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,520
 You probably shut it off 15, 10 minutes ago.

923
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,680
 You're like, "Why is he still talking about this conference?

924
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,480
 Get to the ghost, bro."

925
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,320
 But if your first episode, if this episode is not your last episode, but this is your

926
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,360
 one thousandth and fiftieth episode, maybe this is even the second or third time you've

927
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,960
 listened to the whole catalog through and I get a lot of emails from people saying,

928
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,680
 "I've listened to your podcast all the way through two or three times."

929
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
 It's fantastic.

930
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,280
 It's so awesome to be part of your lives.

931
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,440
 It really is.

932
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,440
 And I'm glad you're part of mine.

933
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,160
 I thought, "I didn't plan on this to be in the last story of season 20, but I think

934
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,560
 it's a fitting one because this is all about celebration.

935
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,720
 Even when we talk about the spooky stuff, even when we talk about the dark stuff, celebration.

936
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,440
 It's us sharing these stories with each other.

937
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,000
 And I'm just so...

938
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,160
 It's so dope.

939
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,560
 It's so dope to be doing this.

940
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,520
 And I feel like I'm in a real good mental place.

941
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:50,920
 Like I said before at the start of the episode, almost every season before this, when I stopped

942
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,960
 recording the last episode of that season, I would go, I would say to myself, "I don't

943
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,840
 know if I'm ever going to put out another episode.

944
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,480
 I'm going to see how I feel at the end of my break."

945
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:04,560
 That was how it was almost every season.

946
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,560
 But now that I don't feel that way anymore, now that I'm looking forward, as this break

947
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,520
 starts, I'm already thinking about what I'm going to be doing for season 21.

948
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,480
 That's a big game changer for the show.

949
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,280
 It's a time of celebration.

950
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,280
 It's a time...

951
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,400
 Apparently, there's a dog outside my window.

952
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,840
 Hopefully, it's not a paranormal dog, written by a leprechaun/nome.

953
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,320
 The dog's barking outside my window.

954
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,040
 That's probably a sign.

955
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,640
 It's time to wrap up season 20.

956
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,320
 But again, I want you guys to celebrate.

957
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
 Oh my goodness.

958
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,560
 How big is that dog?

959
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,560
 It's like getting closer.

960
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,760
 It's like I'm on the ladder.

961
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,720
 It's coming up to my window.

962
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,880
 That's like the biggest dog I've ever heard outside my window.

963
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,480
 This is the way season 20 is.

964
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,080
 With a big old dog outside my window.

965
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,520
 Oh my God.

966
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,880
 Every time I lean forward to the mic.

967
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,120
 I think this season 21 will be the start of the gangstauging season.

968
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,120
 I'll be like, they're after me.

969
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
 They're after me.

970
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,360
 They keep rubbing their bellies and driving yellow super-roos.

971
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,000
 And have German shepherds.

972
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,040
 Anyways, guys, I got to wrap it up because the dog is driving me nuts.

973
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,280
 I appreciate you guys.

974
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,960
 I hope you guys really do have an awesome break.

975
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,840
 I hope you guys have lots of fun.

976
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,960
 I hope to see some of you at the Oregon Ghost Conference.

977
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,580
 But even if you're not able to make it.

978
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,880
 Even if you're listening to this episode way in the future and the Oregon Ghost Conference

979
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,880
 is coming on.

980
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,320
 I hope you guys know that I will be thinking of you on my break.

981
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:35,520
 And I can't wait to get back to the microphone for the first time in 20 seasons to share

982
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:43,120
 more stories of paranormal conspiracy and true crime with my friends.

983
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,280
 I love you guys.

984
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,360
 Stay safe.

985
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,360
 Have fun.

986
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,840
 DeadRabberRadioGmail.com is going to be your email address.

987
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,540
 You can also put us up at facebook.com/DeadRabberRadio.

988
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,180
 Tiktok is at DeadRabberRadio.

989
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,020
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily dog stock, of course.

990
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,620
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

991
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,620
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

992
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,620
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

993
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,620
 Have a great break.

994
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,620
 I'll see you guys soon.

995
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:13,460
 I'll definitely see you all on April 3rd.

996
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,460
 It's going to sound crazy if the mic didn't break up that dog.

997
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:23,460
 If you can't hear on the mic that dog is working and I just found it.

998
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,460
 I love you guys.

999
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:36,460
 Have a good one.

1000
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:43,460
 Bye.

1001
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:50,460
 Bye.

1002
00:49:50,460 --> 00:50:00,460
 Bye.

1003
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,460
 Bye.

1004
