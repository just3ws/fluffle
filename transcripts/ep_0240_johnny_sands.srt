1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 An unusual disease caused by an annoying hobby.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,720
 And then we take a look at the alien abduction of Johnny Sands.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,200
 Who's Johnny Sands you ask?

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,720
 Why he's the most rootnest, tootnest alien abduction victim you'll ever meet today on

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,200
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:29,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,280
 I'm your host Chase Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,720
 I'm sweaty, I'm just a puddle of sweat.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,120
 And just think about it, a year ago today was the day before Dead Rabbit Radio started.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,320
 I still don't know if I'm gonna do anything special for tomorrow's episode.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,240
 Because I kinda did my look back episode for the New Year's Eve episode and I thought

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
 that I don't...

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,040
 I don't think I can do another one six months later.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,720
 The last six months have kind of been a blur.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,640
 The first six months was pretty rough.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
 The last six months they've been kind of rough too but it just kind of flew by.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,160
 And I've had a lot of good stories but I haven't had a lot of bad, like that first retrospective

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,160
 I was able to say like this was my least favorite episode.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,400
 Here's some of the drama that was happening behind the scenes.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,760
 We even had anything like that since.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,600
 Which is good.

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 I haven't had an episode that I've recorded in the past six months that I've been like

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,600
 this episode sucks.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,360
 I've had episodes I've recorded that I've re-recorded and it's just funny because that's part of

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,000
 the thing of becoming skill.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I don't think I'm...

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,640
 I'm sure I could do much better at this than I am doing but through practice I can be

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
 recording something and I'll go this isn't working.

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
 In the past I would've just released the episode because I wouldn't know if it was working.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,120
 I would've just been like oh that was great Jason.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,920
 You talked for a half hour.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,840
 Episode's done but now when I record stuff as I'm recording and I can go this isn't

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,160
 working for whatever reason then I gotta like re-record it.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,360
 But even that doesn't happen as often so.

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,560
 Within a year I think I've come a long way skill-wise.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,080
 There's still a lot of stuff I wanna work on but yeah.

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
 I mean that's it.

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,240
 I don't... there wasn't any craziness that's happened in the past six months.

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,320
 Other than the stuff that we cover on the show.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,040
 Let's go ahead and actually get started with our first story.

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,160
 Now for our first story we are going to England.

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,360
 The year is 2014 so not too long ago.

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,600
 There's an old man.

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 Actually not that old.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,880
 He's only 62 years old.

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,960
 That's old to you if you're young.

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,240
 When you're 42 that's not old anymore but there's a 62 year old man laying in a bed

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
 in Britain.

50
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:45,320
 And they're like old man whose name we can't disclose because of medical privacy laws.

51
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,000
 Just hang on a little bit longer.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,080
 I can't.

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,960
 There's a scientist doctor dude doing stuff in another laboratory.

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,320
 Doctors like going over these readings and stuff like that.

55
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,360
 And he's like I got it.

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,360
 I know what's making him sick so he's running through the hospital.

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 Get out of the way nurses.

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,200
 Move out of the way burn victims.

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,120
 I got a person to tell something to because it's too late to actually save this person.

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
 This person is eventually gonna die but the scientist doctor kicks in the door and goes

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,480
 I got it.

62
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,360
 I know what's killing you and he's like thanks a lot.

63
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
 Is there a cure?

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,280
 And they're like no no there's no cure but I thought you would want to know what killed

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
 you.

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,600
 He's like I'd rather have a cure.

67
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,920
 So this man who they haven't named we'll call him Seamus.

68
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,120
 We'll call him Seamus and the reason we'll become clear in a second.

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:51,280
 So Seamus in 2009 he was diagnosed with this thing called hypersensitivity pneumoniumitis.

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,800
 I know how to say pneumonia this had a couple extra little vowels at the end of it.

71
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,760
 Hypersensitivity pneumitis.

72
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,240
 And what happens is this horrible lung disease where you're basically like getting in mold

73
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,760
 and stuff into your lungs and it's causing your immune system to basically attack your

74
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,000
 own body so it just completely scars up the inner sides, the inner side.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,680
 It completely scars up the insides of your lungs.

76
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,200
 So this gross little like it's basically remembered that movie Osmosis Jones that but it's a

77
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,560
 horror movie.

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,280
 They're crawling in you and they're like making Osmosis Jones shoot your own lungs.

79
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,200
 He's like I'm doing such a good job as you're like slowly unable to breathe.

80
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,440
 So Seamus has this disease and they can't figure out what it is.

81
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,560
 The doctors are like okay well we know what causes this it's mold.

82
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
 So let's go to your house.

83
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,800
 So they go to his house and they're like checking for mold and they're like no there's no mold

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,560
 here do you keep pigeons.

85
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
 Are you a pigeon is that one of your hobbies is playing with pigeons and he's like no.

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
 I don't like pigeons who collects pigeons.

87
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,600
 I mean I know they don't collect pigeons they raise pigeons they're not running around the

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,840
 neighborhood like throwing nets on random pigeons but I know Mike Tyson plays around

89
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,600
 with pigeons and stuff like that just seems such a like a weird hobby.

90
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,880
 A pigeon person is the male equivalent basically Mike Tyson's a cat lady but with birds.

91
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,480
 So anyways he's not a pigeon person.

92
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 He they they go do you do you have any birds around you because bird poop can also cause

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,480
 this disease and he's like no I don't they're like do you smoke.

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,000
 This guy didn't smoke he didn't smoke.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,640
 His lungs are grossly inflamed the doctors don't even like doing tests on him anymore

96
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,480
 because they look so gross but this guy's not getting any better.

97
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,800
 He's like you know what I'm gonna go on a trip I'm gonna go on a trip and I'm gonna

98
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,280
 leave this hobby behind and the doctors are like what hobby he's like oh no I'll tell

99
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,560
 you about that hobby later this hobby I'll leave behind.

100
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,040
 I'm going to Australia for three months and the doctors are like okay hope you feel better

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,360
 and they're just kind of like that poor sabby's not gonna feel better.

102
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,840
 He goes to Australia feels great gets better actually starts to recover from this horrible

103
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,200
 horrible disease can breathe again comes back starts his hobby back up and immediately

104
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,200
 gets worse eventually gets the point that he can't walk more than 65 feet without having

105
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,280
 to sit down and take a break that's how much he couldn't breathe and the doctors the whole

106
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,400
 time could not figure out what it was but the doctors the whole time although they did

107
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,520
 check his house for mold and they did check his bird his bird cages make sure he had none

108
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,720
 wasn't hanging out with the pigeons on the roof they did notice he had quite an odd

109
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:43,760
 and annoying hobby it was playing the bagpipes.

110
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,360
 Every day he played the bagpipes he had this really nice bagpipe and it was a synthetic

111
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,240
 bag now the old bagpipes had leather bags that every day you have to treat the leather

112
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,280
 to keep it loose but as technologies moved on people have moved on to the synthetic bags

113
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,400
 so you don't have to do that I mean you're recommended to clean them but you don't have

114
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,160
 to do this daily treatment for them he played the bagpipes every single day until he went

115
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,320
 to Australia for three months didn't bring his bagpipe with him got better came back

116
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:24,080
 to the UK first playing Lance he unpacks his bags he's like oh I missed you honey as he's

117
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,600
 hugging the bagpipe starts playing it again gets worse now it wasn't until he was basically

118
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:37,560
 on his deathbed that the doctor said hmm let's look in the bagpipe is full of mold super

119
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,760
 gross it was basically his lungs in a portable form which technically his lungs are portable

120
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,360
 because they're moving around with him but you know what I mean like what was in his

121
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,360
 lungs was in this bagpipe so he's blown into the bagpipe all these years and you probably

122
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
 cleaned it out occasionally but not as much as you would need to because the synthetic

123
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,360
 bag just holds all that gross disgust can you imagine how gross that cut open that I'm

124
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,360
 getting kind of sick just thinking about it cutting open a bagpipe bag and just seeing

125
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,480
 all like that growth and bacteria from him spitting into it for years whether he cleaned

126
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,680
 it once a year or he didn't clean it all enough stuff gross stuff was able to breed in there

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,400
 all of his breath and wet liquidy mouth stuff so I was the word I'm looking for hanging

128
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:31,200
 out in here growing civilizations rise and fall within his bagpipe bag as bacteria and

129
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,320
 mold just conquered that hole basically to them that was their universe so but but then

130
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,560
 some of them decided to start a space program and flew into his mouth and then he became

131
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,680
 colonized as well so he did pass away and this is now been called bagpipe lung and they've

132
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,960
 had to warn people specifically people who use synthetic bagpipe bags clean them as often

133
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,360
 as you can because otherwise you can have some horrible horrible problem but let's go

134
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,360
 ahead and move on to our next story now our next story here is going to take us to the

135
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:18,360
 magical magical year of 1976 the year I was born so in 1976 in January it's a cold Vegas

136
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,760
 night let's go to Las Vegas guys heading out to Las Vegas city that never sleeps little

137
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,040
 tiny town in the middle of Nevada basically one long strip I've been there a couple times

138
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,080
 I think I've only been there once but technically I took an airplane so I flew out of there and

139
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,200
 then I came back I've been a Reno quite a lot but Las Vegas is just like a big road

140
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,920
 with a bunch of shiny buildings on it I don't know I saw it in Conair and casino so or did

141
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,880
 casino take place in Reno it doesn't matter the point is is that we're in Las Vegas gambling

142
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,400
 Mecca of the world we're in a car we're actually going to be in the car with this dude we're

143
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:02,320
 all crowded into the back it's me you and Johnny Sands now Johnny Sands you don't know who

144
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,200
 he is I had to look him up because I didn't know who he is but he knows who he is he's

145
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,840
 an up and coming country musician now we'll spoiler alert the fact the story takes place

146
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:19,200
 in 1976 and you don't know who this guy is should tell you the trajectory of his career

147
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,480
 but in 1976 the whole world was open to Johnny Sands Native American kid turns into country

148
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,880
 western singer actually made his bones doing stunt work for western shows and now he is

149
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,800
 out to make his career as a country western singer he's getting ready to release his first

150
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,540
 album he's in Vegas doing a couple shows and doing radio spots for his album but this

151
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,560
 night he's just driving through Vegas just driving through the desert to get to Vegas

152
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,160
 or to leave Vegas that basically the whole place is one big desert you can turn down

153
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,160
 an alleyway and all of a sudden you're in shrubs it's a horrible horrible hellscape

154
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,880
 but he's driving through the desert and he sees a blimp overhead and you know whatever

155
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,320
 like I'm always fascinated by blimps I mean at least for the first two minutes I see one

156
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,680
 and then I just go back to do whatever I was doing but they are kind of fascinating air

157
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,440
 vehicles but in 1976 whatever he's like it's not 1932 this isn't the world's fair I've

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,800
 seen a blimp before he sees a blimp doesn't really pay it any mind he has moves to make

159
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,440
 he's got stuff to do but as the blimp gets closer overhead it's behind him his car starts

160
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,200
 to die and he's like dang never oh man I know I should have gotten the extended warranty

161
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,000
 on this car because now what I'm gonna do I'm out in the middle of nowhere and my car

162
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,120
 is broken down and he gets out of the car and he goes over and he's like checking the

163
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,880
 gas tank he's like kick it I read this in multiple articles it says that Johnny Sands

164
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:54,000
 kicked the car so he can hear if the gas was swarming around in the gas tank I'm thinking

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,080
 who is this guy the Hulk how can you kick a car so hard that you actually hear liquid

166
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:07,120
 inside of it moving two articles said he kicked the car it's like that's okay so right there

167
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,960
 I was a little suspicious of his story I've never I've heard of kicking the tires before

168
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,800
 but I've never heard someone go hey how much gas you have in your car and then a dude just

169
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,240
 goes ah he goes a quarter of a tank so anyways Johnny Sands he's able to kick his car hard

170
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,320
 enough to determine he does have gas in his tank he then goes to work on his engine because

171
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,760
 he's like well I kicked the car so that's not the problem and he's like kicking the

172
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,640
 hood open he's like doing he's punching the engine he's like I don't know why these spark

173
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,600
 plugs aren't working but as all that's going on we're just sitting in the car we're not

174
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,560
 helping this dude we're actually a little scared because when he kicked the car with

175
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,400
 us in it I felt the liquids in my own body move I go oh my god I drank too much water

176
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:58,840
 today gotta go bathroom now so as he's working on the car though he realizes that the vehicle

177
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,120
 has now passed overhead and it's not a blimp it's not a blimp now we knew it wasn't a blimp

178
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,680
 because this is a story from the intro about a UFO abduction but he still sees it as like

179
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,800
 a disc type shape flies overhead and he notices that it seems to have windows on the side

180
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,840
 and it has and it has red and white lights flashing on each end and that's a funny detail

181
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,880
 when I read that I thought that's something that a earthbound ship does red and white

182
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,920
 lights like that's something you see on basically every plane so that made me think well this

183
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,960
 might have been a US vehicle but it's just the red and white lights is such a mundane

184
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:45,640
 detail it was also a rusty orange color now Johnny Sands is quite the colorful character

185
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:53,440
 he's basically a down home country boy and so it makes sense that his ufo encounter he

186
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,440
 sees it the color of a beat up Ford truck rusty orange UFO that is basically the general

187
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:08,000
 lead that is basically like a trailer park truck color his ufo encounter is with this

188
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,920
 thing and he flies overhead and he's like oh whoa that's kind of cool but he goes back

189
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,800
 to working on his car because he really wants to get out of there and he's still thinking

190
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,560
 it's a blimp but at that point his headlines turn on so he kicks the hood shut and starts

191
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,640
 to walk back into the car but he's paralyzed you can't move but before he gets paralyzed

192
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,480
 sorry I forgot this part before he gets paralyzed he turns and looks down the desert road when

193
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,520
 the headlights came back on the headlights come back on he looks down the road and then

194
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,480
 he's like better get back in my car now now he gets paralyzed and as he's paralyzed he sees

195
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,480
 these two humanoids walking towards him from the craft so he said he has the aliens

196
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,520
 like one of them stayed farther back but one of them approached him and he described him

197
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,680
 as having the body of like a young fit man like just like a nowadays we'd say you know

198
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,240
 he had the body of Ryan Reynolds as alien at the body of Ryan Reynolds young fit man

199
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,880
 back then he would have said the guy had the body of who's deal with the big mustache not

200
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,400
 Magnum PI not Bruce Willis because he did not he's never had a mustache he was Bert Reynolds

201
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,480
 Bert Reynolds so imagine this alien with a burly Bert Reynolds body because 1976 that

202
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,480
 was young and fit back then nowadays that's like monstrous man who why aren't there big

203
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,560
 actors anymore why are all the actors super like lean like even the muscular ones are

204
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,240
 super lean whatever happened to the Schwarzenegger's and the Stallone's they got replaced by the

205
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,800
 Jean-Claude's like we need another like giant action star maybe not even action star we

206
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,640
 just need like a giant even if he's in a romantic comedy not like Andre the giant giant but

207
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:51,080
 we need more buff actors I want equal representation as a possibly buff man myself someday I want

208
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:57,000
 to see my future self represented in the movies get to it Hollywood we need more buff men

209
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,400
 so anyway that aside Bert Reynolds body but Johnny Sands says this about the aliens head

210
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,760
 this is interesting exact quote but in his face facial structure I don't know something

211
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:18,720
 gave me the idea that this guy was a 300 or 400 years old was very powerful face not ugly

212
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,320
 powerful looking and that's kind of interesting he goes on a couple times in his descriptions

213
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,080
 he talks about I know what powerful looks like when he goes into like he's like listen

214
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,120
 I grew up on a reservation I've been around people who were like spiritually touched and

215
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,280
 new things greater than I could ever hope to know and that's what these aliens look like

216
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:46,120
 they just looked like they had the secrets the universe in them and the powerful powerful

217
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,680
 and you're like calm down calm down dude powerful one of these articles actually is just a straight

218
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,120
 interview with him and it's a hoot but so he's saying that they they looked like these

219
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,760
 adonises from the neck down but they're and he's saying they weren't ugly they just looked

220
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,080
 so knowledgeable they looked ancient but they also did kind of have wrinkles and stuff like

221
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,040
 that this is how we describe them they were bald they were they were tall too they were

222
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,800
 his height and they were bald no eyelash there was no facial hair whatsoever so no eyelashes

223
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:23,460
 no brows no whiskers nothing now they wore black skin tight suits like basically unitards

224
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,720
 from the wrist all the way down to the ankles and I've as I've been looking into more alien

225
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,720
 abduction stuff it's so bizarre almost all of them to wear unitards almost all aliens

226
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,520
 wear unitards I wonder how come there's no aliens wearing togas is it have something

227
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,400
 to do with the way that they travel or is it just an easy detail to make up if you're

228
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,920
 making up a story I don't know but there has to be some reason why they're always wearing

229
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,120
 his unitards but he said that the suit was skin tight black so you can see they're perfectly

230
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,360
 carved Burt Reynolds muscles he could see each hair pressed up against the tight tight

231
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,520
 suit he said that it looked smooth but when he touched it because at one point one of

232
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,760
 them brushed up against him uh-huh Johnny was like trying to make the moves on this

233
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,440
 dude the aliens like stop it but no we come in peace get your hands off me he grabbed

234
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,160
 he touched he didn't grab sorry he pressed up against the alien and the suit felt like

235
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,720
 sandpaper so even though it looked super smooth it actually was quite coarse all of this going

236
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,440
 on they had black eyes with white pupils so little little uh inhuman eyes something you

237
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,960
 don't normally see a flatten nose a small mouth a little slit mouth that didn't move

238
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,760
 when they spoke so these ones are again working on some sort of telepathy type stuff and very

239
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,920
 interesting detail they had gills they had little gills on the side of their neck that

240
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,640
 would constantly move constantly move so basically fish gills maybe like farther up

241
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,320
 like on the head area but they're basically very visible there and but they still had

242
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,720
 a nose and a mouth and all that stuff so there's this whole thing where they're basically asking

243
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,800
 him like what are you doing here they ask him what are you doing here even though they

244
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,320
 just flew over in their Chevy pickup landed paralyzed him and they go what are you doing

245
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,200
 here and he's like I'm here promoting a music album it just the dude is so down to earth

246
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,800
 like assuming this story is true he's meeting extraterrestrials for the first time and

247
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,920
 they go it'd be the equivalent of someone goes take me to your leader and he's like

248
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,960
 Trump you want to know about Trump why he's making America great again you better come

249
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,320
 on down come to the White House like just instead of just being like whoa whoa whoa

250
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,600
 wait a second your aliens he just goes into his sales pitch they go what are you doing

251
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,360
 here and he's like well I'm in Vegas to sell my album you know I'm a country singer and

252
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,640
 I got stuff to do I got moves to make I got moves make you're sitting here you're busting

253
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,200
 my car I gotta go I don't know why he had a New York accent all of a sudden but anyways

254
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,480
 and he said I I said that I didn't go off in that whole monologue of the Jason just made

255
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,560
 up but he did say I'm a country Western singer I'm here promoting an album and he says the

256
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:11,240
 aliens acted like they understood what I was talking about like that they understood what

257
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:18,000
 a country singer was and things like that it was so odd now he doesn't reveal a lot of

258
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,520
 what these aliens say because they told him don't tell anyone what we talk about he did

259
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,840
 ask him questions like are you with the military and they said no but for the most part he

260
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,960
 doesn't really reveal a lot of stuff about what was said now again this happened 42 years

261
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,040
 ago so some of it has come out but he said they told me not to say anything and we'll

262
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,880
 get to kind of a loophole in that later on but he's given us just a little bit of the

263
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,960
 questions now I think of what's so funny so he's meeting these aliens and when he first

264
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,200
 meets these aliens because again this is 1976 so we've had UFO culture around for about

265
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,280
 20 years at this point he had all the movies and you had all the stories of these little

266
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:09,120
 green men and all this stuff he says this is one of his great quotes well I'm not discriminating

267
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,920
 nobody because I'm not wanting to say that I'm the only man who has seen somebody from

268
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,040
 outer space but I do have a little bit of a problem with some of the stories that I hear

269
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,640
 because I don't think those little balloony shaped head people with green dotted eyes

270
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,920
 and crawl around and look like pizans I think their intelligence is far beyond that look

271
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,760
 they're not three foot high these people I seen were intelligent people you could see

272
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,080
 wisdom in their face you could see that strength in them now I know there was a three different

273
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,480
 accents during that dramatic reading but he brings up an interesting point so he's saying

274
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,680
 from his point of view listen I'm not I'm gonna have to translate hillbilly now I'm

275
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,880
 not saying I'm the only person who's ever seen an alien before but every description

276
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,840
 I've ever heard of an alien is wrong because that's not what I saw at all and and even

277
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,880
 if aliens did look like that it doesn't make sense because aliens seem to be so much smarter

278
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,240
 and so much more advanced than us and they look like pissants they look like tiny little

279
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,920
 people so anyways he ends up bidding the aliens adieu and that's just the beginning of his

280
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,440
 adventure he ends up talking to the government he like mentions it at a news conference or

281
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,720
 something like that he ends up like mentioning it at a news conference or mentioning it to

282
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,200
 a reporter and then he gets connected with this aerospace lab in Nevada and they tell

283
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,440
 him then he tells story again and I'm sure they all just thought it was super amusing

284
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,440
 they tell him to contact the government he contacts the government and they want to do

285
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,080
 like a lie detector test on them and interview him and at one point he says I have an album

286
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,160
 to publicize and this is actually not good publicity for me because everyone's just gonna

287
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,320
 think I'm a big old kook buy my album you want to buy my album general and the guy's

288
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,840
 like fine if I buy your album will you take a lie detector test and he's like you buy

289
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,200
 10 albums I might everyone on the basis having to buy a copy of an album he does take a lie

290
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,880
 detector test he quote unquote passes which basically means he wasn't being deceitful I

291
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,080
 mean the thing lie detector tests are all it doesn't necessarily mean you're telling

292
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,400
 the truth it just means that in your mind what you're saying is true but while they're

293
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,360
 doing all this stuff the they bring in a guy to do a sketch of the alien described as the

294
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,560
 best artist in Vegas so I'm assuming it was a velvet artist the guy just completed velvet

295
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,640
 Elvis and now he's doing velvet dogs playing poker he's brought in by the government to

296
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,360
 do velvet alien and as the best artist in Vegas is doing this and Johnny Sands is like yeah

297
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,000
 and then the guy and he was bold he was bold but he had Bert Reynolds body and they're

298
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,360
 like oh that's interesting I can draw that pretty easily and Johnny goes and he had

299
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,840
 Gills he had Gills and the artist starts running and he goes why does he have Gills if he has

300
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,200
 an ear and a nose now remember this is in a government area the government's getting

301
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,400
 the artist to come out here and do all this stuff as the artist goes why does he have

302
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,920
 Gills if he has a mouth and a nose a member of like an attache there's like a government

303
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,880
 observer there he goes the reason why he has Gills it's evolutionary thing they're from

304
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,320
 a planet from the serious star system that's half water half land and so as the water tides

305
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,320
 move across the planet sometimes they have to be under water when it's super hot sometimes

306
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,560
 they have to be on land they're kind of like a frog an amphibious race of aliens so that

307
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:31,680
 basically meant this this guy knew what these aliens were and the artist goes now imagine

308
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,360
 you're sitting there you had just seen an alien you thought it might have been a one

309
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,520
 off thing you asked him these questions you're in a government meeting a guy goes oh no we

310
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,960
 totally are aware of that race they're an amphibious race we know where they're at we know why

311
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,840
 they're like that how would you react to that Johnny Sands goes well I don't know but that

312
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:57,480
 sounds good to me as it is exact quote this guy now you realize why UFOs always land in

313
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,200
 the middle of Arkansas because if this is your most credible witness a guy just tells

314
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,040
 you that they have knowledge of an alien civilization on another planet and what you saw is verifiably

315
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:15,560
 true to the point we know why they evolved that way and you're like aww shucks anyways

316
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:21,280
 so eventually he says Johnny goes listen things did start getting a little weird so I have

317
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:26,480
 an old cop buddy I have an old cop buddy who has an incredibly colorful back story he's

318
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,960
 like he fought Muhammad Ali he fought Joe Frazier but anyways he was just super weird

319
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,880
 Johnny Sands again I have a hard time buying into a lot of this stuff Johnny Sands calls

320
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,320
 up his cop friend he goes things are getting a little weird out here I probably use a bodyguard

321
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,000
 and then a local television producer named Dave Dunn was like hey we're gonna do a show

322
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,640
 about this blimp flying overhead but we're gonna make a really low budget because we

323
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,280
 don't have a lot of money but we're gonna drive out to the desert you show us where

324
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,000
 it's at we're gonna shoot this show and Johnny's like fine but I'm gonna bring my bodyguard

325
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,440
 with me and Dave's like yeah sure they all get into like two cars they drive out there

326
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,560
 together and Johnny goes this is the place where the lights are at and the car just keeps

327
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,160
 driving and Johnny's like no no no it was back there where we were supposed to stop

328
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,960
 and the car keeps driving pro tip if you're ever in a car in Vegas and you say hey I'm

329
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,360
 supposed to get out here and it keeps going further into the desert it's not gonna be

330
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:27,080
 a good ending for you but for this story the first car stops everyone gets out the second

331
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,520
 car stops everyone but Johnny and his bodyguard get out they're told to stay in the car and

332
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,160
 all these bright lights appear around the cars and Johnny's like I'm gonna go find out

333
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,240
 what's going on because this is dumb like I need to find out what's going on and he

334
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,280
 notices like Dave is like talking to someone who's obscured by the lights and keeps pointing

335
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,000
 at the car with Johnny Sans and his bodyguard in it and they roll down the window a bit

336
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,160
 and they hear Dave Dunn goes what are we supposed to do he knows too much he knows too much

337
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,720
 and they're like uh oh this is not good and at that point Johnny Sans is like I'm gonna

338
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,600
 give him I'm gonna give him an old one too from a country boy and as he goes to open

339
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,960
 the this is so as he goes to open the door to get out to confront the men behind these

340
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,920
 bright lights in the middle of the Las Vegas desert he describes two two of these big like

341
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,080
 just balls of fur they're like three feet tall giant balls of hair like cousin it from

342
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,360
 the Anna's family come running out of the desert and slam against the car and hold the

343
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,400
 door shut so he can't get out so now he's in the car with this bodyguard he's looking

344
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,640
 at these two big balls of hair looking at him through the window and the bodyguard goes

345
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,800
 are you still gonna get out and the most sensible thing Johnny Sans has done since the beginning

346
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,160
 of this he said no I'm just gonna stay in the car and then eventually the furry people

347
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,120
 left and Dave Dunn gets in the car and the cars just right back drop him off at the hotel

348
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,920
 the next day when Johnny and his bodyguard went to Dave Dunn's production office to

349
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,720
 find out what the hell happened the night of last night because no one said anything

350
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,000
 on their way back who the furry people were what was going on they go to the production

351
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,640
 office they had been to multiple times throughout the course of this whole that that Dave Dunn

352
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,200
 story was actually like quite like weeks long they go to the production office no one's

353
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,120
 there it's been completely cleaned out and the woman who rented the office out said no

354
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,560
 one has no one's been in there for a while Dun Dun Dunn Dave Dunn that producer died

355
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,640
 a thousand years ago Dunn it was this weird like he says that Dave Dunn was basically

356
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,680
 one of the men in black and they were trying to figure out what to do with him but what's

357
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,200
 weird about that story is they should have taken care of him months ago because he'd

358
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,740
 already spread the story all over the place so where are we at now with the saga of Johnny

359
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:44,820
 Sands Johnny Sands has done interviews since he basically says the men in black the guys

360
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,120
 who were doing the Dave Dunn and all that stuff one of the first things they wanted me to

361
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,200
 do was write a song about the aliens write it in one day had a hurry up and write a song

362
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:02,480
 and I did I never released it and then I feel like all of the stuff the aliens told me has

363
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,160
 kind of passed the statute of limitations like enough time has passed I think I can do it

364
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,580
 so I am right I'm gonna release my song about the aliens I'm gonna spread their message

365
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:20,220
 to the world and you can find it on my website myspace.com/JohnnySandsMusic with this album

366
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,620
 we can finally have the message out about the aliens it's time it's time to let you

367
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,580
 guys know what they said the interview kind of wrapped up with the interviewer saying

368
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,740
 you know do you ever like think but you still think about this and Johnny Sands is like all

369
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:39,960
 the time sometimes I just walk out of my house I throw my hands up in the air I look up at

370
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:47,960
 the sky and say come back friends come back I want to talk to you now that's a kind of

371
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,640
 a common thing we've seen with other alien and counter stories in the past people like

372
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:58,640
 want to reach out and touch someone but of course your main question is Jason you listen

373
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,200
 to the music right you found some of Johnny Sands stuff you listen to this alien song

374
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:13,700
 right for this story it's gone deleted lost who knows Johnny Sands music is still up on

375
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:19,380
 myspace page there's absolutely no songs listed there the only song I can find of him

376
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,820
 with some honky-tonk song about Elvis there's always that saying they should have sent a

377
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,540
 poet I think they're specifically talking about going to space for the first time they

378
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:34,180
 said they should have sent a poet because that person could really use the language

379
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:41,820
 to explain the beauty of what is going on and whether or not you enjoy country music

380
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:50,820
 Johnny Sands is a poet he uses his words to create art until evoke emotions how many times

381
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:59,140
 do we have artists encounter aliens it's not very often not very often at all so when

382
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:06,420
 one does I think it's fascinating in his narrative that the men in black have him write a song

383
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,380
 about what he went through very shortly to they didn't want him to overthink it they just

384
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,540
 want him to put it out there right now just write it and he wrote it and he performed

385
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:22,140
 it for him and I'm sure he made them buy his cassette but where is that song now was it

386
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,820
 just another rinky dink tune from a guy who tried making it as a country western singer

387
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:36,260
 and never really lived up to that potential or did that song contain truths artists are

388
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,100
 immortalized by their work whether or not you're a famous artist or an obscure artist

389
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:50,820
 what you create is your legacy Johnny Sands legacy is just a few interviews now a few

390
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:58,140
 MP3's floating around the internet and a dead page on Myspace but the song that he wrote

391
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:05,100
 on orders of a shady governmental organization is part of his legacy as well we may not be

392
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:13,260
 able to hear it but this song that included first impressions of an alien encounter written

393
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:20,060
 by a poet may be in some government archive somewhere just filed away with a little tag

394
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:29,420
 on it Sands comma Johnny Desert Encounter 1976 we'll never be able to hear that song

395
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:36,340
 but hopefully Johnny found some peace knowing that he became one of the most famous musicians
