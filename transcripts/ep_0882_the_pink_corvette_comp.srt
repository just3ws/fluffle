1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
 A young boy grapples with a terrifying memory.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,080
 A young boy grapples with a terrifying memory.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,880
 And then we meet a young man who has had the same reoccurring dream for the past 20 years.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,000
 A dream involving a woman he has never met.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,200
 Is it possible that this is simply just a dream and no more?

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:33,040
 Is he the victim of an unending love spell today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:44,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,120
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,160
 I hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,440
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,080
 First off, let's go ahead and introduce today's supporters walking into Dead Rabbit Command

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,120
 right now, pulling off an encore, a special double episode from yesterday.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,760
 Give it up for the beautiful Mina and her hunky man meet no one as Murphy.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
 Woo!

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,760
 Yeah, everyone can hear it, they're all looking like what?

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
 That's a weird intro.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,760
 Mina and Murphy came out and saw me at the McMenamins UFO Festival.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,320
 It was a lot of fun to see some of my listeners in real life.

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,160
 So you two are gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,440
 So if you guys can't support the Patreon or can't support the show financially or can't

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,240
 travel to meet me in real life, that's all totally fine too.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,120
 Just helps spread the word about the show.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,600
 That helps out so much.

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
 Now Mina, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,480
 We're gonna rip onto your ankles and you're gonna go jumping off the highest point at

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
 Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:47,240
 We're flying all the way out to Tucson, Arizona.

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,040
 And in Tucson, Arizona, there's a young boy, probably about the age of six.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,840
 Now this story was posted anonymously so we don't have a name, but we're gonna call him

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,680
 Tyler.

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,720
 We also don't have a time period for this story.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,320
 We do know it took place in the past.

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,760
 The person who's posting this story, Tyler, he's an adult now and he's reminiscing.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,560
 And this is a really interesting story because you have to wonder exactly what is he remembering.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,600
 Tyler, back when this story is taking place, is a six year old boy.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,360
 And he was just doing six year old boy stuff at the time, right?

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
 Playing with he-man action figures or pogs.

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,680
 I don't know what time period this took place in.

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,000
 I don't think he was flossing to Fortnite.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,120
 But somewhere between the dawn of mankind and the modern day, this story takes place.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,320
 And he remembers, outside of just doing normal six year old stuff, he has this one terrifying

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,720
 memory that just happened over and over again.

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:53,560
 He remembers every so often his dad would take him out to the car and buckle him in.

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,840
 And then he would take his younger sister, Tyler's little sister.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
 She'd be buckled into her car seat.

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,880
 And then the dad would get in the car and he'd begin driving through the city of Tucson,

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
 Arizona.

49
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,360
 Eventually he would reach an automotive shop, pull into the parking lot, and the father would

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,520
 get out of the car.

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,400
 Every time this happened, Tyler would fall asleep.

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,760
 Not on the car ride out there.

53
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,800
 But when the dad pulled into the parking lot and shut off the car, Tyler would get a case

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,120
 of the Snoozies.

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,040
 Peaceful sleep, a six year old, right?

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,440
 And almost every time.

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,680
 Every time he would fall asleep, but almost every time he would wake up and the car would

58
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,520
 be once again driving through the streets of Tucson, Arizona.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,120
 Now Tyler's not specific on the seating arrangement in the car, but I do think it matters.

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,960
 And I'm going to place him behind the driver's seat.

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,600
 Now a lot of times when I do these stories, a lot of times the people find them.

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,640
 So if Tyler wants to correct me on that detail, that's totally fair.

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,320
 But Tyler, I believe, was sitting behind the driver's seat, sitting in the back.

64
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,960
 And this car would be driving down the streets late at night.

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,440
 And Tyler realized something.

66
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,120
 His father was not driving the car.

67
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,280
 In fact, no one was driving the car.

68
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,800
 He would sit in the back seat of this car as it prowled down the lonely streets with no

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 driver.

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,360
 He didn't see anyone's head, shoulders, nothing.

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,480
 Looking from the back seat, he clearly knew that the car was driving itself.

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,680
 He says that when this was happening, he would be overcome with this primal fear.

73
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,560
 Because you could say, well, maybe, maybe this is a tiny person driving it.

74
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,960
 Maybe that person driving the car now is much shorter than any adult that Tyler had ever

75
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
 seen in his life.

76
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,400
 But it wasn't just that he knew that the car was driving itself.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,200
 He also had this overwhelming sense of dread.

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,440
 Something really, really bad was about to happen.

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:16,720
 And he would just sit there in this state of terrified paralysis as this car drove down

80
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
 the road.

81
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,960
 Tyler doesn't make any mention of a destination.

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,200
 He doesn't remember that it pulled up to check his cheese and everything was okay.

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
 See you later, ghost car.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,080
 And thanks for the tokens.

85
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,840
 He just says that the car would leave the auto shop and drive around town.

86
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,280
 There's no mention of the destination.

87
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,480
 And this happened a lot.

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,360
 This happened so much.

89
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,760
 His dad taking him to the automotive shop, the dad getting out of the car, Tyler falling

90
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,120
 asleep and then waking up and the car is driving itself.

91
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,720
 That he began to get anxious whenever he had to get in the car.

92
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,920
 He started to feel like anytime he got in the car he was going to the auto shop.

93
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
 But you're six.

94
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
 What are you going to do?

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,120
 You can only throw so many fits.

96
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,440
 Stamp your feet so many times.

97
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
 You're six years old.

98
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
 You really don't have a choice.

99
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
 You're getting in that car.

100
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,840
 Now a lot of times he'd get in the car and they would go to check his cheese or they

101
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,480
 would go shopping or they would go to the friend's house or they would go to church or whatever.

102
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,200
 So more times than not it was a normal car drive but every so often Tyler would watch

103
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,640
 that car creep closer to that auto shop and then as the father parked the car in the parking

104
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:37,800
 lot and turned it off Tyler's fear was brushed aside as he slowly fell asleep.

105
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,200
 Tyler never really stated when it started or how it started but he definitely knows

106
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,480
 when it stopped.

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,880
 He said one day my dad drove to the auto shop, got out of the car, left me and my sister

108
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,960
 in it and sure enough I fall asleep.

109
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,880
 I wake up and the car is once again driving itself down the road and this time for the

110
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:08,080
 first time I fought against the overwhelming dread.

111
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,240
 I fought the fear.

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,160
 I had to know what was going on.

113
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:22,720
 For the first time Tyler decides to peek around the driver's seat to truly see for once and

114
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,400
 for all if this car was driving itself or if it was three kids in a trench coat.

115
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,500
 So Tyler peeked around the driver's seat.

116
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,720
 He's sitting in the back and he's peeking his little head around and he sees very, very

117
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,800
 clearly.

118
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
 Nothing is there.

119
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,000
 Nothing.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,240
 He said from the back seat as I craned my head around and got a good look the driver's

121
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:02,680
 seat was clearly empty but the steering wheel was slowly swaying back and forth like someone

122
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,920
 was steady in a car.

123
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:15,640
 I saw the pedals, the gas pedal and the brake pedal slowly get pushed down by some invisible

124
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,560
 force.

125
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,480
 This terrified Tyler.

126
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,040
 This is what he knew it was but even at six he knew this wasn't possible.

127
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,200
 He immediately snaps his head back almost afraid that someone might catch him looking and seeing

128
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,400
 this forbidden thing.

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:44,640
 He closes his eyes and he pretends to be asleep but he is so horrified he passes out.

130
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,440
 He said the fear was so overwhelming I lost consciousness.

131
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,280
 Basically going into shock and he said that was the last time that ever happened.

132
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,280
 His father never again took him to the automotive shop.

133
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:11,080
 He never once again sat in the back of a car that drove itself through Tucson, Arizona.

134
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,520
 Tyler added a couple of additions after this.

135
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,280
 That's the bulk of the story but he did add a couple of details.

136
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,920
 One he said that, listen it obviously sounds like a dream.

137
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,840
 Obviously with a little kid falling asleep in the back of a car the easiest thing to

138
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,360
 say is that he was dreaming but he's like this was so real.

139
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,280
 This was part of my childhood.

140
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
 It was so real.

141
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,840
 It was so vivid and it happened all the time.

142
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,560
 I don't think it was a dream.

143
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,360
 I was thinking not necessarily paranormal but repressed memory.

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,920
 Trauma block right and even Tyler thinks that's what it could be.

145
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,920
 Like there was so much trauma going on that it wasn't an invisible person.

146
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,920
 It was a real person that he blocked out from his memory.

147
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,320
 And that would track.

148
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,680
 We know that happens.

149
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,200
 We know people can actually repress memories or have distorted memories and things like

150
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 that.

151
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
 That totally makes sense.

152
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,000
 That's a very very dark story then.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,880
 On the one end, on the paranormal end, we have Ghost Car.

154
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
 Which is awesome right?

155
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,840
 That could be a Pixar movie.

156
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,340
 That could be a regular movie.

157
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,640
 It was not a movie to this kid.

158
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,080
 It was his real life.

159
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
 Ghost Car.

160
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 Herbie.

161
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
 Herbie the love bug.

162
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,760
 Wasn't he possessed by the ghost of some dead monk or something like that?

163
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
 Could be that right.

164
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,640
 Could be Ghost Car.

165
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
 And that would be fine.

166
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,320
 Not for this kid right.

167
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 He's terrified.

168
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,240
 But Ghost Car, I would be willing to believe that is possible.

169
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
 I believe in ghosts.

170
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,280
 I believe that ghosts can possess inanimate objects.

171
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
 It totally makes sense right?

172
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,040
 That tracks on the paranormal side.

173
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,360
 But and here's the thing.

174
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,360
 If you had a choice between having a childhood where you think that every show often some

175
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,320
 dead monk, some dead monk floating around the Sistine Chapel or something wants to take

176
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,720
 a vacation inside of your Chevy Camaro.

177
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
 That's cool right?

178
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,440
 Going a lot of magical adventures.

179
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,840
 But then the other option.

180
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:18,160
 Like you can choose 1970s Disney movie or that something happened to you so often, so regularly

181
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,400
 with the knowledge of your own father that he delivered you to this location that was

182
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,720
 so terrifying, your brain actually altered reality.

183
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,960
 Like your brain basically said a ghost car is more soothing than the trauma you are currently

184
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,800
 going through.

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 That's way worse.

186
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:49,000
 Like if you had to choose between the two, Herbie all the way.

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,440
 And it's funny because this is one of those stories that has its foot in two worlds.

188
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,440
 I'd love for it to be a paranormal story, but it could be a true crime story.

189
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,880
 And if it is, that's absolutely terrifying.

190
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,560
 And then you think is was the kid being knocked out?

191
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,000
 Was Tyler and his sister being put to sleep?

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,320
 And this last time there was some human driving the car and they realized that Tyler was actually

193
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,800
 awake and Tyler got a good look at the guy and then the guy's like I don't want to like

194
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,240
 be driving that kid around anymore.

195
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,280
 Assuming that's what they were doing, I don't think anyone represses memories because they

196
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,800
 go for a joy ride through Tucson, Arizona.

197
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,560
 Like you can only imagine the worst, so I don't want to imagine it, right?

198
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,360
 I don't even want to think about it.

199
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,440
 But what a crazy story.

200
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,160
 I found this, this was actually posted on the X-Force, they had a really cool thread.

201
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,320
 Actual weird inexplicable things that have happened to you.

202
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,680
 There's a bunch of people talking about a lot of experiences from their childhood because

203
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,440
 I think that's what the OP was kind of mentioned their childhood specifically if I remember

204
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
 clearly.

205
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
 Anyways, it'll be in the show notes.

206
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,160
 You can go through there and look at some of the other ones.

207
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,000
 But terrifying story or uplifting Disney Channel movie.

208
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
 The boy fell asleep at the automotive shop.

209
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,440
 That would be much, much preferable.

210
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,560
 Mina, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

211
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,160
 We didn't get you in the carboner copter yesterday so that's why you're back for this

212
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
 episode.

213
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,800
 Mina and Murphy both get in your pilot uniforms.

214
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,000
 We are leaving behind Tucson, Arizona.

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,960
 We are headed all the way out to a local high school.

216
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:37,960
 Oh, here's an interesting thing.

217
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,800
 I actually didn't plan it this way.

218
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,160
 This story was supposed to be on yesterday's episode.

219
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,160
 This story is actually also from the actual weird inexplicable things that have happened

220
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
 to you.

221
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
 So, double header.

222
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
 Double header.

223
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
 I didn't expect that.

224
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,200
 I usually like to spread this stuff out more.

225
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,480
 They come from the same source.

226
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,520
 But here we are at a local high school.

227
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,840
 Mina landed this carboner copter.

228
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 We're going to disembark.

229
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,480
 I hope you guys brought your high school clothes.

230
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
 I did.

231
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,320
 And we're here to meet this guy.

232
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,840
 Now we don't have his name either.

233
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
 It's posted anonymously.

234
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,120
 We're going to name him Aaron.

235
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,000
 Aaron, shortly after he graduated from high school, he began having this dream.

236
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Do-la-p-do-wa.

237
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Do-la-p-do-wa.

238
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 It's a sunny day.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And Aaron is sitting on a little stone bench in the middle of a garden.

240
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Do-la-p-do-wo.

241
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Do-la-p-do-wa.

242
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Love is in the air.

243
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,840
 As Aaron is sitting next to his girlfriend, his high school sweetheart, Lisa.

244
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,840
 And she just has the dreamiest look in her eyes for Aaron.

245
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,840
 And Aaron looks back at her and he's just never been in love like this before.

246
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
 Do-la-p-do-wa.

247
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
 Do-la-p-do-wa.

248
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
 Do-la-p-do-wa.

249
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,440
 And they're holding hands.

250
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,520
 They're walking through the park together.

251
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,760
 Enjoying the sunshine on their skin.

252
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,600
 And that's when Lisa turns to Aaron and says, "Aaron, I love you so much.

253
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
 I love you so much."

254
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,640
 And Aaron looks down at her and says, "I love you more."

255
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:18,080
 And through their romantic date, they're laughing, smiling at each other, they're enjoying life

256
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
 together.

257
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,200
 Young love.

258
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,920
 And she pulls out something she's clipped out of a magazine.

259
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,560
 And she goes, "Aaron, when are you gonna buy me my pink corvette?"

260
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,800
 She says it a little jokingly, a little coy.

261
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,960
 But Aaron knows this is something Lisa's always wanted.

262
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,840
 He's been talking about this for a long time.

263
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
 Her dream car.

264
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,680
 A pink corvette.

265
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,040
 And she pulls out of her pocket a folded photo from a magazine.

266
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,720
 And there in this picture is Lisa's dream car, a pink corvette.

267
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,960
 And Aaron goes, "Someday, baby.

268
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,720
 Someday when I make all the money in the world and I'm rich and famous and successful

269
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,760
 and I have you by my side, I'll get you all the pink corvettes you want, baby."

270
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
 Do-la-p-do-wa.

271
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:13,360
 Do-la-p-do-do-do-la.

272
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,680
 Aaron wakes up.

273
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,520
 He's alone in bed.

274
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,680
 He's sitting there.

275
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,960
 And he sighs.

276
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:38,400
 Because he has had this same dream once a week for 20 years.

277
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,560
 Once a week, he has a dream where he's in high school.

278
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,760
 High school age, Aaron.

279
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,880
 And he's hanging out with his girlfriend, Lisa.

280
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,640
 And he has never met this girl before in his life.

281
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,680
 When he sees this girl, this dream is so vivid.

282
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,400
 He knows exactly what she looks like.

283
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,920
 He could pick her out of a photo if he ever had one of her.

284
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,440
 But he's never met Lisa.

285
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,240
 He actually says, "I don't never really knew anyone named Lisa."

286
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
 Not in high school.

287
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,800
 I didn't know anyone named Lisa.

288
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,880
 He also says, "I'm not a car guy.

289
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,040
 I'm not into cars at all.

290
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:25,960
 But when she talks about the pink corvette, I can the next day look up a photo of a pink

291
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,160
 corvette and go, 'That's the one she was talking about.'"

292
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,680
 Now sometimes she'll show him a picture in the dream.

293
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,200
 So he'll know what to look for.

294
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,040
 But sometimes she'll just by describing it.

295
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,360
 He can find a real life photograph of a pink corvette that matches her description.

296
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,640
 That's how vivid these dreams are.

297
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
 He can picture her completely.

298
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,080
 He can picture the pink corvette completely, even though he's not a car guy.

299
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,920
 He goes, "Sometimes she doesn't bring up the pink corvette.

300
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,240
 Sometimes in the dreams, I bring it up."

301
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,600
 Pink corvettes always this totem floating through his subconscious.

302
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,440
 He goes, "When she brings it up, she'll show me a picture of her dream car.

303
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,880
 And I'll tell her someday, baby, someday I'm gonna get you your dream car."

304
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,440
 But there are times where she doesn't mention it.

305
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,720
 And if she doesn't mention it in the dream, he will mention it.

306
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,200
 And when he brings up the pink corvette, her heart just melts.

307
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
 True love.

308
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,640
 She listens to her, the sign of any good relationship, right?

309
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,000
 They're sitting there at the malt shop, one shake, two straws.

310
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And he goes, "You know what, honey?

311
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I'm thinking.

312
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,440
 I'm thinking that you really deserve two pink corvettes."

313
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,600
 And she, "Oh my God, oh my God, that's totally my dream car.

314
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
 Oh my God."

315
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
 She's totally freaking out.

316
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,040
 She's so excited because he listens to her.

317
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,880
 The pink corvette is always present in these dreams, and him and Lisa are always present

318
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,080
 in these dreams, but he doesn't know who Lisa is.

319
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,640
 Until four years ago.

320
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,440
 Four years ago, Aaron was looking through a yearbook online.

321
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,920
 It is your book, not just some random high school yearbook.

322
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,680
 He was looking through his high school yearbook online.

323
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,720
 And he came across a listing for an Elizabeth Martinez.

324
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,920
 And when he saw that photo, he knew.

325
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,320
 He knew it was her.

326
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,040
 He'd been seeing her once a week for the past 16 years at this point, 16 years.

327
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
 He saw that photo.

328
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,600
 He knew this was the Lisa from his dreams, but she was an underclassman, right?

329
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
 She was an underclassman.

330
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,920
 So, if you're not familiar with American high school's freshman, sophomore, underclassman,

331
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,720
 junior, senior, upperclassman.

332
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,680
 And he says, "Listen, I never, ever saw this girl before."

333
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,000
 Now, obviously you guys are going to find that hard to believe because it's a high school

334
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 and people mingle.

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,600
 He goes, "But I went to a pretty strict conservative school and they not only had rules between

336
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,920
 the upperclassmen and the underclassmen, fraterizing, fraterizing, fraternizing," whatever the word

337
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
 is.

338
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
 They kept us apart.

339
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 They kept us apart.

340
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,000
 Not only did they have rules for keeping us apart, they never taught us how to say that

341
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 word.

342
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,720
 He goes, "The school is actually designed, so we wouldn't really even interact."

343
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,520
 So, I never saw her.

344
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,560
 If there was someone who was two grades lower than you, you didn't even know they were there,

345
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,760
 unless they were your neighbor, you passed them on a bus or something.

346
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,360
 I'm not saying they would be invisible, driving their cars.

347
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,760
 You're like, "Oh, that must be the freshman coming in this year."

348
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
 But he wouldn't know them.

349
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,160
 He goes, "Listen, I didn't know Lisa.

350
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,360
 Never saw her before."

351
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,760
 I didn't even think she existed.

352
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,160
 I just thought this was some really weird, reoccurring dream.

353
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,240
 I couldn't place it at all.

354
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,280
 I had no real way to process it because it was about someone that I had never met.

355
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,280
 And now, here I am, 16 years having these dreams.

356
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,440
 And there she is.

357
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
 She does exist.

358
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,640
 And she has the same name, basically.

359
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,720
 Elizabeth Martinez-Lisa.

360
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,720
 So that happened four years ago, and he's still having those dreams to today.

361
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,800
 It's been 20 years since the first dream has popped up, and he has them every week.

362
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,560
 Now, four years ago, he found the photo of Elizabeth Martinez.

363
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
 Luckily, he had the name.

364
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,840
 Could you imagine how insane he would have been if he just saw a photo?

365
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,800
 He started looking her up on social media.

366
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
 Nothing.

367
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,840
 Which, hey, Elizabeth Martinez, it's a pretty common name.

368
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,640
 He began looking through classmates' social media, who could possibly be a friend of a

369
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,840
 friend of hers.

370
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,800
 Nothing.

371
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,800
 He cannot place her anywhere in the digital sphere.

372
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
 She's a ghost.

373
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,720
 She's a digital ghost.

374
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,720
 He says that when he saw this photo of her in the yearbook, though, think about the different

375
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 words you would describe having a reoccurring dream for 20 years, thinking that it was just

376
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,840
 your brain synapses firing, and your consciousness was trying to make some sort of order out

377
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,280
 of the chaos, and then finding out that the chaos is real.

378
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,720
 Finding out that this girl you've been dreaming about, and this girl wanting this pink corvette

379
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,960
 for 20 years, you find out that she's real.

380
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,720
 I think I would use the words shocked or amazed.

381
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,040
 Flabbergasted.

382
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,320
 The words he chose, it's very interesting, right?

383
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
 Word choice matters.

384
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:46,480
 The words he chose was he described this realization with quote, "Absolute horror."

385
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,720
 Absolute horror is what he is dealing with at this moment, and he's trying to track her

386
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,120
 down and he can't.

387
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,480
 He has to get an answer to this.

388
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,320
 Now there is something to hang his hat on.

389
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,720
 It's not just random chaos while dreaming.

390
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,400
 This woman exists.

391
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,760
 So for the past four years he's been trying to find any trace of her and he can't.

392
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,320
 Which means a few things.

393
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,200
 One super common name, hard to find.

394
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,720
 Two moved out of the area, so all of your searches in the local area are for nothing.

395
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,640
 And his common as a name is Elizabeth Martinez, maybe in your area.

396
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,360
 Nationally, it would be impossible to find this person.

397
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:41,240
 I wonder if with Google, I know Google reverse image search can tell you if the image has

398
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
 been used.

399
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,720
 I wonder if Google reverse image search will eventually, I'm sure they can do it now,

400
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,520
 but it hasn't been released to the public.

401
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,920
 Maybe this is released to the public.

402
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,320
 I don't know that you could take a photo of someone, any photo of them, you take a photo

403
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,680
 of say Scarlett Johansson, and then using biometrics on her face can show you a photo

404
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,760
 of every facial picture of Scarlett Johansson ever.

405
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,760
 Which would be useless because you could just type in Scarlett Johansson, but if someone

406
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:17,440
 wanted to find photos of me, all ten of them, there's not a lot of photos of me honestly,

407
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,360
 but even as a child that didn't have a lot of photos taken, you would have, like you

408
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,720
 could pull up every single photo of me ever posted online, ever.

409
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,800
 So if you had that, you could use it on this Elizabeth Martinez woman, and would pull up

410
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,640
 all the Elizabeth, all of this woman, right?

411
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,520
 I'm sure that technology is out there.

412
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,520
 It's not available to us, it's available to someone, like the Feds or something like that.

413
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
 But anyways, you can't find her.

414
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,800
 I totally forgot where it's going with this.

415
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,840
 I went on my sci-fi eagle eye Shia LaBeouf rant.

416
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,120
 Where was I going with this?

417
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,400
 You can't find, oh, oh, oh, this is where I was going with this.

418
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,560
 If you can't find them, super common name, she may moved out of the area.

419
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:11,680
 It's possible that she had some sort of adverse life event, like a stalker, and she doesn't

420
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,880
 have social media, right?

421
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,320
 That's definitely possible as well.

422
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,200
 At a certain point, you just became too much trouble, and she's like, "Nope, I want it

423
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
 gone."

424
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,200
 The other possibility is the fact that, well, I guess there is one that she just doesn't

425
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,200
 like social media, but the fifth one would be the fact that she's passed away.

426
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,320
 That she's no longer with us, and that's the reason why she's not on TikTok, because she's

427
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,080
 dead, right?

428
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,520
 If she died before Facebook really took off or Instagram really took off, this might

429
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,000
 come as a shock to you, but ghosts can't start social media accounts.

430
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 So that's possible.

431
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,880
 There's those five possibilities.

432
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,880
 But whatever the reason why Aaron can't find Lisa, he said, "Listen, when I thought this

433
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
 was just a dream, I just kind of dealt with it.

434
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,760
 I just thought it was this weird occurrence, but now that I know she exists or existed,

435
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:09,480
 at least, he feels like he may have committed, quote, "the greatest blunder of my life."

436
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,960
 Unquote.

437
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,120
 This was true love.

438
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,880
 This was happiness that he doesn't have today.

439
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,040
 Imagine going to sleep and not knowing if you're going to be thrust into a dream world

440
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,720
 where you are loved unconditionally, and then you got to wake up the next morning.

441
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,560
 It'll almost be torture, right?

442
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,080
 Because it's going to happen every week.

443
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,680
 Maybe there's a couple weeks where it doesn't happen, but it's regular, right?

444
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,560
 In this dream, he is loved, loved, loved.

445
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,400
 And the only thing that his high school girlfriend is asking for is a pink Corvette.

446
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,040
 Now going back to that, here's another little interesting note, and we'll start wrapping

447
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,600
 the episode up.

448
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:01,440
 He says that sometimes she will show him a picture of the pink Corvette she wants.

449
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,560
 But this dream's been happening over the course of 20 years.

450
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:15,920
 Over those 20 years, the model of the Corvette, like the design of the Corvette, changes as

451
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,600
 the new models, as the new years of Corvettes are released.

452
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,680
 The pink Corvette he dreams about today is not the same model that doesn't look the

453
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,720
 same as the pink Corvette when the dream first started, because the Corvette has undergone

454
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
 changes.

455
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,520
 Again, he goes, "I'm not a car guy.

456
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,640
 He's not into cars, but he knows those changes have happened because throughout those 20

457
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,560
 years the pink Corvette stays modern."

458
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:50,640
 And not only that, he goes, "Early on when I'd have these dreams, she would pull out

459
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,480
 a clipping from a magazine."

460
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,440
 Say this is the car I want, Erin.

461
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,000
 But over the years, she stopped pulling out the magazine clipping.

462
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,480
 In later dreams, they would be over at his house or her house hanging out in the living

463
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,120
 room, and she'd be like, "Oh my God, you have to see a photograph of this pink Corvette.

464
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,560
 I want it so much, baby.

465
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,680
 I want it so much."

466
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,880
 She'd go to the computer and look it up online and point to the monitor.

467
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
 "See, baby?

468
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,520
 This is the one I want.

469
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,360
 I'll get that and so much more, Lisa."

470
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:33,760
 As the dreams marched on, Lisa began looking it up on her tablet, scrolling through all

471
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,640
 the different photographs until she found just the right one.

472
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:44,880
 And now in the most recent dreams, she's pulling out a smartphone, thumb texting it into the

473
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:55,000
 search engine, showing him a brand new 2022 pink Corvette.

474
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,720
 The technology changes as time marches on.

475
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,240
 This is my take on this.

476
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,840
 This is my take on this.

477
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,440
 What I believe is that, I actually believe this story could totally be made up.

478
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,200
 Every story we've ever covered could totally be made up from Crash It!

479
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,400
 Or as well to this.

480
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,160
 That's just something that you encounter when it comes to paranormal stuff.

481
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
 This could all be made up.

482
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,360
 Technically, every story is creepypasta.

483
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,800
 Just some of it was published in books in the 1940s.

484
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,120
 But it's still creepypasta.

485
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,120
 It's still one person's account or maybe three person's account or one person saying what

486
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,160
 three people told them on their deathbed and da da da da da.

487
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,240
 Everything can be painted with this could be true or not.

488
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,480
 And I never like to really gloss over that.

489
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,440
 Because that's just the fact of the matter.

490
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,840
 It doesn't mean it's not fun to look at this stuff, but we just have to acknowledge that.

491
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:53,440
 I think when we fail to acknowledge that, I think that's not a good look for us.

492
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,840
 But anyway, as paranormal research.

493
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,600
 But anyways, this is my take on this.

494
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,280
 Put on a conspiracy cap and get ready to wrap up this week.

495
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,480
 I think Lisa's probably still alive.

496
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,400
 And I think although Aaron never met Lisa, Lisa knew Aaron.

497
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:20,400
 I've learned in my life, it's a weird quirk that men often feel lonely.

498
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,280
 Men tend to feel really, really alone.

499
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,920
 And there's always a woman watching from the bushes.

500
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,520
 Literally or figuratively.

501
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,520
 Right.

502
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,040
 I've met men who are very lonely.

503
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,620
 And then you find out that there's, they got some weird secret admirer.

504
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,320
 Some girl who's just absolutely fascinated by them.

505
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,920
 Now is this 100%?

506
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,420
 No.

507
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,760
 But it's happened more often than not.

508
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,960
 It's happened more often that I have seen a pattern.

509
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,360
 People who are really lonely looking for a relationship, maybe look in the bushes.

510
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,800
 And you'll find that person.

511
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,640
 So it's possible.

512
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
 Aaron described himself as a loner in high school.

513
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,400
 He didn't have a lot of friends.

514
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,720
 He definitely didn't have a girlfriend in high school.

515
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,840
 Lisa may have been noticing him.

516
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,460
 Maybe around town, maybe not necessarily at high school.

517
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,780
 But she may have noticed him and something may have stuck in her head with him.

518
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,900
 She was deeply attracted to him.

519
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,500
 Sometimes it's just the way you smell.

520
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,860
 You give up this weird pheromone and you gotta like take a broom to work to keep women back.

521
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,220
 It's the weirdest thing in the world.

522
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,780
 But that's possible.

523
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,340
 I think that Lisa knew Aaron, but Aaron didn't know Lisa.

524
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,460
 He was the brooding lonely boy walking through the neighborhood one day.

525
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,640
 And Lisa was just totally enamored by this guy.

526
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,440
 And I think, and I kind of gave this away in the intro, I think she cast a love spell

527
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,640
 on him.

528
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,920
 I think she cast a love spell on him so powerful she didn't even understand the ramifications

529
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
 of what she was doing.

530
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,120
 A love spell.

531
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,400
 An unfulfilled love spell from a young hormonal witch.

532
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,160
 She may not even know when she was a witch.

533
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,200
 You know how much power you would have to generate.

534
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,880
 Like there are people who write books on magic who could not cast a love spell that lasted

535
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,960
 20 years.

536
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
 That's what I think happened.

537
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,800
 I think that she definitely had some untapped reservoir of power and she utilized it and

538
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,440
 she cast an adolescent love spell on this young man.

539
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,280
 And the reason why I don't think she's dead is that I think the love spell would have

540
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
 dissipated by now.

541
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,360
 I think she's still alive.

542
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:38,800
 I don't know if she's still pining for Eren, but the love spell is still active.

543
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,280
 She may be married and have kids and getting ready to go to college right now.

544
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
 Who knows?

545
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,840
 But whatever she did to Eren is still around.

546
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,240
 And it could be around for another decade, two decades.

547
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:58,080
 It could be the last dream he has the night before he dies is of Lisa showing him a photograph

548
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,200
 of a pink corvette.

549
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,640
 A love spell so powerful it's lasted two decades.

550
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,560
 Cast by a woman who Eren has never seen before.

551
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,760
 And when he does finally find proof that this woman exists, he can't find proof that the

552
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,400
 woman still exists.

553
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,000
 Possible the story is completely made up.

554
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,920
 Possible that I'm off with the magic spell thing.

555
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,840
 Possible that magic isn't the answer to this one.

556
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,840
 But what an amazing, I love this story.

557
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,840
 I love this story because people do weird things when they're in love.

558
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,120
 And young love is super dangerous.

559
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,160
 Young love is when two people fall in love so much that they murder the girl's parents

560
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,960
 and then go rob six gas stations until they have a shootout with the police.

561
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,040
 That's young love.

562
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,560
 Very rarely see people in their 40s doing that.

563
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:04,400
 It happens, but it's far, far more rare.

564
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,720
 But a love spell.

565
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,240
 A love spell cast by someone you never even met.

566
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,800
 And for Eren is there any relief for this?

567
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,280
 Can he stop it?

568
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,920
 I mean it's possible he could get some spiritual guidance, talk to a minister, a rabbi, cleric,

569
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:27,720
 whatever religion you belong to, and get some advice.

570
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,400
 Try to get it cleansed off of you.

571
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,600
 Or you could just live with it, right?

572
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,480
 Now that you know that this woman exists and you might have some idea that she cast some

573
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,280
 sort of love spell, you just roll with it, right?

574
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,760
 I don't necessarily think it's the greatest blender of your life, Eren.

575
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,880
 I think that it may never have meant to be.

576
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,960
 It may have been a love spell and it's just continuing to activate in your mind.

577
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,080
 I mean I get it, like that's not super calming.

578
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,520
 You still have to go to this paradise once a week, but I mean a lot of people don't get

579
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,880
 paradise ever.

580
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,480
 You know, maybe savor those dreams.

581
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,960
 But I think the worst possible ending to this story, and of course that's the way I want

582
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:16,080
 to wrap it up, is I imagine that Eren is finally able to track down Lisa.

583
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,960
 Finds out where she lives.

584
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,480
 Now of course once he had that information he would spend another two weeks, two months,

585
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,840
 two years maybe, trying to work up the guts to contact her.

586
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:37,000
 To contact the woman he's seen every week in his dreams.

587
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,880
 A pure perfect love.

588
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,840
 And it's possible that Eren is in the position now where he goes out and he buys that brand

589
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:54,800
 new pink Corvette and drives it up to Elizabeth Martinez's house.

590
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,040
 He jumps out dressed in a suit.

591
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,760
 He looks like he just walked off the runway.

592
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,440
 And Eren is walking up the driveway to this house.

593
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:12,000
 And he knocks on that door and the door opens up and there stands Elizabeth Martinez.

594
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:22,120
 20 years older but still as beautiful as the woman of his dreams.

595
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:31,080
 And while Eren is standing there looking at this perfect angel, his heart rapidly beating

596
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,560
 against this chest.

597
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:40,800
 He steps aside so she can see the pink Corvette, puts his hand out to shake hers and says,

598
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,560
 "Hi, I'm Eren."

599
00:36:47,560 --> 00:37:01,400
 And she looks at him and says, "Who?"

600
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,040
 DeadRabbitRadio.com is going to be her email address.

 TikTok is at DeadRabbitRadio.

603
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,040

 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listen to it today.

605
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
 Have a great weekend guys.

606
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:40,400
 Bye.

607
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,980
 (upbeat music)
