1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 What would you do if you woke up one day and realized you were actually a chicken?

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:14,160
 And it would take a look at the story of a mother and son who both had experiences with aliens.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,960
 What happens when those that should be sworn to protect you

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,840
 are part of the conspiracy against you today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:35,840
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having an awesome

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,800
 day whatever you do. First off let's give a shout out to one of our longtime supporters of the show

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,880
 Stuart Meatball. Stuart everyone give a round of applause to that big ol' saucy fella over there.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,760
 Big ol' Meatball rolling around. Stuart you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,080
 You can't support the Patreon. I totally understand. Just help get the word out about the show.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,920
 Really really helps out a lot. We all gotta get together. Everyone put a shoulder in it.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,040
 We're gonna squeeze this big ol' slimy Meatball into the Dead Rabbit Rowboat.

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,120
 It's just slopping in there. We're gonna sail across the sea of cheese. Oh god.

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,000
 I remember when I was in high school every so often. It was like every day. There's someone

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 who was wearing that Primus shirt sailing in the sea of cheese. And I remember just thinking,

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,760
 I don't know who Primus is, but I don't ever want to listen to him because that shirt,

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,280
 it wasn't funny. Primus might be a good band, I don't know. Aren't they a jam band? Aren't they like

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,520
 fish or muck or slump or something like that? They just sit and they play instruments. They have

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,680
 two songs on each album. Each album is three hours long. I think it's a jam band. But anyways,

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,600
 I could be wrong. I've never listened to a Primus song unless I think they did it

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,840
 at the theme song for like King of the Hill or something like that. I don't know. That's how

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,360
 limited. I just remember they have that. Anyways, there's a big ol' Meatball sitting in the boat,

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,960
 struggling his shoulders. Stuart, you just kind of hang on. We are gonna row you over across the

24
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,960
 sea of cheese to Belgium. So we're rowing this boat. We finally get to it. While I'm sure one of

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,640
 you spent the whole boat ride being like, "No, dude, you gotta listen to these four songs and then

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,080
 listen to this Primus album." And then, "Ugh, what did I even bring it up anyways?" I pulled the

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
 cotton balls out of my ear. I was like, "Oh, that was a really good song, bro." We hopped out of the

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,400
 Dead Rabbit Row boat. We're rowing Stuart around. We're headed to Belgium. Now, this story, we have

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,240
 no date. We have no name. But not because it's fake. It's because it's medical records. They don't

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,280
 usually give that stuff out. But we're in Belgium and there is a married woman. She's 54. It is

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,560
 fairly recent. Probably like in 2015, 2012, around there, maybe even a little bit later.

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,360
 There's a Belgian woman. Let's call her Barbara. Barbara is mourning the loss of a loved one.

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,080
 She's married. She's 54 years old. She has a lot of stuff going for her. She has a regular job. She

34
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,160
 works at a pharmacy, which is a good place to be if you're depressed. Because basically, you're

35
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,920
 like, "Oh, I'm so depressed. If only there was something to help me." She's leaning on the giant

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,200
 bottle as Annex. Don't do that. By the way, if you work at a pharmacy, you get drug tested all the

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,440
 time. She's in the Throws of Depression. Her whole family is in the Throws of Depression. There's a

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,960
 lot of people who really miss this loved one. One day, Barbara's brother shows up to her house.

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,600
 "Hey, Barbara. You still depressed? I'm still depressed. I'm in the ghetto. That's Annex."

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,520
 And no one answers the door. So the brother opens the door.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,480
 "Hello? Hello? Hello? Is anyone in here? Anyone in here?" "Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!"

42
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,760
 He hears and he goes, "That's weird. First off, we don't have a chicken. I know my sister doesn't

43
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,760
 have a chicken. Secondly, that sounds like my sister imitating a chicken. Bark! Bark! Bark!

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,080
 Bark! Bark! Bark!" And he's walking into the house. It's all spooky. The lights are all flickering.

45
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,080
 Shadow men are fluttering off the wall. He's like, "Oh, I've got to stop taking all those drugs."

46
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,000
 My sister gives me-- he walks into a room and he sees his sister there. Light swinging. There's a

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,080
 light on a rope swinging to make it all dramatic. She's sitting there and she's like, "Bark! Bark!

48
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,800
 Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!" And she's walking around like a chicken does and she's blowing her

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,400
 cheeks like a chicken does, apparently. That was one of the things he said. She was blowing her

50
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,080
 cheeks. I don't even know how she was doing that. I've never seen-- the chickens even have cheeks.

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,600
 Anyways, she was crowing and cawing and balking like a chicken. Now, there's very limited things

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,440
 you can do in this scenario. You can find a giant deep fryer and have a delicious chicken meal,

53
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,600
 or if you're not disgusting cannibal, your only other option is to call the police. So the police

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
 show up with a big old chicken net. They're like, "Oh man, we thought it was actually a giant chicken

55
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,320
 in there." They show up. They take her to the hospital and she's walking around the hospital

56
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,720
 going, "Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!" I just realized how good I am doing chicken noises.

57
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,640
 I should do more chicken related stories, chicken conspiracies. "Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!"

58
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,640
 The doctors-- the doctors putting cotton in his ears is like, "Ah, it's going to be a long night."

59
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,920
 The doctors are like, "So what's going on with you, chicken lady?" And she goes-- she apparently

60
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,400
 could talk because she was able to communicate this with the doctor. She goes, "Well, it's because I'm

61
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,880
 a chicken. That's why." "Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark!" And they're like, "Well, you're obviously not a

62
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,360
 chicken. Look at your legs." And she looks down and she goes, "But I feel my legs, our chicken legs.

63
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,280
 I feel that they're different now." Then she has a seizure and falls down. She comes out of the

64
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,080
 seizure and she goes, "Whoa! Whoa! Wait a second. Why am I in the hospital?" And the doctor's like,

65
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,560
 "You don't remember anything?" And she's like, "No, I remember being at my house. And now I'm here.

66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,000
 What happened?" And the brother's like, "You thought you were a chicken?" She's like, "What?" And he's

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,840
 like, "Yeah, I'm sure they videotaped this, right?" Because listen, dude, siblings-- I love all of my

68
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,160
 siblings, all of my step-siblings, all of them, to death. But if one of them started acting like a

69
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,160
 chicken, I'm recording it. I'm like, "Oh, man, it feels super bad. I hope this isn't permanent."

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,880
 As my eyes go from side to side, I would totally put them in some side show. I'd have a one chicken

71
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,360
 side show. But no, I would record it and I'd feel really bad. I'd feel really bad if they were a

72
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,600
 chicken in the moment. And then once they got better, I would just put it on Facebook every

73
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,440
 single day. "Hey, bro, remember when you turned into a chicken?" They don't do that. Apparently they

74
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,000
 have a bit more restraint in Belgium. But they do say it used to be a chicken. Now, well, not that

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,640
 she was a chicken. That's a totally different story, that she thought she was a chicken. And she

76
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,800
 is super embarrassed by this whole thing. She doesn't remember it, but when the police and the

77
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,320
 doctors and your brother, who's probably still laughing and pointing at you, said you were a

78
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,920
 chicken, you were like, "Oh, I don't remember it, but obviously I was a chicken or thought I was a

79
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,320
 chicken." And she's super embarrassed by the whole thing. What she suffered from is an incredibly rare

80
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,680
 mental disease, mental defect, called clinical zoanthropy. You have lycanthropy, where people

81
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,600
 believe that they're werewolves. And that's pretty rare too, but this one's even more rare. It's

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,160
 specifically, you believe you're one of the lower animals. So you're not like a cool werewolf or

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,920
 man bat. You're just a dumb old regular animal. There's only been 56 cases of this between 1850

84
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,680
 and 2012. It's extremely rare, and it's so rare they can't really do much research on it. It can

85
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,840
 last an hour or it can go on for decades. So unless you're lucky enough to be a scientist walking

86
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,800
 through a village, it usually happens in rural areas or less developed areas. It's very rare to

87
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,600
 stumble across these things. Here are some of the examples. So the obvious ones would be a dog and a

88
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,120
 cat. So people have thought they were dogs and cats. And again, not like furry, not like werewolf,

89
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,800
 they're a dumb dog. They're like a beagle or something like that. Then you have, so whatever,

90
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,440
 like dudes a dog, dudes a cat, that's kind of cool. But you kind of expect that. Then these are the

91
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,400
 guys that are dope. Listen to this. There have been cases where people have thought they were lions.

92
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,160
 Ah, dude, could you imagine running into that guy in like a dark alley, some naked dude on all fours?

93
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,400
 Actually, lions just kind of sat there, right? And then they'd have you're like, oh, look at that,

94
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,800
 that naked guy just sitting on that rock. He must think he's a lion. And then you have his lionesses,

95
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,560
 bunch of naked women crawling up behind you. That's actually, that's actually kind of sexy. So that

96
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,040
 wouldn't be too bad. You turn around, you're like, oh, lions, tigers, be kind of spooky,

97
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:39,200
 a guy's stalking you. Rhinoceros. How did that guy figure out he wasn't a rhinoceros? He's all

98
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,600
 running in this stuff. His brain is slowly leaking out of his head. It would be very quickly

99
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,320
 disproven that you were a rhinoceros. When you ran headfirst into a car and you thought, why didn't

100
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,840
 the car flip over? A wild boar? It's pretty dope. Not as cool as a rhino. And then a horse, again,

101
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,240
 that's kind of dumb, right? Because horses don't do anything. Horses are only useful if you're like

102
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,400
 on them. You just see a horse walking around your neighborhood. You're like, oh, that's

103
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,040
 lame. You can't even drink its milk. Speaking of that, people have thought they were cows.

104
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,240
 Here's some of one. So you could, if you saw a guy walking around, this is basically just me

105
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,320
 listing stuff off now, but I love this list. If you saw a guy walking around and you're like,

106
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,880
 hey, dude, what are you doing? He's like, row. You're like, oh, you're a lion. Don't encourage,

107
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,040
 don't encourage their beliefs. You shouldn't be like, yes, you're a good lion. Oh, you're scratching

108
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,760
 behind the ears. That's fine though. I mean, it's not, it's mental illness, but like, you can

109
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,400
 understand that. Oh, the guy thinks he's a wild boar. Guy thinks he's a rhinoceros. You're just

110
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,120
 putting up barricades for him to run through. Shark. How do you go, how do you think you're

111
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,400
 a shark? Because obviously you're just sitting in your living room. You're not, if in salt water,

112
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,720
 you're not like 300 feet below surface level, you're just sitting in your living room and you go,

113
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,000
 oh my, what? What? I'm a shark. Like you're immediate, then you should go, oh no, I'm gonna

114
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,920
 tie if I stop moving so you're like running around your apartment the whole time. And then you go,

115
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,320
 oh wait, I need water. So then you like are just swimming the whole time. That'd be really hard.

116
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,160
 And so what this does actually, let me explain a little bit of the science behind this before I

117
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,800
 finish my list. You've noticed when they've done studies with people with lycanthropy,

118
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,400
 that because they believe it's related to this clinical, uh, zoonotherapy, and they both, they

119
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,160
 believe both of them have a tie to schizophrenia, but what happens is the part of the brain that

120
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,600
 misfires, or one of the parts, is the ability, it's a sensory perception. So let's say you're

121
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,200
 hallucinating though, when you look down, you see you have a shark body. When you'd go to get up,

122
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
 you'd be moving on both legs. You wouldn't be like hopping around. The other thing, this is really

123
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,080
 creepy. The other thing this affects in the brain, we have a thing in our brain called pro-priception,

124
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:56,080
 pro-priception. It's our brain telling us where our muscles connect to our body. So we know intrinsically

125
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,760
 our thighs are connected to our hip bone and our hip bones connect to our rib cage. They're not.

126
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,960
 Don't, don't use that during an anatomy test. I'm missing a bunch of steps, but our brain knows

127
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,280
 how our body is supposed to be. This one, your brain actually goes, "Oh no bro, like you see two

128
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:21,520
 legs and it will make your body and your brain merge those two legs into shark fins." Your brain,

129
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,640
 not only will you look down and see yourself as a shark, your brain will rewire itself to tell you

130
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,920
 that you don't have two legs. Even if you look down and saw two legs, your brain is telling you

131
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,880
 that's an, that's the fake illusion. You're actually a shark. You're hallucinating that you're human,

132
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,840
 because it's not letting you put together those pieces. Terrifying disease. Let's go back to this

133
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,640
 list though. So shark, crocodile, that's pretty dope, right? You're just sitting in this pool with

134
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,520
 your mouth wide open. Birds are, birds are cleaning your teeth. You're like, "Oh, this isn't too bad."

135
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,720
 Frog, it's a little bit lame-er, right? You just kind of hang out. Frogs are, again,

136
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,640
 are, they're cute to look at, some of them and stuff like that. But I mean, what do you do?

137
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,760
 You just look at them. You can't drink their milk. So very pretty useless. Snake would be hilarious

138
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,120
 to watch a guy slither around. You're like, "Hey, Ernie, how you doing?" Until Ernie starts to

139
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,680
 constrict you. He's not wrapping around your body. He's just using his hands to strangle you out.

140
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,640
 So those are all pretty good, right? But then we have these. Goose, rabbit, which would just be a,

141
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,640
 basically just a horny dude hopping around. A gerbil. So you just like sit there. Again,

142
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,600
 some of these are useless. Like, could you imagine turning into a gerbil and then your roomies turning

143
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,240
 into a rhino? You're like, "Oh man, why didn't I get that mutagen on me?" You turn into a little

144
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,840
 gerbil. The funniest, though. The funniest one that you could possibly turn into out of all of these.

145
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,640
 We've covered the basic animals, dogs, cats, sharks, lions, hyenas. There is at least one

146
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:59,280
 unfortunate soul out there who thought he was a bumblebee. First off, did he imagine himself as a

147
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,720
 six-foot-tall bumblebee? Like, did he, was his brain so distorted? Was the wiring so distorted

148
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,760
 that he imagined himself as a little two-inch bee? Also, again, that'd be super easy to disprove.

149
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,280
 Like, you're sitting in a chair. You're not hovering. You have a lifespan of over two days.

150
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,400
 You can't sting people. You might eat a bunch of honey. That might be the trade-off. You're like,

151
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,120
 and then you're like, "Am I a bumblebee or am I poo-bear? I don't know. I just really like this

152
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,560
 honey." But I'm wondering, did he think like, when they took this guy to the doctor, were they like,

153
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,280
 first off, how did they know? Was he just sitting there going, because this woman was balking. This

154
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,280
 woman was a chicken, right? Was he sitting there going, "Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

155
00:13:37,280 --> 00:14:07,280
 woman was a chicken, right? Was he sitting there going, "Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

156
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:36,160
 bumblebee just flies out of the net. So that is the list of people who have this. It's super, super rare, but it does happen. If you do happen to find yourself going insane, think of the best animal. If you have a little bit of rational thought left, you could call up the hospital and say, "Guys, I think I'm going insane." And they come and they help you. Or you could just go, "Rino, rhino." But the animal works, rhino. You turn into a rhino. You're knocking stuff over. I don't recommend doing that.

157
00:14:37,120 --> 00:15:01,680
 As much fun as I would have watching a human think he was a rhino. He's knocking stuff over. It would be hilarious. Don't, if you find yourself going insane, call somebody. But if you're middle of nowhere, you don't have a phone, just go with it. Because best case scenarios for about an hour or two, you'll be a rhino. You'll be knocking stuff over. Worst case scenario, you'll be doing the same thing, but it'll be over the course of several decades.

158
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:27,840
 I also, when I was researching this, I found it interesting, tie into current conspiracies. And this is to show you that nothing ever changes. Nothing ever changes. Back when they came out with the smallpox vaccine, they used cowpox. They used some cow disease called cowpox to help make the smallpox vaccine. And so they're like, "Hey, you know that disease that's killing everyone? We got a shot for it and people were refusing to take the vaccine."

159
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:57,040
 Because they thought it would turn them into a cow. Because they knew it was derived from cow germs. So people were like, "No, if I get that shot, I'm going to turn into a cow." And doctors like, "That's... If that was the case, I would be taking this shot." Because cow, it'd be cool to just run around people drinking my milk all the time. But they don't always have the most happy ending. They usually end up in a happy meal. But it's not going to turn into a cow. And people said, "No, no, no, I won't take it because it's going to turn me into a cow."

160
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,040
 So these conspiracy theories that are around today are hundreds of years old. I think that's what's so fascinating.

161
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:22,320
 Steward Meatball, let's roll you into the carpenter copter, get you into that cockpit. We are leaving behind this island of Dr. Moreau. We saw these people. They're like, "Ahhh, bunch of rhinos. Imagine everyone else." We're leaving them behind. We're headed out to Imnaha, Oregon. It's July 1, 1976.

162
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,720
 Helicopter is flying over this remote part of Oregon. It's far. It's like on the eastern border of Idaho.

163
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:43,280
 We're going to meet a woman. We don't have her name. She's telling the story, but let's call her Margaret. We're going to meet this woman named Margaret. She's living there with her family.

164
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:52,480
 Now, apparently they own some sort of ranch land because they have a barn. They have a house. They have an old sawmill. So that might have just been off their property.

165
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:00,720
 But it's a nice time for a family outing. So Margaret, her husband, and her daughter go out to the sawmill to do the good old...

166
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,920
 Good old... This is a great transition. I didn't realize these were related. The good old family activity of castrating horses.

167
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,920
 So they would take them into the sawmill. They'd use a giant bus saw. He's like, "This is the most efficient way to do it."

168
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,360
 The horses are on a conveyor belt. Sorry for that visual image. He's out there. He's castrating horses.

169
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,600
 There's a guy who thinks these are horses. He's like, "Oh, please wake up. Please wake up. Please wake up."

170
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,560
 And apparently the farmer's blind. He doesn't realize it's just the guy walking on all fours.

171
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,200
 "Time to put your shoes on. No!"

172
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,440
 Anyways, one of the ropes break and they need several ropes to tie these horses down to castrate them.

173
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,480
 I don't think there's been enough ropes you could have. So he goes, "Hey, Margaret, can you go back to the old farm

174
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,520
 to get some more ropes?" Because these horses do not like having their balls dropped off. And Margaret's like, "Yeah, sure." And she brings her

175
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,080
 13 year old daughter with her.

176
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,320
 Why they had her at

177
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
 at the Castration Castle in the first place? I don't know, but

178
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,040
 Margaret and 13 year old daughter are walking and the

179
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,240
 farm is about a quarter mile away. They're walking to the farm and then there's this area

180
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,960
 like this grassy field. And Margaret stops and she sees this

181
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,520
 shiny oval object just sitting in the grass.

182
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,520
 Now it's not like the size of a rock. It's sizable. It's a basically it's a UFO.

183
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,200
 And she stops dead in her tracks. She points to her daughter. What is that? Look at that.

184
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,440
 The daughter's looking and she goes, "Yeah, whatever." And just keeps on walking.

185
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,880
 Let's put a little pin in that because I think that's interesting behavior.

186
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,800
 I think that'll play part in what happens later, but the daughter keeps leaving and

187
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,920
 the mother is standing there and she starts to kind of get these feelings.

188
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,360
 She goes in this area like it wasn't middle of nowhere, but there were a lot of power lines

189
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,600
 that were crisscrossing this area. She said, "I felt like the object was actually absorbing electricity from these power lines."

190
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,360
 Then she gets a telepath that command in her head.

191
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,600
 "You need to come here." She hears.

192
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,320
 She replies by thinking, "I can't. They're waiting for me."

193
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,560
 In reference to her family, especially her husband, who's back at a sawmill with a bunch of rampaging

194
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,800
 stallions because they don't have enough ropes to tie them down. Next thing she knows,

195
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,800
 she's standing outside the sawmill. She doesn't have any idea how she got there.

196
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,520
 And her husband comes out and been like, "Dude, where have you been, man? Where's my ropey as a giant?"

197
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,040
 Big old horse shoe shape lump on his head. He's like, "Where have you been? You've been gone forever.

198
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:38,480
 Where's my rope?" And she is kind of dazed and she goes, "Uh, I don't know where I've been.

199
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,480
 I don't know where the rope's at." She's instantly flooded with these memories of being a child,

200
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,600
 walking down the hallway to her bedroom and seeing dark silhouettes peeking out from behind the corner.

201
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,200
 Of waking up in bed, completely paralyzed, of floating out the window.

202
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,000
 She then goes on to say that her life got pretty weird after this.

203
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,600
 And she says, quote, "Some experiences I wonder were they real or dreams."

204
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,040
 She talks about one day walking through Hell's Canyon, Oregon.

205
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,600
 And she sees laying on the ground there a little what she described as a half-human,

206
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,520
 half-alien hybrid. It's curled up in the fetal position. She said it had like gray skin,

207
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,560
 like an alien, but looked oddly human at the same time. She says, "I don't remember picking it up

208
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:35,840
 specifically, but I do remember being told telepathically that I needed to pick it up."

209
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,400
 She said that the aliens' children weren't thriving, especially these hybrids. They weren't

210
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:48,240
 thriving because they lived in a such logical cerebral world that human love and affection and

211
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,360
 cuddling a baby just to have a baby close to you is not something they do. It wouldn't

212
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,240
 be efficient. A lot of times humans just hold babies for no reason, because they want to hold

213
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,000
 a baby and the baby wants to be held. Aliens, that's alien to them. So they left this little

214
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,320
 hybrid on the trail, knowing she would find it and asking her to pick it up. She says, quote,

215
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:17,680
 "Oh, the stories could go on and on," unquote. So she's had several encounters with these creatures.

216
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,800
 That was just one she decided to share. At one point she has another child, a son.

217
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,320
 And when he was three years old, her son started to tell her about problems he was having.

218
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:35,280
 "Mommy, mommy," barely he's three inches tall. Three-year-old goes, "Mom, mom,

219
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:42,000
 there's something in my closet." That's common. You know, kids are afraid of what's hidden in their

220
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,920
 room. But when he describes these things as "lil white men," her ears perk up. Sometimes he would

221
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,200
 wake up and find droplets of blood on his pillow, wipe away blood from his nose and realize,

222
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,240
 in the middle of the night, he got a nosebleed. He talks about dreams, where his bedroom window

223
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:10,400
 opens up and he sees a gray alien crawling into his bedroom. These are horrific visions even

224
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,000
 for an adult. Before a three-year-old kid, they're absolutely terrifying. There's no context for any

225
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,880
 of this stuff. Here's another quote from her. "He was very afraid of them. As he grew up,

226
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,400
 he would dream of things before they happened. Car accidents, deaths. He and I talked in length.

227
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:36,080
 Agreed aliens are very prominent in our thinking. Always vigilant, always looking, and a little on

228
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:44,000
 edge." When he turns 23, when this young man turns 23, he can't take it anymore. The mother

229
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,720
 realizes he's starting to get agitated. The pressure is getting to be too much. He's no longer

230
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,960
 seeing into the future, which again is terrifying in and of itself, but beginning to have strange

231
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,080
 visions. And some nights, he wouldn't sleep. Some nights, he would just stare up at the night sky,

232
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,480
 looking for something. The boy began to complain to his mother that he couldn't do what the aliens

233
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:18,000
 wanted him to do. What are they telling you, son? He says that the aliens were telling him

234
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,400
 that he was going to save humanity. He was going to be the one to save the world from destruction.

235
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:35,280
 Truly a chosen one, at age 23, being given the responsibility to save billions of human lives.

236
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:43,600
 They wanted him to join them. The aliens wanted him by their side to go on this galactic mission

237
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:52,480
 to save Homo sapiens. He just wanted to be left alone. For 20 years, he's been having this interaction

238
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,440
 with these aliens. It's enough. He's just one normal life. He starts to beg his mother for help,

239
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,080
 because he knows that she also is in contact with these aliens. All these years they've been

240
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,320
 having these conversations, they've been able to bond over this. "Mom, I know that the aliens talk to

241
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,760
 you too, and you can talk to the aliens. Tell them to stop. Tell them to stop. I don't want to be the

242
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,440
 savior of humanity. They've got to pick someone else. I can't do this, mom. Please, tell them to stop."

243
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,960
 But she didn't. Or she wouldn't. Or she couldn't. We don't know. It's her side of the story, obviously.

244
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,440
 So the sun begins to change tactics. He doesn't want to be the savior of humanity.

245
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,520
 So if his mother's not going to help him stop this, his mother is part of the problem.

246
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:51,440
 He begins to refer to his mother as the leader of the aliens. That she has to be working for them

247
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,560
 if she won't help him work against them. "Mom, we can both communicate with these things.

248
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,840
 And if you're not trying to get this to stop, you're part of the problem."

249
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,240
 One day, according to her, he traps her in her bedroom, which, given the context of what I'm

250
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,720
 about to say, I'm assuming, I don't think he had like some home alone trap that she's hanging up by

251
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,160
 her feet from a rope. I think that he cornered her in the bedroom so she can't get out. It wasn't

252
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,320
 like he imprisoned her on purpose. He was following her and that's where she went to hide.

253
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,200
 Because what's happening is she's in her bedroom on the other side of the door. Her adult son is

254
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,640
 saying, "I have to kill you, mom. I have to kill you. This has to end. You're the leader. This has

255
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,400
 to end." And she's hiding in her bedroom as her son is banging on the door. He begins accusing her

256
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,320
 that she has been taken over by the aliens. She is a collaborator. She is the queen of them. And

257
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,520
 she can control them. She's not doing it. They're making him suffer. They've made him suffer all

258
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:59,440
 of his life. And mom, I am coming through this door. He does. He breaks down the door. He pulls out a

259
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,320
 15-inch carving knife and stabs her. Now, she survives, obviously. She's telling this story.

260
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,000
 And even though the knife was—that actually was the most unbelievable part of the story in a sense,

261
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,440
 because I was like, "15 inches, dude. That was straight ski. Are you—?" Assuming this story's

262
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,080
 true. We always have to say that. This is her story. She reported this to Move On, the mutual

263
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,200
 UFO network. But he stabs her with the knife. Listen to this next sentence. Listen to how she

264
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,520
 wrote this out. "He just wanted to be left alone. His distrust became so intense that one day he

265
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,880
 trapped me in my bedroom. Told me he had to kill me, that they had taken over my mind and body,

266
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,680
 called me the queen. He stabbed me in the chest by burying a 15-inch carving knife. He then committed

267
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,200
 suicide. I know you think I'm nuts, but I think the aliens harassed my sons at the point of death.

268
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:59,440
 This is just some of what we've encountered." That is so bizarre that her sons act—not

269
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,240
 of stabbing her. There's more. This—we're gonna get psychological here for a second. She spends

270
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:12,000
 more words explaining how she got stabbed. And he then committed suicide. That is almost like

271
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,320
 an afterthought in her writing. "Oh yeah, yeah, and then he committed suicide. And then I'm just

272
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,280
 gonna keep on talking." I don't need her to go in detail. Like, he loaded the shells in the shotgun

273
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,840
 that he bought at Walmart. I don't need the gory details, but the fact that she goes—she

274
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,360
 spends quite a lot of words—again, this is psychological reading—but she spends a lot of

275
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,560
 words describing the knife that penetrates her own body in fairly graphic detail, burying the 15-inch

276
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:43,120
 carving knife, versus, "Oh yeah, then he committed suicide." I think that that's a fascinating

277
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:51,200
 end to a bizarre psychological tale. Now, if this story is completely made up, this woman is nuts,

278
00:27:51,200 --> 00:28:01,200
 because this story makes her out to be a lunatic. Basically, her son from age three was complaining

279
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,720
 about—actually, let's start off here with the sister, because I said I was gonna talk about that

280
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,240
 later. When she sees the UFO sitting in the field and the sister just keeps on going, there's two

281
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,200
 ways we can read that situation. And honestly, in most ways that I would read that situation.

282
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,920
 So we've talked about this before, of aliens sending other people away so they can have contact

283
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,880
 with the person that they want. We've covered that before. The lumberjack who found the injured

284
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,960
 alien—two of the lumberjacks just walked away, and the third lumberjack thought that was weird.

285
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,840
 He goes, "It was almost like they were commanded to leave." We've seen incidences in the past where

286
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,280
 people have just excused themselves from the situation, and the implication is the aliens

287
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,240
 telepathically moved them away. In the context of this story, I think the daughter was like, not

288
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,320
 this again. There's a mirage, there's like a little pond, and the sunlight shining off of it,

289
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,920
 and my mom, who always believes in UFOs, thinks it's some big old spaceship, and she leaves because

290
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:02,080
 she knows her mom is a wackadoodle. In any other context, I would read it, "Oh, maybe the aliens

291
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,200
 made the girl leave because she wasn't supposed to be contact." In this context, from the rest of her

292
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,120
 story, it makes me think the daughter just didn't want to deal with it anymore. The fact that the

293
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,440
 husband and the daughter completely disappear from the narrative, I find very telling as well.

294
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,000
 I think what's most tragic about this story is, again, if it's true, you have a young boy who's

295
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,600
 tormented, either by aliens or mental illness, or both. And his mom is feeding into that. It's the

296
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,080
 same thing like, you remember when you were kids, you thought there was a boogeyman in your closet,

297
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,160
 there was a monster under your bed, what if your parents came in and said, "Yeah, the boogeyman may

298
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,880
 be in your closet." He's actually real. And not in any way to punish you to get you to go to bed

299
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,200
 telling you the boogeyman might get you, like, a little legit telling you, when you're three years

300
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,680
 old and saying, "I think the boogeyman's in my closet," your dad sits you down and goes, "Let me

301
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:58,400
 tell you about my experiences with the boogeyman." And starts telling this bizarre mythology about

302
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,320
 how once you picked up the boogeyman's hybrid baby, children come to parents for support and

303
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,360
 comfort. And she's feeding into this thing. Now, I believe in aliens, right? I believe that there's

304
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,680
 possibility of aliens in all of these encounters. It may or may not be true. You'd kind of have to

305
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,880
 take them as is. But if I, and I've actually talked about this before too, if I met somebody who said

306
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:29,120
 there were aliens hiding out in their house, I would be concerned. I would be concerned. If someone

307
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,400
 told me their apartment was haunted, I would be like, "Oh, that's kind of spooky. Can I spend the night?"

308
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,080
 Someone told me they had aliens hunting them and stuff like that. And I know people who have had

309
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,720
 alien induction encounters. So again, you take it case by case basis. But someone just said, "I think

310
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,640
 aliens are in my closet," and things like that. And they're giving me visions. They're telling me

311
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,880
 that I'm going to save humanity. I guess that's the difference. I've had friends who have had

312
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,200
 encounters with aliens, and I don't poo poo that. I take them because I know them as people, as humans.

313
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,680
 I take them at their word. But once they start talking about stuff that kind of falls into the

314
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:10,400
 realm of delusions of grandeur or paranoia, they're all out to get me. That's when you start to get,

315
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,680
 I think that's the difference here. Someone told me that their apartment was haunted. I would be like,

316
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,720
 "Can I spend the night?" Again, I'm coming over. "I'm spending the night, bro. You can't stop me."

317
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,480
 But if they started telling me that they see the ghost and they're following them around,

318
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,840
 and the ghost are whispering in their ear, "You have a great plan to do. You have to go do this

319
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,320
 thing. You're going to be the one to save." Then I would be concerned. They're hearing voices. They

320
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,920
 can't stop it. They're getting these delusions. That would make me more concerned than just the

321
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,240
 aliens hanging out of their apartment. Again, I would want to spend the night there, too. But

322
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,240
 I just don't have a place to stay right now, guys. Please take me in.

323
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,400
 But you know what I mean? When you turn to your parents and this guy was in

324
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,840
 distress, whether or not the story was whether or not he actually was seeing aliens or having

325
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,720
 some sort of mental breakdown, he was in distress. The issue was that his mother believed in that

326
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,840
 as well. I think for so long for 20 years, she fed into that. If you're not the chosen one,

327
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,880
 what's the next best thing that you're the mother of the chosen one?

328
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,120
 So I think she fed into his delusion. First off, fed into his fears. There's little white men in

329
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,560
 my closet. "Those are great aliens, honey." What? "Those are our galactic brothers. And sometimes

330
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,440
 they'll take you, and I found the hybrid." And then... So when he starts having these visions of car

331
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,240
 accidents and deaths, he's a young boy. "Those are just gifts the aliens give you, honey. You're special."

332
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,320
 And this goes on and on and on. I think that reading of the story works because I think her

333
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,600
 narcissism shows at the end. And he committed suicide. As an afterthought, that statement

334
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,920
 made such an afterthought. Her son, who struggled with psychic trauma for so long,

335
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:09,200
 gets four words in a sentence. And then she ends it saying, "This is just some other stuff we've

336
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:17,360
 encountered." Being abducted by aliens must be terrifying. It seems to happen wherever they want.

337
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,440
 A lot of times it happens in your house where you should feel safe, in your bed where you should

338
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,720
 feel safe. And it happened to a child who's even more terrifying. But to have someone else in the

339
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,520
 house feeding into that fear, feeding into that uncertainty, clasping their hands with joy that

340
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:40,320
 they have a fellow UFO believer in the house, unlike the sister and the father, feeding into

341
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,040
 that energy. It must have been overwhelming for that child. She says, "I think the aliens harassed

342
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,400
 my son to the point of death. But I think the aliens had help."
