1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 just when you thought it was safe to go back into the theater.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Now we take a look at the theory that when we dream we actually tap into some sort of paranormal realm.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And a warning, this is serious, simply hearing that story may invite a demon to visit your house today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 *Music*

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Barberner. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. If you guys are around here, like I don't want a demon in my house.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm gonna click the episode off to those of you who are still listening.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We salute you and that is real. We'll get into that second story in a moment.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 First off, we got a lot of stuff to cover. I have to issue a minor update.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Friday's episode, the episode about the woman with the glowing boobs. That was actually a recommendation.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I did not know it was a recommendation. It was recommended a long time ago.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 And I did not know it correctly.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So a Twitter follower @drutherca, thank you so much for recommending the Illuminous Boobs story.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 People are like, "I missed that episode. You should listen to it. It's a good one."

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Thank you so much and I'll edit that into that episode as well.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I apologize. I try to make sure I give everyone credit when they recommend the story. So that was my bad.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And then let's give a shout out to today's Patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 flying with wings. Which is how you normally fly. You normally don't hover in Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 We won't have any of that. It's Archeopteryx.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 [mimics flying]

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Because apparently...

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 You're like, "Ting it! Jason, I get listened to the episode even though you warned me. I get possessed by a demon."

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And then you made that bizarre noise right in my headphones.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Archeopteryx is apparently some sort of bird, prehistoric bird.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Archeopteryx, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Really, really helps out a lot. You should ask yourself, "What did I do today to support my favorite podcaster, Dead Rabbit Radio?"

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Archeopteryx, I'm going to go ahead and touch you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Catch them in your beak. Ah!

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And just try with your hand. Don't drive with your beak.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed on out to Corona, California.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 [imitates flying]

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Pull up to this movie theater, Archeopteryx. We are at the Regal Edwards Corona Crossings.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Hmm, hmm.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Maybe that's a conspiracy that it took place here. The Regal Edwards Corona Crossings in RPX,

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 which I think is one of those theaters where the seats move.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I know I went to go see Black Widow in a movie theater where the seats moved.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And it was good. I liked Black Widow. And I review the seats. The seats were good too.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I didn't think I'd like Black Widow that much, because I'm kind of off the Marvel bandwagon.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But no, it was, it was, I liked it.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 But anyways, it's July 26, 2021. We're at the Regal Edwards Corona Crossings and RPX Theater in Corona, California.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 It's late at night. It's like 11, 1130. And people are watching their movies or watching Fast Nine.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I watched that. That was good. You're like, Jason, this is a paranormal podcast. We're talking about movies.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I mean, it was good. I give it five ghosts. I give F9 five ghosts. So it is paranormal.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 It's my rating system. Okay, it's late at night. It's like 1130 at five at night.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And people are watching F9, the Fast Saga. All of a sudden the movie stops.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 All of a sudden it goes black for a second. The lights come on and a voice is announced over the theater.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 You leave. Leave the theater. Leave calmly. But there's an emergency. You must leave the theater.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And everyone's kind of getting up there like, oh no, will Vin Diesel ever find his family?

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 They're getting up. They'll have to go look up spoilers on IMDB. They're getting up there, leaving the theater.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 They don't know what's going on. What happened? This is so bizarre.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 What happened was earlier in the night. At 9.35 p.m. there's a showing of the Forever Purge.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 It's the fifth Purge movie in the Purge series. This one, if you don't know what the Purge movies are,

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Purge movies are about a society where for 12 hours, one night a year, for 12 hours, all emergency personnel,

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 they have to stay at home. Hopefully they're at home. All emergency personnel and services are cut off

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 and anyone can commit any crime they want to for 12 hours. And it's a way to kind of blow off some steam.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 This one, the fifth movie in the series, is about people going, you know what, what if we committed a crime

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 for more than 12 hours? Basically the fifth movie is just real life. It's just a documentary.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 At this point, the fifth movie, the Forever Purge. Why do we just purge for 12 hours? Let's do it forever.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Anyway, so that's the plot of the Forever Purge. This showing at this regal cinema sold six tickets.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Six tickets to go watch it because you know it's pandemic times and it's the Forever Purge. It's not an 8-movie.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 The movie ends around 11.35. Cleaning crew goes into the theater. It's empty. They go, what is a Purge movie?

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Who stays till the end of these things? They go and they start cleaning up the theater.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And one of the members of the cleaning crews are walking through the barely illuminated darkness.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 The end credits are still playing on the screen. They see in the movie theater two bodies.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 They call the cops. The cops show up. They issue the emergency. F9 is canceled.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Slumped down in this movie theater you have Riley Goodrich, an 18-year-old young woman, and she is dead on the scene.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 The only next to her is Anthony Barros, 19-year-old young man. He's bleeding profusely with a few gunshot wounds to the head, but he's still alive.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So he's rushed to the hospital and they're trying their best. And the cops have no idea what could have caused this.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 There wasn't a single report of a gunshot in the entire movie theater, which you know, everyone's watching movies or people are shooting guns and revving cars.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Maybe some of them are just dialogue movies. I don't know, I don't watch those.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 But no one in any of the theaters heard a gunshot. And the cops are trying to figure this stuff out and they go, "Okay, we have six people. Six tickets were sold to the Purge, the Forever Purge."

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Let's track them down. And they were able to track down four of the tickets to one other buyer.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So you had Anthony and you had Riley. They were able to track the four of their tickets. They bought them online. They used their credit card.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 They had all that information. The cops show up at this dude's house and say, "Hey, we know you have to know something about this because there's only six people in the theater, one's dead, one's in the hospital, and you bought the other four tickets. What's going on?"

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So the friend says, "Okay, I did buy those other four tickets. It was me, two of my buddies, and one person, I'm not going to say it's my buddy.

77
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 A young man known as Joseph Yemenez, he's 20 years old. And dude, this cat is weird. Joseph is a weird duck. You know, I just said he was a cat. He's also a duck. That's what makes him weird.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 He was acting weird in the theater. We're watching the Forever Purge and he was acting really weird. He was like, "This movie's good. This movie's actually decent."

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And they're like, "What? What sane person would say that?" He's like, "I can't wait until they make a sixth one."

80
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 No, he was acting weird and it was kind of making the friends nervous. So when he gets up in the middle of the movie, so the four of them are sitting in the back of the theater.

81
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Riley and Anthony are sitting in the middle of the theater. When he gets up in the middle of the movie and comes back with a bag and says, "Yo, dude, I got a strap with me now. I got a strap."

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 The other three friends are like, "Uh, we all gotta go to the bathroom." That was actually their excuse. All three of them had to go to the bathroom at the same time.

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Now, a strap is normal slang for a gun. Because something that may come up is, did they know he had a firearm on him?

84
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 But they all get up to go to--and they don't warn anybody. And I was reading an article and they said legally are they--because he wasn't threatening anyone.

85
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 He was just acting weird. He was mumbling to himself. He was a fan of the Purge series. But was he actively threatening anybody? Were these people legally liable?

86
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 These people are going to carry this to their grave. Like, this is something you're gonna have a hard time getting over.

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 But they all go--they just think he's being weird. They don't want to be around him. They all go, "I have to go to the bathroom at the same time."

88
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Like, "You and Louis just walk out of the movie theater." But they don't leave the theater. Because they have to, like, they're not gonna do that.

89
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 They'll look even weirder. But they go, "We're not going back in that movie theater." Because, you know, there's a deal with a gun in there.

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 From Joseph Yemenez aside, because he was been arrested. He's been arrested at this point. He finally told the cops. He goes, "Listen, so I've been hearing voices for a long, long time."

91
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And that can obviously be building an excuse for stuff. You know, there was that young man who shot up the--what is it?--Stoneman Douglas School in Florida.

92
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 And when he got arrested, he's like, "The demons! The demons are inside of me!" JCS Psychology. There's a YouTube video called JCS Psychology, which I watched, like, the day he drops a video.

93
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 It's really good stuff. He breaks down interrogation videos. I highly recommend this channel, if you're into any sort of true crime stuff or just like human psychology.

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 He really broke down how that was a lie and how--I don't remember the cat's name who did that. Apparently everyone's a cat. Everyone's a cat today.

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 But I don't remember who shot up Stoneman Douglas and I could care less. But he was--he would go back and forth between talking about demons to, like, pretend that he was crazy, but when no one was around, he stopped pretending crazy.

96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 It's a really interesting video. But you think about Joseph--and so I think it was made up. I think he would have thought that he--everyone thinks they're just gonna go to a mental ward, which is way worse!

97
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Way worse than going to just jail. At least jail, you get to play cards and get your head bashed in with a lead pipe. In a lot of these mental facilities, you're just drugged in your comatose. You don't even have, like, free will.

98
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 But anyways, Joseph Yimenez, he could be building as an insanity defense, but he tells the police, he goes, "Listen, I've been hearing voices for a long time. I've been hearing these voices in my head."

99
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 And they were telling me I had to kill people or my family would be killed and all my possessions would be taken from me. And I was struggling with this.

100
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And when we're sitting in the forever purge, the voices are just there too much. So I went out, I got my gun, I came back in, my buddies left.

101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I walked through the dark theater. There was only two other people in the theater. I walked into the row behind these two people. They're watching this movie.

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And I shot the man first, shot him several times in the head. And then Riley kind of jumped up and then I shot her. And then I left.

103
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He says in his statement, he immediately regretted it. Like, he felt so sorry that he had done this thing. As he should, it's not going to protect him.

104
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 He's facing the death penalty because it's considered lying in wait. It also, I think, took one of their wallets or one of their cell phones.

105
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But the cops knew early on this wasn't a robbery. The cops idea was this was a totally random event, unprovoked assault.

106
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 By the time Joseph finally had confessed to this, Anthony has also passed away. He was brain dead for a couple days and then he died as well.

107
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So now he's facing double homicide charges with special circumstances that makes him eligible for the death penalty.

108
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 It's also unsettling the idea of, I believe this, if the voices in your head are paranormal, the voices in your head are like some sort of evil sinister thing,

109
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 that the second you do what they want, they completely disappear because they were just there to bone you in the first place.

110
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I always think that idea is spooky. And then, just the idea of sitting, there's all these things. You have him having to suffer through that if it's true, if it's not an excuse.

111
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And then they're like, "Kill, kill, kill, kill." And then you do it and then they're gone. That's spooky to me because just the voices saying "Kill, kill" I'm going, "Oh, that's not scary at all!"

112
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 I'm all brushing my teeth. I'm like, "Oh, this is such a good song." That's scary in and of itself, but the idea of once you do it, they're gone.

113
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Like, that's creepy. Because then you know that there's something malevolent behind it trying to ruin your life, because it's life's ruin. Life's ruin.

114
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And then you have the idea of these two young people who are on their date. They're sitting in this movie theater. And it's just you two.

115
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And there's four other people and then you don't know that they've left. They haven't warned anybody and you're just sitting there.

116
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 You're shot in the back of the head. It's just that's unsettling as well. It's unsettling as well.

117
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 So I wanted to share that story with you. I do think it has the crossroads between the paranormal and the true crime.

118
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And it's one that just happened on my vacation and I thought would be a really chilling story.

119
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Archaeopteryx, let's go ahead and give you the hair hang-lider. Even though you can fly without it, we can't.

120
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 We're going to leave behind Corona, California. We are headed out to Crown's Nest Pass in Alberta, Canada.

121
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And I thought it's, as a philosophical thing, it is interesting. Like what happens when we sleep? What happens when we dream?

122
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Are they real? Are they just your subconscious firing? Is it a combination of the two?

123
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 This is one thing I find interesting about dreams. It doesn't always, or just things in general, it doesn't always have to be one or the other.

124
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 You can have a million bigfoot sightings that are fake and three that are real.

125
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And when you dispute the other million, you're not saying that he doesn't exist at all.

126
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I mean, after you've disputed literally one million bigfoot stories, people may make assumptions.

127
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 But maybe dreams are subconscious, but sometimes they tap into something darker, something more primal.

128
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 That's what we're going to take a look at today. And last warning, I'm going to talk about two dreams.

129
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 The second one, just read, when I read the story, stuff has been, there's something different in my,

130
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 different in my house now. But anyways, before we get there, let's take a look at this.

131
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I found from a person who goes by the name Where the Raven Lives, maybe it's a friend of Archaeopteryx.

132
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It's the mid 90s. We're in Crow's Nest. Ooh, Archaeopteryx may know where this is at.

133
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 We're in Crow's Nest Pass. That's in Alberta, Canada.

134
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And it's next to the border. This location is next to the border of British Columbia.

135
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 There's a couple of lakes in the area and where the Raven lives, let's give them the name Jody.

136
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Jody says that she has to take the bus to school from where she lives to go to school.

137
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 After you're like Jason, I know how buses work. I'm not a moron, but it's a far distance.

138
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Do you know how far distances work? It's a far distance for her to get from her house to the school.

139
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 So sometimes the bus, actually a lot of times apparently, it takes, she gets picked up before the sun comes up.

140
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 The bus drives her all the way through this wilderness that is known as Alberta, Canada, and then she gets to school.

141
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And she goes, it's actually beautiful. Like even as a child, I appreciated how beautiful it was to be picked up before the sun came up.

142
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And you see just these beautiful lakes. One night Jody is having a dream.

143
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And even she's a little hesitant to call it a dream. Sometimes these premonition dreams seem so real.

144
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Not really a premonition dream, but these dreams that kind of pierce reality seem so real that it's hard to quantify as a dream.

145
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 But it's not reality. Jody knows that. Jody is a child standing out on the side of the road along her bus route.

146
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And the lakes are completely frozen over at this time. It's winter time. The lakes are completely frozen over.

147
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 But she sees the guardrail along the road has been smashed.

148
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And there's a hole in the ice leading into the frozen depths of the lake.

149
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Suddenly, now standing directly in front of her is an old woman. She's dripping wet. She's soaked head to toe.

150
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Her whole body seems to be shaking, quivering. She raises a finger at Jody and whispers.

151
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 But Jody hears every word perfectly in her ear.

152
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 It's so cold in here.

153
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Jody wakes up, gets ready for school, gets on the bus that's waiting outside.

154
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 A glorious early morning sky, fresh snow on the ground, a winter wonderland.

155
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 But she's on the bus and she's going her normal route.

156
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 In about 10 minutes into her ride to school, she starts to see red and white lights bounce across the trees.

157
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And as that bus is getting closer and closer, she begins to recognize these lights are coming from emergency vehicles.

158
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And sure enough, as she crosses the same location she saw in her dream, the guardrail is ripped open and a car is being pulled out of the icy waters.

159
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 She found out later that a car containing two older people crashed through the guardrail and went into the ice and both people were killed.

160
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 She says to this day when she drives by that location, she still immediately remembers that old woman just standing there on the side of the road.

161
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 It's so cold in here.

162
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Classic American ghost story, even though it took place in Canada, it's classic ghost story with the twist of the premonition.

163
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Or was she dreaming it while it happened, like was the old woman already dead when she had the dream?

164
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Or was she seeing the accident before it happened?

165
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Just kind of an interesting ghost story. It's creepy. The imagery is creepy. You're safe alone in bed next thing.

166
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 You know you're transported out into this winter paradise and then there's a ghost in front of you.

167
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I think you'd probably be in a sauna in Jamaica and a ghost appearing in front of you would still be unsettling, but you have it.

168
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 It's so hot in here. It's so hot in here. Turn down the temperature. Is there boiling alive in the spa?

169
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It's an interesting story. Just on its face it's an interesting story, but I wanted to pair it up with this one, but I wanted to pair it up with this next story I wanted to do.

170
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Because this story also involves a dream taking us to a paranormal reality.

171
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And then that paranormal reality becoming true.

172
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 That's always the key with this. If it's just a dream, I'm not interested in it.

173
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 But if there's a real-world ramification, that's when we can start to look at the dream as being something else.

174
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Archaeopteryx, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous carbonicopter.

175
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 We are leaving behind Crow's Nest Canada. We are headed on out to Engelside, Texas.

176
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 [imitates car noises]

177
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 This story was sent to me by Beatrice, a long time listener of the show.

178
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Our forest fin correspondent. I'm sure she's probably had to hang up her hat on that one since he's passed away.

179
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 But still will always be remembered as our forest fin correspondent. Thank you very much for that.

180
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And maybe she'll be remembered for this terrifying story as well.

181
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It's the year 2000. She's living in Texas. Beatrice is 25 years old and she's living there with her 3-year-old daughter Mia.

182
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 A tiny little home on Avenue E.

183
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Her daughter has a really hard time sleeping by herself. She actually refuses to sleep by herself.

184
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 So for all intents and purposes Beatrice and Mia shared a room.

185
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And this is a tiny little house and she said the way that it was set up was that her bed- their bedroom, really-

186
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 the bedroom door opened directly into the kitchen.

187
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And recently her fridge bulb had burned out in her fridge.

188
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And she hadn't had to- I didn't even know this burned out. I guess they do. I've never had one burn out in my 44 years of existence.

189
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Apparently those beautiful- I guess Jason light bulbs can burn out.

190
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Anyway, what reality do you live in? The best one.

191
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 The light bulb of her fridge had burned out. She'd been meaning to replace it. It wasn't really a big thing.

192
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 She just read through the dark void and ate whatever she grabbed. She's like, "Oh awesome. A bottle of ketchup."

193
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 One night she's sleeping in her bed. The bedroom door is open and she can look into the kitchen.

194
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 She's sleeping in bed with her daughter Mia. And she is woken up by a sound.

195
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And she looks into the kitchen and she sees her daughter is open the refrigerator door and is rooting around inside of it.

196
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And she notices, but it doesn't make the connection at first, that the refrigerator door light is on.

197
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 She sees her daughter kind of rooting around. What she's more concerned about is not- whoa, my daughter knows how to replace a bulb.

198
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 What she's thinking more about is, "When the world's my daughter doing up and why is she in the refrigerator?"

199
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And she can hear like the sound. Like you know when you open a fridge door you can hear stuff kind of rustle around.

200
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Ketchup hitting mustard and jelly falling out hitting the ground and making a big mess.

201
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Everything kind of rattles. That's what she heard. That's what she woke up to. And she can still hear that noise.

202
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And she starts going, "Mia! Mia, come back to bed dude. You can't eat your own bottle of ketchup until I'm up. Come back to bed."

203
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And she says that "Mia then turns to her and it's not Mia. This little girl was the same height, same haircut, same floral dress that her daughter wore to school."

204
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 But as this figure turned to face Beatrice, she realized the hair was gray and dusty.

205
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And the face was a horrible distorted version of what her daughter's face should look like.

206
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And this figure is just looking at Beatrice and Beatrice has a weird reaction to this.

207
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Her mind is telling her, "This is a normal girl, but not my daughter. She just must have wandered in. This poor little child must have wandered into my house."

208
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 So she begins to tell the child, "Where are you from? What are you doing here? Your mother must be worried about you."

209
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And this little girl is now walking towards the bedroom. Why are you here?

210
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 But as the girl's getting closer, Beatrice has this normal reaction that it must just be a real girl, a real random girl with a distorted face and super dusty hair.

211
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Who stole her daughter's haircut and clothes. But as the girl's getting closer, Beatrice starts to get panicked.

212
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Something primal inside of her is telling her, "This isn't your daughter, obviously. And this isn't just some random kid who wandered into your house late at night.

213
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 I'm hungry for ketchup. This is something else."

214
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And she begins yelling at the girl to leave.

215
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 But the little girl continues to walk into the room and Beatrice starts to get panicked.

216
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 She looks over and sees that her own daughter Mia is safely asleep.

217
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And she looks back at this Amia doppelganger, this grotesque parody of her child just continuing to walk into the room.

218
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And she keeps asking, "Where are you from? What are you doing here? You don't belong here."

219
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 The figure continues to walk into the room.

220
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Beatrice again has a unique thing because generally if you see like a monster kid walking around your house, you know, maybe do some kung fu, maybe pray a little.

221
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 But I think there's still this thing in her head that this is someone real.

222
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Right? If there's a real kid in your house and you're like, "Hey, can I call my mom? I'm lost. You don't want to kung fu him?"

223
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 She tells this figure, "I'm going to call 911. I'm going to call 911. The police will take you home."

224
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Still thinking it's a real child. She picks up the phone.

225
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 The girl keeps walking towards her. She dials 911.

226
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 And she puts the phone in her ear and it's her mom's voice talking on the phone.

227
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And she's going, "Mom, mom, hang up. There's something in my house. There's a little girl lost in my house. Hang up. I need to call the police."

228
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 The next thing Beatrice knows, the phone's on the cradle and she's sitting up in bed like she just woke up.

229
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 She's sitting up in bed and her eyes are opening up for the first time.

230
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 She looks, the phone is on the cradle and the girl is still standing in the room.

231
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 So Beatrice grabs the phone, dials 911, puts it to her ear and her mom's voice is on the phone again.

232
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 She gasps, sits up in bed, eyes opening like it's the first time. The little girl's in the room.

233
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 The phone is on the cradle. She said this happens two more times. She's struggling to call 911.

234
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 She can't. And then after the phone is being out the fourth time, she gasps. She sits up straight, her eyes are open, and the little girl is not in the room this time.

235
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 She jumps up, she begins looking for this. Was this real? Was any of this real?

236
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 She turns on all the lights. She's wondering if she's just going to wake up again and be back in bed.

237
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 She is really having a hard time with reality at this point. Everything seemed so real in the beginning.

238
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 She decided not to go back to sleep that night, which is a prudent decision, and stays awake.

239
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 She does have the solid set that the refrigerator light is burned out still.

240
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 She's like, "Woo! Fine. I'm so glad I still have to take care of that choice."

241
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Because had it been on, then she would have known that this was reality. The little child walking around was reality.

242
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 She goes, "Okay, the light was burned out during the day. The little kid shows up. The light's on in the fridge, and now it's burnt."

243
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Okay, so it must have just been a dream. That next day, she's kind of walking around her front yard in a zombie-like state.

244
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 She has two neighbors, two neighbors at a time, Eric and Dee.

245
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 They're talking to Eric. He's out in his front lawn, and he goes, "Hey, you look a little stressed. Are you doing okay? I can tell something's going on."

246
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And she goes, "Oh, yeah, I couldn't get any sleep last night."

247
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Let me tell you what happened. She begins telling Eric this story, and as she's telling him, he's getting quieter and quieter.

248
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And then he goes, "Okay, you need to stop right now. Don't tell me anything else. I'm super scared."

249
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 No, he said, "Don't tell me anything else. I'm gonna go get Dee." Runs inside, he brings out Dee, and he goes, "Beatrice, tell her what you just told me."

250
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Beatrice is like, "Well, okay." Beatrice is telling the story, and the same thing as she's telling the story, Dee and Eric are listening intently.

251
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And Dee goes, "That happened to me, too."

252
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Dee said a while back, she was sleeping on the couch, taking a nap.

253
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And she had, like, the doors to the house open. She had, like, the front door open, the back door open. She's sleeping on the couch, and she wakes up,

254
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 and there's a boy sitting on the arm of her couch, just sitting there.

255
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And he's wearing overalls, but no shirt on underneath, and he's just kind of sitting there.

256
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And her first inclination, she said he had dusty hair. His hair was gray and dusty.

257
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And he didn't have any shirt. She said his skin looked almost like a leather hide.

258
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 She's taken this in. This does not look like a normal child.

259
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And her first inclination is, "Oh, this poor child must have wandered into my house."

260
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 He must have just been lost and walked into my house and sitting on my couch. That's her first inclination.

261
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 But then she starts to feel like this thing is something far darker than that.

262
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And this little boy turns towards her and begins to growl.

263
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 She feels, she believes that this is a demon. She begins praying out loud.

264
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 It's stillness just layers itself upon the entire living room, and then the figure is gone.

265
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 If Beatrice had just sent me the story where she had a dream where she thought this little kid was walking around her house that looked like her daughter,

266
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 and then it kept repeating and then it disappeared, that's a creepy dream.

267
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 It doesn't have any parallel to the real world.

268
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 I mean, it could cause you to sleep with your nightlight on, but that in and of itself is just a dream.

269
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 But when you have the neighbor, when you have someone who's in such close geographical proximity,

270
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 have the same, you know what's interesting? It's not even the same dream. It's the same elements.

271
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 There's two different sexes of the kid, which is creepy.

272
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 So it means that it can shift, but no matter what form it takes, it has demonic features.

273
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Beatrice said that this actually took place right next to Elizabeth Cook Elementary School,

274
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 and there is a legend of that school being haunted for a long time.

275
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 So is it simply the fact of these ghostly children going, "You know what? I've been at school for two, three hundred years.

276
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 It's time for a break." And visiting neighbors.

277
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Is it something more sinister than that? Because it is able to change form, but it's still locked into some sort of demonic visage that it can't really shake?

278
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 I find it very, very interesting that both people were under the false assumption that this was a totally normal child,

279
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 that it happened to wander its way into their house.

280
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 One of them having that would be weird, but both of them having that means it's a feature, not a bug.

281
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Like it's actually doing this thing on purpose.

282
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And then you start to wonder, like people who talk about black-eyed children, and you don't realize, I mean, they're looking at it,

283
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 they can tell it's demonic and they're still thinking, "Oh, it must have been a kid walking in."

284
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 There's some sort of like mental camouflage there, even though you could visually see they were wrong.

285
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 So there's a whole lot of things we can talk about with this story. What is this? How did it get there?

286
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 But Beatrice sent me this story. She sent me a bunch of stories the other day.

287
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Beatrice sent me this story and it could just be psychosomatic, but it's been a couple days now.

288
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 I feel like there's something else in my place now. I feel like there's something else in my house.

289
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Um...

290
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 The night I was reading this story, I have this weird ritual sometimes.

291
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I'll bring a snack into the bedroom. I'm like, "Jesus, no weird ritual. That's just what nine-year-olds do."

292
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 I brought in some trail mix. I'll have the light shut off and I'll put on a movie, and I'll eat it.

293
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And drink a bit right before I go to bed. It's a really bad habit.

294
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 But I was doing that. I had the light on from my laptop. I have a night light because I researched the paranormal and I've seen a lot of horrible stuff in my life.

295
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 I have a night light on my laptop and I'm sitting there and I'm eating my trail mix with raisins.

296
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 I'll put extra raisins in it. And I have my drink. And this hasn't happened in a long time.

297
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 That's enough light for me to get by on, really. There's something behind me as I'm eating my trail mix.

298
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And I...

299
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 It's funny because we're going to be covering a story later this week about a case that totally got a big paranormal case that ended up being a fraud.

300
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And everyone who was involved in it now looks like a schmuck. And it's funny because...

301
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 It's possible that Beatrice is just pulling my leg. I don't think so. She's a long time listening to this show.

302
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 I've had a lot of communication with her over about a year now. She seems like a real good person. I don't think she would fraud me.

303
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 But I feel like what was in my room the other night was that child.

304
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 So if it turns out that she made this story up, I'm going to also look like a big old schmuck.

305
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I feel simply by reading this story, I invite... And it's been a couple days now.

306
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Normally I fall asleep with my nightlight on and then I wake up in the middle of the night and shut it off.

307
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 The batteries, I have rechargeable batteries, luckily. It's running until the morning comes up.

308
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 I think there's something else. I've always had the old man in my closet who I've made my peace with.

309
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 But I think there's something else now, here.

310
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And this would make sense because the ghost itself kind of exists in the subconscious.

311
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 This little child creature exists in the subconscious. It's visiting through dreams.

312
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And what is reading but visualization?

313
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 When you read something, as you're reading it, your subconscious is... Or maybe your consciousness is... I don't know the exact mechanism.

314
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 But as you're reading something, you're picturing these things like a dream.

315
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 And is just hearing the stories, just reading the story enough to have this thing visit you? Is that enough?

316
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Do you have to be physically located there? And I'm just a big old scaredy cat.

317
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 And the story struck a nerve for some reason. And... I just imagine it's here.

318
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Or by simply hearing the story have you invited this thing into your life.

319
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 It's possible that I have cursed a bunch of my listeners with a demon that I really know nothing about.

320
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I've never really researched outside of this story.

321
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 It's possible it's just a figment of my overactive spooky imagination.

322
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 But it's always interesting, the world of paranormal research is unlike most forms of research.

323
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 If you're a scientist and you want to study bugs, you gotta go where the bugs are.

324
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 If you want to study rocks, you gotta go to where the rocks are.

325
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 The paranormal research is one of those few groups where sometimes it comes to you.

326
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Sometimes the best ghost hunting adventures you go on are the ones that end up on your own doorstep.

327
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Sometimes it's exciting, but sometimes it can be extremely dangerous.

328
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 If you're not prepared for what's standing at your doorstep, you may stop being a researcher and you may become a victim.

329
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 You may become a victim of a paranormal entity. You may disappear, die a mysterious death, get possessed. Who knows?

330
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 You're like, Jason, I'm not listening to this podcast anymore, but all those things may happen.

331
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 You may become not a paranormal research, but part of the paranormal legend.

332
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
