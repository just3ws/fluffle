1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 A man hunts for a monster only he believes in.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,040
 And then today is the day. I know I always say this, but the most requested topic, just wait

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,680
 till I read the list of names of people who have requested this story, is from the Conspiracy

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,560
 Iceberg, and it may change the way you think about history, because now we are going to tackle

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,400
 the Great Mud Flood today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:37,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,680
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you are having a great day too. I'm always happy when I

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,640
 start recording again, because you know I go maybe two days without recording and some days I

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,960
 bulk record episodes when I have a lot of free time, but it's always nice to come back. It's always

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,120
 nice to get back on the mic and I'm having a lot of fun and I hope you guys are still having a lot

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,920
 of fun listening to the show as well. So this first story is actually a recommendation. I got it.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:08,080
 This was in my email and this was sent by Moss X. Mos X, one of the two, but I appreciate this story.

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,520
 So he goes, "Hey, here's a story idea for you. Honey Island Swamp Monster. Probably never heard

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,200
 of it before." And it was funny because he also said that it's... the way that I read sometimes,

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
 especially when I'm reading emails and stuff like that, before I respond I have to read it again.

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,480
 When I'm initially reading it, my eyes kind of scan it real quickly. So I see the title,

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,800
 "Honey Island Swamp Monster," and then I see the word "smell." So I was like, "A monster that smells

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,480
 like honey? I'm in!" But then I realized that it was just a smelling monster, but it was still

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,360
 intriguing, although I would have enjoyed the sweet smelling monster. I wonder if any cryptids do

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,440
 smell good out there. I wonder if there's a cryptid that smells like sweet, sweet flowers.

21
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,880
 Ghosts do, so I don't see why cryptids wouldn't. Anyways, so we're going to Louisiana.

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,200
 And a little bit out of New Orleans, a little couple miles away from New Orleans,

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
 there is the Honey Island Swamp. Walking through the swamp.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,280
 The... we're walking through the swamp. We got those rubber pants on so we won't get wet,

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,080
 but I made sure that yours were just a little too short so they immediately get fled with water

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,320
 and you sink up it, and then I have a good chuckle. And while you're dealing with horrible

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,960
 diseases you catch from the swamp, we also go back in time. We're going back to the year, 1974.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,760
 And in 1974, too many merged from the swamp. Harlan Ford and Billy Maze. No, sorry, Harlan Ford

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,960
 and Billy Mills. They come out of the swamp with a plaster cast of a footprint and they like throw

30
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,000
 it down on the ground and go "proof!" Now there wasn't anyone around when they did that, so then

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 they had to pick it up and actually go into town and then they take it into a bar and go "proof!"

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,480
 People are like "proof of what?" So Harlan Ford and Billy Mills had said that they had once seen

33
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,320
 a creature in Honey Island Swamp. They described it as seven foot tall, gray haired creature.

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,040
 They estimated it would weigh about 400 pounds. Giant monster man. So, and it had yellow or red

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,360
 glowing eyes and the difference in the eye color could be chalked up to either what time of day

36
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,520
 they saw it in or how bloodshot their own eyes were when they were out hunting. Glug glug. But

37
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,760
 anyways, they come into town with this plaster cast and people are thinking "well that kind of

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,680
 sounds like a big foot Harlan" and he's like "yeah but this one's different because look at this

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,280
 plaster cast and it looks like it had webbed toes." And you can see photos of these. They basically

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,760
 looks like it has four toes once kind of folded in or something weird. The toes are webbed. It's

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,560
 not like a primates footprint. And the thing is in 1963 these guys came out of Honey Island Swamp.

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,520
 They're like "this is what we just saw. We were walking through the swamp. We saw a boar with its

43
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,320
 throat ripped out and a giant monster and we went to shoot it and the monster ran away."

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,600
 Nobody believed them. People are like "that's... you're making that up. You're making that up."

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,200
 So about nine years later, more like 11 years later, they find this... they find a footprint

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,440
 they go and they pour the plaster in there and bring it back. People are like here they go "here's

47
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,040
 proof. There's proof that there is this monster running around." Nobody believes them. And it's

48
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,400
 one of those weird things that a lot of communities really like to have like bigfoot sightings and

49
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,200
 stuff like that because you can sell chotchkies and things like that. But this would not take off.

50
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,760
 This would not take off. Harlan dedicated his life to finding proof of the Honey Island Swamp

51
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,080
 monster. He was out there consistently after these two sightings and he did bring back other

52
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,960
 plaster casts. But for whatever reason, the people in the town took it as a myth. They weren't really

53
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,040
 embracing it. Even today you have tour guides and they say the swamp... the swamp is really like

54
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,040
 beautiful. It's very untouched. You go there to visit. It's just a great place. It's a great

55
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,160
 recreational place and they have boat tours. You can take boat tours through the area. I was reading

56
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,960
 this article one guy did. He said "hey I'm gonna go on this boat tour. Check it out." He talks to

57
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,640
 the two tour operators and they're like "there's no a Honey Island Swamp monster." And it's funny

58
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,040
 because these people could actually make more money by saying that there was. But they're like

59
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,360
 it doesn't exist. It absolutely doesn't exist. There are boat tours you can take where it's

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,480
 called the Honey Island Swamp Monster boat tour. But it was funny in the article where the guy was

61
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,080
 taking the boat tour. He saw that boat still docked. No one was on it. Because people just want to go

62
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,840
 and enjoy nature. Even in that area people aren't like "this creature exists you know oh no I ran

63
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,200
 into it when me and my uncle were out playing baseball one day and the baseball fell in the swamp."

64
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:47,520
 They don't buy it. Which is odd but I might just be because the only people who have ever seen it

65
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,720
 are the two people who first saw it and then the people who started bringing back

66
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:59,120
 plaster casts. Harlan Ford was dedicated to finding the proof of this thing. So much so

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,720
 that for the next six years he was constantly looking for it. Why only six years? Because he

68
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,400
 died in 1980 without ever having any proof, conclusive proof that what he saw standing over

69
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,640
 that bore and what was leaving those footprints was real. And it would be a footnote. No pun intended.

70
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,680
 It would be a footnote in cryptid history about the Honey Island Swamp Monster. It would just be

71
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,560
 a funny name for a creature that the locals don't believe. That they almost actively dismiss.

72
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,480
 Just like when people go to towns and start asking for the Blair Witch they're like "Blair

73
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,520
 Witch isn't real you know it's fake right?" Now like I was saying this would be a footnote in

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,440
 cryptid history but the main proponent of it is dead. I don't know what had ever happened to

75
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,280
 Billy Mays. He's a footnote within a footnote. It was he passed away there was never any proof.

76
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:57,520
 People assumed it was a hoax and it might have been. But a hoax that has become cemented in the

77
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:06,480
 minds of millions of girls everywhere. Monster High dolls are a line of dolls of monster girls

78
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,160
 that are attending a school called Monster High. So you have Frankie Stein and you have like a

79
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,480
 Dracula Chick and a Wolf Girl and Laguna Beach or whatever. They're all the daughters of famous

80
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:26,000
 monsters and somehow all these famous monsters now are also attending Monster High with Honey

81
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Swamp. The daughter of the Honey Island Swamp Monster. She's not a bigfoot she is like a sea

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,080
 creature thing so she get rid of all that fur. No girl wants to be covered in fur be seven feet

83
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,840
 tall or four hundred pounds some of them might want to be seven feet tall but she's just like a

84
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,240
 a creature from the Black Lagoon type creature. She's 115 years and monster years according to

85
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,600
 her bio which is how I'm going to start describing my age. And so here's her bio let's learn a little

86
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,400
 bit about Honey Swamp since we don't know much about her father. I'm a proper southern ghoul

87
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:08,240
 from the swamps of Honey Island. My mama always taught me if you work hard and follow your screams

88
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:16,720
 you can be anything you want to be. Well I want to be a world famous cinema togherfer

89
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,560
 in Hauntleywood. Now I do know how to pronounce the word cinematographer but the dashes here make

90
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,440
 me think they're trying to emphasize ogre cinema to ogrefer because you know she's a monster.

91
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,040
 She's also friends with Claudia Wolfe and Vipereen Gorgon if you want to complete your

92
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:40,720
 collection so he did get that legacy at least. So Harlan if you're up there and you're watching down

93
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:48,480
 I hope you're happy with the fact that millions of girls around the world are now playing with dolls

94
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,800
 named after your hoax so it wasn't a waste of time. Who would have thought that when you and your

95
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,520
 buddy one drunken evening decided to go out and start pouring plaster into footprints you made

96
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:10,160
 and that hoax turned into a worldwide phenomenon if you play with monster high dolls otherwise

97
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:18,480
 you still don't know about this creature but good job Harlan you created a hoax and it became a doll

98
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,200
 and I don't honestly I don't think anyone else can claim that. A lot of hoaxes out there but not

99
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,600
 all of them attend monster high. So let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Now I know that

100
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,480
 a lot of times when I do these iceberg topics I go this is the most requested topic we've had

101
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,840
 because at the time they were but there was one that was constantly gaining people saying hey

102
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,640
 when are you going to do this story? When are you going to do this story? And it's time. The reason

103
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,560
 why it took so long these stories are much more time intensive to research. A lot of times people

104
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,640
 go do more iceberg conspiracy stuff and I do like Kentucky Meat Storm was iceberg conspiracy but

105
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,840
 the stuff that I really like the deep conspiracies I really have to get into they take a while. I

106
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,400
 enjoy researching these ones I really enjoy researching them because I'm kind of trying to unravel

107
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,800
 a puzzle you can just take a while because they keep running into roadblocks and go now I'm back

108
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,880
 to square one. On YouTube this was requested by Bint Fox by Red Baron. On email there was Matthew T

109
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,480
 Jimmy M and on Twitter I had Harrison. All of these people requested mudflud.

110
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,760
 Now you go mudflud what is mudflud?

111
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:46,640
 The year is 2019. The place wherever you're at right now it may just seem like a normal day

112
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,280
 but you remember in the back of your mind you remember when you were in school learning about

113
00:10:51,280 --> 00:11:01,360
 this day it was the day after humanity decided to start building out of the mud. This was the day

114
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:09,280
 when humanity said the mudflud would no longer hold us back. You remember learning in school about

115
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:17,520
 the great excavations of Europe how they had to dig cities out of tons of mud that came rushing

116
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:24,240
 down from the mountains. You also remember hearing stories about the American frontier where the mud

117
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:32,320
 just smashed into buildings burying them up to a floor deep until humanity decided to take back

118
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:39,200
 the land. And you think you reflect back on that day that you learned about all those years ago in

119
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,680
 school what an amazing feat of human engineering that we were able to clear out that much dirt

120
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:53,040
 and regain control of this planet. But that 2019 that place where you are that existed an

121
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:02,080
 alternate timeline because in this timeline not only did the mud stay but the powers that be

122
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,600
 covered the entire thing up. The great mudflud is a very very interesting conspiracy theory and for

123
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,240
 this one I'd been working on it for quite a while. I actually reached out to a friend of mine,

124
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,280
 Mitcham. I was like I do not know what to make of this. There has to be a rational explanation.

125
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,440
 This one I was completely stuck in and none of these are mud puns. None of this stuff like digging

126
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,680
 out of a hole or getting stuck and stuff like that. None of these are mud puns. I remember

127
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,040
 reaching out to my friend Mitcham and I sent him some stuff and I said I don't know what to make

128
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:45,440
 of this. I do not know what to make of this. This is I go it has to be fake. It has to be.

129
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:55,520
 This is what the great mudflud is. This is the theory. In the 1860s to 1870s a massive wave of mud

130
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:04,400
 covered the earth and buried most of our cities up to 812 feet in mud. And you think well that's

131
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:14,800
 stupid. That's obviously not true. The evidence for it is videos and photos of buildings all over

132
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:24,640
 the world buried up to the first floor in mud. So you will see buildings that have a window

133
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,560
 like you can see the top of a window sticking out of the cement. Like you can see where the ground

134
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,480
 is and then you see on the building there is definitely the shape of where a window would have

135
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,440
 been that's been bricked up and now the street is level to that window. You'll see pictures of

136
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,040
 what appear to be formally first floors of buildings that are now basements,

137
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,840
 odd doors that you have to walk downstairs to get into the front door. You'll see photos of

138
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,040
 excavations where they were doing road work and you'll find see a building that has an again an

139
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,400
 entire first floor with entrance doors and windows so they weren't originally basements.

140
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:10,400
 They're excavating this you'll see a front door and windows underneath the ground.

141
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,000
 And I'm looking at these things and I'm thinking okay these photos are real. There's actually a

142
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,600
 building that I know of that has the window sticking out of the ground corner. So these

143
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,960
 build these photos are real. These photos are not photoshopped and I'm looking at them and I'm

144
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,600
 watching these videos and I'm thinking yes that evidence is real. Those buildings are

145
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,920
 farther underground than they should be. A front door should not be underground. But the idea that

146
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:49,040
 a mud flood covered the planet and buried all of these buildings I was thinking that's not true.

147
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,720
 Now see here's the thing the theory there's more to the theory so not only did the mud flood come

148
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,800
 over but it was covered up to hide. It was basically used as a hard reset on humanity because there

149
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,200
 was a super advanced civilization that was so wonderful and at peace and they had all these

150
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,800
 amazing pieces of technology and this free energy and these super weapons even though they were

151
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:21,040
 peaceful and it was like this multicultural multi religious society that existed before 1860s

152
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,480
 and the mud flood came. Super technology didn't help them stop that and at that time the powers

153
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,720
 that be whoever whatever boogie man you want it to be said we're going to wipe them off the map

154
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,000
 and we're going to say they never existed and we're going to use this mud to basically bury

155
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,680
 everything that's proof of them and do like a hard reset on the history of the world. So I can buy

156
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,640
 like it was so basically I'm working against two conspiracy theories. One the the civilization the

157
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,360
 super advanced civilization that's been wiped off the map and two a history reset due to the mud

158
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,680
 flood and then three just the the geographical features itself. Now alternate history is easy to

159
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,600
 kind of look into but I'm looking at these photos and watching these videos and I'm thinking this

160
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,720
 I cannot figure this out but that was the main piece I really needed to tackle and that's why

161
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,240
 this took so long. I talked to Mitchum and I said I sent him this stuff and I go this is killing me

162
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,120
 this is killing me. There has to be a rational explanation for this and and he actually pointed

163
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,000
 me in the right path on the mud flood thing which is really interesting. Now what I'm about to go into

164
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,400
 you could say I'm going to present this and you could say well that's not the case in this city

165
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,280
 and that's not the case in this city but I think it's close enough and I have enough proof for enough

166
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:52,880
 cities that it applies to most of them. There were massive rain floods in the 1860s around the world

167
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,680
 there was this huge rainstorms storm system set of storm systems all sorts of stuff and there's

168
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,120
 geographical and historical records of these massive rainstorms that caused flooding everywhere

169
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,200
 almost all over the planet and when we look at these buildings that have been covered up by the

170
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,600
 mud this episode is probably going to run a little long but this I mean I kind of got to get through

171
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,280
 all this stuff when we look at the buildings that have been covered up in the mud they were built

172
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,520
 pre 1860s it's not like houses that were built in the 1970s are a foot deep all of the buildings that

173
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,960
 have this mud problem or basically the street level is where their second story would be

174
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,800
 are all built before the 1860s this was the thing of Mitchum turned me on to he said

175
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:50,480
 I do remember reading something a long time ago about Napoleon trying to clean up the cities of

176
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,760
 France they needed brand new infrastructure in these cities and they didn't know how to do it

177
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,480
 it might be related to that and I started looking into that and Napoleon did go about these huge

178
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,040
 projects because they were having issues with flooding they were having issues with cholera

179
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,480
 they were having issues stuff like that but I could never find anything that actually said so they

180
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:21,840
 did x and then I found an article on wikipedia about the raising of Chicago now this was this was

181
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:29,680
 really the key to unlocking the mud flood thing because once I kind of queued into this I realized

182
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,760
 that other than the raising of Chicago this is such a mundane answer for such a bizarre conspiracy

183
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,920
 that it's hard to find because it's such a people were like yeah why are you googling that why are

184
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,240
 you researching that it doesn't really make sense because we're just a small town that was built

185
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:53,600
 prior to 1860 we didn't really care about that 1860 this they were having problems with flooding

186
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,000
 and all over the world we are having these huge population explosions in cities and when you

187
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,080
 have huge population explosions in cities no longer can you just use mid 1800 sewage technology

188
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:15,120
 so Chicago says you know what we need sewers that are enough to to basically hold the sewage of

189
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,080
 millions of people but we can't dig deep enough into the earth to put all this stuff in however

190
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,800
 we can lift all of our buildings up put in our sewer system cover that and then we don't have

191
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,600
 to worry about floods either and there was a ton of documentation on the raising of Chicago

192
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:41,120
 entire buildings entire giant buildings were lifted and some of them were even moved and then

193
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,400
 the ground was filled in and then they were lowered back again it was this huge effort on

194
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
 behalf of the city to do this but they needed to do it because they needed to get these sewage

195
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:00,160
 systems up to speed so in Chattanooga uh Chattanooga Tennessee they also oh in the race in Chicago

196
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,360
 1860s is when that happened the uh in Chattanooga Tennessee they were like we know that they did

197
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,040
 something like this in Chicago but we don't want to do that we are having a serious trouble

198
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:22,080
 with flooding and sewage so we are going to fill in the streets we're just going to fill them in

199
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,280
 with dirt we're going to bring all this dirt in and this was the thing it was and I think this was

200
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,560
 a component with a lot of these other cities and that's why there's not a ton of records on this

201
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,880
 stuff it was per building it was your job as a building owner to raise your street level because

202
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,080
 otherwise in Chattanooga they were having serious trouble with flooding they could not control the

203
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,760
 flooding in the area so they said floods caused disease we're having cholera outbreaks it's

204
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,480
 go there were buildings that were never dry you'd go into the first floor it was always wet and

205
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:02,160
 musty because of the floods they said we have to raise the city by a couple feet by eight to 10 feet

206
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,080
 however it's per building so as a building owner it is your responsibility to do that

207
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,880
 and you would have to do that because if everyone on your block had their building raised and you

208
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,320
 didn't raise your dirt level by eight feet it's going to be you're going to be soaping wet all

209
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,400
 the rainwater is going to go in there and it happens over the course of years where people

210
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,560
 are just filling in dirt now I typed in like or this is what I was googling like origin of the

211
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:34,640
 russian sewer system origin of the parachutist system when were the sewers built in this city or

212
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,880
 that city in that information is so fairly mundane I'm not able to pull up anything like that I just

213
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,040
 had to find these scraps oh Chattanooga also that project took place in the 1860s so the timeline

214
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:53,280
 does match up at some point in the 1860s all these countries said we're having these population

215
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,160
 growth and we're having these huge cholera outbreaks we're having these huge disease outbreaks

216
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,560
 we just had these massive rainstorms all over the planet we just need to make our city a little

217
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,000
 bit higher and we could do the raising of chicago thing or we can just bring in dirt and sacrifice

218
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,040
 the first floor of all these buildings now the mud flood community they have their answers for this

219
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,480
 stuff I was reading one site and they're like yeah we don't think the raising of chicago actually

220
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,680
 happened we think that was a cover-up that's an easy thing to that's an easy route to get lost down

221
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,320
 I don't think that that's fair to say when someone says well actually here's an explanation for why

222
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,640
 these buildings are all around the same time covered in dirt it's because we have these massive

223
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 rainstorms in the area or around the globe and it made sense other cities were doing it and then

224
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
 for people to just go out there's just part of the cover-up you can't really debate that but to me

225
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,560
 and with Mitchum's help I had found a way to answer because those mud flood pictures were

226
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,680
 really freaking me out dude those mud flood pictures I'm thinking like what is going on

227
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,360
 there's tons of them this conspiracy theory actually tends to be mostly on YouTube because

228
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,960
 it's such a visual conspiracy theory if I just told you in 1860s mud came from everywhere and

229
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,360
 buried the planet you'd be like what that's not true but after watching an hour of video footage

230
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,080
 and photographs of these things you're thinking mud must have buried the planet until I and I never

231
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,720
 couldn't I mean I could imagine believing that but at a certain point in the back of my head I

232
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,840
 always knew my voice is going hoarse from doing this episode I always knew that there had to be

233
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:35,360
 rational explanation for this there had to be but we're not done and I was thinking okay we got it

234
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,840
 that's we're good on that now I have to tackle their other issue about this lost civilization

235
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,280
 thing because if I just do the mud flood part and leave that part hanging then I've only really

236
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,000
 looked into half of it and that's where it took me a bit longer this episode was supposed to come

237
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,120
 out maybe two weeks ago and then I had to look into all this stuff the mysterious civilization

238
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,640
 that they talk about that was wiped off the map I'm probably going to mispronounce it but

239
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:12,160
 it's called Tataari T-A-R-T-A-R-Y and I was reading in these mud flood blog posts and they're like

240
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:19,600
 yes Tataari was this multicultural any religion you wanted to milk and honey rivers advanced

241
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,600
 technology better than us humans this massive nation and we didn't like them so we wiped them

242
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,880
 out blah blah blah and every time I'm reading that I'm dismissing it as more more nonsense because

243
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,240
 I'm looking into this mud stuff I'm looking at that and as I was getting ready to release this

244
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,440
 episode a while back I typed in Tataari and I was like okay well I need to figure out more about

245
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:50,640
 this just as like a footnote god damn it if I didn't find 50 maps of the world from pre 1860

246
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,480
 that say grand Tataari on them and I was like okay episodes postponed I gotta look into this now

247
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:04,480
 map after map after map these ancient maps that have from halfway into China's borders

248
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:14,800
 all the way to basically Moscow they just say grand Tataari on them now this gets weird so

249
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:25,520
 grand Tataari is this idea that before the 1860s again before the 1860s people in Europe

250
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:33,040
 referred to anything east basically east of Moscow as Tatar it was kind of this catchall term for

251
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,120
 what was out there for the people that were out there and it was just like this thing and then

252
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,880
 after 1860s Russia it's all just kind of was called Russia now at first I'm thinking well that's

253
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:54,160
 kind of like how Persia exists and then like the 1930s Iran says we'd prefer to be called Iran we're

254
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,200
 not Persia anymore and everyone goes okay no we don't care we'll call you Iran because people in

255
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,800
 the area called themselves Iranians and Iran or some variation of that they're like we don't go by

256
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,760
 Persia anymore okay same thing orient that's a term that's fallen out of disuse so we do have

257
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:17,680
 places on maps that are fallout of disuse Tataari was basically considered a wild region full of

258
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:25,360
 Mongolians and a lot of Muslims it was mostly Muslim country out there and that's a thing that

259
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,760
 the conspiracy theory dismisses they're like no no no they weren't Muslim it was this multicultural

260
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,080
 great place that you could do anything you wanted with this advanced technology but it wasn't just

261
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,000
 Muslims but back then it was considered basically a Muslim stronghold we have drawings of their

262
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,760
 uniforms of their troops sometimes they're described as militia members sometimes they're

263
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:51,440
 described as an acting army we have impressions of what their flags look like there was a little

264
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,440
 article and this was on a mudflat website but they had a scan of a little article saying there was

265
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,360
 an opera currently being performed in six languages and it was like English Russian French Tataari

266
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,520
 I'm like what the hell is this and all this terminology for this area and for this region

267
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:15,120
 of people stopped being used in the 1860s just immediately fell out of vogue and I'm thinking

268
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:22,160
 as I'm reading this I'm constantly thinking of the Persian Iranian example where people who live

269
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,880
 in Iran that area is now called Iran so you have maps for John or the orient example as well you no

270
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,400
 longer have maps to say the orient and it's like the entire region now you have China and South

271
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,400
 Green stuff like that so it doesn't mean that the empire of the orients were wiped off the map and

272
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,040
 it was all hidden history and stuff like that at all it just means that maps have been redrawn but

273
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,880
 when I look at stuff like the flag and the uniforms I'm thinking what was out there what was out there

274
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,840
 but I don't think and I'm thinking and I'm like I don't think there was some grand empire wiped off

275
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:04,800
 the map but I have to keep looking I'm thinking there was no great I just I was like it was weird

276
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,480
 because I it was almost like cognitive dissonance like I'm thinking this can't be real the mud

277
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,800
 fled thing I'd already put to rest I'd already found it's to me sufficient answers of why buildings

278
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,920
 looked like that but now for me to have to look into a civilization that I've never heard of that

279
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:30,320
 used to take up one one half of Europe that was gone now I'm thinking it's just like the orient

280
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,880
 it's not an issue and then I found this and to be fair I did find it on a mud flood website but

281
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,840
 they have the link to the actual CIA document and I checked out it as well back in 1957 there was a

282
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,120
 CIA document written it was talking about the way that the Russians were treating the Muslims

283
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,440
 in the area how they basically at first said you guys are all welcome here you're going to welcome

284
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,000
 be here but how this at the point in 1957 the Soviet Union but how they were saying how they were

285
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,480
 actually subjugating the Muslim populations of the Soviet Union altogether and this is a document

286
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,280
 from written in 1957 from a CIA operative or researcher however you want to put it

287
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,640
 or let us take the matter of history which along with religion language and literature

288
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,560
 constitute the core of a people's cultural heritage here again the communists have interfered in a

289
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:33,600
 shameless matter for example on 9 august 1944 the central committee of the communist party

290
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,000
 sitting in Moscow issued a directive ordering the party's tartare provincial committee to

291
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,640
 proceed to a scientific revision of the history of tartarsia to liquidate serious shortcomings and

292
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,240
 mistakes of a nationalistic character committed by individual writers and historians in dealing with

293
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:00,560
 tartar history in other words tartar history was to be rewritten let us be frank was to be falsified

294
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,600
 in order to eliminate reference to great russian aggressions and to hide the facts of the real

295
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:13,120
 course of tartar russian relations and this was no isolated case in every muslim area within the

296
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,200
 ussr historians on orders of the communist party have rewritten history to distort the facts so

297
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,960
 that the russians appear always in a good light needless to say histories which present the facts

298
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,800
 truthfully have been withdrawn and destroyed so that the present and future generation of muslims

299
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,880
 are forever denied the chance of learning the true facts of their nations past

300
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:44,000
 i don't think that the great mud flood happened i think that there would be way too much evidence

301
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,800
 of that all over the world and there really isn't the evidence can easily be explained away by them

302
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:59,840
 having to redo the systems i think the idea that tartar or tartaria was a advanced civilization with

303
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,680
 way cool super epic mechs and like this awesome magic and this free energy and stuff like that and

304
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,800
 they're multicultural and blah all these buzzwords i think it's absolute trash i don't believe that

305
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:20,240
 at all but the idea that there was a nation within the past hundred years that was basically wiped

306
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:29,040
 off the planet and then actively suppressed to the point where the cia is talking about it in

307
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,600
 1957 i mean it could have been an alliance of city states type of thing so it they did have

308
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,760
 like flags and stuff like that in uniforms but it was never a great world power i'm sure there are a

309
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,080
 lot of countries and regions that have changed names over the years like the examples that i've

310
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,520
 previously given but something about it still that the the tartar part something about it still just

311
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:02,960
 doesn't sit right with me when i read when i was reading initially sites were like sites that were

312
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,400
 debunking it was like oh it's just this term that the western europeans made up because the place it

313
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,440
 sounds like a scary name it reminds them of greek mythology and and hell and so it was just some

314
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,280
 name they threw out there because it sounded spooky and they didn't know what was out there that was

315
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,560
 the dismissive part the people who believe that it was this great civilization they stole the virtues

316
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,320
 of this giant empire that used to exist to the point that napoleon and the czar had to team up

317
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:36,400
 to destroy them but it's weird because even the debunking stuff doesn't admit what the what the

318
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:45,440
 cia document does that these people did exist at some point and that the soviet union made a

319
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:54,800
 concentrated effort to remove them to change their history to rewrite it the thing that trips me out

320
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:02,720
 most about the grand tata re tatar empire however you want to call it is that i'm this is episode

321
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:11,680
 what like 183 184 i've debunked a lot of stuff and there's a lot of iceberg conspiracy theories

322
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,840
 where i say i don't think this is true but this is what i think the theory is let's just put on our

323
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,200
 little imagination caps and run with it but this one not the mudflat again that part's ridiculous

324
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,280
 but the idea that there was a nation that was wiped off the planet and out of the history books

325
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:34,320
 and if i if you ask me right now dismissing the mudflat i think that's been thoroughly debunked

326
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,040
 but if you asked me right now jason do you believe that there used to be a nation in europe

327
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:50,720
 called to tar with its own culture people uniforms flags language that covered most of the continent

328
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:59,120
 and was wiped off the map and out of the history books since 1860 jason do you believe that conspiracy

329
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:11,760
 theory i have to honestly answer with i don't know dead rabbit radio at gmail.com is going to be
