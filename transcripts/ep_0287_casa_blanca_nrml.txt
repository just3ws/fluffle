 A beautiful bandit, a mysterious family, and a UFO story so bizarre even veteran UFOologists
 have a hard time believing it. What happened in 1955 in a sleepy little town in California?
 Were they invaded by aliens only children could see today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's actually only about two hours
 since I finished the last podcast. Most of you guys know I work three jobs every so often.
 Someone has to take a vacation at one of the jobs and I cover form. It's once in a blue moon,
 but starting this week into next week and a little bit of the week after that,
 I'm working all three jobs every single day. So try to get these episodes out when I can get them
 out. And that's one of the good things about doing a solo podcast. I just want to get them out once a
 day for you guys. So if anything absolutely earth-shattering has happened from the time I'm
 recording this to the time you hear it, it's not because I ignored it, didn't know what happened
 yet. I'm recording this at 11 o'clock at night. But let's go ahead and jump right into this one.
 I'll keep my energy level up for you. I'm drinking my diet mountain dew, choice of a generation.
 So hop on board. Let's use the Jason Jalopy. So throw your bags in the back. This is going to be a
 long journey. We're going to have, bring a sleeping bag, some popcorn. I don't know why popcorn.
 Bring food. That was what I'm saying. Bring yourself some food or some delicious beverages from
 PepsiCo only because they sponsor the show. No Coke. No Mr. Pib. No Dr. Pepper either. That's
 just disgusting. Prune juice flavored soda. Get in the car. And also they don't sponsor us for
 legal reasons. That was a joke. We're driving down the road. Beep, beep. Keep your hand off the horn.
 Only I can press the horn. Drive another road. And we're pulling up to Sugarland, Texas.
 This just happened August 23rd, 2019. So this happened on Friday, last Friday. It's 825.
 The darkest time of night when all the spooky stuff happens. 825 is quite early for this type of
 activity. We're parked across the street in our Jason Jalopy eating. You brought snacks. I'm eating
 them too. You're like Jason. I'm like, I thought you were on keto. I'm like, I'm trying to break.
 Doritos. So as I'm swelling up and some gaining 10 pounds of water weight from just eating one
 Dorito, we're looking across the street and there's a place. There's like a parking lot.
 And we see this hot woman hops out of the car. And you're like Jason, you have to objectify her.
 Yes, I do because that's the point of the story. Now give me some more Doritos.
 You see this hot woman hop out of the car. Blonde hair, pink blouse, yoga pants. You're
 taking a look. Hold on. This is important for the story. This is important for the story.
 And also it's not just my fantasy. This is on surveillance video. Hot blonde hops out of the
 car. Hair blowing in the wind. Beat of sweat moving down her chest. No, so anyways, we see on
 surveillance video this blonde woman gets out of her Mercedes SUV, walks over to a building,
 tries opening the door, goes back to her SUV, gets a portable power saw and begins cutting through
 the window because she's breaking into the Botox RN MD Spa. It's a place where they injected
 Botox into people's faces. Makes your face all tight, gets rid of the wrinkles. She cut her way
 in and stole a bunch of Botox and then gets in her Mercedes SUV, just drives away. They don't know
 who it is. They have no suspects. She's not wearing a mask. She's just walking up in her pink blouse.
 She looks like she just got done picking up the kids or, hey, I'm not going to be sexist. Maybe
 she just got done buying a business. Maybe she's a CEO. I don't know. Maybe she's president of
 the United States, Jason. Don't be sexist. So nobody knows who this woman is, but anyways,
 she gets in her car and she drives away. Now I will say this though, police of Sugarland, Texas.
 My personal, if I was a cop, I would just look for women who look permanently surprised. Their
 eyebrows are all lifted. No wrinkles. They'd be like, where were you Friday night? She's like,
 no emotion on her face. Actually, she'd be really good in interrogation room because you wouldn't
 be able to read her face. It would be full of a deadly disease and she shows no emotions. Just
 constantly looks like she's in shock. I'm arrested versus hello. I guess your voice doesn't change.
 Anyways, so be on the lookout, residents of Sugarland, Texas. An attractive woman
 may actually have a face like her entire body at this point. It's just 90% Botox and she's coming
 for you. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Hop back in the Jason Jalopy. We are driving
 to a place that was recommended to me by Andrew. Andrew via Gmail sent me this recommendation.
 We are going to Yucca, Ipa, Yucca, Yucca, Ipa, California. So we're going there. We're going
 to, we're just call it the Big U. We're going to the Big U out in California. I'm driving up. Now
 actually, it's perfect. We're in the Jason Jalopy for this story because this story requires you
 to be in a car. So we stopped at that gas station. You bought some beef jerky, right? Okay, awesome.
 You're like, Jason, you have a Patreon now. You can afford your own food. I was like,
 I'm putting the gas in, man. So anyways, we drive up to outside of this house. There's a specific
 house in the Big U, Yucca Paya, and it's an urban legend come true, video proof of this house. And
 what happened was it started off in the area and then it spread to the internet and then things
 got really bad. If you pull up to this particular house in Yucca Paya, you're driving your car,
 you park in front of it, and a bunch of people come out of the house. Now you're thinking that's
 not unusual. And so it's funny because it's so mundane, but at the same time,
 it's very, very bizarre when you kind of step back and think about it. People will drive up to this
 house and park outside the house. And then a bunch of people come outside the house. That's the story.
 That's the story. That's the story of Yucca Paya. They're technically called the Yucca Paya
 Watchers. So that makes it sound like really sinister, but that's it. You drive in front of a house
 and people come out. And what's okay? So if someone just said, "Hey dude, did you know that if you drive
 down this spooky street during the day in the middle of the day and park in someone else's parking
 spot, someone's gonna come out of the house?" You'd be like, "That's the dumbest urban legend I've
 ever heard." But the reason why Andrew sent this to me, it's because these guys don't just come out
 of their house. They come out like four or five deep and begin screaming at people in their cars.
 So there's tons of YouTube videos of people, you know, just dumb kids driving in front of this house
 and they just park. And then like four dudes come barreling out of the house. They're all like
 donkey kong. They're like, "Get out of the house!" So they've made themselves into a target for people
 to just park the car any time of the day. And that's why they call the watchers. They don't just
 watch, but they know when you're there. People are like, "We think they have cameras." Probably,
 probably. But it's one of those, I mean, again, it's they've made themselves a target for people
 parking in their front yard, which seems so not even in the front yard. They're not driving up on
 the grass. They're like, "Oh, my petunias!" It's like they just park the car. The problem is,
 is it's gotten to the point where people in the neighborhood are like, "Hey, look at these local
 weirdos." Like in Bay Area, I've talked about him before. We have that guy named Joe Trombone,
 who's this crazy schizophrenic hobo who just rapped all the time. Local legend. But in Yucapaya,
 you have people going, "Hey, man, those guys, they run out of their house when you're parked."
 And then people started doing it on YouTube and then people started coming from all over California
 to videotape themselves. I'm surprised Jake Paul hasn't done a video with these guys yet.
 It's become this thing. And they call the cops all the time. So now you run the risk of being
 arrested for parking your car. And this was a total flashback for me. I read this short story.
 I watched a couple videos about the Yucapaya Watchers and then I read this story.
 I'll try to make it shorter. It's kind of, let's see how long this goes.
 "I don't know how many of you heard of the Yucapaya Watchers. But don't ever go there."
 They were pretty famous on YouTube. Here's the legend. That's their word. Legend has it.
 "If you go by there any time day or night, the people who live there will come out of the house
 and confront you and talk." Beep. Beep that up. People listen to the show at work.
 "Me and my friends went there and just like they say, they immediately misspelled.
 Immediately come outside. It was two in the morning. So the beep started walking to the vehicle
 with a full, flesh sasch light." I really shouldn't make fun of people spelling because of my
 pronunciations but a flesh sasch light shone on us and started talking. Beep.
 "He took down our plate and called the cops." I guess. I probably could have read that more
 smooth. "He took down our plate and called the cops I guess and we got pulled over on our way back
 to the freeway. The officer said she knew we were at the Watchers and knew we filmed it and blah
 blah so they checked us." This is my favorite part. This reminded me of me being in my 20s.
 I loved it. It just had this like, this put a smile on my face when I read this last sentence.
 "So they checked us all and looked for any excuse to arrest us since driving by a house isn't really
 illegal. Long story short, my friend had one Tylenol 3 on him that he doesn't have a prescription for
 so they arrested him. Don't ever effing go there." Now I'm not happy that the kid got arrested
 obviously but I remember being such a stupid knucklehead kid and just doing dumb stuff and
 you'd be driving with your buddies and the one kid has a single pill. I don't know why I find that
 so funny. It's just such a flashback to what people do as kids that are idiots. So yes,
 I don't think the moral of the story is don't go to the Ucopie Watchers. Don't have prescriptions,
 even a single pill on you if you're going to do something semi-legal. But so the legend is this,
 is that the Ucopie Watchers are like satanic cult or they're meth dealers like they have something
 to protect. I just think they're weirdos who have attracted more weirdness to them because
 of the way they react stuff. So thank you Andrew for the recommendation but looking into it I don't
 think there's anything sinister going on. I just think they're lunatics for legal reasons. A legend
 lunatics who have like maybe they're think they're gangstaught or but the thing is is like every
 time they react in a crazy way more and more people want to go out there because they see these
 crazy videos. So it keeps going on. The legend that I think is going to happen is they're going to
 end up shooting somebody or there's going to be a serious fight because the people drive away real
 quick when they get nearby. They're like man that was close everyone take their tight little three oh
 it feels so groovy now. Driving away but yeah I don't know. I think it's an interesting local
 legend and because of things like YouTube it's become far far more popular. I mean like sometimes
 you can engage in behavior that makes you more likely to become an urban legend like the Ucopie
 people. Okay so we're driving away from Ucopie. They're chasing us down the street. I'm like oh
 good thing I still have all this pain medication on me. You're like Jason no you're driving. I'm
 like you take the wheelie. I'm just going to lay in the back seat for a while and be constipated
 and you're like where are we going Jason? I just can't drive the Jason Jalopy wherever I want or
 can I and you try to take it back in time but I'm like no no no don't do that. Only I can
 activate the magical powers of the Jason Jalopy. We are going to Casablanca and you're like yes
 played against Sam. No we're going to Casablanca in 1955. You're like yes is that when the movie
 came out? I'm like no actually I don't know when that movie came out. I'm going to come out in 1955.
 No we're going to Casablanca, California. So we're almost there. We're going to Riverside County
 so go ahead hit that button right there. Take us back to the year 1955.
 Car, the car does not sound that smooth. It actually sputters and barely gets us to 1955
 Casablanca, California and I'm going to tell you a story. I'm going to tell you a story.
 It was a beautiful day in the neighborhood. Two p.m. Kids are out playing, flying kites,
 eating apples, having fun. There's a group of eight kids wrestling. Well technically only two of
 them are wrestling but the other six are like fight fight fight and we have a dude named Kermit
 Douglas. His whole body's all oiled up ready to go and then an unnamed kid who I imagine he's wearing
 like a unit's heart he's like come get some big chest hair they're wrestling in Kermit's yard
 and then they hear a ping kids look up in the sky and they see a dome like a silvery it was like
 silvery and translucent dome in the sky and he goes ping disappears and then they hear a ping
 and they see what looks like a flying saucer but it's flying sideways so it's like stationary but
 it looks like a circle in the sky and they're said they could see light bending around the edges of it
 at this point Kermit's like come on let's go let's go everyone else is looking at these things
 Kermit's like what he looks up he sees it and he's like oh I better stop wrestling ping disappears
 ping the dome appears ping disappears ping sideways flying saucer appears ping
 disappears and the two vehicles started going ping ping ping appearing and disappearing appearing
 and disappearing in front of these kids now one of the kids is like this is not good I'm out and he
 runs away and he runs home and he tells mom mom there's some pinging out there you got to come out
 and see what's in the sky now of course she's probably like oh great gotten to his dad's acid
 again but she's like looks out the window she's like I don't see nothing and the kid's like oh mom
 he runs back to join his friends to see if this is still going on his mom couldn't see anything though
 he goes back and he goes hey so what happened with those UFO things and the kids go in unison all
 seven of them go we don't just so can they go they went away you rent to go tell your parents and
 then they just disappeared and the kids like oh shucks what do you want to do now you want to
 kick the can and then ping the dome appears again ping and they start alternating the end and the
 kids are like oh okay now now this is creepy because at the first point they're thinking oh you know
 maybe we're seeing something wrong maybe it's a UFO but once the kid went to go tell their parent
 and it went away it's almost like a stranger in the bushes like hey you want to come play with me
 I'm gonna go tell my mom and then he like leaves gets in his van drives away but then you come back
 and you're like oh mom doesn't care you go back he crawls back on the bushes that's creepy so the
 fact that he left to go tell his parents made it stop they're like oh it's kind of a stranger
 danger right and they didn't have a stranger danger back then lights are blinking ships are
 coming in and out of existence and then they see the dome ship go 1950s 1950 sound effects it's like
 bobbling like it's attached to a string they see it land in a football field about a half block
 from kermit's house and she goes it's hovering about three feet off the ground so they're like
 come on guys goonies never quit or whatever that stupid saying is they start never say die whatever
 they're running through the yard to get to where the dome is and then they see it they all turn to
 their left or right it doesn't matter it's by kermit's house they see an alien and they describe
 this alien as this it had like a roundish head like a normal normal head big red round eyes
 taking up a good portion of its face a big red round mouth it didn't have a nose it had four
 little dots kind of spaced around its cheeks and they said they shimmered like diamonds
 it had arms little arms moving around but it had no legs its body actually tapered off like
 Casper the ghost so i know what you're thinking at this point i know what you're thinking at this
 point Jason this is kind of creepy and it's quite bizarre we haven't even gotten started yet so they're
 looking at this Casper ghost just kind of floating there wavy arms just kind of hovering there right
 it's wearing a belt like all ghosts it has to have a fashion accessory it has his belt with a giant
 like mirror type piece of metal on it super bright the kids are like oh i can't see i can't see and
 then one of the kids in the group is like looking at the alien and he's like yeah that's nothing
 he looks at the dome UFO in the in the football field and he goes that's the most beautiful thing
 i've ever seen and he starts walking towards the domed UFO and two of the but everyone's staring
 at this ghost he's not chill and not a ghost whatever whatever it was alien ghost maybe the
 ghost of an alien who knows anyways this thing's floating around the corner there and everyone's
 staring at that one kid leaves the group starts walking over there two of the older kids see what's
 going to happen see him walking towards the ship they have to run they have to tackle the kid they
 can't keep him from walking towards the ship once they tackle him multiple UFOs began appearing in
 the neighborhood one lands on a nearby roof of a house one knocks off the branch of a tree
 a walnut tree to be specific and then one seems to fly by and shoot out some sort of ray
 now at this point the kids are screaming out loud because they've seen the alien guy hanging
 around the corner they've had to tackle one of their buddies all these things are blinking in
 and out of existence their parents and other people in the neighborhood come out to see what's going
 on and they don't see anything they don't see a little ghost man mommy mommy know there's a guy
 over there he has a weird belt buckle ah it's blinding me it's blinding me she looks over there
 it's a shrub with a shiny ant on it she's like oh that's just an ant they don't see the UFOs flying
 around they don't see the landed UFO they just see their kids like freaking out in the front yard
 the parents have no idea what they're looking at but these UFOs are bing bing bing flying all around
 dudes are getting tackled kermit's ready to wrestle an alien all the kids are freaking out
 and then one of the kids turns around and in a you got all this chaos going around right
 he turns around and out of thin air he sees an arm just like cut off at the shoulder it's like the
 rest of the body is invisible and there's just an arm reaching out of reality and it's beckoning
 him towards it it'd be like if you cut a hole through a curtain and stuck your arm through it
 but that curtain happened to be existence and it wasn't a alien arm it wasn't a human arm it was a
 metallic armored arm and it's just beckoning a child over towards it now there's drawings of the
 arm and what it reminded me of is you know how we'll put our not we because we're not professionals
 but you know how professionals will put their arms in those things to kind of control like radioactive
 isotopes and like move aids from one vial to another they have to use like those mechanical arms
 or they at least put their hands in gloves and you know like you see them in movies where they're
 like reaching into a box that's what it looked like but it was this like metal sleeve over an arm
 with fingers beckoning the kid over he doesn't go he doesn't he's like i'm not going over there the
 arm's like snaps its fingers it's like dang it it disappears a dude appears in the field and other
 kids looking out in the field and there's just some guy now there's just some random normal looking
 human walk he was considered he was called a strange man so it wasn't one of the ghost guys
 this is all happening in the middle afternoon by the way there's a man walking around now by the
 ufo he pulls out two guns he goes jew jew doesn't make the noises actually shoots two kids and they
 get paralyzed now i know what you're thinking at this point because i was thinking the same thing
 i can understand if the if the parents walked outside and the kids are like oh no it's an alien
 and the kids the parents look around the corner and they go that's weird there's nothing there my
 kids must just be imagining stuff but if you were a parent and you walked outside and your kids are
 running around they're going oh my god no aliens are getting us i would think they were playing
 around if i saw a branch fall off of a walnut tree you're like oh no my walnuts if i saw a branch
 get knocked off a walnut tree if i saw two kids running and then go paralyzed and hit the ground
 i'm not going to be like oh those those rap scallions oh they're just playing around i'd be like
 oh you know that they always play that game loss of central nervous system oh it's just an
 old thing we used to play that as kids too you would go oh no there's some sort of emergency going on
 but apparently okay so let me finish the story let me finish the story so two kids get shot with
 paralysis ray and i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you this right now before i keep going this isn't
 from backpackerverse this story is from several reputable ufo sources not even just websites but
 from ufo literature okay so it's there's no twist to the ending where i'm like surprised i found out
 it was invented in 2018 no this story goes back to 1955 when it was reported so where did i leave
 off because it still isn't even the weirdest part yet two kids get paralyzed walnut tree is
 destroyed or branch broken off you have the mechanical arm still we're coming up to this is
 the my favorite part this is hands down my favorite part so now the ship the dome ship in the distance
 a portal opens up like a little doorway right and out comes another alien now this alien looks has
 the same head as the alien who was hiding behind the corner has the big red eyes big red mouth a
 little diamond little like red things that sparkle like diamonds but he has two arms but at the elbow
 it becomes two more arms so he has four hand like four four arms four hands on each like he has a
 like a shoulder to elbow and then the arm splits and his body doesn't taper down like a little
 caster ghost he has four tendrils he just kind of hovers above the ground upside of the ship he's
 just hovering above the ground with his weirdo arms and his weirdo legs and then there's a kid
 there we have a names a few of these kids we had kermit we have this kid his name is ronnie stricklin
 he said that the alien telepathically told him hey go climb that tree we'll pick you up in 15 minutes
 and he's like yes master yes and he starts walking towards the tree now an other kid as well must
 have gotten the command because an other kid starts walking towards the tree with ronnie now you have
 all of this chaos going on so kids are trying to just not get paralyzed themselves trying to save
 their walnut trees they're like this is for my science fair project no everyone's it's basically
 every man for themselves so they don't see what ronnie and this other kid are doing at first
 but they do end up climbing a tree and they sit up there for 15 minutes so this story supposedly
 took place between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. this was going on i know i've been kind of saying then this
 happens and this happens supposedly all of these events took three hours from beginning to end
 these must be the worst parents in the world who they're like oh yeah you know kids love to play
 the same game for three hours i love to play paralyzed on the ground that's such a popular game
 they saw on leave it for beaver oh they love playing that game where they're just petrified
 pointing at nothing going please mommy help me oh it's such a great game this goes on for three
 hours so they are waiting up in the tree for 15 minutes and then you still have this core group
 of kids and they're trying to get this is my favorite part of the story they're trying to get the kids
 down from the tree they're like no ronnie no other kid get down get down from the tree i don't know
 if it's the same tree as the walnut tree that would be hilarious the other branches getting ready to
 break they're like no no i eat walnuts i have to forge those before winter we're going to hibernation
 and their kids are just sitting up in the tree so then after 15 minutes a ufo comes down and they
 said it's shaped like Saturn so it had like a ball in the middle and this ring around it okay this
 is so great i love this oh did i tell you i didn't i did i should say this right now um put you in a
 little bit of suspense here but i want to make sure i give credit i have read this story this weekend
 and then just the other day chop top on youtube said hey have you ever heard the story of the
 casablanca entities and i was like i just read that story but i wanted to give him credit so chop
 top thank you for recommending this story he definitely sped it along i probably would have
 waited a little bit longer to do this but i want to give i want to give you guys credit when credit
 is due so back to the story there's this hovering ball there's this ball with like this Saturn like
 ring right and Ronnie and this other kid are standing in this tree sitting in this tree now
 little dudes a little little Martian guys are now walking out of the ufo and they're like hanging
 off of the Saturn ring reaching for the boys they're like come on get in the ship get in the ship
 and Ronnie and the other kid are like hypnotically trying to reach for the aliens
 and their friends are like oh my god we're about to watch your friends get kidnapped go to another
 planet so how do you get kids out of a tree how do you let me rephrase it how do you quickly get
 kids out of the tree my scenario would be just throw stuff at them but i'm an adult so i could
 throw hard enough to knock a kid out of a tree i could be like oh this rock will do it and just
 like hit him in the ribs and be like but a kid can't throw that hard so they go and they grab a hose
 right they go and they grab a hose and they're like hit it and they turn the water on and they
 shoot him they're in a tree they're blasting these kids with the hose thinking actually
 they're not trying to knock the kids out of the tree they're trying to wake them up so don't throw
 rocks if a kid is hypnotized in a tree they start blasting their friends with this hose
 and Ronnie's like what he wakes up from his hypnosis and he sees these little guys like
 hanging off of the ship and they're like we'll get you next time and Ronnie climbs down the tree
 but the other kid is still hypnotized and they're just blasting this kid with this hose and then
 and then finally he does he falls he falls out of the tree the aliens can't get him so he falls
 out of the tree and then floats through i love this he falls out of the tree he doesn't hit the
 ground he floats across the yard and lands on a roof lands on a roof safely so somehow he fell
 he started fall he levitates he goes back up because the tree is not as tall as the house
 i'm assuming unless it's this giant tree he falls out of the tree he slowly levitates he ends up
 on the top of the house walks off the house he walks off the house after just being magically
 levitated across the yard these kids are watching their friend they're about to see him fall out of
 the tree they're like oh no and then something catches him he slowly glides through the air they're
 like oh good and then he just takes a step and falls off the house he lands on his head he falls off
 a two-story house presumably even a one-story house but he falls off the house he lands right on his
 head and then all the UFOs disappear so that is the story of the Casablanca entities and i'm
 reading that i read about it on the cryptopia website which has been a huge resource for this
 show in the past like week or two i found a lot of great stories from that and i read it and i go
 this there's no way this story is true and i actually had a really hard time finding backup
 resources for it and i thought this is the only site where i could find the story i go this is
 the most likely fake or the author's just having a joke maybe there's an april fool's story or
 something like that but i spent like the past two days every so often i'd kind of go back to it
 looking for references and he mentioned a couple authors and he's like this UFO author covered
 this story but he wasn't really saying what sources i could find it at and so right before i decided
 to do this story today because i was talking to chop-top on youtube decided to do the story today
 and originally i was going to say there's only one source for this it's this one website but
 i went back revisited his article found the name of an author typed in that name of the
 ardor Casablanca entities found a paper he wrote that includes this story along with very well
 known UFO story the kelly hopkins story the hopkinsville story or whatever kelly's what it
 doesn't matter it's a little goblin story that's fairly well known that there's a house and a
 bunch of goblins attack it kelly hopskin it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the point is is that as
 stupid as the story is it's very very obscure but it is listed with by it is written about by
 reputable authors once i was able to get that author's name a bunch of resources popped up i
 think Casablanca is just such a generic name it was really hard to find this stuff but once i was
 able to match Casablanca to the author's name found article after article after article detailing
 this stuff from again established UFO websites so is this story true again i don't want to sound
 like a broken record but either they're making it up someone else made it up they're misinterpreting
 real life events or it's true i think those are always the four things we can look at with this
 type of story there's no evidence we could go out to see if there's a walnut tree with no branch
 but let's assume just for the sake of fun that it's true because again we can't really prove it
 either way there is a i had to read this article multiple times and i had to read a bunch of resources
 on it there is a through line in this story that makes it genuinely terrifying every single thing
 that the aliens do let's presume they're aliens every single thing the aliens do once they show up
 is to divide and conquer the ghost shown up around the corner of the house distracted all the kids
 so the one kid would start walking towards the ship and while people were focusing on getting the
 kid from walking towards the ship the mechanical arm appeared to the one child beckoning him over
 there the alien comes out with the guns to paralyze two kids whittling their number down from eight
 to six you had the two kids hypnotized instead of hypnotizing all of them it was almost like they
 simply wanted any one of those children no one was the particular target but it was all about
 distraction and attraction it was a hunt the fact that the parents couldn't see anything makes it even
 more creepy because what child wants to live in a world where they are surrounded by dangers that
 are invisible to the people who can protect them the most this story has never been replicated as
 far as i know there's never been such a massive alien presence in a neighborhood really in two
 yards in a football field and a home there's nothing that parallels this why did this happen
 in that neighborhood has it happened since or before but more importantly is that a viable
 hunting strategy i mean it could have worked in almost any other location a campsite where a kid
 is lured off into the bushes another neighborhood where kids don't play in groups but just a kid
 walking home alone that's terrifying because it doesn't seem like they're after anyone particular
 it seems like they were the alien equivalent of a human predator any child will do
 so for all the fun and all the ridiculous stuff that happens in that story that's the terrifying
 throughline they were hunting and they came close several times but hunters rarely give up
 they may move where they hunt they may change tactics but eventually
 they'll bring home that trophy dead rabbit radio gmail.com is going to be our email address you
