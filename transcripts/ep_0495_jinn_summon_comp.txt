 Has the internet uncovered the path towards summoning your own jinn?
 And then we take a look at a man whose father told him many stories growing up of being abducted by aliens and
 Having a religious experience with them. Is there any truth to these stories? Is it possible that all aliens?
 worship the same God today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 *music*
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover. It's day two of Alien Disclosure Week
 Yes, we're here called the UFO Disclosure Week. It doesn't matter stuff is getting disclosed one way or the other first off
 Let's give a shout out to our newest patreon supporter Nate
 Nate thank you so much for supporting the show. You are going to be our captain this episode
 I may refer to you as Nate dog. Hopefully you're fine with that. Hopefully you know who it is
 It's definitely a compliment from me because I love Nate dog rest in peace
 If you can't support the patreon that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show
 That really really helps out a lot and I actually want to highlight this I have a Google alerts set up for Dead Rabbit Radio
 But it only pops up once a week
 because otherwise it goes off all day long because
 Every time I put out a podcast it goes to all these different websites and things like that
 So a lot of times I don't see time stuff that pops up on time
 So Nate as you stand there dutifully with your arms and a wet your side or something
 I don't know crossed you just kind of standing there waiting for your turn to drive one of vehicles
 Let me read this post I found it pops up on my Google alert too late, but I want to read this post
 I found on the export. It's a titled dead rabbit radio. I did not write this
 I did not write this but somebody did and I wanted to address this a dead rabbit radio and here's what it said
 I miss it bros. I can't wait till Monday if you're here Jason. Hey friend
 I am thankful for your show and it makes me happy life has been hard lately, but dead rabbit radio is real good
 I'm not saying that because it's complimentary towards me
 I wouldn't be reading it if it was insulting, but there was a there's a key point in that and I get this in emails all
 The time I actually got a similar comment from a YouTube username
 34.qg7 just today
 That they're having trouble with their life that life is hard
 That things haven't been going well for them that they're lonely or sad or whatever and guys
 It makes me feel so good to know that I can help you out in that way
 Because we're all we
 One like being into ghosts and stuff like that like sometimes you can find like ghost buddies
 physical corporeal beings other humans that are into ghost or paranormal or Bigfoot and stuff like that
 But a lot of times it's pretty solitary right a lot of times. It's maybe an internet community and things like that
 So I'm glad that I can kind of be
 Be out there be out there in this audio realm
 To be your friend to be your your buddy your your
 You know what I mean like that made me I get so many emails or people are telling me
 That the show makes them happy and that to me is the biggest compliment
 That really to me is the biggest compliment for the show. So whoever you are anonymous person
 It's back the show is back. It's not going away anytime soon and to everyone who's ever emailed me
 Saying that they're not doing good that they've been having a bad week or a bad month or bad year or whatever it is
 I'm glad that I can be a little bit of
 making it better
 Making it better
 So I just wanted to acknowledge that because I get that comment a lot and I'm glad I can kind of
 Do my little part to make your day at least for maybe half hour a little bit more fun a little bit more fun
 You're not alone. You're not alone. There's millions of people out there just like you you just haven't met them yet
 But you will you'll be really good friends when you do
 Nate let's fire up at Jason Jalopy
 We are driving down to Los Angeles this I mean I got a ton of stuff to cover today
 We're driving down you found breathless. We're driving down to Los Angeles right now. So as we're driving LA
 Let me give you a little bit of this in two or ten different things at once right now
 I'm all feeling that reports and you're looking for UFOs and like giving you a hug so you don't feel so sad and Nate's like
 Where's my hug? We're going to LA at September 7th, 1973
 And we're gonna go see the Johnny Carson show at the Tonight Show is what it is
 So it was the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson
 I'm old enough that I actually watched it when it was on the air not this episode not that old
 But I remember watching it in the 80s yesterday
 I talked on the episode saying that for a long time talking about aliens talking about UFOs
 It was you were ridiculed for it
 Nowadays you can have your own web group or you can actually have your own YouTube channel and and even if you're not doing that
 Even if you're an officer speaking in front of Congress or something like that. It's not as jokingly
 Courage as it used to be and I want to play this clip as an example for this
 What I'm about to play you it's Muhammad Ali famous boxer Muhammad Ali
 He's on the Tonight Show and he's acting a little kind of reserved and Johnny Carson kind of picks up on it
 So he asks him like, you know, what's going on? That's what kind of the lead-up is to this clip
 Quite reserved tonight. I've been studying UFOs. Did you know there are UFOs out here flying around?
 This would be the place for him Southern California
 I'm seriously sighted a bunch over Georgia. I've seen him at night
 They have real photos of him and the government and the people just completely seem like don't talk about it
 But mr. Harold Salkin of Washington DC is head of the National UFO
 Bureau
 brought me moving films
 I actually have moving pictures of little saucers of gray steel objects coming into pictures that people took and I'm just surprised
 They don't know that talk more about it something they can another great insight into the fight game
 I read that but did you read the thing last night on the news? No, it's on physicists said there's two things to address there
 It appears that that was the first thing really Muhammad Ali is saying in that clip other than like hey
 He starts talking about this UFO thing and he's kind of like this is what I wanted to talk about
 Sitting next to him is the heavyweight champion Ken Norton
 they're doing publicity for their upcoming heavyweight fight rematch and
 Ken Norton's just kind of sitting there shocked the whole time the whole clip is about three minutes long and I had the links in the show
 Not to recommend listening to that but that laughter
 That laughter even what you have Muhammad Ali
 World famous boxer
 Saying yeah, you know, this is something I want to talk about I want to talk about you talk about UFOs and that laughter and you can
 Tell half of it is nervous laughter because they don't know the audience doesn't know how to react to it
 But the other half is laughing at him. That's really what it used to be like for the UFO community
 You don't get their reaction much anymore. You can have post Malone who I'm pretty sure is haunting my apartment at this point
 I'll do that story tomorrow's episode because I'm still doing some research on that
 But you can have post Malone and I think it's also picking the audiences back then you had a general talk show
 You went on there and then after that after Muhammad Ali gets off you'd have like a dancing cat
 It was just kind of a general talk show nowadays post Malone can go on
 H3H3 or Joe Rogan and they'll talk about UFOs and one there's no audience there
 You don't get that instant reaction
 But two I think one people are more open to it and you can pick your audiences when you talk about it
 That's what it used to be like though and that takes guts
 Now it probably caught him a little off guard when they first started laughing but like I said the clip goes on for three minutes
 He just keeps talking about and Johnny Carson kind of he's a little dismissive at the beginning
 But then he actually goes oh, you know
 I read this article saying that it may be satellites falling and stuff like that
 There's like this back and forth between them as far as that goes, but it was
 Completely hostile you had a hostile audience when you talked about this stuff back then this was in 1973
 September 7th 1973 as opposed to today
 So it really took guts to talk about this stuff when a heavyweight boxer is getting
 Laughed at and mocked on national television
 Imagine someone who just saw UFO and they're in their small town and they're like hey
 I think I saw something weird last night. I don't know what it was
 Imagine that reaction, but it's your peers and you're in your small town diner
 So that's what that was like Nate. Let's leave behind LA Muhammad Ali's like no no
 Take me take me to a future where people will believe me. We're like no, sorry, dude
 You got you got fights to win or lose. I don't really know his record
 But I don't know if he won that fight, but he was were speeding away. He's like do I win?
 Do I win this fight? I don't know. We're not sports people at least I'm not we're driving away Nate. Let's go to
 Spooky bedroom. I don't know. Maybe it's your bedroom. That's spooky. I'm pretty sure my bedroom is haunted by post Malone
 Even though he's still alive something weird is going on. We're elite. We're not going to my bedroom
 That's tomorrow's episode. Let's just go to your bedroom, but it's super spooky like you've put up like crepe paper and
 It's like black and red and you've lit some candles
 That's what your bedroom normally looks like and we are going to look at a
 Ritual I found this on Reddit. I found this on Reddit
 It is supposedly so I always like to say that because I want to give credit to the person who brings it to my attention
 This was from a user named bill feiny. So we're sitting in your bedroom. Thank you bill whoever you are
 We're sitting in your spooky spooky bedroom
 And we're going to look at something that he supposedly found from a book called the miraculous aspects of things
 Existing supposedly according to this reddit post. This is a book that was written by Zachariah L.
 Cosweeney in the
 1200s so long long time ago if you don't have a calendar if you don't have a calendar in front of you just take my word for it
 The 1200s is farther back than the
 2020s apparently this is a text that actually shows you how to summon a gin
 Now gin, you know one of the biggest things I see in the party
 I can't say it's the biggest thing I see but it pops up a lot in paranormal world. The one thing that pops up a lot is
 How do I get wishes?
 It's funny because you think about it. That is the
 Wanting to have a wish fulfilled and wanting to be able to go back in time and change things
 It's like an it's like a basic human need
 It's so weird to think that you know if you I think I talked about this like on episode 40 of this podcast
 If you went back to like old timey England like the 1400s
 And they're like using sickles and stuff to like chop hay up and like pet and sheep
 Do instead of using the sickles on the sheep. You know, they're like, oh, you know, what would be totally awesome
 I heard back in the the thousands things were way cooler people are dressing all in retro thousand clothes
 They're like, I don't know. I don't know what clothes they wore in the 1400s
 But you know what I mean like people always look backwards with like sepia colored glasses or they didn't have glass glasses
 Wasn't invented back then so they just looked back and go, you know what?
 I'm sure I wish I lived in the times of the Arthurian legends. That's what they were thinking
 They're like back when knights actually fought for good instead of like beating up peasants and nostalgia is a thing
 I'm sure you could even go back to like the bee season. They're like, ah, I don't know
 Maybe maybe there's a limit because you have to have some sort of record of the past
 You're gonna be sitting in your hovel in
 Grease and you're like, ah, dude things were way better back
 I'm guessing cuz things suck so bad now. I'm just guessing anytime before now is better
 But anyway, so time travel wish fulfillment very very basic human needs
 So that is a very lengthy introduction to this. I said I have a lot to cover and I'm seeming to ramble more than often
 Here's this. Here's your instructions. Get a pen and paper. You write this down
 before sunrise
 But but but before you start writing stuff down realize you will be summoning a gin if you follow these instructions
 So maybe not spooky spooky bedroom. You got a I'll give you a single light
 So you can write stuff down or you can use your cell phone because you don't live in the PCs
 Before sunrise you have to practice solitude and quiet and then at night
 So this is like the day before so it takes a couple days preparation
 So you wake up one morning you practice solitude and quiet and then that night you pray and praise God
 So this might not work for atheists although I
 Would be kind of weird when atheists are trying to summon a gin and expect it to happen
 They're like, I don't believe in anything except this thing. I heard on a podcast before sunrise
 I'm sure do atheists believe in ghosts actually not that I think about it. I know do they?
 Like I guess like they probably believe in Bigfoot
 That's for that's another episode. That's that's another episode
 I could see an atheist believe in an aliens
 But I don't get an atheist believe because at what point you're like, ooh that ghost
 That's real, but then it's if it becomes like a wraith or a demon you're like
 It's ghosts ghosts all the way down like I don't I don't know actually that's a good question
 But the question that will be answered on a later episode has nothing to do with this one except
 Except you'll be summoning a gin and to do this you have to praise God. So that's why that comes up
 Could you praise God if you could you fake it fake it till you make it fake it till you make a gin
 Before sunrise you practice solitude and quiet and then that night you pray and praise God the next day
 You're gonna fast, but before you fast you're gonna fast from Sun up to Sun down
 But you're gonna wake them in the morning. So you got to wake up before the Sun comes up
 You have to only eat unsalted food
 No planters peanuts for you. You can eat this stuff is inedible. This stuff is inedible
 I'm about to list by the way, so I mean if you want to summon a gin your first wish should be make unsalted foods taste good in the future
 You can only eat barley. I don't know where you're getting that at
 I have no idea where you buy just straight barley, but you can eat barley
 You can eat unsalted olives. Those are disgusting even if they are salted dried grapes
 That's like a raisin right dates. I've never had one of those and
 My food review it's it's oddly become that you can eat barley unsalted olives dried grapes dates or
 Fruits and vegetables they should just say fruits and vegetables right because no one's gonna go out and buy
 You don't have to eat barley by the way
 You don't have to go raid a horse farm or like guys. What are those things called the stalls the horse place?
 Thing you know what I mean. You've seen movies or been around real horses the place with all the boxes and the horse heads are popping out of it
 Whatever
 You don't need to go there for this ritual
 But if you wanted to steal barley go to a horse farm
 But anyway, so you just eat fruits and vegetables really and then but here's the thing put down that honey because that's what you're going for
 It's not a fruit or vegetable. You can't eat anything that has an animal origin including honey
 So no meat no eggs no milk and then whatever else comes out of a cow or chicken or an owl
 Don't eat it and then you fast first from sun up to sundown
 And then when you break the fast you have to go back to eating the barley you have to go back to eating unsalted stuff or again
 Just fruits and vegetables
 That's when the sun's going down now before nightfall comes
 So you have that time period of dusk and then night falls coming you need to start
 Summoning the gin now you have to read this phrase out now. I am
 Going to be a total chicken. I'm not gonna read this phrase out on I've debated this and I know you guys were waiting with baited breath
 Is he going to actually summon a gin during this podcast?
 So this message is apparently written in a combination of Arabic and a gin dialect
 I'm like, okay, but when I ran it through a translator and there's no Google translator for gin
 There's no Google translator for like leprechaun or anything like that
 But when I ran it through the translator it didn't even pick up any of the Arabic words. So I was like
 I'm not really don't really feel comfortable, but
 You can check it out online. You can check it out online. It's not super long
 I don't even feel comfortable reading the first word
 Because again first off post Malone's already haunting my apartment and then two maybe he's haunting my apartment because I've been reading this in my head
 It's probably I don't know it probably take you 30 seconds to say it if that but you have to say it one
 Thousand times so it's nightfall now
 And you've already done all this preparation and you repeat this phrase over and over and over again
 1000 times out loud and there you go
 After the thousandth time this is interesting because this is something that's easily testable. I
 Listener be aware as far as actually doing this ritual because again, it may work
 You may want to summon a gin it may summon something else
 But or it may have a psychological component to it as well
 We'll get into that but it's something that's easily testable like once you get it down
 After the thousandth time the gin will appear in front of you in human form
 And if that happens if you're standing there and you see a human that previously did not exist appear in front of you
 Don't panic it says do not panic if you've summoned something from the other realm
 You are instructed to crawl into bed and go to sleep
 You got to immediately go to sleep. I don't know if you have to immediately like I don't know if you have to
 Immediately go to sleep that might be putting a little pressure on you
 But you have to at least like try to go to sleep can't be on your phone
 Can't be playing your Nintendo switch while you're sleeping the gin will wake you up. Hey, dude
 Hey, dude wake up wake up you do you summon me dude?
 You said that a thousand times don't you want me to be here?
 Why are you speaking so rude and then you wake up and then you will create a contract with this gin during this conversation?
 I don't know how casual the conversation. Hey, how was your day?
 Were you doing anything before I summoned you into this realm?
 You know stuff like that it could just be straight to business
 But eventually you do come up with this contract and here we get this quote
 The gin will be bound to a lifelong servitude which includes fulfilling realistic wishes and
 Forming the human about the questions that he sets to the gin
 Unquote so there you go. I think it's funny because there is that caveat saying well the wishes have to be realistic
 Like you can't wish to be
 King of ours or something like that like it has to be something like I wish this donut had only a hundred calories and the
 Gin's like Duke
 He got sit in one fourth and gives you you're like, huh? They have to be realistic wishes, but that's still an interesting thing
 I would just be fascinating that a human appeared in my bedroom not saying that humans don't appear in my bedroom
 They don't magically my bedroom, but humans do walk around in my bedroom from time to time
 But that would be weird right if someone just magically appeared in front of you that would be proof enough
 But the fact that he will stay stick with you forever. He'll answer questions that you set upon him
 So you're like who is
 Who's who's that man walking on the street and Jin's like
 And he reads his ID in his pocket. He's like, oh, that's Jimmy Smith the actor
 He's that's where what's he doing in my hometown and Jin's like
 He's looking for a job
 So I don't know
 That would actually be kind of cool because I would be pestering him with questions all the time
 In the middle of night. He's trying to sleep. I'm like, hey, Jin. Jin wake up. Hey, dude
 I was wondering what do you call place where horses are at?
 He's like, oh, please. Let me break my contract. I'll make you president of Mars
 I'll break all my laws just to get out of this. So anyways, that's how you can summon a Jin
 I'm wondering if you could record it record that saying and go
 And then hit play and let the recording play out a thousand times
 It would be weird then what if it doesn't work?
 You're like, I'll go to sleep but like your mp3 player
 It's sitting there and it's like just sitting there like the cameras closing on the MP3 player and
 Then the Jin appears in the MP3 player and he's like I'm you're at your command and like the music is allowed to make wishes
 It's a little black mirror episode for you guys
 That one's free, but anyways apparently if you doesn't work
 I'd be shocked if it did obviously, but I'm not gonna try it if it doesn't work
 They say just keep doing it just keep doing it over and over again
 It'll eventually work and what's interesting is in the reddit comments
 So one of the first ones that popped up was from a guy named
 Ibnami this guy says
 Don't do this don't do this at all for a psychological reason if you repeat anything
 1,000 times in a row it's gonna mess with your head like that is really how
 I'm not saying like chanting chanting is supposed to take you to another like realm another like supposed to elevate the spirit
 But he's like don't do this chanting if you channel just random stuff and just repeated that phrase a thousand times
 It's gonna mess with your head. Don't do it. This is not saying don't do it because the Jin might show
 Don't do it because you might actually cause psychological damage to yourself. That is probably true
 It probably has some sort of tulpa effect
 But who knows maybe this guy is onto something not this guy not this killjoy the original guy
 Maybe you can do this and summon a Jin and get realistic wishes, but again, that's a that's a bit of a
 That's a bit of a small print thing going on there because you could be like I wish and the
 No matter what the Jin's I can't do it before you before even finish it
 Nope, he's just eating all your potato chips all your unsalted olives. You're like, oh man. I really wanted those
 It's going to garbage. Yeah, because they're disgusting. He's eating barley
 So let's go ahead and get Nate in the seat of the carboner copter now
 What I did was I promised you on yesterday's episode to talk about
 This guy whose dad was abducted by aliens not only did I promise it on yesterday's episode
 I promised it on this episode as well in the intro, but Nate let's get in that carboner copter
 I don't know if we have enough time for that
 Honestly, I don't know if we have enough time for that technically the the story with
 Ufo disclosure
 I don't think I have time to really do this story justice and I don't want to have another long episode because I want to make sure you guys
 You know, I don't want to waste your guys's time
 Let me not saying the show's waste of time, but you know what I mean?
 Like I like having a set amount of time. Hold on a second here
 Let me find a shorter story to end this on a shorter good story. Don't worry. I'm not just going to throw throw mud of the wall
 Okay, here we go
 Nate you've been doing circles in the carboner copter been in a holding pattern
 We are now leaving behind your creepy bedroom. You can redecorate it when we come back. We are headed out to Kokomo, Indiana
 It's January
 1999 I got this from that website one of my favorite investigative websites think about it docs.com
 It's January 1999
 Helicopters coming over Kokomo, Indiana. It's late at night
 It's late at night
 It's late at night and two women are driving
 Down a dark country road in a little area north of Kokomo, Indiana
 We don't have their real names, but we'll call them June and
 Monica June and Monica June is driving the car and those are their real names. It's just a shot on the dark
 June's driving the car Monica's on the passenger seat. Yeah
 Car is driving on the road this area that they're in if you're familiar with Kokomo, Indiana
 If you're familiar with that area, you may actually know the stretch of road
 Apparently on both sides of the road
 There's these big bushes these big bushes that kind of line the road and they're about 10 feet tall
 Monica and June are just having a good old conversation driving on the road
 Monica falls silent for a moment and then a moment longer
 And then a little longer and June looks over and she sees her friend's face
 contorted in fear
 Not just a slight grimace. It's not just a
 It's a look of pure agony
 Seeing something that fills her with
 mortal fear
 Monica points out into the darkness as the cars continuing down the road and just then
 The car engine shuts off
 The car is now just coasting down the road the headlights dim
 Lining each side of the road are these bushes these 10 foot tall bushes and Monica is pointing out
 Towards the bushes, but not at the bushes
 above the bushes
 June sees it too. What she's seeing is
 peeking over the bush are people
 She said the heads seemed larger and the shoulders seemed disproportionately big
 but all of these
 Creatures these beans these shadow people were all over 10 feet tall big enough that she could see the head in the shoulder
 So 12 feet tall 13 feet tall and they're just staring as the cars coasting down the street
 engines completely shut off June almost reflexively
 You're gonna think it's natural geography, right trick of the light something like that June swivels her head to
 Her side of the car looks out. She sees the beans on her side of the car as well looking down at them
 Now at this point June turns to Monica who Monica is still just barely holding it together
 June turns to Monica and she says the one thing that if you are a passenger in a car
 You hope no one ever says in a situation like this because you are helpless
 You are stuck to the desires of the driver June says quote
 They want to communicate. I am stopping
 But before June can actually hit the brakes because she believes that whatever this encounter is they want to just talk to them
 Monica flips out Monica absolutely flips out on this. She's having a completely different reaction to this
 June is getting the sense that they want to talk to us and
 Monica in an almost animalistic fight. It's basically you have that response. You have like a fight response than a I don't know
 Communicate with us response. That should be the fourth one fight flight freeze or just talk it out
 Monica though is straight fight complex. She's really not even communicative at this point
 She just becomes violently hysterical is the quote that's used and while June is now trying to call Monica down
 The car is just continuing to coast and these things are standing on both sides of the road for a length of around 50 feet
 And then at that point
 June looks up and she doesn't see them any further
 Than the 50 feet that the car coasted once they pass by where these shadow beans were on both sides of the road
 the engine
 Starts up again lights turn back on
 car drives home
 That story ends with this passage here quote one of the women who I'm assuming is the passenger
 I don't think the driver would be like well golly. I wanted to stop the car
 But now that I think about it here's this quote one of the women locked herself up in her room for two days
 And we're not talked to anyone after the incident. So again, I'm just assuming that's the passenger. That's an interesting story one
 It's terrifying
 Because it has all these it has all the combinations. It's at night. You're in the middle of nowhere
 You have an unknown
 Element and in this one you have multiple unknown elements. They're basically surrounding the car the car is dead
 And you have a fight between the two people in the car not a physical fight
 But you have the passenger who noticed them first and was just instilled with fear
 Freaking out when the driver says well, they want to just want to talk to us
 Let's stop
 Now we don't know what the intentions of these creatures are
 We don't know if these were shadow people. We don't know if these were malevolent. They're a bunch of out-of-work gins
 We don't know but I think if in my case, I wouldn't stop the car
 Especially if I was surrounded if I saw one of them, maybe
 But if I saw a bunch of them both sides of the road, I wouldn't stop the car
 This story is interesting because what would have happened if Monica wasn't there
 That car could have passed silently by all those subjects. June was just looking in front of the road
 Maybe she experiences a little bit of car trouble, but even the car trouble didn't come till Monica had already pointed them out
 Maybe her car would seem to the gas pedal wasn't really working for that point in time and it keeps going
 Maybe the fear actually now that I say that maybe the fear is what gave them enough power to shut the car down in the first
 But June could have just driven right by him
 June's car could have broke down and she's out there trying to figure out what's going on. It's 1999 not everyone has a cell phone
 It's nighttime. She's hoping someone else is gonna drive by to help and while she's trying to figure out what's wrong with her car
 Why the engine just died there are these dark shadows just staring down at her
 Silently watching her and waiting
 It's also possible that she was driving out
 Like this episode are you glad I found this one people who are listening to this episode at night driving down the road and
 They're experiencing car trouble. It's also possible that she would have stopped so let's play it where she's driving on the road
 She sees the figures the car does die
 But she's coasting and she goes they just want to communicate
 She gets out of her car and then just disappears
 I have to assume some sort of malevolent force with this because there's very few guardian angels that will
 Check up your car to talk to you right that was always my biggest complaint about that twilight book
 There's a lot of them
 But was that Edward the romantic star at one point doesn't want Bella you guys didn't expect this
 You guys didn't expect this on today's episode Edward doesn't want Bella to go meet the werewolf guy
 Whatever his name was Sean or Sam or something like that
 Edward doesn't want Bella to go meet that dude Sean the werewolf whatever his name was so Edward
 Breaks into her car and rips out the starter engine to her car and says I told you stay away from Sean
 She's like pretty sure that's not his name
 He's like doesn't matter stay away from them because you're not getting this starter engine back and I'm never reading that and I thought I
 Know guys like that. I know guys that would
 Human strength they're not like er, but I know guys that if they could have they would have ripped starter engines out of their
 Girlfriend's cars or girls they're interested in but she ended up with them anyways though
 It's horrible horrible moral of the story, but and then the werewolf ends up with her baby
 It's the whole the book is so all the books are weird didn't finish the last one, but it did three of them
 my point is is that
 Good things good guys don't normally damage your car or even temporarily
 It's so good that that gin that I summon was throwing down spike strips on the road doesn't happen
 You could say guardian angel makes it so your gas pedal doesn't work just right and then a car goes by it because you were
 decelerated fine
 But to actually like kill your engine and have you glide down this dark road as you're surrounded by ghosts or demons or whatever
 They were aliens who knows seems odd. It's almost like when you read the story
 I'm sure there's a group of people who go oh dude if Monica was in the car June could have had a
 Close encounter like June could have experienced the paranormal
 But I think a more rational person me would say good job Monica good job because you probably saved her from
 A fate worse than death. Ooh, here's one. Here's one. So to wrap this episode up this chaotic episode
 You're driving down the road late at night
 And then that story happens to you
 I'm gonna repeat the whole thing
 But you're driving down the road late at night your car dies and you've always been a little bit interested in the paranormal
 You've summoned gins you read the Twilight series and now you are in the middle of nowhere
 With these giant beans of shadow and darkness
 It has to be the the silhouette would have had to be so pitch black to be noticeable at night
 I've seen things like that. I've seen shadow people like that. It's like watching it. It's really hard to describe
 It's like it's like darker than black
 Very it's like an true absence of light. I've done a couple episodes on those guys
 My personal experiences, but so to be able to see those things against the night sky that have to be
 physically and possibly dark
 Machine good, but you get out of your car. You've always wanted an encounter like this you get out of your car
 You just want to communicate you yell out into the darkness. I know you just want to communicate. That's why I've stopped
 Please please tell me what you want me to know
 But you never get to tell that message
 The next day your car is still on the side of the road police car shows up tow truck shows up
 Family and friends wonder what happens to you
 Nobody can ever really figure it out
 then on another night
 Another car is driving down that same stretch of road and that night a keen observer
 May notice
 There's an extra
 Giant shadow standing on the side of the road
 looking for another victim
