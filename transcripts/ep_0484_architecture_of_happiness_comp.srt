1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 A recent crime-fighting breakthrough may have led to the arrest of a famous fugitive.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,800
 And then we take a look at a theory.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,500
 Can a place be haunted by more than just a ghost?

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,800
 Can your mere emotional residue leave something so profound

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,500
 it torments anyone who cares about you?

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,300
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,300
 I'm a wild freak down.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,300
 Actually, I'm a wild freak down.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,300
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,800
 By the time you guys hear this episode, I'll be on vacation.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,300
 I am trying so hard to record as many episodes up for you guys.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,800
 So right now I'm trying to record 10 episodes in the span of five days, six days.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 I am having a great day. I really am having a great day.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,300
 I mean that every time I say that.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,800
 But it's definitely a daunting task.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,800
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to today's supporter, Robert Paulson.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
 Robert Paulson, thank you so much for supporting the show.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,800
 He's the one who did the artwork, the Ouija board artwork that you see in regular rotation now with the Dead Rabbit logo.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
 It's really cool. I really, really appreciate that.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,800
 You are going to be our captain. You are going to be our escort.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
 Not that kind of escort.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,300
 You're going to be the person who's flying us around this episode.

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,300
 Let us go ahead and get started here, Robert Paulson.

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,300
 Let's hop in that Dead Rabbit robot. Let's get started nice and slow here.

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,300
 We're going to row lazily across the Atlantic Ocean.

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:38,800
 Yes, the whole thing. We're going across the Atlantic Ocean, but it gives us time to put on our SWAT gear.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,300
 So like pulling up a boot and like lacing it and stuff like that.

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,800
 We put on these cool specs. There's like all these guns. It's like Matrix.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,300
 We're just like standing there.

32
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,800
 Robert's just rowing the boat. We're like, whoa, look at this cool gun.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
 We're shooting. We're shooting sharks.

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
 Robert's like, oh man, I'm going to shoot sharks.

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,300
 Yeah, you're the pilot. You're the pilot.

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,800
 Eventually, with massive upper body strength, Robert Paulson rose us across the Atlantic Ocean.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,800
 It's May 2020. We're in England and now we're walking off the boat.

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
 And there just happens to be a house, a villa right there.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 And there's like a dude standing there, like on the patio with a big old cigar.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 Oh yes, I love being a British drug dealer.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,800
 No one will ever catch me except that I say my profession out loud and public.

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
 And we're like sneaking. We hear him. We're like, that's all the evidence we need.

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
 We hear him kick down the door.

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,800
 Rabbit core, whatever this made of group. It's called rabbit core.

45
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,300
 Get down, get down. We're like arresting all these drug dealers.

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,800
 Now imagine that happening 746 times basically within a two month period.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,300
 This is nuts. This is nuts. And it actually applies a lot to another interesting thing that pops up.

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:56,800
 So recently across Europe, you had 746 arrests, mostly drug related, a lot of, and they were mid to high level guys.

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
 This wasn't the guy on the corner slaying in cocaine.

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,800
 These were high level dudes, mid to upper to the tippy top.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,300
 That's the term they use in the drug world, right? They're like, are you the kingpin?

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,300
 No, I'm the tippy top. They're like, oh man, I've only heard legends about the tippy top.

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,800
 What happened was, let's flash back in time to March.

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,300
 Now we're the cool SWAT dudes in our gear, but we can't do our job without the help of nerds nowadays, right?

55
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,800
 You can't do anything without nerds.

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,800
 So back in March, you had these nerds going, hmm, let's see.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 If I move the 1 and the 5 here and times it to the triangle plus two squares, I have it.

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,800
 What they were trying to do is they were trying to hack into incro chats, like encrypted chat.

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,300
 There was a company that was based out of France. I don't think they knew where it was at first,

60
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,800
 but once law enforcement found out where it was, it didn't take them long.

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,300
 There's a thing called incro chat, incro chat.

62
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,300
 What it was is you bought a cell phone from them for about a thousand bucks,

63
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,300
 and then it was for six months, it was like an $1,800 fee for six months of service.

64
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,800
 It was a cell phone. It had the GPS, the camera, the mic, all disabled, just right off the bat.

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,300
 It had a separate encrypted operating system put on top of it,

66
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,300
 and it had a code that you could set up that if you entered this pin number,

67
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,800
 it would completely race the phone and brick it.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,300
 So it would be completely worthless. You could also delete messages at will.

69
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,800
 There was no way, the last trick's there, there was no way for these phones to be hacked,

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,300
 or for any of your information to be saved.

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,300
 And incro chat was selling these. They're like, it's for a legitimate business.

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,800
 There's people who want to have their information disappear, and that's true.

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 There are people who want to have their information disappear.

74
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
 Most of them are criminals.

75
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,300
 Now, I'm not saying that if you want to have your information disappear,

76
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,300
 if you want to use NordVPN, whatever.

77
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,300
 But you're also going to get a lot of criminals who are like, "Yeah, that's a pretty good idea."

78
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,800
 So that's what that ended up being a huge part of their user base.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
 I can't say it was all, because I don't know, but...

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,300
 So in March, some nerds figured out a way that they could...

81
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,800
 The report said that they deployed a technical device.

82
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,300
 So who knows if you had some guide yourself as a ninja who like,

83
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,800
 came in through the sewer drains one night and attached a little hacker box to it

84
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,300
 and made like a happy face and went, "Ha ha ha ha ha!"

85
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,800
 and cracked into the system.

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,800
 Or it was just they got a janitor in on the inside and his name happened to be TechNiCow.

87
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
 We don't know.

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 But because they're not going to reveal it, because they'll probably do this again.

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 Incro chat, basically the European authorities got into it.

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 Nikki Holland, she's the National Crime Agency, that's the UK organization.

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
 Nikki Holland, the NCA Director of Investigations,

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
 said about getting this information.

93
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,300
 It was, quote, "a kin to cracking the enigma code."

94
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,300
 Which is where the allies got a device that would decipher Nazi transmissions.

95
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,300
 That's how big of a break this was.

96
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,300
 Because they were able to go after some high level gangsters.

97
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,300
 People, they were like stopping murders and getting drugs off the streets and stuff like that.

98
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,800
 Rumors start to swirl among users and incro chat starts getting these emails.

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,300
 Hopefully, security emails.

100
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,300
 They're like, "Hey, I bought your phone to run my drugs."

101
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,300
 And it's not working and they're sending it via Gmail, drugdealer@gmail.com.

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
 Don't email that. I don't know where it's going to take you.

103
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,300
 They start emailing incro chat and being like, "Hey, I go to erase my messages and they're not deleting."

104
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,800
 You said there was a button, I could just delete messages that are completely gone.

105
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
 Incro chat goes, "Oh, we'll look into that."

106
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,300
 Well, you know, 500 complaints later, incro chat can't figure out why this isn't working.

107
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,800
 And they sent out an encoded text message saying, "Hey guys, we don't know what's going on.

108
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
 We're shutting down our service."

109
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,800
 And we highly suggest you ditch your phones.

110
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 But that'd be funny if they said, as they're sending out that text, they're like,

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
 "Okay, shut the service down so only half the people got it."

112
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
 It seems so.

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,800
 Because what happened was, they said, "Let's move."

114
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,300
 And you had cops kicking down doors all over Europe.

115
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,800
 And people would be holding their incro chat phones.

116
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,800
 And the cops are coming out and they're hitting their pin number to deactivate it and it wouldn't be deactivated.

117
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
 This was an interesting thing too.

118
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
 One of the things said, because everyone was in lockdown, we knew where everyone was at.

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
 No one was on the run. We just went to their house.

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 It's interesting because I know conspiracy theorists will make a lot of hay out of that.

121
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,800
 It's definitely, if you are a criminal, you don't want to be a criminal during a pandemic where you can't go on the run.

122
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,800
 But anyway, so they were just kicking down doors of the, they were saying like, "Some of these places were very wealthy criminals."

123
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
 People who were spending their money lavishly.

124
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,300
 They said, "There are other people who are tippy top criminals that you wouldn't have known."

125
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,300
 They lived a much more normal lifestyle.

126
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
 But it didn't matter.

127
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,800
 If you were doing illegal activities with these phones, then you were going to get caught.

128
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
 746 people arrested.

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,300
 That was just announced on July 2nd, 2020.

130
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,300
 What's interesting, there's two interesting things about this.

131
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:56,800
 First off, I want to say that a while back, John from the Scar Group, he's the one who's done artwork for the show, really, really appreciate his contributions,

132
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:04,800
 he sent me a story that PC World covered in 2004, that for a long time, it was unveiled in 2004,

133
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 but printers have a secret code that's on every single document you create.

134
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,800
 Every single thing you print out, prints out a little code using these little tiny yellow dots.

135
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,300
 And you can't see them unless you have a microscope. Maybe not a microscope, but you generally, I think you need a blue light and maybe a microscope.

136
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,300
 But you can't, they're not visible to the naked eye. It's a serial number.

137
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,300
 It'll tell the cops when the document was printed and the serial number of the printer.

138
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,300
 And the make and model, I don't know if it's the make and model, it's not like HP, Desk, Jet, 101.

139
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,300
 But it gives the feds enough information so if you write a manifesto, they can track it back to you.

140
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,800
 Once this report came out in PC World, you had a bunch of groups trying to hack it,

141
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,300
 trying to expose it and create software program for whistleblowers.

142
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:01,300
 Basically, if people wanted to print out documents from the military base exposing abuse issues or from a company exposing pollution issues,

143
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,300
 they said, "Let's build this software to break that."

144
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:11,800
 They did it for a short period of time. Apparently, they had a software that you could download a driver that would kind of up in that.

145
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,300
 And again, that's something like, yes, that would appeal to whistleblowers and people writing manifestos.

146
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,300
 But anyway, so your printer spies on you. We know your phone spies on you, right?

147
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:31,800
 Regardless of whether or not you're paying $1,600 for every six months, your phone's spying on you anyways, right?

148
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,300
 And it's funny because let me wrap this first part up like this. I deal a lot with other podcasters now.

149
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,300
 And when I'm on Reddit, that's probably the board you'll see me on the most is a podcasting board.

150
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,800
 And every week, someone says, "I want to remain anonymous doing my podcast."

151
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,300
 And every week I put the exact same thing, "You will never remain anonymous doing a podcast." Absolutely not.

152
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,800
 I have looked into... I'm not anonymous, obviously. And part of the reason was that was like,

153
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
 they're going to find out who I am anyways, right? That's just the way it goes.

154
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,300
 So it's better for me to use my real name so I can state real things I believe and then if I was using a fake name,

155
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,800
 if I was Wild Larry and I started saying stuff that Wild Larry says and had a character,

156
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,300
 and then eventually I get docs and they're like, "Wild Larry, do you actually believe that, you know,

157
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,800
 the earth is flat or that Lady Gaga's a murderer?" And I'd be like, "Ugh, little of..."

158
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 Little yes, a little no. But yeah, so you're going to get docs anyways.

159
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 You will get docs. You will 100% get docs. If someone wants to find out about you, they will.

160
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,300
 It's definitely easier for the government to do it, but you will get docs.

161
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,800
 So, and just stories like these guys went through extreme lengths.

162
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,300
 They bought a phone. I guess it's not extreme. They just bought a phone.

163
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,300
 But they bought a phone and they thought they were being secure and they're like, "Yeah, I'll give you the drugs tonight

164
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,800
 as long as you murder those five politicians." And they're like, "I'll never be caught."

165
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,300
 And they look up in a clock and it says March 2020. What? What does that mean, anything?

166
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,300
 "Why do clocks have calendates on them?" Also, I wanted to say this.

167
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,300
 This was exposed on July 20th, July 2nd, 2020.

168
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:13,300
 "I bet you anything this is how they caught Ghislaine Maxwell." That's Jeffrey Epstein's alleged second-in-command.

169
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,300
 His ex-girlfriend who was helping allegedly procure girls. I bet you this is how they caught her.

170
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,800
 I bet you anything! Because they announced this the day after she got nabbed.

171
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,800
 I bet you anything. That's how they tracked her. Because they haven't revealed how they knew she was a New Hampshire yet.

172
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,800
 I bet you they caught her on one of those in crypto, in crypto chat or whatever it's called.

173
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,800
 They now defunct business in crow chat. Allegedly defunct. They might still be around.

174
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,800
 But they definitely have some PR they need to do. I bet you that's how they caught her.

175
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,800
 I bet you that's how they caught her. Was using one of those phones.

176
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:56,800
 Robert Paulson, let's hop in that carpenter copter. We are headed out to any town, USA.

177
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,800
 Robert's like, "Yay! We're going to his hometown." He's like, driving his around in his own car.

178
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,300
 He's like, "That's the place I was born." And that was my first job. It was at the place where I was born.

179
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,800
 I got a job at the hospital. We're like, "When I said any town, I mean a generic town."

180
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,800
 Now this is an interesting story. And I'm not... I came across this story.

181
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 Normally I put stuff in my show notes. I'm not going to link any information to this story.

182
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 Because it's a very personal story. Didn't happen to me. This person put this story out into the public sphere.

183
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,800
 So I feel comfortable talking about it from that level. I actually talked to Sabine and I go, "Should I cover this story?"

184
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,800
 And she goes, "Absolutely. This is an important story."

185
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,800
 When I said, "Should I cover it?" it wasn't... I think it's good enough. I think it's super compelling.

186
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,800
 I've read this account multiple times. But it's personal and it's a little tragic.

187
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,800
 So Robert, let's leave behind your hometown. We're hopping back in that carpenter copter. We're headed to any town, USA.

188
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 I'm going to give these people fake names. If it happens to be their real names, it's absolutely happenstance. Absolutely happenstance.

189
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 It's July 2020. Helicopter's flying over. There's a man walking through the mall.

190
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 He's just shopping. He doesn't like come here often. Let's call him... let's call him Marcus.

191
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,800
 Again, if that's his real name, this is a total shot in the dark. Marcus is walking around the mall.

192
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,800
 He's a husband. He's a father. And he goes, "I'm shopping at this department store in this mall. I got this list.

193
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 Who has a shopping list when they go to the mall?" Grumbel's the list that throws it away.

194
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 I'm walking through the mall and just a day as normal. But there's a staircase that leads up to the next story of the mall, the next floor of the mall.

195
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,800
 It's the easiest way to get up there. I mean, he could go to the elevator, but that always takes too much time and it's farther away.

196
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 He goes, he starts to walk up the staircase, gets a couple steps up, turns around, walks through the department store, gets on the elevator, goes up to the second floor.

197
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,800
 This staircase, Marcus has a visceral reaction to being near the staircase.

198
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:11,800
 It took him a couple times to figure it out, because it was just the easiest way up. He would take the staircase, he would go to the landing, he'd turn the stairs, he'd go up.

199
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:21,800
 But after a while, he'd go up the staircase, he'd get to the landing, and he would feel his stomach just tighten. He felt sick.

200
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,800
 He would just walk up the next flight of stairs, get to the floor where he was supposed to be.

201
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:36,800
 Now, this had been going on for years. He'd get to the staircase, he'd go up to the landing, he would hate being there.

202
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,800
 He'd walk past as quickly as he could. He couldn't stand it.

203
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:50,800
 To the point where he doesn't even want to go to that area, he doesn't want to be anywhere near the stairs, because he knows that that land, for whatever reason,

204
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
 that landing gnaws at him.

205
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:00,800
 He can go anywhere else in the store, unless someone died, unless there was a burial ground right underneath that platform.

206
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,800
 There's a hundred ghosts reaching up and grabbing him. He couldn't figure out why he hated this place so much.

207
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,800
 Eventually, he just started avoiding it altogether.

208
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 The first couple of times, he realized he was having a really, almost an allergic reaction to the location.

209
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 Then, eventually, he just started going out of his way, taking the long way, using the elevator, what have you.

210
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 He's sitting there one day, and his adult daughter will call her Kitty.

211
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,800
 Again, totally just pulling that out of the air.

212
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,800
 Kitty walks in, talking to the dad, and just a normal talk, enough and important.

213
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,800
 She tells him about a book she's reading called The Architecture of Happiness.

214
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 He's sitting there, just eating an apple.

215
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:50,800
 They're having a conversation, and she goes, "Yeah, it's really interesting book. The book is about how buildings can be built to evoke emotions in us."

216
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,800
 You can have a building that, when you see it, it's actually, it's not just a beautiful building, but it fills you with joy.

217
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
 You feel joy when you're around it.

218
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 The buildings can actually create emotions in us.

219
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,800
 This book, actually, when the guy wrote it, he got an honorary degree as an architect.

220
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:24,800
 The world of the architecture will never be the same. I mean, it was pretty boring to begin with, but they're like, "Yay, here's someone who's really talking about how the world of architecture has an impact on people."

221
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 So, architecture, the idea is that architecture can evoke these emotions in us.

222
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:38,800
 I think a Catholic cathedral, obviously, is like the go-to example, but that's not just, the book isn't just focused on religious icons, but just houses and buildings and things like that.

223
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:46,800
 So, Kitty's telling Marcus a story talking about the book, and at a certain point she realized that he's no longer taking a bite of his apple and pretending to listen.

224
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,800
 She realized that he's been quiet. He's been very quiet for a bit.

225
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 He goes, "You know, you want to know something weird? You know that department store we end up going to all the time?"

226
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:10,800
 That staircase. That landing where the staircase turns, "I hate it! I totally get where that book's coming from because I hate that staircase!"

227
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 It makes me sick to my stomach. He tells her that he'll do anything to avoid going there.

228
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:25,800
 He went there for a while and eventually realized that he was having some sort of reaction to it and ended up trying to find another way to the second floor.

229
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 In 2006, this daughter of Marcus was in the mall, and she was walking up the steps.

230
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 She was going to the second floor of the department store, and somebody molested her on the landing of that staircase in the department store.

231
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:53,800
 He groped her. She never told anyone in her family, ever. Never revealed that information.

232
00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 In college, she told one or two friends, but she never told anyone, especially her father, about what happened.

233
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,800
 It's an interesting story because the author came forward and was asking about this, what could have caused this incident.

234
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 I don't know the person personally, but this young woman was asking, "What could have caused this? What could have caused this?"

235
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:28,800
 My response, I reached out to her and said, "You don't need to have a ghost for a place to be haunted."

236
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 We've talked about that before on this show, but I always think it's good.

237
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,800
 This is an amazing story. The love of a parent towards their child.

238
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:48,800
 The amount of psychic energy she must have expended in that moment, where that disgusting man did that.

239
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 It would be the equivalent of getting stabbed and leaving blood, and your parent seeing the blood of their child.

240
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:09,800
 This was raw psychic energy, right? Because of this sicko, this wound that he gave a child.

241
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:19,800
 The love of a parent, right? To be able to sense that across time.

242
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 To just not see it, but sense it. To know that something horrible happened there.

243
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 You wouldn't be able to put your finger on it because you wouldn't even think that, right?

244
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:38,800
 You wouldn't even think that. You wouldn't want to think that that happened to your child.

245
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 You wouldn't be walking up the stairs and going, "Oh."

246
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,800
 You would just have a visceral reaction to that. The amount of psychic energy that must have been expended in that place

247
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:56,800
 was so overflowing that her father could sense it years later.

248
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 To this day, we'll not use that staircase.

249
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,800
 She says that she has a hard time dealing with this still. She describes this event as extremely traumatic.

250
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,800
 And that wouldn't make sense. She probably left a piece of herself on that staircase, right?

251
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:17,800
 And so it's hard to heal when a chunk of you is missing. It's not impossible. It's not impossible.

252
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,800
 But it's harder. It's not impossible. If you've dealt with something like this, it's never impossible.

253
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 It's just you have to... There's more stuff you have to work through, right?

254
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:35,800
 But the love of a parent for their child is astounding.

255
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:43,800
 We've talked about this on the show. I understand there are bad parents out there, and not everyone has great relationships with their parents.

256
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:53,800
 But it should be astounding. It should shock us in a good way, the love that a parent has for a child.

257
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,800
 But you don't need... And this is what I mean. You don't need a ghost.

258
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
 A lot of times when I'll talk about ghosts or a place being haunted or something,

259
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,800
 I've spent a long time since I've actually done an on-the-site ghost hunt. I've never done it on the show.

260
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 I used to do it personally for a long time.

261
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 And I mentioned on the show, like, I can walk into a house and tell you how your marriage is doing.

262
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:21,800
 I can walk in your house and I can sense that. And it's funny, because as skeptical as I am, I'm not blind.

263
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,800
 There's stuff that I've seen and stuff that I've experienced that I believe in.

264
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,800
 There's stuff that I haven't seen or experienced that I surmise is real.

265
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 I can walk in your house and tell you how your marriage is doing.

266
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:38,800
 Because you expend emotional energy fighting with each other, or one person fighting the other,

267
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,800
 or even if it's a silent fight, that energy. I can walk in and know something is wrong.

268
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,800
 If you tested me in a lab, could I pass the test? No, probably not.

269
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,800
 Could I be fooled? Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

270
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,800
 But I think people... I think most people can do that.

271
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 We call it a funny feeling, or I don't feel good. I don't know what it is, but I don't like being over at their house.

272
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,800
 A place can be haunted without someone dying.

273
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 Someone can simply be emotionally wounded on that level.

274
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 Where that happened in 2006 and 2020 when this person is relating this story.

275
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,800
 They're still dealing with the trauma. That's a deep-seated trauma. That's 14 years of trauma.

276
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:26,800
 The amount of emotional energy that must have exploded out of that young girl's soul is going to echo through time.

277
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,800
 So the father would sense it. And I'll be honest with you. I'll be honest with you.

278
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 It's very beautiful that the parent could pick up on that.

279
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,800
 To this time of this recording, as far as I know, she has not told her father about this,

280
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,800
 it would be interesting if other people are picking this up as well.

281
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,800
 Walking up that staircase. Other empaths. Other survivors of trauma.

282
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 Walking up the staircase. I don't like that staircase. Take the elevator.

283
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,800
 I'm sure that there are emotional landmines throughout the world like that.

284
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,800
 People just kind of avoid those areas.

285
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,800
 Some people won't pick up on it. They're too busy. They're thinking about other things.

286
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 They're not picking up at the subtle hints. Then you have people who are deep empaths.

287
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 People who have survived similar situations.

288
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 Just keep on moving. Get through the area as soon as possible.

289
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,800
 I'm sure there's a lot of situations like this. If she had never told her dad she was reading this book,

290
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,800
 it wouldn't ever come up in normal conversation.

291
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,800
 Hopefully she can use this incident of her father saying how horrible that feels,

292
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 or maybe she can use this to talk to her father about it because he doesn't know that it happened.

293
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 Maybe she can use this to try to reclaim some of that soul destruction that happened.

294
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 Because it can always be repaired. It can always be repaired.

295
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
 Maybe she can use this as a moment to heal.

296
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 It's an interesting story on many, many levels. On a personal level, on a psychological level,

297
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,800
 and then on the level of the paranormal or the supernatural.

298
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:17,800
 It should be a reminder of, one, just because a place is haunted doesn't necessarily mean that somebody died there,

299
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,800
 that not all ghosts are manifestations of someone's soul. It could be an outburst of emotional energy.

300
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 But two, it should be a reminder that while none of us are doing anything as disgusting as this dude, right,

301
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,800
 none of us are as gross as this piece of filth, right?

302
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:43,800
 Our actions can still have consequences. We can still leave these emotional landmines ourselves,

303
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 or we can cause other people to have them as well.

304
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 You don't have to do something as disgusting as this guy to leave a scar on somebody else's soul.

305
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,800
 I think we all know that because other people have done things that are fairly minor to us that we remember to this day.

306
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 So just think about that the next time you're about to do something.

307
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:15,800
 It's gonna sound trite, but we don't know how weak or broken another person's soul already is.

308
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 So when you lash out in anger, not this guy, I can talk about this guy all I want, right?

309
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,800
 I want an email saying that, "Jason, you told us not to lash out in anger."

310
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:33,800
 This guy deserves my anger. But going back, you know what I mean, right?

311
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 You know what I mean. I also have to... I could be the best troll in the world.

312
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:48,800
 I could be trolley McTrolls then, king of troll town, on planet troll, in the troll Alexey.

313
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,800
 It's actually like, I have to stop myself from being a troll a lot.

314
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 So let's take this story, this absolutely tragic story, and we can microcosm it and see how we can go about living our lives in a way that maybe we're not trying to affect people negatively on purpose.

315
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 Maybe we take a step back because we know how sensitive we can be, all of us.

316
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 Let's recalibrate. Let's try to be a little nicer, right?

317
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 Because the last thing the world needs is more emotional landmines out there.

318
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 But then again, I do kind of talk trash about a lot of people on this show, so let's try to be better there.

319
