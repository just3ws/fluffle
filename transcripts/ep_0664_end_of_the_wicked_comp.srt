1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
 The world is a world of miracles and wonders.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,040
 But what happens when some of those wonders...

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,560
 kind of suck?

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at a truly cursed film.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,240
 Is it possible that just viewing End of the Wicked

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,280
 will make you go out

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,600
 and murder a child today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,840
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,880
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
 You like two of your friends that talk about a movie?

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,640
 Then they make me murder a kid.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,040
 I'm having the opposite of fun.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,640
 Ah, slap me on the back.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,920
 Slap me on the back.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,320
 Come on, man, you're gonna have tons of fun this episode.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,360
 You're super scared. You're afraid I'm gonna break out a movie projector.

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,920
 Bringing in movie projector right now is our newest Patreon supporter.

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,200
 He's in the pouch of a kangaroo as well,

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,720
 'cause you know, you gotta have a gimmick.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,520
 It's AZ. He's pushing in a movie projector

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,400
 while he's in this kangaroo's pouch.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,040
 It's a comical thing to see.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,440
 AZ, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,440
 If you guys can't support the Patreon

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,480
 or if you don't live in the ambionic fluid of a marsupial,

28
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,280
 that's fine too.

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
 Just help spread the word about the show.

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,960
 Really, really helps out a lot.

31
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,280
 So AZ sets up that film projector.

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,720
 You're like, "No, I don't want to watch it. I don't want to watch it."

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,360
 We'll watch the movie later.

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,520
 You know how much you guys want to watch the movie?

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,920
 First off, AZ, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,320
 We're headed out to a haunted house.

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,320
 Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

39
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:56,800
 The reason why we're headed out to this haunted house is because I recently found an article in one of my favorite websites, Backpackerverse.

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,280
 It's absolute fiction.

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,560
 They stopped writing like that, so it's not as fun to go back to, but it still has a place in my heart.

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,320
 I still check it out every once in a while.

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,680
 They actually recently had this article called "17 psychic abilities you can tap into and how to develop them."

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,040
 So we're in this haunted house.

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,520
 We've got little ghost girls running around, rocking chairs rocking by themselves,

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
 squeaky door, crow on the roof.

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,600
 They're a typical haunted house stuff because we want to see if we can actually use our new psychic abilities to perceive the world around us.

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,280
 Now you're thinking, "Jason, couldn't we have just done this in a non-haunted house?

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,520
 Couldn't we have done this where there's not a creepy girl in the corner just pointing at us and saying, "You are next?"

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,840
 We could have, but it wouldn't be as dynamic.

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,800
 This list starts off with some pretty basic psychic powers I think everyone knows about.

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,680
 Astral projection, that's a big one. Everyone wants to be able to do that.

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,960
 It's basically like running away.

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,480
 You're significant others just droning on about something they find incredibly interesting that you could care less about the bills.

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,880
 They're like, "We're gonna lose the house, George! If you don't pay the bills, we're gonna lose your house and you're just sitting on the couch and your spirit is all d-eee-eee."

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
 It's floating away.

57
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,120
 Astral projection would be the best, right?

58
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
 Aura reading, being able to read people's auras, obviously what it says, the energy around them.

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,920
 You can tell, like, if they have good intentions or bad intentions, happy or sad, which sometimes you can just tell that by if they have the knife they're coming after you.

60
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,320
 This is a sad man who's evil.

61
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,600
 But aura reading would be fairly useful as well.

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,840
 Automatic writing, letting the spirits right through you.

63
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,520
 You can get hidden knowledge.

64
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,680
 Clarivoience, right? Being able to see the future, that would be obviously beneficial.

65
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,840
 But these are all pretty standard things. Telekinesis, telepathy, and you're thinking, "Wow, Jason, this article is telling us how to develop these things."

66
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,920
 Well, it just says, "Find a quiet room and meditate and pretend you're doing these things."

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,800
 And it's pretty basic stuff.

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,960
 We're not covering this article so much so we can develop these talents.

69
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:56,400
 We're covering this article because there's some superpowers, "superpowers," I should say, that I've never heard of before.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,240
 Imagine if you got this. Your buddy can astrally project. Your boss is able to read your aura.

71
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:11,320
 So, like, whenever you're, like, calling in sick, he's like, "Mmm-mm, you don't have that purple aura. Your aura is nice and orange."

72
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,280
 Claircent.

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,440
 Claircent is the ability to smell aromas from the other side.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,240
 This is a tricky one because on the one hand you have a lot of ghost encounters where people say, "My grandpa always used to smoke cigars."

75
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,720
 He passed away. Now every so often when I'm sitting in his favorite chair or I'm at home, I smell cigar.

76
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,760
 We actually covered that on a recent episode. I don't remember which one it was, but I was wondering why it's always,

77
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:46,160
 whenever it's since it's tied to the dead or ghosts, it's tied to cigars, cigarettes, flowers or perfume.

78
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,440
 Those are the ones that no one's ever like, "Oh, I was sitting at home and I smelled my grandmother's lasagna.

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,720
 I smelled every layer of cheese in her delicious lasagna."

80
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:23,720
 "Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

81
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,000
 There's less communication between them. But is it also something as simple as those smells permeating the environment

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
 when you sit down in the chair, it releases a little bit of those molecules?

83
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,640
 I don't know because sometimes there in hospitals people will smell the mother's perfume or do smell roses.

84
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,840
 It's an interesting thing, but it's always one of those four smells.

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,000
 That's fairly common. So does that mean those people are Claircent? Does that mean those people all have that ability?

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,760
 Well, the smell is tied very closely to memories as well.

87
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,240
 So maybe it's the memory triggering the smell or the smell triggering the memory.

88
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,840
 But Claircent would be something even beyond that where you could sit in a house and you go,

89
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,760
 "A murder happened here. The man was passing gas.

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,000
 He was very gassy. He just ate some Taco Bell.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,880
 And then some other dude crawled into the house and he had just stepped in dog poop outside.

92
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,240
 And the cops are looking around. They're like, "Ee gads! Look at there is dog poop on the windowsill."

93
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,280
 So you can smell into the past. You can smell into the future. You could be standing.

94
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:34,280
 You could be standing in the parking lot and you go, "Someone's going to throw up here. It's 2 AM outside of a bar."

95
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,680
 You're like, "Right here some sorority girl is going to stumble out and land on her knees and scrape them up and vomit."

96
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,840
 And forget the entire thing by the time she gets home.

97
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,240
 But that will happen. You can smell into the past. You can smell into the future.

98
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,040
 You can smell other dimensions. You could smell sulfur, like a demonic smell.

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,400
 You could smell angels, which I don't know what an angel would smell like.

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,680
 You would think maybe it would smell like baby powder.

101
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
 That's how I imagine angels would smell like.

102
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,760
 But you consider angels are like these celestial beings that have like 18 arms and 1500 eyeballs.

103
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,360
 They probably don't smell like baby powder. They probably smell like scorched star.

104
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,960
 They probably smell like the edge of a black hole.

105
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,160
 For Claire's scent, they actually list how to master your smell power.

106
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,760
 It says, "When seeking to make contact with a beloved relative who has crossed over to the other side,

107
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,560
 light a candle in their honor and meditate on the flame as you think about them."

108
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,360
 You're sitting there in the darkness and you're like, "Grandma, grandma smell to me."

109
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,800
 Grandma make that grandma smell come across the borders.

110
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,920
 Permiate between life and death with that musty smell that your nightgown always had as you walked past me

111
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,920
 when I was in the living room. "Oh, grandma, may I smell you once more?"

112
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,720
 If you're going through this trouble, just get a wheeze you bought right if you're going through this trouble.

113
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,240
 If you're holding a ritual to smell your loved one one last time,

114
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,760
 why not just do the same ritual but be like, "Hey, dude, can we talk?

115
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,640
 Can you like, can I try that automatic writing thing?

116
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:14,200
 Why would I want to... If I had the ability to contact you, why would I choose smell?

117
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,880
 Why would I just... Give me a sign. I just want to smell you one last time."

118
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,480
 They also say that the Claire's scent has a unique ability that it can protect you.

119
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,080
 Claire's scent is one of those psychic abilities that can protect you.

120
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,800
 What you do is before you go into a dangerous situation, smell something that reminds you of protection.

121
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,440
 They give the example of like sandalwood or fringon-sensor myrrh.

122
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,760
 I recommend smelling a nice, oiled handgun. Just...

123
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,680
 Ah, yes, that's the smell. That's the smell of a well-maintained weapon.

124
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,960
 And then just leave it there. Just leave it at home. Walk.

125
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,600
 You walk out into the war zone that surrounds your place.

126
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,400
 Nothing will hurt you because you smell like a gun.

127
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,560
 You've smelled like a gun and you've created this bubble around you.

128
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,000
 Although you may also just want to bring back up... Bring the gun with you.

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,280
 Okay, so that is Claire's scent. Claire's scent.

130
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,880
 There is one more. If you thought that was useless before we get to the movie,

131
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,160
 that'll make you murder children. If you thought that one was useless,

132
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,080
 we have another one that makes Claire's scent seem to be a superpower on the level of

133
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,840
 Superman's heat vision. Claire Guston's. Claire Guston's.

134
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:35,960
 It's the ability to taste from beyond the dimensions. You can taste things that aren't there.

135
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,840
 Grandma, I know it's been a long time since I sucked on your fingers.

136
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,760
 Oh, Grandma. Grandma, please stick your finger in my...

137
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,520
 Why? Why? Okay, here's the thing. One, I don't believe that's an actual power.

138
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,800
 I found that listed on... Both of these are listed on several websites.

139
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,960
 These just aren't on backpackerverse. I can't believe one that people can actually taste from

140
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,640
 beyond the grave. Two, if you did, if you did, why would you admit it?

141
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,040
 Why would you say like you're sitting around a bunch of people and they're like,

142
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,640
 "I can see in the past." And the other person goes, "I can see in the future." And you go,

143
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,200
 "I can taste ghosts." You'd be like, "How did you figure that out? First off, how do they taste?

144
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,960
 Are they minty fresh? Do they taste like decaying corpses?" You're like, "Oh yeah,

145
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,720
 they're all decaying corpses. They're all absolutely disgusting." You can also taste like

146
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,600
 Claircent. You can taste angels. You can taste demons. Why would you want to...

147
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,160
 Why would you even want to? That's the only power you have, though. I guess you got to run with it.

148
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,560
 One woman said, "Actually found an account." This is why this power would be the worst power ever.

149
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,640
 I keep using the word power. This would be a curse. One woman says that when she meets

150
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,800
 somebody who doesn't take care of their teeth, someone who is not performing proper dental hygiene,

151
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,680
 in her own mouth, so you're walking down the street, I mean, nobody brushes her teeth as much as they

152
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,840
 should, right? My mom does three times a day. She's the only person I know who does three times a day.

153
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,400
 This woman, she has Clairgustence. She's walking down the street. If she meets someone who doesn't

154
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:24,520
 take proper care of their teeth, in her own mouth, she can taste yeast or plaque. That's what she

155
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,440
 tastes when she talks to someone who doesn't brush their teeth all the time. How could you exist in

156
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,480
 a world where you tasted everyone's mouth disease? You're just walking down the street and it's like

157
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,360
 yeast, plaque, yeast, yeast, plaque, plaque, yeast. You're just disgusting. Then there's this other

158
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,040
 woman who said that she here, quote, "another client told me she always knows when her brother is

159
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,280
 having a good time in his life because she experiences the taste of oranges in her mouth."

160
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:05,240
 No sister should ever taste her brother's fun. Ever. And vice versa, by the way. No brother should

161
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,200
 ever taste his sister's fun, brother's and other brother's fun, sisters and cousins fun. No. No.

162
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:19,720
 Please don't. Imagine she's sitting at home. It's like 2 a.m. This guy picked up some drunk sorority

163
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,880
 girl from this bar and she's sitting at home and she goes, "mmm oranges. My brother must have got

164
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:34,760
 lucky tonight. Gross bro." That's disgusting. Every time he's having a good time, he's like a super

165
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,400
 party guy. She's constantly tasting oranges. She's like, "oh no, I'm allergic to oranges."

166
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:47,720
 Gross. I would not want that power. I would rather have no power than that power. And I think everyone

167
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,040
 would agree with that. Okay, we've had a good time with these awesome powers here. A-Z. I'm gonna go

168
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,360
 ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter. We are leaving behind this haunted house or waving

169
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,800
 goodbye to all the ghosts. Tastes ya later. We sa-s-s-s we're flying away. We are headed out to Nigeria.

170
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:15,800
 We're headed to a movie theater in Nigeria. We got our popcorn. We got our tickets. We're sitting

171
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,320
 down. Sitting to our right is Abdullah. He actually recommended this. He's like, "I don't want to be in

172
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,680
 this story. This story is terrifying." But Abdullah recommended the story to us. Thank you so much.

173
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,200
 Y'all, he's all covering his face. He's trying to sneak out. He's like, "Dude, I want no part of

174
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,840
 this other than recommending it to you." No, you're stuck here. He recommended this story. Thank you

175
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,520
 so much for that. You guys can thank him as well at the end of this. He also recommended the An-Hill

176
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,600
 Kid Story a while back, so that was awesome. And then I also want to give a little tip of the hat

177
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,480
 to Splacatorius. He actually did some additional research on this story. Thank you, Splac. The

178
00:13:49,480 --> 00:14:00,600
 movie starts. It's called End of the Wicked. And it's this really grainy 1999 shot on camcorder

179
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,560
 horror movie. Well, horror movie might be a... There's a genre... So there's a thing called

180
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,320
 Nollywood. So you have Bollywood in India, Hollywood in America. Nollywood is Nigerian film industry,

181
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,560
 and they actually put out the second most movies of any country, the number one being India.

182
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,640
 So Nollywood pumps out tons of movies, and they have a whole genre called hallelujah films. They're

183
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:30,200
 Christian movies. But End of the Wicked actually borders more on a horror film. So we're sitting

184
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,240
 in this movie theater, and it's actually quite packed. There's a lot of people watching this movie,

185
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,920
 and some of them... This is their third, their fifth, their tenth time watching End of the Wicked.

186
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,080
 It starts off with Beelzebub sitting on his throne. It's actually like a chair in the middle of the

187
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,600
 woods. It's really, really cheap. It's a really, really cheap movie. And he's sitting there, and

188
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,720
 he's like, "All of my witches gather together. We need to make more wickedness." He... Show,

189
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,160
 don't tell. Whoever wrote this movie, show, don't tell. Show the wickedness. He goes into a lot of

190
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,640
 these monologues about how he wants to, you know, destroy the world, destroy mankind. And we're

191
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,880
 watching it, we're kind of rolling our eyes, we're kind of laughing at it. There's lines like this.

192
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:20,120
 "Dance the seduction dance. The most sexy dance on earth." We're like, "What? What? So dumb." But

193
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:27,960
 we notice everyone in the audience is terrified of this film. It's creepy, and the special effects

194
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,880
 exist in this realm. Yes, there are special effects in this Hallelujah film. The special effects

195
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,960
 exist in this realm where they're so cheap they're disturbing. Like, there's a movie I watched a long

196
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,680
 time ago called The Gateway Flesh or The Gateway Meat. I think it's The Gateway Meat. It's actually

197
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,080
 on like the lost media or the forbidden media iceberg. I saw The Gateway Meat a long time ago,

198
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,280
 and it existed in the same realm. But you know what's funny? Is it existed in the same realm where

199
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:02,680
 it was so cheap it was disturbing? It also existed in the same realm. Totally boring. Super boring.

200
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,560
 Gateway Meat, super boring. Into the wicked, super boring. I was bored through most of it,

201
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,880
 but I'm watching it in the comfort of my house, fully aware that what is going on in this film

202
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,400
 is fictional and does not affect me in any sort of way. But it had a different impact in the

203
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,440
 country of Nigeria. This is the plot of the movie. There's a young father who's just trying to live

204
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:33,320
 his best life, and Beazlebub's having none of it. Every time he goes to sleep, demons or witches

205
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,320
 are summoned upon him to curse him in one way or the other. Actually, you basically like a sketch

206
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,800
 comedy show. It's like a sketch horror show. So he goes about his day. He's doing stuff,

207
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,800
 and then he falls asleep, and a bunch of kids fly out of their bodies. A lot of astral projection,

208
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,840
 and they eat his back. But because the special effects are so cheap, they...

209
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,320
 This is... I'm watching this and I'm thinking, this is both dumb and creepy at the same time,

210
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:11,400
 because the way it's shot is creepy. There's a bunch of kids. The guy's laying on his back.

211
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:19,240
 And then a... You know those ready-made pans of Stoffers Lasagna that you can just buy at Safeway?

212
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,600
 It's like the best food ever. One of those appears on his back, and we're supposed to pretend

213
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,880
 that those are his guts. But you can clearly see the tin foil. You can clearly see. It's like

214
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,920
 they didn't just take handfuls of lasagna and throw them on his back. They took the whole tin.

215
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,160
 They took it right out of the oven. He's probably like, "Ah, it burns!" They set it on his back,

216
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,840
 and then the kids run up, and they start eating the lasagna. And the camera linger. It's like a

217
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,040
 static shot that the camera links on for an uncomfortable amount of time. Then he wakes up

218
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,280
 with horrible back pain. And when I'm describing it to you, you're like, "Jason, that's the least

219
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:01,000
 creepy thing I could ever think of." But again, it's just... It's unsettling. Maybe creepy is not

220
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,560
 the right word. It's... And this is what Abdullah said when he sensed it to me. He goes, "The movie

221
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,880
 feels evil." So we have this weird stuff that's kind of funny eating lasagna out of the tin,

222
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,440
 but when you watch it, when you're watching the Indian credits, you still feel unsettled.

223
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,320
 The kids come back at another point. He's dreaming, and they remove his eyeballs. Now,

224
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,320
 this is a much more realistic special effect. They're like dangling from his eye sockets,

225
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,480
 and then they cut him, and they fall in a bowl, and I think they eat him. I think they're really

226
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,920
 hungry children. The play to lasagna was obviously just a play to lasagna. The eyeballs, if you were

227
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,040
 a young kid, that's completely disturbing. So this kind of goes on and on throughout the movie.

228
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,720
 He keeps having these dreams. These witches are cursing him at night. His mother is one of these

229
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:57,560
 witches that are trying to get Beezlebub's favor, and she ends up getting a giant shlong. Like,

230
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,920
 she's like, "Oh, give me this Beezlebub, and this thing. This about as long as my leg,

231
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:10,120
 and as thick as my leg is massive, comes out of this woman." And this isn't an anime. This

232
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:18,440
 isn't an anime. This is a 1999 Nigerian Christian film. And then in her sleep, or in the mother

233
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,200
 rapes, sorry, this one from 0 to 60 real quick, the mother rapes her daughter-in-law and gives

234
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,160
 her a miscarriage. Like, she does it in the spirit realm, and then the daughter-in-law wakes up and

235
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,560
 her nightgown is all bloody, and the implication is she's lost the child. And this kind of goes on

236
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,480
 and on and on. They're all these different, but again, you're like, "Jason, this movie sounds

237
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:45,160
 fantastic. It's boring." Like, I'm kind of listing off the ones that I remember. And then at the very

238
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,480
 ending, the Beezlebub, the demon, spoiler alert, they decide to take out the man. The suffering

239
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,600
 is done. They've done everything they could. Canada's sky, they're not going to let them live

240
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,960
 peacefully. There's a long shot of what I can only describe as the dolest machete in the world.

241
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,520
 I mean, I don't have a lot of experience with wheeling machetes. I do own one,

242
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,680
 but I've never tried doing this before. It is a close-up shot. You see the man suffering in bed,

243
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:19,320
 like he's having some sort of fit, and then they cut to a close-up of a goat being held down by

244
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,280
 three or four demons. And what I can only describe is the dolest machete slowly sawing the goat's

245
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:33,160
 head off. It's a real goat and a real machete. So the movie ends with you watching, and the goat

246
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:40,040
 is looking right at the camera, and it's bleeding. Sorry, this is not going to be for 18 and under

247
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:46,200
 on YouTube. Very, very disturbing. This movie is actually available on YouTube. If you're like,

248
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,360
 "Jason, I'm sold." It's very, I mean, you know, it's funny because killing animals is so normal

249
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,280
 in so many parts of the world, everywhere. Any farming community, I could go 10 miles in any

250
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,400
 direction from where I live. People are like, "Oh yeah, I kill chickens all the time. It's not a

251
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:08,120
 big deal." But do you use a dole machete? And then, you know, that's not the end of the movie.

252
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,840
 Technically, the good guys do win. I don't want you guys to have nightmares tonight.

253
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,880
 A woman, a very famous and very real minister named Helen Ocpabio shows up. She's a real life,

254
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:26,280
 very, very famous minister. She shows up and she realizes that the mother is the witch

255
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:32,840
 after her son has been killed, after that ritual killed her son. They exercise the demon from the

256
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,200
 woman. It's a Rottweiler. Just a clip art picture of a Rottweiler kind of floats out of the woman

257
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:46,760
 and floats away. Movie ends. End of the Wicked. It was directed by Teco Benson, which that name

258
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,480
 didn't really ring a bell for me, but he's actually one of Nigeria's biggest filmmakers. He's won a

259
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,320
 lot of awards. Very, very famous accomplished filmmaker. Ann Helen is a very, very powerful

260
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,600
 minister in the evangelical Christian movement in Nigeria. And she's the leader of the Liberty

261
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,800
 Foundation Gospel Ministries. Why is it a cursed film, like I said in the intro? It definitely has

262
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,160
 the hallmarks of what we think of a cursed film. It looks grim, like it looks gritty. Normally,

263
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,080
 when you don't think of cursed films, you don't think of Tenet. You don't think of 1917. You

264
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,160
 don't think of these beautifully shot. They're usually really grimy. They seem to be shot on

265
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,920
 camcorder. They're infused with some sort of dark energy and simply watching them makes you feel

266
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:36,440
 uneasy at best and at worst haunts you, possesses you, makes you do evil things. So how is End of

267
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,840
 the Wicked a cursed movie? This movie, and I kind of gave it away in the beginning in the intro,

268
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:51,480
 this movie is suspected to have led to the deaths of countless children. We're talking

269
00:22:51,480 --> 00:23:01,000
 thousands upon thousands of children in Nigeria, specifically the Aqua i-bomb state. It's rural.

270
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,280
 It's a rural community and it has the worst combination. It's religious and superstitious.

271
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,160
 I guess you can't really be a superstitious atheist, but when you have people who are very

272
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:18,440
 devout in their religion and also take any sort of misfortune as a sign of the war between heaven

273
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,480
 and hell, it's a bad combination. We see that in every culture. We've seen that across time,

274
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:35,640
 from the witch trials to this. People watch this movie and kill children. What is going on is that

275
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,000
 people in the Aqua i-bomb state, when a misfortune befalls them, they lose a job,

276
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,440
 they don't catch as much fish, the harvest is bad, someone dies, someone falls sick,

277
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,720
 a witch did it, a wizard did it, there's some sort of external force cursing them.

278
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,920
 And how do you get rid of an external force like the devil? Well, you can kick them out of your

279
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,520
 village, you can kill them, or you can try to do an exorcism. Those are the only three ways. You

280
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,400
 can't suffer a witch to live, like the Bible saying goes, do not suffer a witch to live. So they

281
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,880
 take that to heart. They can send them out, kill them, or try to exorcise them. Now, what's going

282
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:24,520
 on right now is they're targeting children as witches and wizards. I knew that going into the

283
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,440
 movie. I knew that this movie has been connected to the murders of thousands of children. But when

284
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,280
 I was watching it, I actually didn't see that many kids in the movie. And that kind of left me

285
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:42,120
 puzzled. So let's dig into this a little bit more and see why this particular movie is connected to

286
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:50,120
 the murder of children. The first theory is that because Helen Uckpabio is behind it. Helen,

287
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:57,480
 by her biography that was listed online, said that at age 14, she was initiated into a satanic

288
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:05,880
 cult herself. She was groomed to be Lucifer's bride. But she broke free. Now she speaks the

289
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,160
 truth. She is the one who can tell you what is going on in the spiritual world. So she herself,

290
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:16,040
 as a child, was targeted by the forces of Satan. There is the famous scene of the kids eating

291
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,600
 lasagna and the kids eating the eyeballs. But the main antagonist in the movie is the mother.

292
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,040
 So she in this movie does not specifically say that children are the leading cause of witchcraft.

293
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,080
 And in real life, Helen has a defense against this because she gets accused of these

294
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,160
 child murders. She gets accused of inflaming the flames of hatred towards children. Helen, for her

295
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,920
 defense, says, listen, the movie was never intended to be a real story. It wasn't supposed to be a

296
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:51,160
 true story. It is a story of what could happen. It's a story of salvation and fighting the devil.

297
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,280
 She said, this movie is not supposed to be a real story. And accusing me of crimes that this

298
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:02,760
 movie inspires would be the same thing as accusing J.K. Rowling for riding Harry Potter and bad stuff

299
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,720
 being inspired by those books. She goes, "No part in that movie did I say it's okay to kill children."

300
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,960
 And that's true. That's true. Children actually play a pretty small part in the movie outside of

301
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:18,280
 eating a couple body parts. However, another thing people hold Helen accountable for is she wrote

302
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,720
 this book called "Unveiling the Mysteries of Witchcraft." And in this book it says, quote,

303
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,720
 "If a child under the age of two screams in the night, cries and is always feverish with

304
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:38,040
 deteriorating health, he or she is a servant of Satan." So whether or not the movie is inspiring

305
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:45,640
 this stuff, people are inspiring the belief that children can be servants of Satan. And whether

306
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,920
 or not End of the Wicked specifically does it, we have seen a switchover. It used to be that the

307
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:57,480
 elderly was accused of witchcraft. Even in this movie, it's the mother who's accused of witchcraft.

308
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,000
 But now we have the switchover where it's children. There's a British documentary that you can watch.

309
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,360
 You may not want to. I'll put it in the show notes if you want to ruin your day.

310
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:16,520
 It's called "Saving Africa's Witch Children." And it documents the lives of children who have been

311
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,320
 accused of witchcraft, the ones that are still alive. There's a group called the Child Rights

312
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,560
 and Rehabilitation Network. They have this little village that they've set up. They've taken 10

313
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:32,280
 children a week that have been accused of witchcraft. A lot of them are horribly injured. I'm not

314
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:39,000
 going to go through the injuries. If you watch the documentary, though, be prepared to see several

315
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 horrible injuries of these children ages 10 and under. And quite a few of them. There's quite a

316
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,640
 few shots of dead children as well. At one point in the documentary, some workers of the Child Rights

317
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,480
 and Rehabilitation Network want to bring a little girl back to her village and convince these people

318
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,480
 that she is not a witch. And when they show up, a man says, "You can leave her here, but I will kill

319
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,240
 her. She's a witch and I'll kill her. If you leave her here, she's dead. So get her out of here.

320
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,800
 I will kill her tonight." I mean, they just show this little girl crying. It's basically 45 minutes

321
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:25,560
 of that type of stuff. It's a real issue over there. And it's absolutely tragic. The movie itself

322
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,840
 may be cursed. And this is what I mean when I keep saying the word "cursed." When we talk about

323
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:37,640
 cursed, it has some sort of dark energy on it. I actually, outside of Helen's book, outside of

324
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,600
 Helen's book where she says children could be witches if they cry, I mean, they always cry,

325
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:49,160
 right? The movie itself doesn't make children the main adversary. The main adversary is the mother

326
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,520
 and then Beazelbub. The children play a part. I honestly don't think she intended the movie.

327
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:01,160
 When she says the movie's fake and you can't hold me accountable for it, I honestly think that she

328
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,920
 means that. I'll agree with her on that. But it could be, this is where we get to the cursed

329
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:13,800
 movie thing, that in the course of making this movie, whether or not the intentions were pure,

330
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:25,240
 it became infused with dark energy. The film became possessed. Because when you do watch it,

331
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:34,840
 it is boring, but something's off about it. Something's not right. And you just kind of get

332
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,840
 that sense of uneasiness when you're watching it. And I'm wondering if Conspiracy Cat fully on,

333
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,680
 while they were filming that movie, there was something working in the background

334
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:56,280
 that became part of the film itself. So when you watch it, it's not just a story about Christian

335
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:03,960
 redemption and beating back the powers of the devil. It's about that child your neighbor is holding

336
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:11,240
 is the devil. You have to kill it. In this dispatch's documentary, it's interesting. They'll be at a

337
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,120
 church service and a minister will come out and say, "Your son's possessed by Satan. Your son's a

338
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,320
 servant of Satan." And then there's just 12 year old boy just standing there and he's like, "What?

339
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,000
 Like, he's not, right?" And the mom's like, "No, he's a good boy." And the minister's like, "No,

340
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 that boy's possessed by Satan. You got to take care of it." And the film crew goes, "We don't know

341
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,960
 what happened to that kid." And this happens all the time. Kids are just getting accused of witchcraft.

342
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,800
 And I keep saying they get pushed out of the village, which is a death sentence for an eight-year-old.

343
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:47,160
 They get killed, which is a death sentence, or the exorcisms. That costs like $120. And most people

344
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,200
 in that state in Nigeria make a dollar a day. So you have parents selling off all of their

345
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,240
 belongings so they can get their child exercised. And even then, sometimes the guy collects the

346
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,080
 money and goes, "Sorry, I couldn't do it." And they still have to get rid of the kid.

347
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:08,120
 So you have murders and you have scams going on as well. And you have families being torn apart.

348
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,680
 And you have this entire culture of it. The government of Nigeria cracks down on this stuff,

349
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,680
 but that state, the local authorities are like, "We'll try." The governor of that state is like,

350
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,440
 "We're doing our best, but you go to an area and they're like, 'We're not going to talk to the police.'

351
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,360
 And the police are like, 'We can't tell whose kids this was. We can't track down the parents.'

352
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,440
 This kid was abandoned walking down the street of this other village and they don't want them

353
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,960
 because they know if this eight-year-old walks into their village, it's obviously a witch."

354
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,640
 The authorities show up at this one town and they're like, "We don't know whose kids those are.

355
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,480
 Go away. They're not from here." So you have the national government and you have the state

356
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,320
 government trying to work on this. But in the dead of night, children are still being killed.

357
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,200
 When I was watching this movie, when I was watching this documentary, when I was researching this,

358
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,760
 I thought, this is one of those stories when you look at the battle between heaven and hell,

359
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:08,120
 that the Christians are kind of the bad guys, right? In this story, the people who say that

360
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,960
 they're Christian, that they believe in Christ, they're the ones murdering children. Because

361
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,280
 someone else says, "Oh, the water went bad. My grandma got sick. It must be that little girl."

362
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,360
 So they chop her up or burn her, bury her alive, all sorts of things that goes on.

363
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,840
 And it's funny I was reading that and I go, "This is one of those stories where in the battle between

364
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,920
 the Christians and the forces of darkness, the Christians are in the wrong."

365
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:43,080
 The Child Rights and Rehabilitation Network have that little village where they take in 10

366
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,800
 kids a week who have been abandoned by their families. I imagine one day a little kid's going

367
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:55,640
 to show up there, a little 12-year-old girl, accused of witchcraft, exiled from her village.

368
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:02,360
 She walked all the way to the Child Rights and Rehabilitation Network facility.

369
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:09,320
 She was branded a witch. She quickly becomes friends with the other children. They've all

370
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,560
 suffered the same things, abandonment by the people who should love them the most.

371
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,920
 But there's one thing that makes this little girl different than all the other children

372
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:29,400
 at the facility. She's a real witch. She knows things. She has powers that most people

373
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:36,840
 can't even comprehend. And she can teach those powers. At night when the loving guardians of

374
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,120
 the Child Rights and Rehabilitation Network go to sleep and the children are in their bunks,

375
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,960
 this young girl teaches her classmates simple tricks. And as time goes on,

376
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,120
 children filter in and out of the facility, but this girl stays. No one wants her, but she wants

377
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:06,680
 to stay. And these children keep learning from her. Until soon, she has an army of children who

378
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:15,000
 were discarded by society. A religion that was based around love and redemption threw them away

379
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:25,080
 like so much trash. So they've turned to another master. They've turned to learn the dark arts.

380
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:35,000
 When villages and cities that dot the state of aqua-eyebomb begin to suffer horrible diseases,

381
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:46,040
 mysterious fires, waves of homicidal violence, no one will really know what's causing this epidemic.

382
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:53,880
 But that little girl does. The children are returning home. The children are going back

383
00:34:53,880 --> 00:35:03,640
 to their towns to show the people there what a real witch is capable of.
