1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 Police investigators thought they were just rescuing a young woman from sex trafficking.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,800
 It turns out they may have stumbled onto something much more vicious.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,060
 And then we join a young couple in Salt Lake City, Utah.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,040
 They went out there to spend a little bit of time together.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,400
 But then the unspeakable thing crawled out of the darkness.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,400
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
 I'm your host Jason Carvener.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,080
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,120
 Hope you guys have some really cool stuff to do this weekend.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,400
 First out, let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy patreons coming into

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,760
 Dead Rabbit Command right now.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
 Give it up for Ryan O'Hara.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
 Everyone round of applause.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,800
 There's fireworks going on for you.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,680
 Ryan, thank you so much for your continued support of the show.

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
 Really, really means a lot.

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,080
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,400
 Just help spread the word about the show.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
 Really, really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,040
 You have no idea how much that helps.

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,920
 Then it's Fan Art Friday.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
 Take a look at this amazing piece of art we got from Slappy Sleepy.

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,760
 It is a wood-burned image of the Dead Rabbit Radio logo.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,080
 Looks absolutely amazing.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
 Thank you so much Slappy Sleepy.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
 Really, really appreciate it.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
 Thanks for letting me use it for Fan Art Friday.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,600
 And I wanted to add this too.

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,880
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,680
 You guys have been requesting it for a long time.

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,160
 I finally got it.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,840
 I now have a PO box.

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,800
 So if you want to mail me stuff, if you want to mail me some of this fan art you're doing

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,000
 or mail me letters, the PO box is going to be in the show notes.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,120
 There's this weird thing going on right now.

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,240
 If you can believe it in the life of a man who does a paranormal podcast.

40
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,320
 One of you guys reached out to me a while ago and told me.

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,800
 You tempted me that you had a piece of the Balloon Boy's balloon.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,800
 My favorite conspiracy story ever.

43
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,960
 Drew, crime, however you want to label it.

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,520
 The Balloon Boy, the Heeney Saga.

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,680
 I'm about to do like a 60-part documentary on them.

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
 Told me you had a piece of the Balloon Boy's.

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,840
 I reached out to you.

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
 I tried looking for you.

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
 I was looking through Instagram and Twitter and TikTok and Facebook and all these places

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,040
 you can contact me.

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
 I can't find you.

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,720
 I was going to let you know that I had the PO box.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,800
 So now I'm starting to think that you don't exist.

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,280
 I'm starting to think that this was some sort of Berenstein bear effect in an alternate

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
 universe.

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,600
 Jason is now proudly looking at a piece of the Balloon Boy.

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 Not the Balloon Boy himself.

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,080
 It's a piece of flesh from Falcon Heeney.

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
 I got more in my garage.

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,240
 But the balloon itself.

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,080
 So if you are the possessor of the Balloon Boy balloon piece, please, please get in

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
 touch with me and send it to me.

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,600
 Because I am golem-esque really craving this piece of balloon art.

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,160
 And also, speaking of balloons, Cabot Cove Balloon Friends has an amazing piece of art

65
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,400
 there sending me that they've been working on for a long time.

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,200
 And they were also really wanting me to get the...

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,480
 So I got it for you guys.

68
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,360
 And I am looking forward to getting all sorts of cool art and letters from you from around

69
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
 the world.

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,160
 Ryan, let's go ahead and toss you the controls to the Hair Hanglighter.

71
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,560
 We're gonna take a nice glighty flight all the way from Dead Rabbit Command to Clarksburg,

72
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,880
 West Virginia.

73
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,760
 Now I've recently started doing a lot of stuff on TikTok.

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
 I'm uploading stuff every day.

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
 Now if you're not a fan of TikTok, that's fine.

76
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,120
 I also post it to my Twitter, to my Instagram, and I post it to YouTube as well.

77
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,600
 So you don't have to join everything.

78
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
 Just figure out where it's most convenient to you.

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,160
 I don't upload it to the podcast because they're only a minute long and it would, trust me,

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,200
 would aggravate you if you had all these minute downloads.

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,080
 But I'm making it as available as possible.

82
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
 You don't have to go to TikTok.

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,960
 But something I've started doing is I love true crime, but a lot of true crime is just

84
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,000
 who would, wouldn't wear why how?

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,920
 And there's no way to extrapolate it.

86
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,080
 And so I don't cover it a lot on the podcast proper.

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
 But I...

88
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,200
 Every day I love reading these true crime stories.

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,080
 This one I originally came across and I was like, "Oh, this is perfect for a TikTok.

90
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,560
 A little short thing."

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,480
 And then it just kind of spiraled into a bizarre, unexpected twist.

92
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,440
 We're in Clarksburg, West Virginia.

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
 It's 2019.

94
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,960
 And there's a 15 year old girl.

95
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,200
 She's unnamed.

96
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,680
 She's a victim of sex trafficking.

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,640
 So we're going to call her Samantha.

98
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,600
 And if that's her name, it's just a shot in the dark.

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,160
 Samantha begins hanging out with this dude named Johnny Thomas.

100
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,320
 He's a 34 year old man and it starts off as a consensual, quote unquote, consensual relationship.

101
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,960
 I mean, it's illegal.

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,520
 She can't really give consent of that age.

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,960
 She's quickly swept up into the world of sex trafficking.

104
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
 And this is normally how these things play out.

105
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,360
 She's forced to move from state to state along the East Coast and she's forced to have sex

106
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,960
 for money and then they're taking her to photo shoots so they can put her ads online and

107
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,280
 in magazines and all this stuff.

108
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,560
 There's a whole infrastructure built around sex trafficking.

109
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,800
 You think that it's the pimp and the girl's out on the street.

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
 What do you want, honey?

111
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 Huh?

112
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
 You want a...

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 You want a...

114
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,320
 I'm not gonna say what it is because it's sexually explicit, but he'll talk about sex

115
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,200
 trafficking.

116
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,740
 You think it's like that and there are parts like that, but there's also like a whole infrastructure

117
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
 behind it.

118
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,880
 I wonder if they have like sex trafficking accountants, but you definitely have like

119
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,080
 photo shoots and web designers and things like that.

120
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,600
 We're not talking about porn at this point.

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,400
 We're talking about illegal sex trafficking.

122
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,600
 Like obviously the photographer's not going to be like, can I see your driver's license?

123
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,920
 It's obvious this girl is 15 years old and he's taking pictures of this girl.

124
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,000
 She tries escaping and she gets caught.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,520
 And Johnny Thomas isn't working alone.

126
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,920
 He has a female partner as well and she's kind of like building the trust with Samantha,

127
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,640
 but at the same time she's also there to make money exploiting these girls.

128
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,160
 She tries escaping, she gets caught, she has an incredibly brutal encounter with a client

129
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,080
 that leaves her bleeding and she's pleading to be let out and Johnny's like, "No, you're

130
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
 my girl now.

131
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
 You gotta make money."

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
 Finally, she escapes.

133
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,580
 Finally she's able to get out of there and she turns in Johnny.

134
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,800
 She turns in his accomplice, Becca Mills, a 25 year old woman.

135
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,840
 They're both facing life in prison because this amounts to slavery.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,760
 Sex trafficking alone is such a huge charge because you're moving from state to state,

137
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,840
 you're facilitating all of this stuff and then you have all sorts of rape and abuse and like

138
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
 assault charges and things like that going on top of it.

139
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,140
 They're both facing life in prison.

140
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,180
 Not in and of itself is just a sad true crime story, but listen to this next part.

141
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,680
 This is where you get into the conspiracy of it.

142
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,680
 This is really, really creepy.

143
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,140
 When she keeps fighting, fighting this life, she's trying to get out of that and she keeps

144
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,100
 trying to escape, she keeps being rebellious.

145
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,620
 Johnny tells her this more than once, "Listen, you're lucky you're with me because I'll

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,820
 tell you what.

147
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,400
 I can sell you tonight."

148
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,660
 I know a guy who will give me $1,500 on the spot right now.

149
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,980
 You know what he's going to do to you?

150
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,820
 He's going to take you, he's going to inject you full of heroin and then he's going to

151
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,740
 chain you up to a bed.

152
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,980
 And then while you're half awake, half asleep in a state of bliss really, you're going to

153
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:23,500
 see him chop off one of your toes and then the next toe and then the next toe.

154
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,400
 And you're not going to feel the pain, but you'll mentally be able to experience the

155
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,320
 horror as he amputates all of your toes.

156
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,040
 You're actually going to see each finger slowly be removed and then the hand cut at the wrist.

157
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,200
 You're going to see your body whittle down to nothing but a torso.

158
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:51,720
 If you try escaping one more time, I'll sell you to a man that I know has done that to

159
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,300
 many other women.

160
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,580
 On the one hand this could be a bluff, right?

161
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,520
 Johnny Thomas could have actually made it up.

162
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,420
 Or it could have been an urban legend.

163
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,460
 He had heard of this story about a man who did this, but it is quite possible that this

164
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,720
 is real.

165
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,020
 And that Johnny Thomas, this low level piece of trash sex trafficker who's picking up

166
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,520
 young girls and beating them into submission so they can make him a little bit of money.

167
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,460
 Knows a serial killer who takes the light and slowly removing a woman's body parts bit by

168
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,100
 bit until she becomes nothing.

169
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,020
 Now Johnny Thomas is caught.

170
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,580
 He's facing trial.

171
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,500
 What about this guy?

172
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,980
 Is he still out there?

173
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,220
 Who knows?

174
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,400
 Criminal urban legend, which they do exist.

175
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,020
 Criminals because it's their own underbelly, their own world, they do have their own urban

176
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,020
 legends.

177
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,300
 Is it a very interesting subculture?

178
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,100
 Or is it a real person that he knows?

179
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,820
 Or knows of?

180
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,980
 Who right now could be pulling $1500 out of his wallet and passing it to a pimp as a young

181
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,320
 woman is being led into the back of his car.

182
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,940
 Terrifying.

183
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,440
 Terrifying.

184
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,120
 True crime story with that dash of conspiracy theory.

185
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,840
 And hopefully a whole lot of urban legend as well.

186
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,520
 Ryan is like "Damn, that's like the spookiest story you've told in a long time.

187
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,020
 Why am I on this?

188
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,040
 He's too scared of him throwing in the carbonicopter keys.

189
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
 He drops them.

190
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
 Ah!"

191
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,440
 Ryan, go ahead and pick up those carbonicopter keys.

192
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,980
 We are leaving behind Clarksburg, West Virginia.

193
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:45,280
 We are headed on out to Salt Lake City, Utah.

194
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,240
 And as we're headed out there, I wanted to do a quick update.

195
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,440
 I've talked before about Max Kramer.

196
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,520
 Max Kramer, quick overview, is a homeless man who is a video game designer who believes

197
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,720
 that everyone lives in the matrix and he's one of the very few people and we're just

198
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,760
 like robots that walk around or simulated people.

199
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
 Sim, yeah, we are.

200
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,360
 He calls us Sims.

201
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,640
 He also believes that he can wear our skin and attack our children, put it to put it

202
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
 politely.

203
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
 That's what he believes.

204
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,520
 I'll put the episode in the show notes.

205
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,280
 And I said in a recent episode, because I think I've covered him twice, he's a fascinating

206
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,320
 character because he's so off the rocker nuts, but he can write.

207
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,880
 He can write very succinctly.

208
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,520
 It doesn't make sense, but it's very rare when we can see someone who can write their

209
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,840
 thoughts out who are this far gone.

210
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,000
 He's still alive.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,440
 He's still alive and he is still doing this stuff.

212
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,120
 I actually got an email from a woman named Cassandra.

213
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,520
 She lives in Cookville, Tennessee and she goes, "Hey, you know that guy that you're

214
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,920
 doing those episodes on?

215
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,640
 Here's a picture of his van."

216
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,400
 I don't know if she took the picture.

217
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,200
 I'm pretty sure she wasn't following this guy, but he has this van and it says like

218
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,680
 Sim, people on it.

219
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
 It's Max Kramer.

220
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,760
 And he has a whole new website that we're going to dive into shortly.

221
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,800
 I'm still going through his old website, but I wanted to share with you some Maxisms.

222
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,640
 I wanted to share with you some of these thoughts because sometimes you just have to kick back

223
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,960
 and think, what does a homeless video game designer think about when they're not designing

224
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,360
 video games?

225
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
 Let me read you these.

226
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,560
 It has this theory called car machine, which is computer assisted reality.

227
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
 It's what we live in.

228
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
 Let me read you this.

229
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,280
 It's quote, "So when the car machine, I am taunted by strangers all day sometimes.

230
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,720
 Insults, homosexual harassment, he has this weird hang up about not being gay.

231
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,640
 He thinks that gay people are constantly trying to attack him or turn him gay or both at the

232
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,280
 same time.

233
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,720
 Insults, homosexual harassment," he says here for the hundredth time on his website.

234
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,280
 "I'm totally straight.

235
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:54,000
 Impersonations of my family and step family from strangers.

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,360
 Go to jail for freedom of speech.

237
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,640
 Can't get a job because of the economy.

238
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,320
 Wade in lines of the homeless shelter for food.

239
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,240
 Talk to women without any sex for two years.

240
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
 Pennyless.

241
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,680
 Shoes falling apart.

242
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
 Holes in my socks.

243
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,960
 And you'll go, 'Okay, Jason, those are all legitimate things.'

244
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,600
 Not the people impersonating your family.

245
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,520
 But that's second, I can see that second section here.

246
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,040
 Not being able to get a job.

247
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
 Wade in lines of the homeless shelter.

248
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,480
 Maybe you don't wait in lines of the homeless shelter either.

249
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,960
 But not being able to get a job.

250
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,000
 Not being able to get a date.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Not having a lot of money.

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Shoes falling apart.

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Holes in my socks.

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,080
 That's all stuff you feel bad for this guy.

255
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,000
 But let me finish this.

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,240
 Shoes falling apart.

257
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:43,560
 Holes in my socks stalked by queer people wearing skin dye and disguises.

258
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,080
 That is strange.

259
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
 It seems insane.

260
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,920
 Now that's so fascinating.

261
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,640
 I just ran across this blurb when I was researching him.

262
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,160
 It's fascinating because even he knows that all of those thoughts are insane and yet he

263
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,880
 believes them.

264
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,160
 So that's why I love Max Kramer.

265
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,320
 He knows something's wrong.

266
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,800
 I've run across insane people in my real life and they don't know they're insane.

267
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
 You may have the unfortunate pleasure of doing that as well.

268
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,080
 We definitely see him online.

269
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,520
 A lot of times you see people posting stuff online and you're like this is nuts.

270
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,000
 "Well you're just part of the shill agenda blah blah blah blah."

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,040
 But he knows that thinking that queer people wearing skin dye and disguises is an insane

272
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,920
 thought and yet he still believes it.

273
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
 Fascinating.

274
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,080
 Fascinating character Max Kramer.

275
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
 There's nothing really more.

276
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,040
 I mean I have tons and tons more stuff to talk about with Max Kramer but I kind of wanted

277
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,560
 to share that insight with you.

278
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
 So bizarre.

279
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,400
 To wrap I'll add this one too.

280
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,480
 He also said one day "After eating a bag of parsnips vegetables I experienced erectile

281
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
 dysfunction."

282
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
 Unquote.

283
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,960
 So right now you're eating a big bag of parsnips and they're like "Nyum nyum nyum."

284
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,720
 I finally got a date after two years of talking to women "Nyum nyum nyum nyum."

285
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,320
 Which is one more parsnip and I'll be ready to go.

286
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,640
 So yeah it's just fascinating.

287
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,000
 The stuff that this guy writes down is just so bizarre.

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,480
 He does have a dream that he actually he really wants cause he's a homeless person.

289
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,720
 He recycles cans all the time.

290
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,240
 He said "Sometimes when I'm walking around recycling I imagine..."

291
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
 What if?

292
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,040
 The thing about it is you were recycling cans.

293
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,160
 If you were having to rely on recycling cans for your main source of income what would

294
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
 it be or what if?

295
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,520
 Sometimes when I'm walking around recycling I imagine what if there was a gigantic...

296
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,640
 It's not a million dollars in the briefcase.

297
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:46,920
 I imagine what if there was a gigantic can like the size of a duffel bag worth ten dollars.

298
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,840
 And you go "Oh Jason that's kind of sweet actually.

299
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,600
 He doesn't have these high hopes, these high dreams.

300
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,560
 Ten dollars would be life changing to him."

301
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,360
 Well we have a segment coming up on him soon where he does explain what he will do if he

302
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,200
 - here's a little teaser - he'll explain what he'll do if he finds a million dollars.

303
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,880
 He's going to build an edible theme park.

304
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,080
 And the edible part, the edible part of the theme park is you.

305
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
 It's bizarre.

306
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
 It's so bizarre.

307
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,800
 And I also want to give a shout out to Oogs cause he's the one who originally told me about

308
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
 Max Kramer.

309
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,520
 But we'll talk about his edible theme park on a future episode.

310
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,360
 Max Kramer is just - he said "I just love this guy."

311
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,680
 Ryan you see that little patch of land just outside of Salt Lake City?

312
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,560
 We're going to land there.

313
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,680
 And we're going to visit a young couple.

314
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,520
 It's October 1982.

315
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,760
 And it's late at night.

316
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,400
 [Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun]

317
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,040
 Carbonicoptor lands kind of far away from what's going on.

318
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,280
 We see this young couple.

319
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
 We don't have their names.

320
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,920
 We want to call them Levi and Rebecca.

321
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,200
 We're going to call them Levi and Rebecca.

322
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,960
 And they're sitting in this field.

323
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,680
 Where we're at isn't in the middle of nowhere.

324
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,080
 There's like a school there.

325
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,880
 And they're sitting in a field near the school.

326
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,120
 And a cool mist appears over the field.

327
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,440
 And Rebecca and Levi are just kind of sitting there and they feel - all of a sudden just

328
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,480
 feel super relaxing.

329
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,560
 It feels like they both just drank a delicious Sierra Mist.

330
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
 But they didn't.

331
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,560
 They didn't.

332
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,400
 They will wish they had.

333
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,120
 They will wish that was the end of the story.

334
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
 They will wish they were in a commercial.

335
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,000
 They're sitting there and this cool mist envelops them.

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,200
 And they just feel both very at ease.

337
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
 Pleasant.

338
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,160
 But then Levi notices something.

339
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,800
 His hand is on the ground and he's like, "What?"

340
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
 "What?

341
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 That's weird.

342
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 The ground.

343
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 It's..."

344
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And Rebecca goes, "You're right.

345
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 It got muddy all of a sudden."

346
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 "What?

347
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 How did the ground get so muddy?

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Could the mist - no, no, no.

349
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,160
 There's not enough moisture in the mist."

350
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,360
 Levi says to make it this muddy.

351
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,960
 And that's when they notice the entire area is dead quiet.

352
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,680
 Not a bird.

353
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,280
 Not a bug.

354
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:05,200
 It's almost like they're sitting in a vacuum.

355
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:13,000
 Without talking to each other, Levi and Rebecca both begin to slowly turn their heads.

356
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,680
 Both looking over their left shoulder.

357
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,440
 They're synchronized in this movement.

358
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,640
 They're both just slowly turning their heads to look over their left shoulder.

359
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,560
 And while they're doing it, they feel the hairs prick up on the back of their neck.

360
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,320
 Something is wrong.

361
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,960
 Two hundred feet away, they see pitch blackness.

362
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,440
 And out of that blackness, it crawls.

363
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:56,920
 This monstrosity is human-sized and crawling on its belly towards the young couple.

364
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,520
 Its skin is so dark it's hard to see as it's coming out of the shadows.

365
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,840
 But they describe it like this.

366
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,440
 It's completely naked.

367
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,640
 Its arms are held close against its body and its hands are pressed against its own waist.

368
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,800
 It's slowly inching towards them, though.

369
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,640
 And they're watching this sight and they realize the only way it's moving, it's pushing its

370
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:31,160
 toes into the mud and scooting forward inch by inch on its belly.

371
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,040
 The knees were inhuman.

372
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,240
 You could figure it might be a dude laying on his stomach doing this.

373
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
 It would take a while, right?

374
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,160
 There would be more convenient ways to sneak up on people.

375
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,640
 But the knees were bent up and backwards.

376
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,420
 So he wasn't laying flesh on the ground.

377
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,240
 His knees were up in the air while the rest of his body was pushed against the mud.

378
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:03,160
 And yet only his toes continued to wiggle as this creature inched ever closer to them.

379
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,440
 It lifted its head up out of the mud.

380
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,560
 And the last hope that this was some sort of human trick evaporated.

381
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:20,400
 When Levi and Rebecca looked at this thing's face, where its eyes should be, was just two

382
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,200
 endless pools of darkness.

383
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,920
 Levi and Rebecca jumped up, ran to their car, and sped off.

384
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,080
 After they reported this, others came out and visited the area.

385
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,360
 There was no sign of this creature, but strange tracks were found in the area.

386
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,800
 I got that story from one of my favorite websites, think about it docs.com.

387
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,680
 You guys should be checking that website out, it's so good.

388
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,240
 They got it from Castle of Spirits, which is a collection of stories.

389
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,760
 Now I have a vague recollection of this story.

390
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,520
 I've been sitting on this story for a while, so it could be that I think it's really cool.

391
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,440
 I may have just been playing it over and over in my head.

392
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,680
 I may have actually covered a similar story like this before.

393
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,480
 And there's a chance, you know, this is episode 726.

394
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,280
 There's a chance I've covered this story before.

395
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,440
 Because it sounds so familiar.

396
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,720
 I don't think I've covered it for sure before, but I think I've covered something like it.

397
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,960
 But even if I had repeated it, even if this is a total repeat, and if it is, it's unintentional.

398
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,760
 My takeaway is still the same.

399
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,040
 This is utterly horrifying.

400
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,360
 Because what we have is we have a cryptid that can control not its environment, your

401
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,360
 environment.

402
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,320
 There's really two views on cryptids.

403
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,400
 That cryptids are some sort of biological entity that is an undiscovered life form,

404
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,080
 like maybe Loch Ness Monster is a dinosaur, maybe Bigfoot is this giant simian.

405
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,560
 But that's a modern way of looking at these things.

406
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,440
 When you look back at the old legends of Bigfoot or sea monsters, they were devils.

407
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,720
 These were things that were not of this world.

408
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,200
 The old native version of Bigfoot was he was a ghost.

409
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
 That's why you can never catch him.

410
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
 It was like this spirit animal.

411
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,560
 And when you think of sea monsters and old European lore, they were monstrosities.

412
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,000
 Not some biological entity.

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,320
 It has a reproduction cycle and a sleep cycle and has a diet and poops.

414
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,240
 And that version of the cryptid is far more terrifying because they are not of this earth.

415
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,120
 They live here, they share the planet with us, but they are not of this earth.

416
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:35,920
 You, a rhinoceros, a squirrel, and a goldfish all have the same life cycle.

417
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,720
 You all have the same needs.

418
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,760
 And when you throw something into that food chain that doesn't, that can alter time, can

419
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,320
 alter reality, can teleport, that isn't bound to the needs of calories in to be able to

420
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,280
 complete certain actions, get sore muscles, toothaches, they don't have these things.

421
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,920
 They're not biological entities.

422
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,680
 And that would make them the perfect hunter.

423
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,360
 They don't tire.

424
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,160
 They just hunt.

425
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:14,600
 And now, with this one, has the ability to turn any area into its own kill box.

426
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,200
 Because we all know that there's another version of this story.

427
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,800
 We all know that there's a version of this story where 12 hours after this event, Levi

428
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,400
 and Rebecca don't come home.

429
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,880
 And 14 hours after that, police are assembling search parties, and three days after that,

430
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,480
 missing people signs go up all over the town of Salt Lake City.

431
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,080
 National news agencies come into town to report the story of a young missing couple.

432
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,080
 Within a month, most of those missing persons' flyers are in trash cans and recycle bins.

433
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,040
 The family still puts up fresh ones, but the story is quickly fading from the memories

434
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
 of the people.

435
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,640
 And they're never seen again.

436
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,200
 That's the other version of this story.

437
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,160
 And luckily, they got away from this thing.

438
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,520
 But there is the other version where they don't.

439
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:12,640
 Where their car is found by a nearby school, and there's no sign of Rebecca and Levi.

440
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,800
 It's scary to think that the difference between Levi and Rebecca living to tell this tale,

441
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:26,360
 or Levi and Rebecca disappearing into the night as this mud creature pulls them into

442
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
 the darkness.

443
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,120
 The difference between these two stories is about 50 feet.

444
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,720
 How do they not gotten to their car?

445
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,420
 We would have never known what happened to them.

446
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,040
 They would have just disappeared.

447
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,240
 Into the mist.

448
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,560
 Into the mud.

449
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:54,560
 Into the realm of a supernatural predator.

450
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,200
 Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is going to be your email address.

 Tiktok is at Dead Rabbit Radio.

453
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,600
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

454
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,160
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

455
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,140
 I'm so glad you listened to it today.

456
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,140
 Have a great weekend guys.

457
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,140
 I'll see you in my next video.

458
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:11,140
 Bye.

459
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:36,140
 Bye.

460
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,720
 (upbeat music)
