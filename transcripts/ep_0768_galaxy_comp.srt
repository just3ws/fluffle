1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,860
 A ninja, a ninja attacks a US base on US soil and nobody seems to care.

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,520
 Such a bizarre story.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 So insane.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,280
 Then I'm outraged, I'm outraged people aren't talking about that story.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:25,060
 And then we travel to Oregon to have a good night out drinking at a local bar.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,160
 Everything is going according to plan until it's time to go to sleep.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,520
 And then we take a look at a brand new conspiracy theory from the twisted mind of your favorite

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,720
 podcast host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,440
 A lot of times we've talked about people like Hans Wormhat and other conspiracy theorists

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,160
 who believe that NASA is trying to hide proof of God from us.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,520
 We always laugh at these conspiracy theories, but the other day I looked up at the night

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,480
 sky and had an epiphany.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,040
 What if Hans is right?

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,840
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:11,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,200
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
 Hope you guys are having lots of fun.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,480
 Hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,880
 I bought a heater that oscillates.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,920
 That's how exciting my life is right now.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
 You know what?

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
 I love it.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,360
 I've always seen myself moving up here from California when I moved up to Hood River.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
 I always saw this as this was Sam going back to the Shire.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
 I'm retired baby.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,240
 I'm done with all of the crazy adventures.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
 I'm done.

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,920
 I buy an oscillating fan on Amazon and it gets sent to me and I'm like, "Whoa, this

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,320
 is a heater with remote control and it oscillates?"

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,560
 That's the most exciting thing and I love it.

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,120
 I don't need car crashes.

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
 People coming after me.

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,600
 I just need an oscillating heater.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,720
 You get to that point in life and it is a good point in life.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,560
 And another good thing in life is our Patreon supporters.

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,920
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, a long time Patreon supporter.

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,120
 Give it up for George Clooney.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
 The George Clooney.

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
 You didn't know he's the word of the show?

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,320
 Come on in George.

42
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,920
 I call him Georgey for short.

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,200
 George, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
 I could buy a lot more heaters but I totally understand.

46
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,920
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,520
 George, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

48
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,240
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
 Grab onto George's hips.

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,560
 Oh wait, actually before we do that, we got some Fan Art Friday.

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,440
 We're just going to hold on to his hips for the rest of this segment.

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
 Fan Art Friday.

53
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,400
 Look at this awesome art I got from Madison Merritt.

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,360
 It's the classic Dead Rabbit Radio logo but Madison's own take on it.

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,640
 Really, really love this stuff you guys are doing.

56
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,200
 That's so awesome.

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,960
 Really, really love it.

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,920
 Thank you so much Madison.

59
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,480
 So George, we're going to go ahead and keep holding onto your hips.

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,320
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

61
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,400
 We are headed all the way out to the Mojave Desert in California.

62
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
 [breathing]

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:24,960
 The reason why we're going out to the Mojave Desert, this story absolutely boggles my mind.

64
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,800
 So let me start by giving credit.

65
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,400
 Mason on the Patreon Discord sent this over to me so thank you so much for that.

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,520
 I got all of my information because it's really only coming out of one source right now.

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,880
 It's Stars and Stripes which is the official newsletter for the Milit Armed Forces.

68
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,360
 These articles have been written by Chad Garland.

69
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
 September 18th, 2021 we're in the Mojave Desert.

70
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,320
 We're specifically at the In-Yokern Airport.

71
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
 What's going on?

72
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,080
 It's 1 a.m. and currently this airport is being used for training exercises by the 160th

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,960
 Special Operations Aviation Regiment aka the Nightstalkers.

74
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,360
 It's an elite helicopter unit.

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,120
 They're training here.

76
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,160
 At 1 a.m. the Staff Sergeant leaves the Admin Building.

77
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
 Smoke a cigarette.

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,840
 Get a little relaxation from all those other knuckleheads in that building.

79
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,040
 There's 26 guys in total here.

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,680
 While he's outdoors he's smoking a cigarette.

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,000
 His name is not released for security reasons and I will also assume embarrassment reasons.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,920
 As he's outside smoking a cigarette he turns around and there's a ninja standing next to

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
 him.

84
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:43,600
 Full on Ninja Garb carrying a katana and he asks the Staff Sergeant "Do you know who

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
 I am?"

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
 I don't know.

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,800
 I don't know if he had a voice changer but we will pretend that he did.

88
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,920
 Do you know who I am?

89
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,920
 Staff Sergeant's looking over at him and he's probably thinking "Ninja?

90
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,160
 But I mean specifically I don't know."

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,400
 So he answers "No."

92
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,760
 And then the guy goes "Do you know where my family is?"

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,720
 Staff Sergeant's like "Are there baby ninjas around?"

94
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,320
 That would be really cool if they were hiding in the bushes and underneath street lamps.

95
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,960
 But he says "No."

96
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,480
 He doesn't goad on the armed ninja.

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,760
 He goes "I know, I don't know where your family is."

98
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:24,560
 The ninja then begins to slash at the Staff Sergeant.

99
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,880
 Cutting his knee and his leg.

100
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
 Staff Sergeant starts running away.

101
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
 Gets to a fence.

102
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,320
 He's over it.

103
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,640
 The ninja is in quick pursuit.

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
 See he doesn't even make sound.

105
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
 I didn't have to do sound effects.

106
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,400
 He doesn't make sound when he's running.

107
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,760
 The Staff Sergeant breathes heavily.

108
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,000
 The ninja does that non-noise.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,920
 Staff Sergeant gets into the admin building.

110
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,440
 He goes "Guys, you will not believe what's out here right now.

111
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
 A ninja."

112
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,640
 He didn't let him guess because he knew they would never guess.

113
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
 They're like an elephant.

114
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,960
 He's like "No, a ninja."

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
 He locks all the doors.

116
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
 He's calling 911.

117
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,400
 There's 26 Special Operations Soldiers in the hangar.

118
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,640
 Verse 1 Ninja.

119
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,760
 We've been lied to, ladies and gentlemen.

120
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,320
 I've seen many an episode of G.I. Joe which let me know that if you took 26 Joes and put

121
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,160
 them up against Storm Shadow, to be fair this is a cartoon, but the Joes would win.

122
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,440
 Maybe Storm Shadow is going to take a couple of them out.

123
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,520
 You don't want to be that guy, but it's a cartoon.

124
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,600
 They're not really dead.

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,000
 Shipwreck just gets his shirt kind of torn.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,880
 Now I guess we've also been watching movies where one guy with ninja skills comes in and

127
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,760
 kills a bunch of faceless goons, but these are U.S. Soldiers.

128
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
 They're not faceless goons.

129
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,760
 We're not the faceless goons.

130
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,520
 The other guys are the faceless goons.

131
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,920
 Troops from Belarus trying to take down Owen Wilson.

132
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,520
 Those are the faceless goons unless you're listening to this podcast in Belarus and you're

133
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,000
 my favorite listeners.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,080
 This one ninja keeps 26 Special Forces Operators at bay.

135
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,280
 Now to be fair they're Special Forces and helicopters, but still they should know how

136
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,240
 to fight like hand to hand or chair to sword.

137
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,600
 They are in this building hiding from a ninja with a sword and he begins throwing, first

138
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,160
 off he begins punching the door, which their hearts must have just stopped at that point

139
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,080
 because after the first fist punch hits the door you have to think, does he know a ninja

140
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
 way?

141
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,000
 Does he know a ninja way of punching a door off of the hinges?

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,320
 But he punches the door a couple of times.

143
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
 That doesn't work.

144
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:57,720
 He's punching windows, which works and then he picks up a big piece of asphalt and throws

145
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,240
 it through the window and again people think this wasn't a real ninja.

146
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,000
 We'll get to the ending of this story.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,540
 That's how stories normally conclude, but people think he's not a real ninja.

148
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:17,280
 He is able to take a large piece of asphalt, throw it through a window and hit a man.

149
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,320
 In the building.

150
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,820
 That skill.

151
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,720
 That skill because when you think about it when you're trying to shoot a hoop, shoot

152
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,240
 basketball that's already a little difficult, but he's shooting basketball with not a basketball

153
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,680
 with a giant piece of asphalt.

154
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,480
 It's going through a window and he's still able to throw it accurately enough that it

155
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,800
 hits a captain.

156
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,600
 Now the soldiers, even though they're soldiers, you're like Jason you're going really hard

157
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 on these guys.

158
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,720
 This ninja did have a sword and I get it.

159
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,280
 I've had knives pulled on me.

160
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,880
 It's not a fun experience.

161
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,400
 But what do these guys do in the battlefield?

162
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,840
 Again, they are helicopter operators so maybe they don't know how to fight hand to hand,

163
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,440
 but I thought that was kind of required.

164
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,640
 I thought like if you joined the military you had to know how to swim and shoot a gun

165
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,720
 and like roll around on the ground and go no and screaming the air and stuff like that.

166
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,640
 But apparently those rules don't apply to the 160th.

167
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
 They are just hanging out.

168
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,880
 They don't have any guns in there.

169
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
 They're on training.

170
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,120
 They don't even have like an experimental helicopter.

171
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,440
 You don't have nothing.

172
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,240
 What were they training with?

173
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,200
 The police show up and they shoot him with some non-lethal rounds and I really hope that

174
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,560
 he tried blocking them with his sword.

175
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
 I don't know.

176
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,800
 It doesn't say for sure but the rounds were useless.

177
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,000
 The non-lethal rounds did nothing to this guy so I'm sure the police officers left it

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
 out of the report that it was so weird.

179
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,600
 We pulled our guns and then all of a sudden reality became split screen and it was a close

180
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,520
 up of my eyes and a close up of his eyes and then I shot three times and he just moved

181
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,320
 his sword around noiselessly.

182
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,560
 Is that a word?

183
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
 Quietly.

184
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
 He moved his sword around quietly.

185
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,040
 It moved like a whisper through the night sky.

186
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,240
 It moved like a whisper through the morning air and then the non-lethal rounds just seemed

187
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
 to be chopped in half.

188
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
 They don't say that.

189
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,520
 They did pull out a taser and they finally subdued him with a taser.

190
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,520
 That story I'd seen when I was on my vacation and I was like, "What?

191
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
 This is insane."

192
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,120
 But I wanted to wait because I wanted a key piece of information.

193
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,120
 When the story was first released they said, "Authorties are not saying who this guy is."

194
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,360
 I thought, "That's really the crux to the issue, right?

195
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,280
 If this guy is a ninja and he's actually from like a ninja clan, this is huge.

196
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
 This is huge.

197
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,280
 Geopolitical ramifications."

198
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,800
 And then there was a follow-up article to this whole thing.

199
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,560
 They did announce who this guy was.

200
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,880
 Gino Rivera, 35-year-old man.

201
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,200
 And I'm like, "Now I just have even more questions, right?"

202
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,960
 I was thinking maybe it was an actual ninja in the military.

203
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,920
 Can't up this guy's family or something like that?

204
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,720
 He was on some sort of collateral Arnold Schwarzenegger-esque revenge mission.

205
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
 No.

206
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,000
 There's some guy named Gino Rivera, not a ninja.

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,800
 Just some dude who's now in jail for attempted homicide, brandishing a weapon.

208
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,840
 He's got a whole slew of charges, right?

209
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,160
 Embarrassing the US military.

210
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,840
 You go, Jason, I think you're going a little hard on the fact that a dude shows up.

211
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,600
 How would you like it if a dude showed up at his sword at your workplace, right?

212
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
 And I wouldn't, right?

213
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,920
 It'd be pretty rude.

214
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,360
 But I'm not a trained soldier.

215
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,480
 I'm not a trained soldier, but if I was a trained soldier and some guy comes to me

216
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,880
 with a sword and he's like dressed as a ninja and he goes, "You know where my family is?"

217
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,920
 I'll say, "Probably burning in hell.

218
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,200
 Why don't you respect my back?"

219
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
 And I just turn around, right?

220
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,480
 I'm just going to throw him off of his game and I'm going to hear that sword whistle

221
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
 through the wind.

222
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,760
 And I'm going to put my hands up.

223
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
 I'm blocking.

224
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,600
 I'm going to catch you with my hands right before it hits my skull.

225
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,640
 I could have done it earlier, but I wanted it to be super dramatic.

226
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,160
 And then I turn around somehow.

227
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
 I don't know.

228
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,120
 I haven't worked at all physics, but I turn around.

229
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,000
 My head spins around like the extra system.

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,080
 I'm staring at him and I look at him and I go, "My turn."

231
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,080
 And then I flip the sword up and I catch it.

232
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,120
 And then I keep it because it's a cool sword and I want a sword.

233
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,040
 I take it to my car and I put it in the trunk and then I come back and I walk back to him.

234
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,520
 And I go, "My turn still."

235
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
 Because he's not doing anything.

236
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,320
 And then I kick him in the shins a couple of times.

237
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,800
 And if it's that easy, if I could do it, well, actually, to be fair, I don't even need to

238
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
 get made a thing.

239
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
 The police did it.

240
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,520
 The police showed up, shot a couple of non-lethal rounds at him, tased them and it was over.

241
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
 So I don't know.

242
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
 I don't know.

243
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,800
 I think I just think military are trained to fight and this guy came to fight and they

244
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,440
 ran away and they hid.

245
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,160
 So that's a little just embarrassing.

246
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,320
 And more to the point, what in the world was this guy's motivation?

247
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
 Where is his family?

248
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,560
 Were they really missing?

249
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,840
 Was this guy actually on this revenge quest?

250
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,080
 Was he like a self-trained ninja or an American ninja?

251
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
 Maybe?

252
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
 Who knows?

253
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,560
 They're not telling us anything and they weren't telling us this story at all until it leaked

254
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,560
 onto Facebook from people who knew about it and then Stars and Stripes covered it.

255
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,760
 And then it was in the mainstream news very, very briefly.

256
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,040
 US base infiltrated by a ninja who attacked servicemen and then they ran and hid and he

257
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,440
 continued to attack him until he got tased.

258
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
 That's a story.

259
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,640
 That's a national news story.

260
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,960
 What in the world is going on?

261
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
 George Clooney?

262
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,600
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

263
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,440
 We're leaving behind in Yoki Airport or whatever the pronunciation was.

264
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,000
 I moved past that page.

265
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
 We're leaving behind that.

266
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,480
 The troops are like, "Thanks for the tips on self-defense."

267
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,320
 I'm like, "You got it, guys."

268
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
 I'm wild.

269
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,640
 I hope you never try that.

270
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,280
 You can't get your sword before it hits your skull.

271
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,800
 We're giving you the keys to Jason's Lappy.

272
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,600
 We're headed all the way out to Oregon.

273
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,360
 George Clooney is driving us all the way up there.

274
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,200
 We're watching Batman and Robin for the 15th time.

275
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,520
 And finally, we get to a little pub in Oregon.

276
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,640
 Now, I got this story from a friend of mine.

277
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,760
 It actually happened to her not too long ago.

278
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,040
 It's a very, very interesting story.

279
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,200
 But for the sake of privacy, I'm going to be changing some of the names and things like

280
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 that.

281
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,680
 Because it's a weird one.

282
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
 It's a weird one.

283
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,880
 Talking to my friend Molly, she listens to the show.

284
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,640
 She shared this story with me.

285
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,600
 Her son works at a bar, not in town.

286
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,080
 He works at a bar in another town.

287
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,600
 And he thought it was weird when he went to get the job.

288
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,560
 The interviewer, the boss, asked him, "Do you believe in ghosts?"

289
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,640
 Because this bar the business owner explained is haunted.

290
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,440
 It's a haunted bar.

291
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,800
 There's three ghosts who regularly hang out here.

292
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,560
 Now, even people who believe in ghosts, I believe in ghosts.

293
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,440
 But if somebody told me this is a haunted bar, I would be like, "Oh, that's really cool.

294
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,040
 I no longer want a job here.

295
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
 Thank you.

296
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
 Thank you for your time.

297
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
 That's super spooky.

298
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,880
 I'm a little stressed to work in a haunted place, but you would think, oh, you know,

299
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,880
 is it like, and then at midnight, sometimes you hear a clock chime 12 times.

300
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,600
 Like, there's different levels of ghostly activity.

301
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,920
 Sometimes when a train goes by, a glass mysteriously falls off the bar.

302
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,800
 We don't know what causes it.

303
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:39,600
 Molly's son is working the bar one night and he sees a full body apparition of a ghost

304
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:47,480
 walk by, which despite what the movies would have you believe is the rarest type of ghost

305
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,120
 encounter.

306
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,440
 Most paranormal encounters, ghost encounters are fragrances, really in this order, fragrances,

307
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,120
 noise, hearing something that you shouldn't hear creaks.

308
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,000
 That actually in yesterday's episode, I'll put that in here.

309
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,360
 Yesterday's episode when I was talking about Baby X, or that was Wednesday's episode, I

310
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,640
 was talking about Baby X.

311
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,840
 I'm going to play this clip for you here in this haunted closet.

312
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:16,560
 It sounds like a footstep every time I mention the age of the victim.

313
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,760
 It was a three week old infant.

314
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:27,960
 It was the body of a three week old infant.

315
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
 That's not me.

316
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,760
 I was making sure I was perfectly...

317
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,720
 When the first time I heard it, I go, "Is that me?"

318
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,040
 And the second time, I did it again.

319
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
 So just weird.

320
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,800
 Again, I have ghosts at home.

321
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,200
 I don't need ghosts at work, but most ghost encounters go like this.

322
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:54,320
 Fragrances, smells, perfumes, cigar smells, noises, voices, and then seeing something.

323
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,600
 And even then there's that degree of seeing the mist fly by versus seeing a discernible

324
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 figure.

325
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,720
 And that's the most common in movies because it's very visual.

326
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,560
 That's the least common you'll see in real life.

327
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,440
 So her son sees a full body apparition.

328
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,560
 The family goes out to visit their son who's away.

329
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,040
 He's working at this bar.

330
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,240
 And they go to the bar.

331
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,240
 They're visiting him right now.

332
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,560
 They're not like, "Hey son, we're in town, but we're going to Applebee's."

333
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
 They go to the bar.

334
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
 They're hanging out.

335
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
 They see him.

336
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,800
 And they have a good time.

337
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,400
 Molly has a good time.

338
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,080
 They tip their son very poorly.

339
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,600
 They're like, "Oh, it's a horrible service son."

340
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,160
 That night, Molly has a dream.

341
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,520
 Molly is in a house and she's taking care of a little girl.

342
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,720
 Little girl in a white dress.

343
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,600
 She doesn't recognize her.

344
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,680
 Cute little girl.

345
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,680
 She's just there to take care of her.

346
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,800
 And she gets the girl settled in this room.

347
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,280
 And there's a baby monitor in the room so she knows that she can move about the house

348
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,320
 and do other things while this girl is safe.

349
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,760
 And she goes upstairs and she hears on the baby monitor what could only be described

350
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,080
 as demonic voices.

351
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,120
 So Molly runs back downstairs to check on this little girl.

352
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,040
 And when she goes to open the door, it's locked.

353
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
 She fights with the knob.

354
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,880
 She's trying to get this door open.

355
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
 She's banging on it.

356
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,680
 She's screaming.

357
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,360
 She's panicked.

358
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,840
 She knows something evil is on the other side of this door with this girl who she's supposed

359
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
 to protect.

360
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,120
 And when she finally gets the door open, the little girl was no longer in the room.

361
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,920
 Instead the room was full of dogs.

362
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,720
 She doesn't say how many of them.

363
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,240
 I don't think it looked like Oliver and Company.

364
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,600
 I just imagine three really vicious type pit bulls whatever.

365
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,680
 They're barking at her.

366
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,520
 She goes right when she opens the door and she sees these three dogs or however many dogs

367
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
 barking at her.

368
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
 Get ready for their big musical number.

369
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,680
 She sees another door in the hallway open up out of the corner of her eye and she turns

370
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:25,360
 and she looks and she sees the little girl run out of that door and run down into the

371
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,560
 basement of the house.

372
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,800
 Now she immediately thinks this little girl's panicked.

373
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,680
 She's freaking out because of the demon voice because of the dog and she somehow got away.

374
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,320
 This little girl is now running down to the basement.

375
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,720
 I have to go get the little girl.

376
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,880
 We got to get out of this house.

377
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,240
 I have to save the little girl.

378
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:50,080
 And as Molly begins to run down the basement herself, she notices something.

379
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,960
 The little girl is running too fast.

380
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,000
 She's moving way quicker than any human should.

381
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,360
 Molly is now halfway down the stairs and she stops.

382
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,360
 She's looking into the blackness of the basement.

383
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,760
 The darkness has swallowed the little girl in the white dress up completely.

384
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:23,440
 Molly is standing on those stairs and she comes to a very, very powerful conclusion.

385
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,960
 I cannot go down these stairs anymore.

386
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,400
 I cannot enter the darkness of the basement.

387
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,960
 And then she woke up terrified, terrified of that dream.

388
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,520
 Later on, Molly told her son about the dream.

389
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,400
 I had this dream when there was this little girl and then as she's talking about her dream,

390
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,600
 her son stops her and goes, "Was the little girl wearing a white dress?"

391
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,960
 She goes, "Yeah."

392
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:07,480
 Her son goes, "That's one of the three ghosts that are trapped in this bar."

393
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,360
 The night she went to the bar is the night she had that nightmare with the little girl

394
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,920
 leading her through the house, trying to get her to go into the darkness.

395
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,400
 And Molly's a legit person.

396
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,320
 She's not someone who would try to pull a prank.

397
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,600
 She's a fan of the show.

398
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,720
 She listens to the show.

399
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,000
 She's a friend of mine.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,480
 She wouldn't be telling me a tall tale.

401
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
 Could have just been a dream, right?

402
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,920
 Could have just been a dream.

403
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,080
 Could have just been a coincidence as girls in creepy white dresses, this kind of thing.

404
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,240
 Could just be the dream.

405
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:47,800
 Imagine if you visit this place and the ghost girl attaches itself to you.

406
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,640
 Could it attach itself to Molly?

407
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,080
 Because she's a mother.

408
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,080
 And attached itself to Molly because she's a mother and sensed the mother's love and

409
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,880
 knew that it would be a weakness.

410
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
 I wouldn't follow no one down to the basement.

411
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 Are you kidding me?

412
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,880
 But Molly did.

413
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,160
 And at the very last moment she caught herself from going down into the darkness.

414
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
 What was waiting in that darkness?

415
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,760
 What was that little girl's plan?

416
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,640
 And you see Molly was able to tell this story to her son who works there and he goes, "Oh,

417
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,280
 you know, that's one of the ghosts that's at this place."

418
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,720
 And it leaves Molly with this kind of idea that was, is, how would this be classified?

419
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,880
 Did this ghost follow me home?

420
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,120
 Was it somehow able to attach itself to me?

421
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,720
 Was it just, I was in a spooky place and something, I just had a weird nightmare.

422
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,120
 It's just not even connected.

423
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,440
 But think about all the people who go to that bar who don't have a son working there.

424
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,520
 Who go home and have a weird nightmare and would never ever put two and two together.

425
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,680
 They don't know that the bar's haunted.

426
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,680
 They go there for some fish and chips.

427
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,560
 Later that night, woman's laying in bed.

428
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,360
 She has a nightmare.

429
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,560
 But a young girl she can't rescue from demonic forces.

430
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:11,760
 Only to find out that the young girl herself may be a demonic force.

431
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,320
 But then think about the people who do continue into the basement.

432
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,080
 The dreamers who don't have that logic kick in at the last moment.

433
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,680
 Who aren't quick enough to realize, wait, no human can move that fast.

434
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:36,400
 If Molly had not realized that detail, she would have continued down into the basement.

435
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,160
 Are there people out there who have visited this bar?

436
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,560
 How did that dream and walked into the basement?

437
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,920
 And when they woke up, who were they?

438
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,120
 Were they the same person who wakes them and goes, well that was a weird dream.

439
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,400
 Or is this bar and this little girl a demonic infestation?

440
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,120
 Ghosts tend to stay in a very localized environment.

441
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,520
 The place that they died, the place that they loved the most, the place where they have unfinished

442
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,480
 business, demons roam.

443
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,000
 Demons leave.

444
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 They have a base of operations, but have soul will travel type of thing.

445
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,640
 What is the little girl at this bar in Oregon?

446
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,040
 Or was it all just a dream?

447
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,040
 We will see.

448
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,440
 That'd be cool to do an investigation there.

449
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,840
 Now you guys see why I left the business name out and they don't want to give this

450
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,800
 city because they basically blasted that business.

451
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,360
 I'm sure they serve lovely food.

452
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,960
 I'm sure the staff is great.

453
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,760
 But if you go there, you may be possessed by the demon of a little girl.

454
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,760
 You may have a dream and you may wake up and your soul is gone and a little girl is piloting

455
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,120
 your body.

456
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,160
 And nobody wants that except for the demons who work at this bar.

457
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,120
 George Clooney, I'm going to go and attach the keys to the carboner copter.

458
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,440
 We got enough time because this last story is pretty short, but it's pretty brilliant

459
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
 in the literal term.

460
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,920
 I'm going to attach the keys to the carboner copter.

461
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,880
 We are headed all the way out to the middle of nowhere.

462
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,160
 And when I say the middle of nowhere, I'm talking like we're on a mountain top.

463
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:20,160
 There's not a city or a town or anything to be seen for miles and miles and miles and

464
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,240
 miles.

465
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,840
 We're just enjoying each other's company.

466
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,080
 Molly's taking a nap.

467
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,880
 She's like, "Don't let her get possessed.

468
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
 Don't let her get possessed."

469
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,320
 We're hanging out there.

470
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,680
 We look up at the night sky.

471
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,120
 The other day I was walking through town here, I was hanging out with my friends Sabine.

472
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,680
 And I said, "When's the last time you've seen the galaxy?"

473
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,640
 Now she's a real rural girl.

474
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,720
 And rural, I can't really say that word, but you know, country girl.

475
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,160
 She grew up more country than I did.

476
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,760
 She's gone camping and stuff like that, stuff that I just don't like to do.

477
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,800
 She doesn't have stuff.

478
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,840
 So I expected it to be a fairly high number.

479
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
 She said five or six.

480
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
 And I was kind of shocked.

481
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
 Like five or six, really.

482
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,960
 She's like, "Yeah.

483
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,000
 I've seen the galaxy one time.

484
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,560
 45 years old, I've seen the galaxy one time."

485
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,680
 I didn't even, I mean, I guess I'd seen pictures of it.

486
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
 I'd seen it in movies.

487
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,560
 I'm not talking about, I'm not talking about like the galaglactic map of Star Trek or something

488
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
 like that.

489
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:27,360
 But when you're in a place with zero light pollution, you look up and you see the galaxy.

490
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,360
 It was truly awe-inspiring.

491
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,920
 I remember we were on the way back.

492
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,960
 We had just seen the Sacramento Kings play against the Phoenix Suns in the playoffs.

493
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,480
 We were driving back and we had to pull over to go pee.

494
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,800
 It was me, Justin, and Hal.

495
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,440
 We got out of the car, drained in the main vein, leaking the lizard.

496
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
 And I looked up.

497
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,960
 It's sort of like two or three in the morning.

498
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,640
 I looked up and that was the first time I had to be like in my late twenties.

499
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,200
 And I'm still using terms like drained in the main vein.

500
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:08,000
 I looked up and for the very, very first time in my life, I saw the galaxy.

501
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,760
 I thought all of that stuff was like camera tricks, like exposures held for the long.

502
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,040
 I didn't know you could look up and see the galaxy.

503
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,240
 It's beautiful.

504
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,760
 And I haven't seen it since.

505
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,200
 It's been around 20 years since the last time I saw the galaxy.

506
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,800
 The other day when I was walking down the street, I asked Sabine how many times have

507
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,200
 you seen the galaxy?

508
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,720
 She said five or six times.

509
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,760
 I just kind of thought it would be more.

510
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,400
 But I said I have a conspiracy theory and it really had just popped in my head when I

511
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
 was looking up at the sky.

512
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,320
 And you see like a couple of stars, right?

513
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,840
 Maybe if you're farther away from town, you see a couple more stars.

514
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,880
 But when you're in the middle of nowhere, you see the Milky Way.

515
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,640
 And it's totally, if you guys don't, some of you probably have no idea what I'm talking

516
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,720
 about because you've never seen the galaxy.

517
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,160
 You have to go into the middle of nowhere.

518
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,160
 We're walking down the street and I said I have a conspiracy theory.

519
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,680
 Just all kind of popped in my head.

520
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,240
 We talk a lot about Hans on this show.

521
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,400
 He's back by the way.

522
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,080
 He announced his retirement, but he's back.

523
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,840
 He's doing stuff again.

524
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
 Nothing super hilarious.

525
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
 Right?

526
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
 Just the same old, same old.

527
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,680
 But his big thing is that NASA is trying to convince us that God isn't real.

528
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,400
 NASA is behind everything.

529
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,760
 NASA has orange chairs because orange is satanic color.

530
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,440
 And NASA is behind faking monkeys because monkeys make us think evolution's true.

531
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,160
 And if we think evolution's true, don't believe in God.

532
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
 It's hilarious.

533
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,240
 And he's not the only person who thinks that.

534
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,040
 A lot of people think NASA is the super satanic group.

535
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,560
 It was started by Nazis, to be fair.

536
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,800
 It was started by Nazis.

537
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,160
 But the idea, I've always said, what would be NASA's stake in trying to keep us from

538
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
 believing in God?

539
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,680
 Or what would be really any, how could you do that?

540
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,760
 How could a group actually erase existence of God?

541
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,000
 A couple of days ago I was looking up in the night sky and I said, I have a conspiracy

542
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,500
 theory.

543
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:10,320
 Sake pollution is being done on purpose because if every night every person on the planet

544
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:21,180
 looked up and saw the glory and majesty of the galaxy we live in, you could not deny

545
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,460
 there was something greater than us.

546
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,060
 We look up at stars under these twinkling little lights.

547
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:39,520
 But when you see the galaxy, you see the galaxy, you see just splendor.

548
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,860
 I wanted to do a bunch of research on this.

549
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:52,740
 I wanted to try to match up places with low light and places with high levels of religion.

550
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,460
 I wanted to take a look at how light pollution is growing over the years and how belief in

551
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,180
 a deity has fallen.

552
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,740
 That research I spent maybe like an hour trying to pull up some numbers and I couldn't because

553
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,700
 it was one, a bunch of other stuff to do.

554
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:17,220
 I had to read about a ninja fighting US troops and two, it's a lot of work.

555
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,940
 So I decided to be like every other conspiracy theorist out there and just make this claim.

556
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,460
 But here's my claim.

557
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,420
 The world would be far more religious and I would say, I'm going to take a guess here,

558
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,300
 this is anecdotal and this is just.

559
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,060
 If you look at parts of the United States that don't have a lot of light pollution,

560
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,660
 I'm going to gamble that they're more religious than the coastal cities that have tons of light

561
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,860
 pollution.

562
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,900
 I think that's a fair, but is that, and that was the other thing I was thinking about doing

563
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,060
 all this research, but at the end of the day, is it causation?

564
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,660
 Could you actually show something or could you show the rise of technology just merit

565
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,380
 a decline in religion and the rise of technology creates more light pollution?

566
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,380
 So there was all that.

567
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,140
 Brad, I could have done a ton of research and it would have been inconclusive anyways,

568
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,660
 but the conspiracy theory is what if putting our conspiracy caps on, what if there is a

569
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,180
 conspiracy theory to make people not believe in a God when you look up and you see the

570
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,980
 majesty of the universe, bright and for every single night, how can you deny a creator?

571
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,660
 But if you look up and you just see five twinkly lights and 10 of them are man made, you're

572
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,540
 seeing planes fly by, you might see a couple of satellites.

573
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,540
 It's far easier to go.

574
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,660
 We're just on a big old mud ball, floating through the darkness, but we're not.

575
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,300
 We're in the Milky Way.

576
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,220
 We're in this beautiful gem.

577
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,380
 We live right in the middle of it and we used to be able to see it from the time that humans

578
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:48,820
 developed the capacity to identify what was in front of them, to comprehend something beyond

579
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,180
 their physical body.

580
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,500
 In that moment, until what?

581
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,940
 The 1880s?

582
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,340
 When those first lights started going up, you saw a little less of the night sky.

583
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:10,300
 But by the time we're talking about the 1960s and 1970s, light pollution is out of control.

584
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:16,980
 So from the beginning of mankind to the 1950s, what is that?

585
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:25,260
 Until 70 years ago, when you watched that sunset, you saw the galaxy.

586
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,700
 You saw what we were a part of.

587
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,260
 And again, there are two people listening to this show.

588
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,620
 One person who knows exactly what I'm talking about, who has seen the galaxy and goes, "It

589
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,580
 is awe-inspiring."

590
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,460
 And then a lot of you are just like, "But it's just the night sky."

591
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,220
 It's not.

592
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,340
 Those photos that, again, I thought were total time-lapse photos of the night sky, those

593
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,820
 cannot even capture the beauty of it.

594
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,220
 And so the question is, obviously the obvious answer is just the acceleration of humans.

595
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,460
 We build bigger cities, more lights are going up, we have high rises and all that stuff.

596
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,940
 It's just a normal thing.

597
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:10,780
 But what if there is a group that wants to deny that God exists?

598
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,700
 And this has been a strategy that they've been laying out for decades.

599
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,180
 Fill the world with lights.

600
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,860
 Cut them off from the universe.

601
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,340
 Make them think we're just on a ball of mud in a darkness.

602
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,780
 And when you look up, you see a couple satellites, you see a couple airplanes, and oh, look,

603
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,780
 there's the North Star.

604
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,100
 Look at that little bright light out there.

605
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
 There's the Big Dipper.

606
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,940
 And it makes you think it's people like Hans Wright.

607
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,300
 Now, I don't believe that monkeys don't exist thing.

608
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:46,060
 But are there groups that are actively trying to erase something that would, when you see

609
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:51,140
 it day after day or night after night after night after night, makes you realize that

610
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:58,620
 you exist as something smaller of a glorious creation?

611
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:05,220
 And whether or not it's an organization on earth of men and women who are actively doing

612
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,340
 this, or it is some, I mean, who's the person who mostly doesn't want to disbelieve in

613
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
 deity, right?

614
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,340
 A Satan, a Lucifer, a demonic presence.

615
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,300
 That this is his plan.

616
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,020
 Cut us off from the most beautiful view in creation.

617
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,520
 It's easier to tell us that it doesn't matter when we die, we just disappear into the darkness

618
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,460
 that surrounds the planet.

619
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:36,860
 It sounds so demonic to want to cut a people off from God.

620
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,420
 That's kind of the definition of demonic.

621
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,660
 That's the definition of a satanic plan.

622
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,540
 You know what the name Lucifer means?

623
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:51,300
 It literally means a light bringer.

624
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,060
 The story of Prometheus who stills to fire from Mount Olympus and gives it to the humans.

625
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,860
 Gods were angry.

626
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,860
 That fire was a tool of the gods.

627
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,380
 He'd given it to these commoners.

628
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:12,240
 But what if that fire was the first time that the night was no longer magnificent?

629
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:22,940
 Even by the roaring fire, the galaxy looked a little less holy.

630
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,540
 Is there a conspiracy theory to hide the wonders of the universe from us?

631
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,220
 And is that conspiracy theory man-made?

632
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,460
 Demonic?

633
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
 Or both?

634
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,460
 Who knows?

635
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,220
 It's just the thought I had the other day.

636
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:44,940
 But I'm a 45 year old man who's only seen the galaxy once.

637
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:53,300
 Before a thousand generations before me, my ancestors saw the galaxy every single night.

638
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:08,180
 Doesn't really seem fair to be robbed of such a beautiful view.

639
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,820
