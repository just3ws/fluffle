1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Is deep fake technology a threat to our democracy?

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:10,400
 And then we look at the wild conspiracy theories about why YouTube was shut down for one hour on Tuesday night.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,220
 Yes, there are already conspiracy theories about that. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:24,220
 [Music]

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,980
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,280
 I'm having a great day generally. I hope you're having a great day too. My sinus infection is getting a little bad.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,280
 It actually hurts to talk.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,480
 So I don't know how long this episode is going to be. Usually I say they're going to be short and they still end up being a little bit longer.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,880
 But we're only gonna do two stories.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,080
 And I really, I just kind of wanted to, the stories kind of flow together and keep things simple and then I'm gonna take a nap.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,760
 First off, after I had done

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,220
 World War II was faked and then

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,600
 Nuclear bombs don't exist. I was like, okay, though I can't do those type of subjects anymore.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,360
 I can't talk about people who don't believe something

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,600
 happened. You can vary and say, well, I have a different interpretation of that event.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,000
 But to say no, those don't exist is very hard to do those episodes.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,560
 After I got done doing those two episodes, Mitcham sends me, I'm sitting there and I get a Facebook message from my friend Mitcham.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,160
 And it's just a photo of a power line with a flyer attached to it.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,160
 It says "Birds aren't real."

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,680
 "Birds aren't real.com." And my soul died a little bit and I was like, are you...

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,040
 And of course, I'm thinking this is most likely real.

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,240
 Like it sounds like a joke, but it's most likely real. I went to their website.

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,960
 Thankfully it is a joke.

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,960
 It is a joke. They have a website where you can buy merch, "Birds aren't real" shirts.

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,200
 They have quotes from famous politicians and world leaders exposing the bird plot.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,360
 Thankfully, you know, it's funny though, we've reached a point in conspiracy theory that you just don't know sometime.

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,040
 If you saw a guy walking around the shirt that said, "World War II never happened."

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,760
 You would probably think, oh yeah, there's no- nobody on earth would believe that World War II was a ten-

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,120
 Wait, I bet you had about a ten-year act from the rise of

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,400
 fascism and Nazi Germany to

31
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:29,440
 drop into the bombs. It was all fake. I now know that anyone can believe anything at any given time

32
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
 from doing those episodes. But thanks, Mitch, for the laugh.

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,440
 And I'll have the show notes if you want to buy a shirt. Birds aren't real.

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,520
 Okay, so let's go ahead and jump into our first story here. Let's talk about Deepfakes.

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,280
 So Deepfakes is a slang term for technology. It's an AI-assisted technology that can

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,120
 take- you have two sources of video. You have a source video and a target video.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,280
 The source video will make a facial expression or turn its head.

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,360
 And then the target- it's really weird looking. And then the target video will make the same

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,760
 expression and turn their head at the same time. Is it perfect? No. Will it be perfect?

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,760
 Eventually. It will be imperceptible to tell the difference between the two.

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,440
 This came out publicly in 2016. They said, this is technology we had. They used some footage

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,640
 where they made George Bush and Obama do different things with their head. And you- we saw what

43
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,400
 though the source guy was doing. He was like yawning or just kind of moving his head. And then

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,280
 you'd see George Bush yawning and moving his head. And you can obviously- obviously it's not 100%.

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,920
 But any imperfections right now that you see in it, you could attribute to film quality issues.

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,520
 In 2017, and this is where the name Deepfake- or Deepfakes comes from, there was a Reddit user

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,520
 named Deepfake. This technology is now consumer level. If you have a good enough computer,

48
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,320
 you can actually do this yourself. Deepfake began to take high quality pornography videos and then

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:02,160
 took images of famous actresses like Gal Gadot and Emma Watson and Taylor Swift, Katy Perry,

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,120
 stuff like that. And it takes thousands and thousands and thousands of frames of your source

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,960
 and thousands and thousands and thousands of frames of your target because you have to match it up.

52
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,800
 You have to get all angles- you'd have to get like all angles of Taylor Swift's head. And then you

53
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,600
 have all the angles of the porn actress moving her head. And where you start to see the imperfections

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,880
 a lot of time is in the hair. Because- and I did watch this because it is quite odd to watch.

55
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,960
 You see imperfections in the hair. If the porn actress moves her face in a way that the

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,200
 source actress didn't, you'll see a glitch because it's trying to fill in that information. The

57
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,000
 computer is trying to fill in information it doesn't have. And again, pornography is very,

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,080
 very high quality. Generally, it's shot very high quality. So the imperfections stood out a little

59
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,480
 more. But if they went with grainier stuff, like amateur stuff, it'd be very hard to tell. Not impossible,

60
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,280
 but hard to tell. You know, you're basically putting people in pornography without their permission.

61
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,640
 And that's true. So Deepfake was banned from Reddit. You can still- you can get this software online.

62
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,720
 I think there's a- there's a couple of them out there. I have one linked in the show notes. But

63
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,160
 again, you- you need a fairly beefy computer to do it, but not like top the line. And a lot of time,

64
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,520
 because it has to take thou- it says one example was you had to have 20 minutes of footage for both,

65
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,400
 and the footage had to be at 120 frames per second. That's how many frames you needed. Some people were

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,200
 just taking still photographs and putting them in pornos, and it looked horrifying. You need to have

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,160
 these things so when they turn their head, everything turns with them. There was a video that I saw

68
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,320
 today, which was the same thing, but the technology's advanced to the point where it's not facial. It is-

69
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,120
 you can do your whole body. So you had- what- you had two people and they were getting all the frames

70
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,080
 they needed. Like, the source guy would be like, kind of moving around, turning around, and then

71
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,200
 the target guy would be doing the same thing, moving around, turning around. And then the source guy

72
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,920
 would begin to dance, and then the- you'd see a person who had never performed those dance moves

73
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,080
 ever in their life begin to copy that same dance. It was weird. It was very- I had very uncanny

74
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,360
 valley feeling, because I'm watching it, and you know this person has never done this dance, ever.

75
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,800
 What you are seeing is 100% artificial, and you're like, Jason, yeah, but so is the ghost from House

76
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,440
 on Haunted Hill. That's artificial, but it's different because this has a like a human head,

77
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,000
 and it's a human, but it's doing these moves, it's doing something completely unnatural,

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,280
 and because the technology isn't 100%, let's say that they had all the footage of the person

79
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,600
 dancing, but the computer never had an image of him with his hand held out making a fist. He had-

80
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,600
 when he held his hand out, his fingers around. It will actually digitally bend the fingers into a

81
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,360
 fist, and it's just this weird blur. The computer's doing its best to create a copy of its source

82
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,360
 with the information it has. It's very, very unsettling. All those videos are down below.

83
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,880
 I- even though I said they're unsettling, they're really cool to watch. It's a really cool thing

84
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,920
 of technology. Now, there's been two groups that have been very, very concerned about this.

85
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:12,000
 One group is the Pearl Kletchine Media, who has announced, pretty much since this- actually,

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,600
 pretty much since last summer, when the Deep Fakes thing came out. This is a threat to democracy.

87
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,960
 No one will ever believe anything that is video again. Deep Fakes are a threat to democracy. That

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,960
 phrase is used in so many headlines. It's a threat to democracy. And then in the conspiracy

89
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,040
 theory circles, they're like, "Damn it! Now, when that Pizza Gate video gets uploaded,

90
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,240
 of Hillary Clinton eating that baby, no one will believe them." It's because Deep Fake

91
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,600
 technology- actually, Deep Fake technology may be fake itself. It may be a CIA cover-up. So,

92
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,200
 when the footage finally gets released of Hillary Clinton eating that baby, no one will believe

93
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,640
 it. The excuse will be like, "Guys, it's just Deep Fakes. That was someone else eating that baby."

94
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,760
 Here's the problem with both of those things. This idea that video evidence is the end-all be-all

95
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,320
 of evidence. And it is regarded quite highly. It is. But the idea that it is a threat to democracy-

96
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,440
 let's tackle that one first. The idea that Deep Fake- Fake Videos is a threat to democracy,

97
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,120
 that I can produce a video that is so realistic, you can't tell whether or not it's true.

98
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:29,760
 Video evidence has been around for what? 67 years? Humanity has been around for

99
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:37,840
 100,000? 50,000 years? Somewhere around there? Civilization has been growing. They were able to

100
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:49,360
 try people and end corruption and expose terrible things for millennias before video cameras came out.

101
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,520
 This- I get it. New technology is very scary. And there will be an adjustment phase. But the

102
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,920
 idea that someone can show if someone put up a fake video of Donald Trump kicking a baby down the

103
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,080
 stairs, down the stairs of the Capitol Building, this is exactly what would happen. Half the people

104
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,840
 wouldn't even watch the video. They would see the title of it and write in the comments, "I knew

105
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,040
 it. I knew it." Donald Trump is an asshole. The other half of the people would watch that video

106
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,240
 would say, "What was the context of the baby getting kicked down the stairs?" Or, "I think it's

107
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,680
 fake." Video evidence can persuade some people, but to think that it is a threat to democracy,

108
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,680
 that somehow one fake video can bring down a world leader, I don't buy it. The only way that can

109
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,800
 happen is if a video was released and nobody disputed it in the media, and I'm not talking about

110
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,400
 like the mainstream media, I'm talking from the daily wire to HuffPo, nobody disputed it. Everyone

111
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,080
 was like, "There was multiple witnesses there." And actually, it might be a good thing because I

112
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,560
 think video evidence can be used, but we'll also come down to where there are other people there.

113
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,280
 So if they show Donald Trump kicking a baby down the stairs, of course, Mitch McConnell

114
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,240
 standing in the background and they're going to be like, "Hey, Mitch, do you remember that?" And he's

115
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,000
 like, "No, that never happened." Generally, evidence is good if it's compounded with other evidence.

116
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,120
 But the idea that just this technology alone that you can get on your home computer will

117
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,040
 destroy democracy is ridiculous because most people have their minds made up about issues

118
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,520
 before they go in, and video evidence only reinforces the conclusions they already have.

119
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,800
 Now, as far as the conspiracy theory stuff goes, first off, the idea that there's a video out

120
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,200
 there with Hillary Clinton eating a baby and trust me, that's just not something I'm making up.

121
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,840
 That's just not an example. I'm like, "Look how wacky they are. I hear that example quite often."

122
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,160
 That doesn't exist. That video does not exist. And I'll tell you why it doesn't exist,

123
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,360
 because if you ate babies, why would you record it? Well, it's because of the

124
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
 ceremony. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why would you record it? No, no, no, because the

125
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,800
 Illuminati... No, no, no. Why would you record it? With the information that you know about human

126
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,640
 beings, why would you personally record that thing? I don't want to hear about anything about

127
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,040
 secret rituals that you don't know about. I don't want to hear anything about secret cults that you

128
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,680
 don't know about other than stuff you heard off the internet. Why would you videotape that yourself?

129
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,000
 Well, I wouldn't. Yeah, exactly. That's the thing. A lot of times with these conspiracy theories,

130
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,520
 they'll make some outrageous claim and then they'll go, "You know, Simpsons predicted 9/11. Why?

131
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,400
 Well, because the Illuminati says they have to predict all of their disasters." According to

132
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:46,080
 who? According to who? Well, I've read it on Henry Macau's website, Henry Macau's a lunatic for one.

133
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,000
 And two, it's made up. I'm not saying the people trying to run the world is made up,

134
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,600
 and I'm not saying there aren't people that eat babies. But when you make an outrageous claim,

135
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,520
 you have to back it up other than someone said on the internet. Or an Illuminati defector said

136
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,680
 this, "What's their name?" Well, they're going, they have an anonymous name. Then it's made up.

137
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,560
 It's made up. There is no video of Hillary Clinton eating a baby. So when that video does get released,

138
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:23,360
 it is fake. It was a deep fake. There's a photo going around right now of Obama in full costume

139
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,600
 at some sort of satanic ceremony. And it's being used as proof that Obama is a Satan worshiper.

140
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:37,840
 However, conveniently enough, the costume covers his face. What? But it's Obama, apparently. And

141
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,520
 there's a guy, there's an overweight black dude in the background, and they're like,

142
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,760
 "That's Eric Holder. What?" But it's so...

143
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:54,960
 Guys, I don't deny that there are powerful people out there who do horrible, horrible things. But

144
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,640
 you have to rein it in a bit. You have to rein it in a bit. If your goal is to expose Hillary

145
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,320
 Clinton as a baby eating psychopath, that's not a good goal. Because there is no proof of that.

146
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:16,160
 Now, listen, I'll admit it. I could be wrong on this, but I highly, highly doubt it. And if she is,

147
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,080
 there's not a video of it. There's not a video of it. And again, I'm going to go back to my original

148
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,320
 point. If a video does come out and the media is like, "That's a fake video that actually didn't

149
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,880
 happen. That's deep fake technology," then you will have to make the determination whether or not you

150
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,680
 think it's deep fake, whether or not when you see those blurs and those artifacts, you go, "Those

151
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,200
 are blurs and artifacts that are part of the deep fake technology." Or you say, "Well, that's just

152
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,960
 the problem with the film quality, or that's because of this, or that, or the other thing." But

153
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,640
 again, generally, I mean, there are people on the internet who believe there's YouTube videos of

154
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,520
 people moving their head and because of digital distortion, they shapeshift, their eyes turn

155
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:05,840
 into reptiles. So, I mean, they already believe that any sort of digital problem in a video footage

156
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,680
 is proof of reptilian blood. I want to say this too. The deep fakes thing is obviously up for

157
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,640
 debate. If you're like, "No, we need to make sure that evidence is always 100%, feel free to leave

158
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:22,400
 a comment, drop me an email, deadrabbitradio@gmail.com," we can discuss this. This is my personal view on

159
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,960
 this. I just think that we've gone long enough without having video evidence being the most

160
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,440
 important thing. I think we can do it for another 10,000, 100,000 years until they started doing

161
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,600
 deep fake holograms and then we're in real deep, deep trouble. I wanted to add this in real quick

162
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,200
 here. This is after I did the episode, so the audio quality might sound different. Sorry to

163
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,600
 break the immersion, but I wanted to thank YouTube user Euphoria. I didn't know if I was really going

164
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,040
 to do this story, but this user was interested in doing it and I want to make sure I take the time

165
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,960
 out to thank the listeners who recommend stories to me. So, thanks, Euphoria. We're going to go

166
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,920
 ahead and continue on with the story here. So, the next story we're going to cover is YouTube was

167
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:12,080
 down for one hour on October 16th, 2018, and there are already three or four conspiracy theories

168
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,360
 involving it. I think it's interesting because it shows what a social, social like landmark,

169
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,040
 social joining place for society has become that YouTube goes down for an hour and people

170
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,680
 within days are like, "What's going on? What's going on? This must have been this big thing."

171
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,880
 So, I mean, it just shows like people like this is such a part of their lives that if it goes down

172
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,840
 for an hour, conspiracy theories pop up. Now, if Netflix went down for an hour, people would go. It's

173
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,400
 probably just some technical issue. The reason why it became more of a conspiracy when YouTube

174
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,560
 shut down because all of the user uploaded content. So, people thought, "Oh my God, somebody

175
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,120
 uploaded something to YouTube and the powers that be had to shut it down. They had to take it out."

176
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,800
 Now, of course, people were talking about Deepfakes and stuff like that, but these were the three

177
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,960
 big... There's quite a few actually. So, one of them was that there was a video of a man in

178
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,680
 a military uniform saying an object is about to hit the moon and YouTube shuts down. And then

179
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,800
 someone found a video of something hitting the moon and they're like, "Oh my God, look at this is a

180
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,800
 reason why YouTube went down. Here's a footage of something hitting the moon and there's like this

181
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,320
 huge dust cloud." I mean, that might work except everyone could have just looked up slightly and

182
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,320
 seen it impact the moon. The video actually was from 2017. It was a special effects test and so

183
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,040
 on and so forth. So, that theory fell to the wayside. The other one is that YouTube now has an AI,

184
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,520
 which that's always the buzzword, AI. YouTube has an AI that now buzzes around YouTube looking for

185
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,360
 live streams. Oh, you know, what's over here? Oh, someone talking about Fortnite. Oh, here's someone

186
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,160
 else talking about Fortnite. What's this guy talking about? Fortnite. This guy's talking about

187
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,160
 Fortnite. Oh, this guy's talking about some conspiracy that no one should know about. Shut the whole

188
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,080
 YouTube down. Really? That seems like to be the most inefficient one. YouTube at the end of the day

189
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:17,120
 is a business and they lost millions of dollars when they were shut down. So, if Andy Worsky is

190
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,320
 saying something on his live stream that the AI doesn't like, the easiest thing to do is to just

191
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,560
 nuke his channel, get him off of the channel. You don't have to shut down all of YouTube because

192
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:35,760
 he's saying, "I hate Anita Sargeesian for the 20th time," and the website goes down. The other theory

193
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,000
 was that there was a video released of a reptilian. Yes, yes, a reptilian. My favorite aliens of all

194
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,080
 time. The seven foot tall reptilian shapeshifters that somehow shapeshift into a human size, but

195
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,280
 the mass doesn't change. But anyways, so there was a video of them uploaded and YouTube's like,

196
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,840
 "Oh my god, the CIA is calling them up. They're like, "Get this video off of here. That is proof

197
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,800
 that a reptilian is on this planet." And they're like, "Yes, sir, yes, sir." You know how many videos

198
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,640
 there are on YouTube of reptilians? I'm pretty sure if I searched for one, it would show up in

199
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,680
 my recommended videos. I'm sure it would show up reptilian videos in my featured channel. There's

200
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,040
 thousands of them. But Jason, though they're fake reptilian videos, then how would you be able to

201
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,160
 tell a real reptilian video from a fake reptilian video? Because if I saw a video of a guy, you

202
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,320
 just go back to the deepfakes thing, if I saw a video of a reptilian guy walking around, I would

203
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,560
 immediately assume that was fake. I'd be like, "That's not real." No matter how good the special

204
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,440
 effects were, I would be like, or if it was real, I'd be like, "That's weird because it looks real.

205
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,240
 That has to be fake." I would almost have to watch it and be convinced that it was real.

206
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,560
 Now, you could go by Jason. They know that, so that's why they shut down YouTube.

207
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,440
 Let me tell you a little trick. If you want to... Okay, let's say you had video footage of alien,

208
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,760
 like provable alien. You meet a real alien. You break into a laboratory, whatever.

209
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,360
 You have video footage of two conformers, a reptilian, and eight grays just kind of like chilling

210
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,840
 out in the lounge. And you're like, "I need to get this footage out there." First off, YouTube is

211
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,680
 not the best place to do it. But YouTube has... You go, "Well, YouTube has the biggest group of

212
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,160
 viewers." All you need to do is to initially get the video online and it will spread itself.

213
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,880
 If you put it on YouTube, you're going to be battling 24/9 videos and like eight videos exposing

214
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,640
 better help. And then you'll be somewhere on there. But anyways, here's what you do. You

215
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,360
 blow the videos up. You set everything to private. You put them on all the websites. You put them

216
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,440
 on LiveLeak. You put it on DailyMotion. You put it on any website where you can upload videos,

217
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,200
 set everything to private. And then when you're ready to release it, you release... You put all

218
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,120
 the videos from private to public. They appear simultaneously all over the place. And then,

219
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,160
 at the same time, upload them to Torrent. Put them on Pirate Bay, if that's the leaving around.

220
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,360
 Send it to WikiLeaks. You'd have to do a mass distribution of the information. Because that

221
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,480
 way, if one of the sites gets shut down, they're not going to be able to shut them down all the

222
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,120
 same time, they would literally have to like crinkle the hose of the internet to really to

223
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:20,160
 get that information out. And I'm an idiot. And I came up with that. If I was a deep state operative,

224
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,160
 if I was a CIA guy on the run or a super soldier or whatever, you could come up with something way

225
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,520
 better than that. I'm an idiot. I came up with that as I was walking home today, prepping this

226
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,960
 episode. I was like, that's... It's so easy to do. That's what I would do. And I'm a dork. And there's

227
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,640
 a ton of people who are into this stuff way smarter than I am, and I'm sure they could figure out

228
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,040
 something better. But anyway, so Reptilean Video got uploaded to YouTube. They shut it down.

229
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,360
 PizzaGate was the other theory. Video got uploaded of politicians murdering a kid,

230
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:02,800
 you know, onto YouTube. That's where if you had that footage of Tony Blair and Nancy Pelosi

231
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,960
 just like straight up just like boxing this eight year old, I mean just like going at it,

232
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,520
 you're going to upload that to YouTube? This is why it went down. This is the most logical

233
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,360
 explanation. And I found this on 4chan and some guy just kind of threw it out there and people

234
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,480
 are like, yeah, that is pretty logical. A couple weeks ago, Google announced that Google+ was a

235
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
 bust. They just wasn't working out for them. It was a money hole. They wanted to remove it.

236
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,720
 And the theory is that when they removed it, basically YouTube went down because Google+

237
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,880
 and YouTube were so interconnected. They're both owned by the same people that to remove the one,

238
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,600
 they had to take YouTube offline. Most likely they thought it was just going to be like a minute

239
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,000
 or two and it lasted longer than they thought it was because computer code can be a little finicky.

240
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,240
 They were getting everything sorted out. Why would they do that on Tuesday at five in the

241
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,160
 afternoon? Well, they didn't because YouTube is a global brand. So for some users, it was the middle

242
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,400
 of the night and they didn't even know it was off. For other users, it was like, oh my god,

243
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,840
 the world's in that I can't get access to YouTube. And they could have also said, statistically,

244
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,400
 this is our lowest viewing point. And I could be wrong on that. Someone could say, no, it's actually

245
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,400
 their highest and fair enough. But they may have said, listen, for five minutes people will have a

246
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,160
 problem. Videos will be running a little slow. But and I think I like because again, they lost

247
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,760
 millions of dollars because of this. That's the most likely explanation. And here's the so this

248
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,280
 is the thing. They announced that the Google+ they wasn't going to work. And then this happens.

249
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:41,360
 So the idea that they had, they go listen, there's a video out there floating around of a politician

250
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,000
 eating a reptilian baby on the moon. But we don't know when it's going to be released. Let's now

251
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,400
 say that we're getting rid of Google+ and we're going to wait an indeterminate amount of time

252
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,200
 until we detect that video getting uploaded. And then we'll shut it down. And then we'll

253
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,560
 use the cover story that it was because Google+ getting shut down. Everyone's like, oh, yeah,

254
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,760
 that's a great idea. That's a great idea. If the Google, I think that if the Google+ announcement

255
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,480
 came out today and they said, this is why it's down Google+ sucks, we're losing a lot of money,

256
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,400
 then the story would make less sense. Then it would sound like a cover story. But because they

257
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,640
 announced it before, it's not like they were just going to wait until this horrible video popped up.

258
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,880
 Also, lots of horrible stuff is on YouTube and it doesn't get taken down. Stuff that could hold

259
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,960
 people criminally liable and it doesn't get taken down. So the idea that someone has this horrible

260
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,680
 video of PizzaGate or aliens or the moon landing and that's why the moon being destroyed or whatever

261
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,720
 it was, it's all nonsense. That was the reason why YouTube went down. It's backwards fairy tale

262
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,480
 making. It's something happening and then people going backwards and trying to figure out why it

263
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,480
 happened. That's all it is. It's a, there's two types of conspiracy theories. There's a conspiracy

264
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,200
 theory that predicts something that is going to happen. There's a conspiracy theory that predicts

265
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,880
 or explains why something happened or is happening. I guess there's three. There's one that explains

266
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,600
 what's going to happen. Like there's a fault, going to be a false flag event during the earthquake

267
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,320
 drills in California in two months. It's a conspiracy theory about what's going on right now.

268
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,720
 And then Katy Perry is a member of the Illuminati and this video is about her worshiping Lucifer.

269
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,400
 And then there's conspiracy theories that explain stuff that previously happened like

270
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,240
 9/11 and like this where they're like, this event happened and this is why. There's a couple

271
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,360
 screenshots of some legs and some dark stains on them and people are like, that's poop, that's poop

272
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,880
 and that's pizza gate proof. People are like, what? No, that's from some art project.

273
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,440
 It's completely ridiculous. There's a video of a, it looks honestly, it looks like a dead body. I

274
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,240
 watched the video but it looks like a dead body on a beach and people are like, look it's a reptilian

275
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,320
 and it looks like she's partially decayed and it could actually be a dummy. I don't know. It's

276
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,440
 on video, it can be hard to tell the difference between a completely intact dummy and a completely

277
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:09,520
 intact corpse. Not in real life though. It's quite easy. And then with the moon things totally been

278
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,040
 debunked. So we have all these videos and these screenshots. This is going to, for the next

279
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,040
 a year from now, people are going to be like, why did YouTube really get brought down?

280
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,840
 A couple years ago, I think, and the internet time moves really quick. So it may have just

281
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:31,200
 been last year but a couple years ago on 4chan, the website went down briefly and the theory was

282
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:40,800
 that somebody posted a photo of an alien walking by a tree in the desert and they took down the

283
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,200
 site or at least they took down the paranormal board. I wasn't there when it happened and actually

284
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,080
 I will say no one was there when it happened because it's all anecdotal. Everyone was like,

285
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,520
 no, I was on that thread and I saw the picture and it was a picture of an alien walking by a tree

286
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,000
 and it was so realistic. To this day, there are people still putting up photoshop of an alien

287
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,800
 walking by a tree and then other people do like thermal resolution. They're like, no, you can tell

288
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,120
 from the way the scales are created. That is actually a model. I saw the real picture of the

289
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:18,160
 alien walking by the tree. I love researching conspiracy theories. I think they're really fun.

290
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,360
 I think that there's a lot of entertainment value in the stories they tell us.

291
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,600
 I love mysteries and that's really what's at the core of these. Why was YouTube shut down?

292
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,280
 But when you're reading a mystery or when you're investigating a mystery yourself

293
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:42,480
 and they'll tell cops this too, you can't jump to conclusions. You have to really get into it

294
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,000
 and try to figure it out and you're not always going to figure it out. But the worst thing we

295
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,320
 can do is something happened and then immediately jump to the idea that it's something fantastical

296
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,360
 and go, "Fordchan must have went down because the alien picture. You too must have went down

297
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,640
 because of the alien video." I think overall that might be exhausting. I think we can run into

298
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,480
 conspiracy theories. Like when I was making fun of the whole Hillary Clinton eating the baby.

299
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,760
 Like to me, if I dwelt on that and was like, no, this is absolutely true even though I have

300
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,040
 absolutely no proof of it, oh no, there's holes on her tongue. That means she eats humans.

301
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,720
 If I was really pushing that, I'd almost have no mental energy to investigate other conspiracy

302
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,960
 theories. You get obsessed with that one particular one. Sometimes you're going to be like, no, I

303
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,840
 have a hunch about this. You start looking into it and there's just nothing to it and you have to go,

304
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,160
 oh, I was wrong and move on. Conspiracy theories can be really fun but we can't let them override

305
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:51,920
 our common sense or our judgment because then it becomes, it's not no longer a fun hobby or an

306
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,640
 interesting investigation or seeking out some sort of the truth. It becomes an obsession where the

307
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:07,040
 truth doesn't matter anymore. It's all just about finding the weirdest possible thing you can think

308
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:14,720
 of and hanging your hat on it. DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address. You can also
