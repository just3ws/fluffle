1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
 Is Kim Kardashian a witch who's casting spells on Kanye West? And then we look

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,080
 at the popular yet controversial conspiracy. Are the Illuminati really the

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,040
 good guys today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:26,960
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode actually it's episode 100 and

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,680
 it is the start of season 3 of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,240
 Carpenter. I am having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. My

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,040
 vacation was really busy. I really got a bunch of research done and I found a way

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,000
 to streamline research so that was nice. You know just having a week to kind of

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,960
 look at the flaws of the research process. Not saying that I did any

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,120
 additional research than I normally do but I mean I did research more stories

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,760
 but I think if you listen this far in the podcast it's not. You know people

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,240
 complain they go man this isn't this isn't a news podcast. You're not a

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,560
 journalist. Yeah that's kind of the point. I was talking to my little brother I

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,480
 said my podcast is basically the equivalent of your best buddy. Read

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,240
 something weird in the news and then plops down on your couch and proceeds to

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,040
 tell you about it while drinking a beer. It's that's kind of the vibe of the

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,720
 show. I didn't want to sit down and read Wikipedia articles and do deep dives

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,960
 into the research. I do that but I think the way that it's presented is

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,240
 there's a reason why it's presented the way it's presented. I do want to say

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,280
 too now this isn't going to affect a lot of the listeners but it's going to

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,400
 affect the listeners who use the Podbean app. We're actually changing our

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,400
 podcast provider. We're going with a different podcast provider. It's going to

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,240
 allow us more freedom, more stats. Really what I needed was a lot more stats. I

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,960
 just needed a lot more room to grow. So for most of you you're not even going to

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,800
 notice the difference. For the people who are watching it on YouTube you're not

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,680
 even going to notice. We're still going to upload on YouTube. For the users who

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,560
 downloaded from podcast addict or iTunes or anything like that there may be a day

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,600
 or two where it doesn't look like anything's getting updated and that's

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,680
 just because of the everything's being moved over but again your subscriptions

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,400
 are going to stay the same. For the people who use the Podbean app you will

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,720
 unfortunately probably have to listen to it either on the website which I will

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,000
 present when we get it. So for the Podbean users there's going to be a brief

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,920
 cutoff where we're switching from Podbean to Libsyn and Libsyn will also have a

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
 website that you can just listen to the episodes on the website but in that

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,520
 interim period what I would recommend doing is you can either go to our

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,640
 YouTube channel DeadRavv at Radio or you can add me on Twitter @JasonOCarpenter

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,120
 on Twitter and I'll let you guys know what the real website is going to be

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,560
 there. It's going to be DeadRavv.com actually I don't know why I'm even

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,520
 making it to be mysterious. It's going to be DeadRavv.com but if you're a

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,520
 Podbean listener you will want to migrate over to that site or you know I

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,160
 would hope that you guys stayed with the show so I'm sorry but yeah we

42
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,160
 have to move to a different podcast provider. I just need more access to

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,800
 the stats, less restrictions, things like that. Podbean's kind of an entry level

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,480
 podcast site and we've moved past the entry level podcast site so we're going

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,600
 over to Lipson but you know Podbean was successful in what it did and I

46
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,560
 appreciate my days with Podbean but it's just time to move on. So I just got out

47
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,080
 of a locked bathroom I guess I should say that too. I locked myself in my

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,760
 bathroom that took about 10 minutes. At a certain point I realized I'm not

49
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,720
 getting out of my bathroom so I just took a shower and then I got out of the

50
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,440
 shower and sat and fiddled with it for a while. My door lock I only have half the

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,400
 doorknob in my bathroom so this is actually the second time I've got locked

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,440
 in a bathroom and probably the last three months the last time I was getting

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,040
 ready to be in a play. I had to get down to the theater to do the show and I

54
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,760
 locked myself in my bathroom and now I did it again. Speaking of shows nobody

55
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,340
 cares but I recently saw the Adams family at local high school up here in

56
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,480
 Hood River. It's pretty cool. I'm not I actually don't like going to the theater

57
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,800
 anyways but but it was a good show. I just like being in theater I don't like

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,240
 watching it. So that was pretty much everything I did during my vacation. Oh

59
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,520
 and I got some weird emails from my dad but I'll talk about those tomorrow and

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,640
 I got some great new artwork and we're gonna talk about that tomorrow as well

61
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,880
 because it's gonna be ready to go up on the podcast and up on YouTube and all

62
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,320
 that stuff. But let's go ahead and get to what I know you're all looking forward

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,200
 to which is officially the start of season 3 episode 100 of the Dead Rabbit

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,720
 Radio podcast. So I appreciate you guys have been there. I hope that you guys

65
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,840
 stick with me as I'm moving from one podcast provider to the other and again

66
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,520
 we'll be seeing what's for most of you but I hope we take the next 100 episodes

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,200
 as a journey together because I'm having a lot of fun doing this and I hope

68
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,880
 you're having a lot of fun listening to it. So let's go ahead and get started

69
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,720
 with our first story. Now this recently happened well I guess let me let me

70
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 preface that this this allegation this story just recently happened so in

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,440
 October of this year there's an actor named Columbus Short. He's on this

72
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,400
 television show called Scandal which I have a very scandalous story about that

73
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,560
 show. There is this yeah I'm not gonna get into it but anyways basically this

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,040
 girl made me watch it. It's a much longer story than that and I can't stand it

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,360
 because I can barely stand her. Anyways Columbus Short is on the show scandal or

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
 was on the show scandal I don't even know if it's on the air anymore. I could

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,920
 totally forgot it existed until this story popped up on my radar. So what

78
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,600
 happened was recently there at Columbus Short posted something on Instagram. It

79
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,680
 was a picture of Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, his wife Kim Kardashian and

80
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,840
 this Ugandan woman and the quote underneath the Instagram post Columbus

81
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,120
 Short wrote this. "I post this picture for one reason and one reason only." I'm

82
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,720
 reading it like he's some member of like the royal family okay. What's a

83
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,920
 better way to okay. "I post this picture for one reason and one reason only to

84
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,280
 expose witchcraft." This is what it looks like. It's an unaddressed issue but real

85
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,320
 and present right now. Both men and women all over the world are unknowingly

86
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,320
 being tormented by witchcraft and this is what it looks like. You can call me

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,320
 crazy but I suggest you guys do your research. Of course provides no links

88
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,960
 for the research we should do so I actually have to do some of my own. We'll

89
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,040
 get to that in a moment but Columbus in the future you want people to do their

90
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,680
 research you should give them a little bit of a starting point. So the picture

91
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,000
 like I said is Kim Kardashian, this Ugandan woman and Kanye West. Now full

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,680
 disclosure I'm a big Kanye West fan. I didn't start off a Kanye West fan. I

93
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,720
 wasn't his fan until graduation not my graduation the album. That was a bad

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,440
 joke but anyways I wasn't a fan of his until graduation and then pretty much

95
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,280
 threw and threw to the current day. I like him for his music. I like him for

96
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,160
 his antics, his personality. I think he's kind of a modern-day you know Andy

97
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,800
 Warhol type guy just like a totally out-of-control artist and I do have to

98
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,320
 say I'm relatively a fan of Kim Kardashian in the sense that I admire

99
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,760
 her business acumen. Of course I was aware of her from her sex tape

100
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,080
 which is amazing but I think she's a good businesswoman. She seems to be a

101
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,920
 relatively stable influence in Kim Kardashian Kanye West's life. She takes

102
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,160
 the idea of prison reform very seriously. She went met with president. She's

103
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,040
 talking about going to law school possibly. I don't think she's an idiot. I

104
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,640
 think that she's kind of a Parrish Hilton type character where she's very

105
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,880
 attractive and she's smarter than she acts because she knows that the dits is

106
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,520
 what sells because from what she's done otherwise she seems to be fairly savvy.

107
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,440
 But I am a Kanye West fan and like I said to a lesser extent a Kim Kardashian

108
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,200
 fan. I think Kanye West is probably one of the best rappers working right now of

109
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,440
 the new generation. Not like the little peep guys but in between like I'm

110
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,920
 getting off topic but anyways so full disclosure and full disclosure Kanye West

111
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,640
 is a eccentric guy. So in this photo it is Kim Kardashian beaming with this

112
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,720
 smile. There's this very tall Ugandan woman standing in between them with a

113
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,720
 big smile and Kanye West is staring off-camera blank look on his face and

114
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,000
 this is the proof. This is what he's providing to post this picture to expose

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,600
 witchcraft. Now here's the thing Kanye West I don't think could take a normal

116
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,600
 photo to save his life. He's just is a he's an odd duck that's just who he is

117
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,920
 and if two people are smiling in the picture he's gonna look off in the

118
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,600
 distance. If the two people were had this very somber look because they were at a

119
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,880
 World War One veteran memorial he'd have a smile on his face. He's just he just

120
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,440
 has these weird tics about him. But you're saying Jason your judgment's

121
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,000
 clouded because you like both of these people and that's true it could be

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,080
 clouded but here again here's the thing. This guy in this what four or five

123
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,840
 sentences that he posted on Instagram is supposed to be telling the world

124
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,560
 exposing the world to the witchcraft that's going on. This is first off this

125
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,560
 photo is terrible evidence. If it was a picture of probably somebody who is

126
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,640
 normally on top of the world and they look this weird there might be a little

127
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,320
 bit more behind it but again Kanye is just so weird anyways and he was always

128
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,560
 been weird it wasn't because Kim Kardashian is a witch or anything like

129
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,360
 that and that's really what he's suggesting here. He's being that Kanye

130
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,760
 West is being tormented by witchcraft and then another user said it's someone

131
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,960
 who responded to this Instagram post and said are you saying Kim Kardashian as a

132
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,480
 witch and Columbus short responded yep so he's saying that yes Kim Kardashian is

133
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,320
 somehow casting spells on him. Let's okay I'm not gonna say witchcraft doesn't

134
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,000
 exist because I do believe in a certain element of magic that's possible. What I

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,360
 find incredibly unlikely is that a practicing witch would use who's powerful

136
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,240
 enough to control other people who's able to cast and curse hexes on people

137
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,520
 would cast them on Kanye West and like I previously said she met with the

138
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,840
 president why didn't she cast him on the president? If she is that effect if Kim

139
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,080
 Kardashian is that effective of a witch why does she get so much hate shouldn't

140
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,680
 her life be absolutely perfect yes she's rich and she's beautiful on all these

141
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,200
 things but the general public looks fairly down upon her so she's this

142
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
 powerful witch that can actually control people why doesn't she just meet with

143
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,720
 like the heads of Fox and all these media outlets the heads of people and cast the

144
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,480
 spell on them you have to ask these questions you these are questions that

145
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,840
 have to be asked so again if I believe in an element of magic in the world and I

146
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,760
 believe that there may be some people who are capable of using it I do not

147
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,560
 believe Kim Kardashian is one of those people because the evidence doesn't prove

148
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
 it she's met with world leaders she met with all these people and she's still

149
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,800
 pretty much when she met with Donald Trump the headline I believe was what

150
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,000
 was it the Trump and the Rump that's not how you would talk about someone who

151
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,600
 had magical powers to control people it just doesn't wash so Columbus Schwartz

152
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,180
 allowed to have his opinion and he does say you can call me crazy but generally

153
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,360
 when people say that they kind of know they kind of know they they don't

154
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,800
 necessarily think that they're crazy but they know what they're saying is

155
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,000
 incredibly illogical which actually should be a term that's used more than

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,440
 crazy you know you can call me illogical because it doesn't there's no logic

157
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,960
 behind it it's a picture of three people and one looks off for all we know he saw

158
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,880
 a duck getting decapitated by a chicken off camera and that's why he's looking

159
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,320
 over there we don't know we don't have all the evidence but the evidence that

160
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,080
 you've presented to me does not tell me that Kim Kardashian is a witch but I

161
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,160
 will follow Columbus Schwartz advice Columbus Schwartz gave us the advice to

162
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,720
 do our research we have to do our research to find out that men and women

163
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,320
 all over the world are unknowingly being tormented by witchcraft so I did I

164
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,800
 found a website that told me the signs of a curse let's take a look at a couple

165
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,400
 of these a lot of them were pretty boring but I found some ones that were

166
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,320
 quite interesting okay number one this is a sign you're being cursed so if this

167
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,880
 happens to you guys you know something's up number one you discover

168
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,680
 unidentified liquids on your doorstep or around your property I will let you and

169
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,640
 your mind fill in what type of what's the worst liquids you could find outside

170
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,520
 your door I know what mine is I've all walked outside my door and I saw urine

171
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,000
 I'd go that's disgusting if I walked outside my door and saw blood my you

172
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,360
 know what the thing is my first inclination to be like somebody got

173
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,600
 hurt here or an animal someone dumped a dead animal off here if I walked outside

174
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,240
 my door and happened to see I don't know semen I don't think I would jump to

175
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,440
 witchcraft but I would think something was very very off so that would be but

176
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,080
 actually no let's go back to this unidentified liquids I'm just gonna look

177
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,400
 down and I'm see a puddle of something I don't know what it is that's actually

178
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,760
 less scary than blood or semen if I walked out and I just saw a puddle I'd be

179
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,280
 like that's water so let's go on with this one style of hex that a witch may

180
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,720
 choose to use involves creating an enchanted potion upon spilling the liquid

181
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,240
 in your in your home around your property or on your doorstep the curses

182
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,600
 then evoked after cleaning up a suspected potion be sure to cleanse the

183
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,040
 space with holy water I would love to meet somebody who every time like they

184
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,160
 just see a puddle somewhere they're like looking around for a pointy hat sticking

185
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,960
 out of the bushes number three now number two you know they go on a lot of them

186
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,240
 are just very vague I just wanted to touch on the most ridiculous ones this

187
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,160
 one here number three now I want to I want you to imagine for a moment a

188
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,960
 growing adult a mature human being sits down next to you and tells you this

189
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,920
 phrase with all earnest like they look at you and they go with complete

190
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,320
 conviction they tell you this you notice that photos have gone missing film style

191
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,920
 photography is said to possess a piece of your auric energy allowing for a

192
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,280
 special connection to the person being photographed as such these photos are

193
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,080
 often used as part of magic rituals you notice that pictures have gone missing

194
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:48,840
 around your home a witch may have taken these now again I want you

195
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,720
 to imagine an adult who's walking around their house and they notice a photos

196
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,960
 missing now again I don't think they're talking about like framed photos let's

197
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,720
 say you're let's say I want you to imagine adult who's going through their

198
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,920
 photo album and they notice a photo is no longer attached to the page that it's

199
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,600
 missing now I think most people are gonna go oh the glue must have come unstuck

200
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
 or that you know the paper was frayed or whatever and it fell out it's behind the

201
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,560
 bookcase that's where the picture is but I imagine that there are a sizable

202
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,280
 group of people out there which might have taken this like that's what they

203
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,680
 jumped to because they read rule number three that they're basically thinking a

204
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,800
 photo missing equals a witch there's all there's a group of people out there that

205
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,680
 is not a small group of people who would believe that it's shocking to me now

206
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:42,160
 again yes people probably can harness some sort of unknown energy I'll accept

207
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,000
 that that might be possible but that's a long leap to saying oh honey where did

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,920
 you put our wedding photo she goes I don't know and he's like oh my god check

209
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,600
 the house for liquids are there any liquids anywhere a witch a witch is loose

210
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,640
 bizarre it's bizarre and it's interesting because it says the film

211
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,040
 style photography is said to possess a piece of your arc energy so digital

212
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,360
 cameras don't do that yet orbs which are ghosts apparently only show up for the

213
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,040
 most part in digital photography so digital photography is good enough to

214
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,800
 capture the soul of a dead person but not good enough to capture the energy of

215
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,480
 a living person even though you think that a dead person's soul would actually

216
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,840
 be given off more energy because it's penetrating the barrier between life

217
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,320
 and death and then I have to say all the photos that I've deleted from my hard

218
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,720
 drive was it really a little witch in there instead of a paperclip or any

219
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,280
 other Microsoft assistant helping me so yeah this is completely ridiculous

220
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,600
 but people believe this people believe this stuff so let me cap this off Kim

221
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,200
 Kardashian is not a witch missing photos are not the sign of a witch another rule

222
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,720
 here says that if your underwear goes missing it may be a sign of a witch if

223
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,520
 your underwear goes missing it may be a sign someone's selling them on eBay

224
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,720
 you're a woman if your underwear is missing and you're a man it may be a

225
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,440
 sign that you're selling yours on eBay or they've simply disintegrated because

226
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,080
 you never wash them a problem I commonly have when my underwear goes missing I

227
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,520
 just figured out they just they just evaporated should have washed them

228
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,840
 witchcraft now you know the signs look for those photos guys if anyone still

229
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,560
 has actual film photos somewhere in their house check to see if they're still

230
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,040
 there Kim Kardashian might have paid you a visit let's go ahead and get moved on

231
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,360
 to the next story now the next story is a story that has been highly requested

232
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,680
 it's one that I think most conspiracy theorists have thought about at some

233
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,880
 point in their research this one this episode I'm thinking might end up

234
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,120
 running a little long but it is our hundredth episode and there's the

235
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,960
 season 3 premiere so we might have to just allow that because this is actually

236
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,880
 a fairly complicated topic are the Illuminati the good guys that's really

237
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,200
 what we're gonna be discussing here now of course it's gonna be a matter of

238
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,800
 opinion we don't know who or what the Illuminati even are really but let's go

239
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,520
 ahead and get as much facts as we can into this before we start breaking into

240
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,080
 the opinion so the Illuminati was we know for let's go over the facts

241
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,560
 Illuminati oh and let me say this too this was like I said this is something

242
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,920
 people have thought about for a long time but it was this episode was

243
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,680
 specifically requested by JC Bateman on YouTube so thank you JC are the Illuminati

244
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,600
 the good guys let's go over the facts here real quick we're gonna go back to

245
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,160
 the year 1776 we're going into Europe there was a man I going to butcher his

246
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,760
 last name but his name was Adam Weishaupt something like that and he had a

247
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,480
 couple beefs one he was a fan of the Masons but he kind of thought it was too

248
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,400
 expensive to join and he thought that the church was interfering too much with

249
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,960
 the Enlightenment too much with the advancement of man which to be fair

250
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,880
 they were so he wanted to form a society of free thinkers and idealists to help

251
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,840
 raise humanity up he originally they were called their perfected lists and he

252
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,360
 thought that takes too long so then they decided to take one of two names they

253
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:17,280
 were either going to be the bee order like bees or the order of the Illuminati

254
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,360
 now it's funny as it would have been to have Alex Jones ranting about the bee

255
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,600
 order taking over the planet they did decide to go with the order of the

256
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,320
 Illuminati and they're standardly known as the Bavarian Illuminati today so they

257
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,960
 formed in 1776 on May 1st this is a quote from Adam he said the order of the

258
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,200
 day is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice to

259
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,160
 control them without dominating them so this idea was to get into positions of

260
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,400
 power so they could begin to move society towards a more enlightened stage

261
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,040
 hence the word illumination Illuminati and they were doing their thing and of

262
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,400
 course with any they started to recruit from the masons they had this order with

263
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,360
 these three steps that you can move up it was a very Masonic type organization

264
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,240
 they begin to get into positions of judges and things like that and if

265
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,640
 members of the Illuminati were brought forward into court they'd kind of get a

266
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,800
 better deal than just an average person and what happened was eventually the

267
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,280
 government of Bavaria said you know what we're gonna out there was too much

268
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,320
 trouble they had so many secret societies that all these people they're

269
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,720
 basically extra legal groups they had their own set of laws and they would

270
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,480
 help each other out and things like that and the government of Bavaria said

271
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,280
 we're gonna outlaw all of them not just the Illuminati all of them because all

272
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,080
 the Masonic lodges and all that stuff Bavaria outlawed all secret societies

273
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:49,760
 and that was officially the end of the order of the Illuminati in 1797 and

274
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,600
 1798 two books came out and that's what really kept the idea of the so the

275
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,360
 order of the Illuminati's gone but these books came out and these books kept the

276
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,080
 conspiracy going the idea was that the French Revolution that later happened

277
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,320
 was caused by the order of the Illuminati that they were still pulling the

278
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,920
 strings behind closed doors or is it behind the curtain anyways they were

279
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,280
 pulling strings somewhere sealed off it's kind of been retconned so now we're

280
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,080
 getting into the stuff that's not actually factual this is all based on

281
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,920
 people saying things there's no provenance to any of is it provenance or

282
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,320
 provenance anyways there's no going there's no tracking back these actual

283
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,180
 quotes where we're gonna go some people claim to say that the Illuminati was

284
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,160
 behind the American Revolution which happened what a month Declaration of

285
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,200
 Independence this happened in May June July so two months later the Declaration

286
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,000
 of Independence was started some people say that the group was it caused the

287
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,760
 American Revolution caused the Declaration of Independence to be

288
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,640
 created my argument to that is you just had a whole generation of people who

289
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,280
 believed in throwing off the shackles of tyranny some of them and were Warren

290
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,720
 Bavaria throwing off the shackles of the church some of them were in America

291
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,480
 throwing off the shackles of Britain but the idea that the Illuminati has now

292
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,200
 through the ages controlled things controlling things behind the scenes now

293
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,960
 of course Adam did say that's kind of what they wanted to do control them

294
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,920
 without dominating them take control without actually having to you know run

295
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,440
 everything you're just running the pieces of power what the Illuminati is

296
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,280
 generally considered to date when you hear that term it is generally a insult

297
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,640
 or a pejorative generally the Illuminati are considered to be saint

298
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,160
 worshipers they're trying to create the New World Order which is a slave state of

299
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,400
 earth they've been linked to wanting to cause mass genocide to cause food

300
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,120
 shortages so millions of people die to controlling wars controlling race wars

301
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,440
 to giving people vaccines to make them dumber or to control them to wanting to

302
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,000
 install chips in people's hands so they can track and they can control them

303
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 rounding up people into camps and again controlling them but basically creating

304
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,760
 a prison planet to where us normal people as civilians as normal homo sapiens

305
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,000
 are ruled over we're cold there's only like five million of us left and we're

306
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 ruled by this satanic overall cold I'll say this there's and this should go

307
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,360
 without saying but there's no proof to back any of that up at all there's

308
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,840
 nothing like there are people who've said they've defected from the Illuminati

309
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,680
 and they tell us a story but I could say I defected from Dairy Queen and tell you

310
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,480
 what a terrible place Dairy Queen is and you have to take the idea and that did

311
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,640
 happen but you have to take what I say with a grain of salt because one you

312
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,200
 don't know if I'm making it up whole cloth and two you maybe I just have bad

313
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,200
 blood which isn't proof it's something somebody else wrote and there's a

314
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,320
 difference between that we have historical documents for the stuff I

315
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,880
 just told about 1776 and the Bavarian Illuminati and stuff like that that's all

316
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,480
 historical documents those are all records of that somebody telling an

317
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,840
 author about his time in the Illuminati that's not proof that's one person

318
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:17,120
 telling a story to another person so that is the Illuminati in a nutshell that

319
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,800
 they started off as the secret order in 1776 and now the theory goes again

320
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,320
 there's not any proof of it but well the theory is is that they're you're still

321
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,600
 around and they are satanic and they worship Molok they worship this owl

322
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,680
 in the Bohemian Grove and they put their secret symbols everywhere the the

323
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,280
 pyramid with the eye you can see subliminal messaging and music videos you

324
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,080
 can see subliminal messaging and kids shows on and on and on and they control

325
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,720
 everything now so let's take that for a fact that there is an Illuminati that

326
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,260
 controls everything there is a group of people that have evolved from a 1776 to

327
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,480
 today and their plan and their plan to put it into the machinations of the

328
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,120
 purveyors of injustice is still here today let's get into the idea that the

329
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,600
 Illuminati are in fact the good guys one theory is that they started off as good

330
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,440
 guys and then they became corrupted by their power they started off with the

331
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,320
 intention of being this enlightened group that would arise humanity up past the

332
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,600
 self-implied restrictions of the church and church thought they said science

333
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,760
 will rule the day philosophy will rule the day instead of these religious

334
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,600
 leaders ruling the day but over the preceding 300 years they've you know

335
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,160
 the original good men died out and those who've taken their place and then after

336
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,960
 them and after them they've just become more focused on power and money and

337
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,600
 become part of the problem and no longer are part of the solution so that's one

338
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,080
 of the theories there's another one that you have the Illuminati that runs

339
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,040
 everything and then you have the garbage people and the garbage people are the

340
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,240
 people who generally we associate with the Illuminati this the like baby

341
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:18,320
 sacrifices the child porn peddlers the horrible like bankers and people who

342
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,880
 start wars and stuff like that and the Illuminati are so well hidden that we

343
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,960
 can't see past the garbage people when we see these horrible deals being made

344
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,240
 behind closed doors or US government selling weapons to this country and

345
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,080
 they're thinking that's horrible and chemical weapons being dropped in these

346
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,040
 high-profile people getting away with child porn charges or getting like

347
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,680
 slaps on the wrist and things like that and we go how was all of this horrible

348
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,000
 stuff happening and I know there's an Illuminati I believe that but then on

349
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,240
 under then I see proof of all this horrible stuff happening I think they're

350
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,880
 connected and it could be that the actual Illuminati are so well hidden that

351
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,280
 we can't see them we see all the people who are like you know would be real

352
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,120
 funny to hide this pyramid eye and this Nickelodeon ad yeah and the garbage

353
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,480
 people could actually be trying to give the Illuminati a bad name because they

354
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,480
 know the Illuminati is fighting for good theory again there's no proof of any of

355
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,560
 this but it's an interesting theory and I think it's one that would actually

356
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,880
 stand up because when we look at powerful people getting away with doing

357
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,680
 wicked things we go how could that happen and if you believe also that there

358
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,680
 is a group of powerful people ruling the world you would your next step would be

359
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,480
 like oh it happens because they're part of this group that runs the whole world

360
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,880
 you just see the visible stuff and you go I can see this and I know this other

361
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,480
 thing I can't see exists therefore the two must be connected and I think that's

362
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,320
 one of the reasons why the Illuminati gets a bad name but I think the most

363
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,640
 important reason again if you buy into the theory of the Illuminati if you buy

364
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,720
 into the theory that the Illuminati are controlling the planet let me ask you a

365
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:06,440
 question and it's a very very simple question is the world better off today

366
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:13,960
 than it was in 1776 if there was a group that was founded in 1776 and their goal

367
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:20,080
 was to enlighten humanity to bring them out of the dark ages of thought are we

368
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:28,360
 immeasurably better off as a planet today than we were in 1776 global poverty is

369
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,640
 down world hunger is down life expectancy is up technological advances are

370
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,400
 mind-blowing to someone from 1776 we have our problems we have bush wars we have

371
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,920
 political issues we have personal strife we have international strife but even

372
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,080
 in my lifetime the world has gotten better from the brink of nuclear war when

373
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,960
 I was growing up in the 80s I like I'm 42 years old so I was a little kid during

374
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,400
 the 80s and we are on the brink of global nuclear war and it terrified me as a

375
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,120
 child to now I simply worry about getting shot when I go out to a nightclub

376
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,760
 you can see both are equally terrifying but one was the end of humanity and the

377
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,920
 other one is an unfortunate terrible event that I'm still aware of can happen

378
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,440
 to me but I think by any measure you could say that is an improvement that's

379
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,400
 an improvement just that example people are living more fulfilling lives today

380
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,640
 than they were in 1776 the average person you could say well the philosopher

381
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,760
 got to sit around all day and just eat apples like Johnny Apple seed and read

382
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,160
 books all day the philosopher maybe but for the average working person it's been

383
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,000
 much better now than it was back then for poor people it was a hundred times

384
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,440
 better than it was back then if there is an Illuminati if they have been acting

385
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,480
 behind the scenes you can come up with all the theories about same worshiping

386
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,160
 and stuff like that that you want with the Illuminati that they're trying to

387
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,400
 create his prison plan and give people chips those are theories if you believe

388
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:12,000
 that the Illuminati formed in 1776 and they've ruled a sense then you have to

389
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,320
 believe that they have benefited this planet because it's better than it was

390
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,440
 back then it's better for pretty much everybody rainforest you know a couple

391
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:31,400
 animals probably not so much but people have more they have more time they have

392
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,280
 more wealth they have more food they have the ability to communicate with

393
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:42,760
 people in parts of the globe that in 1776 were almost fictional people didn't

394
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,960
 even know those places existed we have grown so much as a species we've landed

395
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,840
 on the moon we've sent probes out to the farthest reaches of the solar system

396
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:59,720
 and we've cured diseases that back then they thought were curses if the Illuminati

397
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,560
 has ruled the world since 1776 they're doing a damn good job dead rabbit radio
