1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
 Am I in an alternate reality?

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,500
 Am I in an alternate reality?

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:17,040
 A close encounter of the disturbed kind and robot replacements among us.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,680
 This is Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:40,180
 [Music]

6
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,480
 Okay, it's 10.30 at night.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,280
 On a Friday night?

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
 It's like being in high school again.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,280
 Actually, no, that's not fair because I was actually out with a couple friends and that's why I'm recording this so late.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,280
 So it's not like being in high school again.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,280
 I remember when X-Files first came out, I was in...

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,280
 I think it was a junior or a senior in high school.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,280
 I was so excited. That show was like totally right at my alley.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
 I'm sure you're a fan of it too if you're listening to this podcast.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,280
 And I remember thinking, "Ah, you know, there's probably definitely..."

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,280
 I remember at the time thinking, "There's a reason why they put this on Friday night."

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,280
 Because of people like me who have no real social life that we go out on Friday nights.

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,280
 I had friends, but it wasn't something, "Yo, it's Friday night. We have to go cruising and all that stuff."

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,280
 So for us, for us nerdy types, we stayed home and watched X-Files.

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,280
 I love that show.

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,280
 But I think I fell off around the same time everyone else fell off.

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,280
 So what was I going to say?

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,280
 Oh yeah, so I think I'm in an alternate universe.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,280
 I think I have personally fallen into an alternate reality.

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,280
 Now, there's a thing... We'll probably dedicate a whole episode to it.

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,280
 I probably won't do it tonight, but there's a thing that's called the Mandela effect.

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,280
 And what that is, is it is things that you remember, you swear up and down that it is one thing,

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
 and it turns out that you're wrong. And not just you're wrong, but millions and millions of other people are wrong.

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,280
 The best example of this, even though it's called the Mandela effect, is not really.

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,280
 So there's a disagreement over when Nelson Mandela died.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,280
 Some people think that they have vivid memories. He died in the 80s in jail.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,280
 And then other people go, "No, no, no, he just died a couple years ago."

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,280
 And I don't think that's a very... Most people aren't aware of current events.

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
 They get those mixed up.

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,280
 I was never really following the news coming out of South Africa.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
 So I mean, I don't know one way or the other.

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:47,280
 I do have a vague memory of the tank running over the guy in Tiananmen Square, but that didn't happen.

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
 Apparently that didn't happen.

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,280
 I think the clearest example, though, of the Mandela effect, what really brought it to my attention was that

40
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 growing up, there was a series of books called the Bernstein Bears.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 And it was B-E-R-E-N-S-T-E-I-N, Bernstein.

42
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:16,280
 And when a couple years ago, when I first found out about this theory, that a large chunk of the population has been shifted into an alternate reality,

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 it turns out those books are the Bernstein Bears.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,280
 B-E-R-E-N-S-T-A-I-N.

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,280
 And I know for a fact that it wasn't... It wasn't spelled that way.

46
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,280
 It wasn't the Bernstein Bears. It was the Bernstein Bears.

47
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,280
 I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that those books were titled something different.

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,280
 And it got to the point where a family member of the people who wrote it, like the aunt or the uncle or niece or something,

49
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,280
 from the Bernstein family came out and said, "No, the books were always titled that. That's been our family name.

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,280
 It's never been spelled any differently."

51
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:02,280
 And people will, like, go and find like there's an old TV guide listing for the Bernstein Bears, and they hold it up as evidence.

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,280
 I remember it vividly being Bernstein.

53
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,280
 I think if it was Bernstein, it spelt like a stain, I think there would have been a lot of poop stain jokes,

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,280
 because you know we were kids and we would have come up with any reas, but I just, that just doesn't look right.

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,280
 It doesn't sound right.

56
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,280
 But then there's other stuff with the Mandela effect, like, you know when Impartial Strikes Back,

57
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,280
 Darth Vader doesn't say, "Luc, I am your father."

58
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
 He says, "I think it's yes, I am your father." And that is accurate.

59
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:39,280
 "Luc, I am your father" came from parodies of that field of dreams. If you build it, they will come.

60
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,280
 I think the actual line is if they build it, you will, he will come or something like that.

61
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,280
 I understand stuff gets forgotten. New Zealand moves around on the map and things like that.

62
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:57,280
 Now, you know, so facts will be repeated, and then especially like, you can hear a parody of George W. Bush,

63
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,280
 you can hear like someone parodying him, and that's really, you hear that more than the actual George Bush.

64
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,280
 So then when you hear the real George Bush, you're like, "Oh, that's weird, it doesn't sound like him."

65
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,280
 So I think that has to do with a lot of the Mandela effect.

66
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,280
 However, the people trying to convince me that C-3PO had a middle leg of this whole time, or silver leg,

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,280
 and I absolutely do not remember, I was obsessed with those movies as a kid, that he had a gold leg.

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:33,280
 But again, the argument is most of us had our interactions with C-3PO through the toy, and I guess the toy had a yellow leg.

69
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,280
 I don't know, now when I see photos of him with the clear silver leg, it's super bizarre to me.

70
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,280
 And what's weird is that I think as a kid, as imaginative as I was, I think it's cooler that he has a silver leg,

71
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,280
 because it means he's more like a cobbled together robot.

72
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,280
 And I just don't remember him having a silver leg, and I don't remember the Baron Stain Bears.

73
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,280
 And I've looked into a ton of Mandela effect stuff, and those are really the only two that I'm like,

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
 "I absolutely know those aren't true."

75
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,280
 The other ones, you know what, I really don't have to do a whole episode on it, because that kind of explains a lot of it.

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:17,280
 What the theory is, is that there was some sort of huge cataclysm, and a good chunk of the population shifted from one reality into this reality.

77
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:25,280
 So there was a reality where the books were the Baron Stain Bears, and we got shifted over to the Baron Stain Universe.

78
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,280
 And then other people go, "Fruit loops?" Well, it used to be spelled like fruit, like F-R-U-I-T loops.

79
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,280
 And I'm like, "I don't know, I never ate fruit loops." So I don't know.

80
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,280
 But to me, that seems more just like a mistake, unless you were like a Fruit Loops fanatic.

81
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
 I grew up on Star Wars and Baron Stain Bears.

82
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,280
 I mean, I guess it would be a Fruit Loops every day, but I didn't.

83
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,280
 So, anyways, the idea is with the CERN, with that big superclidre being activated,

84
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,280
 it shifted a bunch of people into this reality,

85
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,280
 or it has something to do with the idea of quantum suicide, where if you kill yourself, you don't actually die,

86
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,280
 you just shift into reality where you're still alive.

87
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,280
 Not just if you kill yourself, but if you die in any way, you just shift into reality where you're still alive.

88
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,280
 Which is an interesting concept.

89
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,280
 It begs the question, though, what if you're 98 years old?

90
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,280
 Do you just keep shifting until you turn to dust?

91
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,280
 Or do we only perceive you as being 38 and you shift?

92
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,280
 Or what if you're paralyzed from the neck down and you die?

93
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,280
 Do you then shift to reality where you're still paralyzed from the neck down and then you die and you shift another?

94
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
 I mean, like, so if you get paralyzed, are you paralyzed forever?

95
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,280
 So there's some issues with quantum suicide that need to be worked out.

96
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
 Or quantum death.

97
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,280
 Because you can't experience the idea of quantum death, because you can't experience reality.

98
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,280
 Reality doesn't exist unless you experience and you can't...

99
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
 I don't know, I don't know. It's 10.30 at night.

100
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,280
 But anyways, basically so, we all shifted into this reality.

101
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,280
 Because of a massive nuclear war and because you don't really die, you just shift into a reality where you still exist.

102
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,280
 Or a certain supercollider, those are the two most popular theories with Mandela.

103
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,280
 The reason why I'm bringing this up.

104
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,280
 So there were three things that I remember.

105
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
 Two things I was taught wrong as a child.

106
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,280
 One was that when I went to school, it wasn't the 1950s, but it was weird.

107
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,280
 The Venus, there was life on the planet Venus.

108
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,280
 It was like a giant greenhouse, like underneath the clouds, it was like tropical jungles.

109
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 That's what I was taught.

110
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,280
 I remember having a really old encyclopedia set from like the 50s.

111
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
 And that was in there.

112
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,280
 And I always wondered when people were like, "Is there a life in space? Should we go to Mars?"

113
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
 I would tell people, "Why don't we just go to Venus?"

114
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
 We know there were plants there.

115
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,280
 And people would just look at me and never, nobody ever corrected me.

116
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,280
 I was a kid, I mean I was probably, but I was saying that until I was like 15 years old.

117
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,280
 They'd be like, "Why don't we just go to Venus? There's like plants there."

118
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,280
 And then one time I started to think about it, no one ever corrected me.

119
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,280
 And one day I was thinking, I'm like, "Wait, wait, what? How can...

120
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,280
 That can't be true because we would just send this up there."

121
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,280
 And then I went and I read up on it and they said, "Yeah, back in the 50s because it had the cloud cover."

122
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,280
 People assume, it might have been earlier than the 50s, but people assume Venus had life because it has like cloud cover.

123
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,280
 But it turns out it's just like an arid wasteland as far as we can tell.

124
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,280
 I also remember being told that, and I think it was the same encyclopedia set, that whales, and I believe the Venus thing.

125
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,280
 This one I really didn't believe, but that whales live to be 500 years old.

126
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,280
 And I remember it said in the encyclopedia, "The whale you see today may have seen Christopher Columbus discover America."

127
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,280
 And I remember like, "That's not true. That's absolutely not true."

128
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,280
 And I went to my dad, I was like, "Dad, do whales live to be 500 years old?"

129
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,280
 He's like, "No, no. I don't know why he never corrected me on Venus."

130
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,280
 But here's another thing though that I always heard as a kid.

131
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,280
 And I feel like I've shifted into a reality where it's no longer true.

132
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,280
 When I was a kid, people took showers every day.

133
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,280
 Every two days, at the most.

134
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:17,280
 But generally a person who had any sort of, who was doing any sort of labor, any sort of work, would take a shower every day.

135
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:25,280
 And then as I got older, people would be like, "Oh, well, I take a shower every day, but I only wash my hair every other day."

136
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
 Mostly women.

137
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,280
 Say, "I only wash my hair every other day because it washes out the minerals."

138
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,280
 I think they're just being lazy because they have a lot of hair, but that's not either hair nor hair.

139
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,280
 And so that's been pretty constant.

140
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:48,280
 In the past, I don't know, a couple months, I've had multiple people tell me they only shower once every three days.

141
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,280
 Minimum. Sometimes a week.

142
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
 And they're like, "Yeah, no, it's totally fine. It's totally acceptable."

143
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,280
 Multiple people across all sorts of spectrums.

144
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 I shower every couple days, once a week.

145
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,280
 And when I go, "No, you're joking." They're like, "Oh, no, no, seriously."

146
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,280
 I think I've shifted into a universe where people don't shower every day.

147
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:20,280
 I think the universe that I was originally in, it was common courtesy for both yourself and other people around you to shower every day.

148
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:26,280
 Now, what's interesting is that I'm around people who don't shower as often, but it's not like people are smellier.

149
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:36,280
 So maybe in this universe, people don't, they have evolved, or they don't take showers every day because their bodies don't smell as weird.

150
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,280
 I don't know. I don't know. I don't feel, I feel gross if I don't shower every day.

151
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,280
 And if I don't shower, I feel really like, ugh, I feel really self-conscious.

152
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,280
 I'm like, "Oh, people can probably tell I didn't shower. Look."

153
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 And then other people, now, apparently, I'm the freak. I'm the elephant man of the shower universe.

154
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,280
 I'm the guy who needs to, like, get clean. I get this dirt off of me.

155
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,280
 And other people are like, "Oh, yeah, no. I can't, the idea of going a week without a shower,

156
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:11,280
 I think the only time I've ever done that when I was severely depressed or, like, super sick."

157
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:18,280
 And even then, I'd say, I think there was probably a time, I have to say, there's probably a time in my life where I was too depressed to shower.

158
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,280
 I give that a week, and then even being super sick, I probably took a shower after, like, three or four days, because I just felt so gross.

159
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:31,280
 My question to you, I need a name for you guys. What should I call? If I'm, this is Dead Rabbit Radio.

160
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,280
 We'll call you, I don't know, the Rabbit League.

161
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:42,280
 Um, the, I don't know, we'll figure out something. The Dead Rabbits? No, maybe, I have a Rabbit League.

162
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:49,280
 Anyways, my question to you is, how often do you shower? I want to know.

163
00:12:49,280 --> 00:13:02,280
 And you can email me the answer at BASQUE5150@gmail.com. That's BASQ5150@gmail.com.

164
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,280
 That's my personal email address. I don't feel like setting up a business email address, because I know I'll never check it.

165
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,280
 Yeah, send me an email. No more weird emails. Send me an email about how often you shower.

166
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:20,280
 Okay, that's a weird email, but you know what I mean. Like, I'm curious, am I the only one? Am I the lone survivor of this great purge?

167
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:28,280
 I'm in the only, you know, I'm the only, I'm the only, like, shh, I'm, um, nah, never mind. I can't think of anything funny.

168
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:38,280
 Okay, so the next thing we're going to talk about is, I see, this episode seven, it's already been featured on, you know what, I'm getting ahead of the punch.

169
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:48,280
 So, here, hold on, because, sorry about that, I had a sneeze. I don't like doing edits, but that one was required.

170
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,280
 Okay, so I'm going to draw, I'm going to paint a mental picture for you.

171
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:09,280
 Man is driving down a road all by himself late at night, late, you know, late enough, and he sees a UFO.

172
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:24,280
 Scary enough. What's interesting about this UFO is that it has descended from the sky and is cruising down the road in front of him, going a cool 65 miles an hour.

173
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,280
 [Humming]

174
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:50,280
 I'm coming by in the night. So, our driver, who has now been put in this position of following a vehicle from another planet, decides to pull up to it, see if he can finally, with his own eyes, have proof that aliens are visiting us.

175
00:14:50,280 --> 00:15:03,280
 He begins following them, can barely see if there's any aliens in there, but he's following them. He pulls up alongside of them, looking inside.

176
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:13,280
 Can't really see, nothing looks too human. The vehicle's not of this world though, that's, he's sure of that.

177
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:25,280
 His first instinct is to tell the aliens to go back where they came from, he's shouting it from his window, go back where you came from, begins making, shaking his fist at them.

178
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,280
 It's the only way that maybe the aliens will understand that he's angry and that they need to leave.

179
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:42,280
 He's pulling in front of them, almost trying to take the UFO off of the road so maybe it'll soar back into the sky and humanity will be saved.

180
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:57,280
 The lights begin flashing. Our hero is getting a little scared now. These lights are coming seemingly from nowhere, they're not emanating from the extraterrestrial vehicle, but from all around them.

181
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:04,280
 Red, blue, red, blue, red, blue.

182
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:13,280
 The police car pulls up behind both our hero, our reluctant hero, and the alien vehicle.

183
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:22,280
 The alien vehicle was a Plymouth prowler and our hero, James Bushart, was smoking meth.

184
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:35,280
 And he pulled up behind this vehicle that he thought was futuristic and began to drive alongside them, threatening them, telling them, demanding that the aliens take their spaceship back to where they came from.

185
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:44,280
 He was arrested with disorderly conduct and the meth. Case closed. Or is it?

186
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:57,280
 So I'm reading this article and I'm laughing at this story. And then I get to this quote from the driver of the Plymouth prowler. This is the exact, I'm going to read this paragraph, this is the exact quote.

187
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:06,280
 So they lead into it, says, "Bushart is also accused of making threatening gestures." That's the lead into this quote. Here's the actual quote.

188
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:23,280
 "That was my biggest problem with what was going on was how upset he was. I guess in reference to the vehicle was the only thing I could think. I was a little upset about that mostly because I also had a passenger with me that was concerned for her safety as well."

189
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:42,280
 That is how an alien would talk to a human. No human is going to say, "That was my biggest problem with what was going on was how upset he was. I guess in reference to the vehicle was the only thing I could think."

190
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:56,280
 That's a robot dude. Humans don't talk like that. I was a little upset about that mostly because I also had a passenger with me that was concerned for her safety as well.

191
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:11,280
 The dude's a robot. Or an alien. Or an alien robot. This is my conspiracy now. James Bushart was probably doing meth. Let's meet him in the middle. He's doing meth.

192
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:23,280
 He sees a spaceship. It comes down to Earth and transforms into a car. This meth addict is now telling him to go back home the only way the aliens, they have two choices.

193
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:33,280
 They can fly away in their ship and then abandon the mission they're on. Or they can involve the Earth authorities to get him off of their back.

194
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:45,280
 Possibly. And then when the cops come to talk to him, "That was my biggest problem with what was going on was how upset he was." People do not talk like that.

195
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:54,280
 I'll even go a step further. What if James Bushart was not a meth addict? What if he was an upstanding citizen who was driving on the road and the aliens put the meth in his car?

196
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:08,280
 And then use some sort of alien technology to make him seem like he was on meth. He did say that James Bushart said he was a very big deal and had 100,000 Asian flowers.

197
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:18,280
 Which doesn't make sense to you and I, but that could be due to some sort of language scrambling from the alien meth machine. I'm just throwing it out there.

198
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:29,280
 Not saying that's what happened. Far beat from me to assume that aliens are hiding meth in people's cars. But that's probably what happened.

199
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:37,280
 Last off, oh, we're at 19 minutes now. You know what, this one will be quick because unfortunately I'm going to have to put the link.

200
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:45,280
 I wanted to cover this, but it's a picture you have to look at. So I'm just going to mention it real quick. Go ahead and look at it. I'll put the link in the description.

201
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,280
 We're on iTunes now. I'm sure you guys have found us on iTunes, but I'm still trying to figure out how to get the links on there.

202
00:19:51,280 --> 00:20:05,280
 Right now the links will be at our DeadRabbit.com. So if you go to DeadRabbit.com and look at the episode, this one will be titled, I don't know, something about showering.

203
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:14,280
 But anyways, I'm going to put up this link. The headline, "Has Meghan Markle been replaced by a robot? Weird video provides proof."

204
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:22,280
 This was an article that I saw the headline. I laughed. I have to see it. It is creepy.

205
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:32,280
 She is either been replaced by a robot, is incredibly high, or is suffering some sort of stroke in this small footage.

206
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,280
 And first off, you're going to see like a gif. And I'm looking at it, I'm like, that's fake. That's so fake. Like someone went in and messed with their eyes in the way.

207
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:49,280
 And then they actually show a clip from the Britain's Got Talent episode. Not a single muscle in her face moves for 25 seconds, except for her eyes.

208
00:20:49,280 --> 00:21:05,280
 It's terrifying the way that it looks. It looks so fake. So I'll put the link up. If you can't get the link, just Google, "Has Meghan Markle been replaced by a robot? Weird video provides proof."

209
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:13,280
 Watch it. It's totally creepy. There's also something about Melania Trump being replaced by a robot. I'm going to look into that. We'll get back to that.

210
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,280
 I hope you guys had fun this week. We're finally on iTunes. We're getting in all the podcast areas.

211
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:27,280
 Next week is going to be our first full week. We've been doing an episode a day, but on Monday and Tuesday we were still in the process of getting some stuff set up.

212
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:36,280
 I'm going to take the weekend off and as long as the world doesn't blow up, get invaded by aliens, or I don't get shifted into another universe, I will be here on Monday.

213
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,280
 My name is Jason Carpenter and thanks for listening to Dead Rather Radio.
