1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
 A baseball mystery that's lasted decades.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,000
 Who shut off the lights.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,440
 I'm making it sound super dramatic, but it is an interesting mystery.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,480
 And let me take a look at the story of the stone clad.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,560
 A race of people that may have lived among the Native Americans.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,880
 They were 12 feet tall, their skin was hard as stone, and they feasted on human flesh.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,280
 Did these creatures actually exist?

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,320
 And if they did, where are they now?

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,280
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,800
 [MUSIC]

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,960
 Yee-haw!

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 I'm having a great day.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,320
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,520
 The reason why I'm Yee-hawing is because we're on Jason's farm.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,880
 [MUSIC]

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,920
 There's like pigs walking around and stuff like that.

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
 They work there.

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
 They're not the livestock.

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
 They're fucking in.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,440
 They're just such a cow getting ready to get milk.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,960
 I just posted that YouTube video.

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,520
 A lot of people didn't expect it.

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,600
 A lot of people didn't know what it was.

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,040
 It was me working at my friend's farm.

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,360
 And also working at my friend's farm.

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,080
 Let's bring in our Patreon supporter for today.

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
 It's SqueezeGod.

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
 SqueezeGod.

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
 We're clapping.

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,080
 We don't see him.

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
 We're looking around.

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
 We see a pregnant cow.

35
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,760
 A cow's giving birth to SqueezeGod.

36
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
 Coming out.

37
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
 He's learning to walk.

38
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
 Little legs, little legs.

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
 I'll get covered.

40
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,240
 Why am I supporting your Patreon, dude?

41
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,840
 I'm covered in embeotic fluid.

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,520
 Oh, we're going to clean you off.

43
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
 And we're going to give you a job.

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,160
 You have to immediately have to get to work.

45
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
 You're late.

46
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,840
 You should have been born five minutes ago.

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,000
 SqueezeGod, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,440
 support the Patreon or if you're not half cow, that's fine too.

49
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,920
 Just helps spread the word about the show.

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
 Really, really helps out a lot.

51
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,800
 I posted some YouTube videos of me holding down a pig as this dude was clipping its nails.

52
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,080
 I wanted to give you guys some background for that because YouTube videos just kind of

53
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,120
 popped up in people who was like, "Dinner time," and people go, "What's this?"

54
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,720
 And it's just the sound of this pig screaming.

55
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,160
 First off, the pig's totally fine.

56
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,240
 This is a routine thing.

57
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,480
 Secondly, I want you guys to feel good about these pig-os in this farm.

58
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,240
 These are, there's four pigs here.

59
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,360
 Joy, the one we are clipping the nails of.

60
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,160
 She's 15 years old and she and all of her other pig friends there actually came from

61
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,120
 research laboratories.

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
 They actually were rescues.

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,160
 So basically after the research was done, after they taught them telepathic powers and

64
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,000
 they're floating around the room, they're like, "We must destroy these pigs."

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,960
 My friend, every show often she rescues two pigs from this local research facility.

66
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,640
 She doesn't like breaking the window.

67
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,640
 They're like, "No, the rescue pig bandit's back."

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,760
 She has an agreement with them that they let her take the pigs home.

69
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,200
 And it's really cool actually, she found out that out this research facility, I don't know

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
 exactly which one it is, so I'm not going to say.

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,000
 It's like Cyberdyne or Waylon, Utahnee or something like that.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,800
 No, it's a local facility here, but they treat them really nice.

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
 Like they are doing experiments on them and they know they're going to have to kill them

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,720
 after the experiments over, but they have like enrichment hours and they get special

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,920
 toys and they get like red books.

76
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,800
 They're freeing them with the wind and the willows.

77
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,160
 The pigs are like, "I don't understand this.

78
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,680
 I don't know English."

79
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,040
 But it's the thought that counts.

80
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,400
 So yeah, Joy, she's 15 years old and then there was Waylon in the video.

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,840
 He's maybe like 10 years old, he's 500 pounds.

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
 So go check out that video on YouTube.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,480
 I think it's really cool.

84
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,360
 It's basically me holding a pig dance close up of a pig's back in my hands going, "It's

85
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
 okay, Joy.

86
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,920
 It's okay as I'm rubbing her little bristles."

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,680
 And she's screaming, but immediately, she was in no pain whatsoever.

88
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
 It was fear.

89
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
 It's okay, right?

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,520
 You can be in fear, wasn't it?

91
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,800
 Immediately afterwards, she just laid down to go nap.

92
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
 So she's totally fine.

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,720
 And she is walking.

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
 She wasn't walking before.

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,800
 We were like, "Jason, this is an agricultural podcast.

96
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,040
 Just get to the goats.

97
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
 Get to the goats."

98
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,160
 I just want to say that she's doing totally fine.

99
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,680
 All the other piggoes are doing fine.

100
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,320
 Chickens and goats and everything like that.

101
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
 Look at SqueezeGod.

102
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,040
 SqueezeGod is now milking himself.

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
 That came out wrong.

104
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
 Everything.

105
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,000
 You have this farm is fine.

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But check out those videos.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I think you guys will have a bowl.

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,160
 That was a really long introduction, but I thought it was an important part of the Dead

109
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
 Rabbit Mythos.

110
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,680
 Me at a farm.

111
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,640
 SqueezeGod, let's toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

112
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,040
 We're leaving behind Jason Farms.

113
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,600
 We are headed out to Baltimore, Maryland.

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,040
 Specifically we're going to Camden Yards.

115
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,680
 That's where the Baltimore Orioles play.

116
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,800
 Dude is on a pitcher's mound and he's like throwing the ball and the guy's all sweaty.

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,840
 He's just a big sweaty guy at home base and he swings that bat, crack, and hits it and

118
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,360
 the ball sails away and the first baseman is trying to grab it.

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
 He's leaving the base.

120
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,400
 They're like, no, no, that's for the outfielders.

121
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,240
 And then he bumps into a bunch of outfielders and it ends up on the highlight reel and he

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,640
 loses his job.

123
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,400
 Typical day at a baseball stadium.

124
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,440
 People are constantly getting fired for leaving their stations.

125
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,240
 We're back in the year 1997.

126
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,160
 The reason why we're here is infielder Cal Ripken Jr. is about to set the record for

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,600
 the most played consecutive baseball games.

128
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,520
 Originally, Luke Gehrig set it in 1939.

129
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,640
 That record existed from 1939, the most played games in a row, until September 6, 1995.

130
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,760
 That was when Cal Ripken beat the record.

131
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,280
 So now we're in the year 1997.

132
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,360
 It's August 14, 1997 and he is still just blowing this record out of the park.

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,360
 August 14, 1997, the Orioles and the Seattle Mariners are facing off in Oriole Park.

134
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,840
 Things ready to go.

135
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
 Someone brought the ball.

136
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
 They forgot that the last game.

137
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,680
 They're like, oh no, we can't play baseball without a ball.

138
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
 Everyone had to go home.

139
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,320
 They brought the ball this time.

140
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,040
 Everyone has their bats ready.

141
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:58,880
 And just before 7pm when the game is about to begin, a bank of lights behind the first

142
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,640
 base dugout goes out.

143
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,600
 So they go and they fix it and the umpire goes, play ball!

144
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,520
 And everyone's like, yeah, yeah, that's what we came here for.

145
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,600
 The bank of lights goes out again behind the first base dugout.

146
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,040
 So let's fix it.

147
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
 Fixing it.

148
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
 Play ball!

149
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,840
 Bank of lights goes back off.

150
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,440
 This goes on from 7pm till around 9pm.

151
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,000
 Every time they fix the lights and they turn it back on, a circuit breaker is thrown and

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,880
 it kills the lights again.

153
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,280
 At 9.15pm, finally the ref comes out and it's doing all the hand motions and stuff like

154
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,960
 these thrown up game signs.

155
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,000
 Arrival gangs are driving by, cheating them.

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,880
 He's doing all the hand signs.

157
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
 Game is off.

158
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,120
 We can't play the game without these lights.

159
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,640
 We probably could have started it back at 7pm when the sun was slightly still up, but

160
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,160
 now no go.

161
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,280
 Also Bloods for Life.

162
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,400
 So calling this game actually puts the Orioles at a disadvantage because that means tomorrow

163
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
 they'll have to play a double header.

164
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,280
 They'll have to play two games in a row because you have to stay on schedule with this thing.

165
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
 But what are you going to do?

166
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,920
 You can't play without this Bank of Lights.

167
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,680
 So there's a conspiracy involving this.

168
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,160
 There's a conspiracy involving why the lights kept going out.

169
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,080
 So let's go back to earlier in the afternoon of August 14th, 1997.

170
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,640
 Cal Ripken Jr. is getting ready for the night's game.

171
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
 He's driving home.

172
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,000
 He just got done playing a game for the Chicago Bulls.

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,040
 He's playing the most games ever in a row.

174
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
 They didn't know that.

175
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
 Not just baseball.

176
00:07:30,040 --> 00:08:00,040
 He pulls up to his house and he's walking up and he hears a "e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

177
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,960
 He's starting to put stuff together.

178
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,280
 He knows that that is the sound of a mattress moving.

179
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,280
 And the mattress move was not supposed to be here until tomorrow.

180
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,560
 So it sounds like someone's having sex.

181
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,320
 And it's not him, but he's in his house.

182
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,840
 He's not the smartest guy in the world.

183
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,600
 He's like, "Ugh, what's going on?

184
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,360
 Someone's having sex, but it's not me."

185
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,200
 His wife is at home.

186
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,880
 And so is his best friend, Kevin Costner.

187
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,920
 And he opens the bedroom door and there is Kevin Costner straight up delivering the mail

188
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,080
 like the postman to her water world.

189
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,280
 It's about time he pulled out his tin cup.

190
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
 I don't know.

191
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,680
 It's the only movies I know of Kevin Costner.

192
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,560
 He made her dance like wolves.

193
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
 That's it.

194
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
 What else was he in?

195
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
 It doesn't matter.

196
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
 It doesn't matter.

197
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
 It doesn't matter.

198
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
 It doesn't matter.

199
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
 It doesn't matter.

200
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
 It doesn't matter.

201
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,600
 It beats up Kevin Costner.

202
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
 Kevin Costner's like, "No, no, I got a movie tomorrow.

203
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
 Doesn't matter.

204
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
 Punch, punch, punch."

205
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,520
 Cal Ripkins punching him.

206
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,880
 Kevin Costner is crawling out of the house.

207
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,120
 I'll show you a tin cup.

208
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
 He just happened to have a tin cup.

209
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
 He picks up a tin cup.

210
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,800
 He's throwing it at Kevin Costner.

211
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,320
 Anyways, the point is that Cal Ripkin beat up Kevin Costner and then he called up his

212
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,040
 coach and goes, "I can't play tonight."

213
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,760
 Coach is like, "Why not?

214
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
 We need you in the game."

215
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,480
 And your world record.

216
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
 We don't want it to break.

217
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,720
 Like, sure, you've beaten Luke Garreg, but we want to make the record even longer.

218
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
 We want to make it even longer.

219
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,880
 And Cal Ripkin's like, "I can't.

220
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
 Listen to what happened.

221
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,720
 I came home, squeaky bed, Kevin Costner, tin cup."

222
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,080
 And the coach is like, "Say no more.

223
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
 Say no more."

224
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,480
 I can pick up those phrases.

225
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,120
 The visual is in my mind.

226
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
 Coach goes, "Tell you what.

227
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
 I'll take care of it."

228
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,480
 And so later that night, the lights wouldn't work.

229
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
 The game was cold.

230
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,720
 And he played a double header.

231
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,280
 Cal Ripkin Jr. played a double header the next day.

232
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,880
 His record stayed intact.

233
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:10,080
 He actually ended up playing a total of 2,632 games in a row.

234
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,200
 Luke Garreg's record was only 2,131 games.

235
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,600
 So he just blew it out of the water.

236
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,760
 That's the conspiracy theory.

237
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,920
 And it's a really interesting one, except for the fact it's 100% not true at all.

238
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,440
 This is a really, I actually really love this conspiracy theory.

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,680
 Because back then, and probably still today, but I remember as a kid, Kevin Costner had

240
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,040
 a huge reputation as being a womanizer.

241
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,160
 He's constantly sleeping around.

242
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,880
 So he's the perfect foil for this story.

243
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,160
 And Cal Ripkin and Kevin Costner were friends.

244
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,200
 And there are photos of Kevin Costner and Cal Ripkin's wife.

245
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,400
 And Cal Ripkin and his wife had some marital difficulties around that time.

246
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,360
 So you have all the elements of this.

247
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
 There's a key problem with this story.

248
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,080
 Cal Ripkin was at that game.

249
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,560
 Cal Ripkin was 100% at that game.

250
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
 This story is huge.

251
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,440
 This isn't some weird conspiracy theory that's floating out there.

252
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,560
 Where it is, well it is.

253
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,320
 But this is addressed in like sports media.

254
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
 Cal Ripkin was there.

255
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,040
 He goes, he's done interviews about it.

256
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,360
 He goes, I was at that game.

257
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,280
 He goes, there's footage of me coming out of the dugout and looking at the lights.

258
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
 He goes, I was there.

259
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,800
 I was trying to help figure it out as well.

260
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
 He was the main guy, he's the main electrician.

261
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,040
 He puts away his bat and ball, grabs his electrician belt.

262
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,160
 He's like, I'll take care of this.

263
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
 He's there.

264
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,720
 He's on footage of being there at that game.

265
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:50,600
 Now you could say, Jason, maybe he did show up, but he also beat up Kevin Costner.

266
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,240
 And then he just showed up a little bit late.

267
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
 Maybe but doubtful.

268
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,440
 It's not going to be one of those things where you're going to say, boss I can't come into

269
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,440
 work, but I can come and just sit there in case anyone starts a rumor later on, I'll

270
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,240
 sit there and be really sad in the dugout.

271
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
 That doesn't work.

272
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,880
 The idea was that he couldn't leave his wife, he was so heartbroken, he just had to stay

273
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,720
 there and process everything.

274
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,360
 I'll just go there and sit in the dugout.

275
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,800
 And the story was, he didn't show up at all.

276
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,440
 There's video footage of him there.

277
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,200
 But this rumor, even though we have physical evidence that this story is not real, this

278
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:34,400
 rumor is so pervasive in 2001, in June of 2001, Fox Sports Radio told this story.

279
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 They reported it.

280
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
 It was a couple of years later.

281
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,880
 They're like, Hey, Barry, did you hear about that thing with Kevin Costner banging Cal Ripken's

282
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
 wife?

283
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
 No, Joe, what happened?

284
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,880
 Well, he gave her the old postman into her water world.

285
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,760
 And they're like, Arrrrg, no, no, no, no, no.

286
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
 Sound effects.

287
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
 It's only a step.

288
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,840
 It's only a step down from what I do.

289
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,920
 They just have better sound effect board.

290
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,640
 Kevin Costner called him up the next day and threatened to decapitate both of them.

291
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,920
 He threatened to take their heads off.

292
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,520
 Kevin Costner, star of four movies, only four.

293
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,120
 He threatened to chop their heads off.

294
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,360
 So it's definitely a really touchy subject.

295
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,680
 I mean, if you find my body, if you go to Jason Farms, my body is being devoured by the hogs

296
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,600
 and my head is missing.

297
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,960
 I don't assume the hogs ate my head.

298
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,760
 Assume that Kevin Costner has it on a mantle somewhere and he's sitting there drinking

299
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,760
 wine, drinking wine out of a tin cup.

300
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,480
 Renee Russo dressed all sexy standing next to him and he goes, That's what you get for

301
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,760
 spreading the rumor, Jason Carpenter.

302
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
 That's what you get.

303
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,480
 That's him drinking wine.

304
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
 He makes that noise.

305
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,600
 He has a little sippy cup, but it's made of tin.

306
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,440
 You know who else likes taking off heads?

307
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
 Your woman?

308
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,560
 I don't know who she does, but she has a sword.

309
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,040
 Superman got killed.

310
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,000
 He got stabbed.

311
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,200
 And then the earth was like, aww, they cried.

312
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,960
 They all made a big baby noise at the same time.

313
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,960
 And across the universe, a bad guy goes, Yes, now is my time.

314
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,040
 That guy's name is Darkseid and him, along with Granny Goodness, are headed to earth to

315
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
 destroy us all.

316
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,480
 It's up to the Justice League to fight back.

317
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,160
 That's Batman.

318
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,560
 And Wonder Woman shows up.

319
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,280
 She's shot people's heads off.

320
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,480
 And then the Flash and Aquaman and then maybe some other dudes show up.

321
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,040
 And then Darkseid shows up and he has his arms crossed and he's shaking his head.

322
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,960
 And he goes, Uh, uh, uh, this is my planet now.

323
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,080
 Is it?

324
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
 Find out.

325
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,800
 March 18th people are like, I'm not watching this movie because of these ridiculous problems.

326
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,240
 March 18th available only on HBO Max.

327
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,880
 Watch Zack Snyder's Justice League rated R.

328
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,240
 I can't wait to watch this movie.

329
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,960
 I can't wait to watch this movie.

330
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,160
 I'm really excited for it.

331
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,600
 I've been excited for it for years.

332
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,960
 I'm a huge Zack Snyder fan.

333
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,160
 I already have my little score sheet.

334
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,240
 Wonder Woman shop off.

335
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,840
 It's rated R. So maybe it's a lot.

336
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,280
 But I'm super excited for it.

337
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,920
 I hope you guys watch it as well.

338
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,000
 Justice, Zack Snyder is very important.

339
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,640
 Is Zack Snyder's Justice League?

340
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
 I actually watched the first one in theater.

341
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
 It was decent.

342
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
 It wasn't great.

343
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,280
 It was better than in game.

344
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,560
 Squeeze God, let's go ahead and leave behind Baltimore, Maryland.

345
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,960
 We are headed out to New York.

346
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,560
 And squeeze God as we're flying out there, I want you to go ahead and hit that time travel

347
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
 button.

348
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,640
 We're traveling back in time to the time when the indigenous people of the continent

349
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,680
 ruled the land.

350
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,880
 And when we're in the area that will become New York, we're hanging out and we start to

351
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,320
 hear stories of the stone coats or the stone clad, different tribes to different names

352
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
 for them.

353
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,400
 But what they were were they were 12 foot tall warriors with skin made of stone.

354
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,520
 Some of the stories actually say they were simply wearing armor.

355
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,920
 But it doesn't matter if you're trying to kill this guy with a bow.

356
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,000
 If you're trying to shoot arrows at this guy and they're bouncing off of him as he's getting

357
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,400
 ready to club you in their brain, you're like, hmm, the distinction between why these arrows

358
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,000
 aren't working is very, very important.

359
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,080
 It was just bashing your head in.

360
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,440
 No human weapons work against these creatures.

361
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,520
 They live in cold areas and they love to eat human flesh.

362
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,160
 Now as you moved farther north, these guys started to be known as windegos.

363
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,880
 And just like the windego legend, some people believed that the stone clad were humans who

364
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,880
 had committed evil acts, namely cannibalism, and turned into these monsters.

365
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,680
 That's not really a punishment, right?

366
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,880
 Someone's like, don't eat human flesh.

367
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,520
 You're going to turn into a 12 foot impossible to kill man.

368
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
 You're like, what?

369
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,120
 I'm totally, I'm going to eat all the flesh now.

370
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,040
 I'm going to eat your flesh just because you told me that story.

371
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,160
 No, it's not a punishment.

372
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,360
 The Iroquois, that's kind of the version the Iroquois have of them are just these giant

373
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
 warriors.

374
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,360
 The Iroquois natives also had a version of them.

375
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,320
 Pretty much the same thing.

376
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
 You could only defeat them though.

377
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,000
 These guys actually had a named weakness.

378
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,840
 You could defeat them by stealing their powers or exposing them to a menstruating woman.

379
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,160
 So just bring a bunch of those along.

380
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,160
 Just have a bunch of them and then you can eat them afterwards and become a monster yourself.

381
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,000
 We covered a story, I don't remember which story it was.

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,520
 We covered a story not too long ago where like the menstruating woman, the monsters tried

383
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,360
 to raiding the indigenous people's tribe and then they just put a bunch of menstruating

384
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,680
 women by the river and the monsters are like, ah, no way.

385
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
 We're headed over this way.

386
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,600
 We're headed to the tribe where all the dudes hang out.

387
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,360
 We're going to eat them.

388
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,640
 So that's not only in this legend, but we do see that menstrual, I bet you didn't know

389
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
 that.

390
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,400
 You learn something every single day, menstrual fluid can be used as a weapon against a particular

391
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,520
 species.

392
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,080
 So always carry some with you.

393
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,640
 Carry a little jar of it.

394
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:09,560
 The Seneca tribe has a legend about what happens when a human actually encounters a stoneclad.

395
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,640
 So squeeze after that little introduction, land this carbonicopter.

396
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,480
 We are on the outskirts of a tribe in ancient America.

397
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,760
 There was a young man standing there with his wife and he's getting his weapons ready

398
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
 to go.

399
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,800
 He is a hunter like everyone else in his tribe.

400
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,560
 We're going to call him Joey and he's standing there and he goes, you know, it's really cool

401
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,560
 hunting with you guys and stuff like that, but I kind of want to eat.

402
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
 He's super skinny.

403
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,960
 He's like, you kind of want to eat.

404
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,160
 The problem is we are all hunting the same thing.

405
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,720
 Sure we get to like share elk and moose and whatever else we're shooting, but I want to

406
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,240
 eat more and I want to get really good game and I want to be a better hunter.

407
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,480
 So I'm actually going to head up north and I'm going to go hunt there and people are

408
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,800
 like, dude, you can't do that.

409
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,240
 The reason why we hunt in this area and not up north is because that is where the stone

410
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
 clads live.

411
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,960
 And he goes, yeah, I hear all this stuff about the stone clads and I believe they exist,

412
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,280
 but think about it.

413
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,920
 They only eat humans, right?

414
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,800
 Everyone's like, yeah, that's why we don't go up there.

415
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,760
 He's like, but follow me on this.

416
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,200
 If they only eat humans and there's no humans living up there, the game must be dope, dude.

417
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,720
 There must be like giant elk.

418
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,940
 Hopefully they're not made of rock too, but you know, there'd be like lots of deer.

419
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,120
 No one's hunting these things.

420
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,680
 So I'm going to go up there.

421
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,560
 They're like, dude, that's the stupidest plan.

422
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,040
 He goes, you will see.

423
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,480
 You guys will see.

424
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,080
 He gets his wife, we'll call her Monica.

425
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,520
 He's like, Monica, I want you to come with me.

426
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,920
 He goes, are you menstruating?

427
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,240
 She's like, I do it once a month and he's like, good.

428
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,160
 Well, plan it for that month just in case.

429
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,400
 So they head up north.

430
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,160
 They make camp.

431
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,280
 He goes to hunt and he was right.

432
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,400
 The game is amazing.

433
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,680
 He has all these dead elk.

434
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
 He's shooting moose.

435
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
 He's shooting animals.

436
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
 He didn't even know he existed.

437
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,720
 He's shooting Komodo dragons and pterodactyls.

438
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,800
 No one else hunts up here, but his wife's back at camp and his wife is just hanging out

439
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,300
 and a stone woman shows up.

440
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,400
 So she bounces.

441
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,800
 She's out of there and she goes down river and she tells her husband, hey, you remember

442
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,080
 that whole thing about you saying you could totally kill these giant monsters that eat

443
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
 humans?

444
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,480
 The dude's like, yeah, is this how she's from side to side?

445
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
 He's like, oh, I really didn't think those guys existed.

446
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,520
 She's like, one of them just showed up in my camp.

447
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,440
 So we got to do something about these things.

448
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
 I get it.

449
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,360
 We're going to eat like kings out here, but they made us.

450
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,400
 So Joey sits there and he sharpens his hatchet.

451
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
 Sharps his knife.

452
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,600
 And he sharpens his wit.

453
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,520
 He's just reading detective novels.

454
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,800
 He's like, oh, Sherlock Holmes.

455
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,000
 Because he knows to fight these guys, he's going to have to outthink them.

456
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
 He sets a big bonfire.

457
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,560
 He wants to draw attention to himself.

458
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,320
 He's basically puffing his chest up.

459
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
 He puts on a puppet show.

460
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,880
 He puts on a puppet show with a bunch of dead elk.

461
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,280
 Hey, everybody, I heard the stoneclad suck.

462
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,360
 Oh yeah, they're totally lame.

463
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,240
 And throughout this whole production, it's like a trilogy.

464
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
 He does this full on director's cut.

465
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,160
 He has the extended director's cut of how much the stoneclads suck in the musical.

466
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,800
 Eventually a stoneclad is standing across the river and he's like, uh-uh-uh.

467
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,880
 We don't suck.

468
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
 You suck.

469
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,400
 Well, we do suck.

470
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,960
 We suck the marrow out of your bones because I'm a giant cannibal.

471
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,680
 And Joey goes, hey, okay, come over here, bro.

472
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
 Let's fight.

473
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,000
 So according to this legend, I love this part, according to this legend, the stoneclad warrior

474
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 is looking around.

475
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,440
 There's a big river separating him and Joey.

476
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,040
 The stoneclad warrior starts to walk into the water.

477
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,520
 And Joey's like, oh crap.

478
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,160
 I was hoping, I knew he didn't have a boat.

479
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,960
 I was hoping he'd be like, I'll be back in three days as I walk around the river.

480
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,280
 No, he's a giant and he's apparently able to breathe underwater.

481
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,440
 He starts walking into the river until eventually the water covers his head.

482
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
 And Joey's like, uh-uh-uh.

483
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,360
 But then he had sharpened his wit and he remembered that a tree had fallen down across the river.

484
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
 That's a big tree.

485
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,840
 Maybe it's a small river.

486
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
 I don't know.

487
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,720
 He runs down to the tree, crosses the tree bridge, and then runs along the other side

488
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
 of the river.

489
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,360
 And as the stoneclad comes out of the river, now Joey's standing on the opposite side and

490
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,840
 he goes, dude.

491
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,560
 Did you get turned around underneath there?

492
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
 And the stoneclad's like, what?

493
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
 What are you looking at?

494
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,640
 He's seeing a smoldering fire pit.

495
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
 He sees all these elk puppets.

496
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,200
 But he turns around and Joey's on the other side of the river.

497
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,800
 Joey's like, dude, you got turned around.

498
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,960
 Like I thought you were going to fight me.

499
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
 Are you scared?

500
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
 Ugh.

501
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,800
 The stone giant turns, walks under the river, and right when his head goes under the river,

502
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:42,280
 Joey runs back to the tree, crosses again, and then standing back by the time the stoneclad

503
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,640
 gets to the other side of the river.

504
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,200
 And now Joey's back on his original side.

505
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,320
 He's like, dude, come on, man.

506
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 What is going on down there?

507
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
 Is there like a whirlpool?

508
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,320
 There are a bunch of mermaids, a bunch of sirens turkeying you?

509
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
 What?

510
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,560
 Yeah, dude, I'm right here.

511
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,720
 This goes, according to legend, this one happened several times.

512
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,040
 The guy kept trying to cross the river.

513
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,520
 Joey just ran to the opposite side.

514
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,960
 This happened multiple times.

515
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,760
 Then eventually, according to this legend, Joey goes, okay, I'm done for this.

516
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,960
 Like this was super funny, but it's really not a tactic.

517
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,240
 Like eventually, I'm going to get tired or I'm going to fall off the bridge and I'm

518
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,960
 floating down the river and he's just going to grab me.

519
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,800
 At this point, the stonecoat walks out and Joey's standing there and Joey's like, finally.

520
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,520
 The stonecoat's ready to smash this dude's head in a putty.

521
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,880
 And Joey's holding up his hatchet and he's kind of like making it look super mysterious.

522
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,720
 He has like a silk blanket over it.

523
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,360
 He's like, what's under here?

524
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,360
 Dance of the Seven Veils.

525
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,640
 To the point that the stonecoat goes, I've never seen one of those.

526
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
 What is that?

527
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
 Can I see it?

528
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
 Then he goes, oh, this is a hatchet.

529
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
 And he hands it to the stoneclad.

530
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,080
 And the stoneclad takes the hatchet and he runs his finger along the blade and he goes,

531
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,840
 hmm, interesting.

532
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
 We don't need these.

533
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,560
 We just rip people's heads open with our teeth and hands.

534
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,200
 I haven't seen something like this.

535
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:02,000
 And as he's running his finger along the edge of the hatchet, he's actually sharpening it.

536
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,680
 He hands the hatchet back to Joey and he goes, show me what you can do with this.

537
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,720
 Joey takes the hatchet and swings it and smashes it into rock.

538
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,920
 The rock splits in half.

539
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,880
 The stonecoat goes, oh, that's what I'm made out of.

540
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,680
 That rock is what I made out of.

541
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,400
 Maybe you humans can kill us.

542
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,760
 We've eaten a bunch of you over the decades.

543
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
 But this is weird.

544
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,960
 We've never seen anyone smash a rock open.

545
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
 Tell you what.

546
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
 Tell you what.

547
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,240
 I'm going to go home and I'm going to tell my people to stay away from you.

548
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,000
 And you can hunt this elk and you don't have to worry about us eating you.

549
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,440
 And Joey goes, that sounds like a great idea.

550
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
 That sounds like a good con.

551
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
 I don't even compromise.

552
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,960
 That's just Joey getting whatever he wants.

553
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,520
 And then the stonecoat goes, how do I get back home?

554
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,960
 And then Joey tricks him 100 more times underwater.

555
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,440
 No, he just lets Stoneclad walk under the river and go back home.

556
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,000
 And for a while, everything is fine.

557
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,560
 They don't go back to the tribe.

558
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,080
 They're just enjoying all this hunting.

559
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,120
 They're all just, everything is just meat.

560
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,600
 Everything is just super yummy.

561
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,280
 They're devouring the entire forest.

562
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,760
 And then one day a stone woman shows up at the camp and she's like, oh, she sounds just

563
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
 like the dude.

564
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,560
 She sounds exactly like the dude.

565
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,000
 The stone woman goes, Joey, Joey of the forest.

566
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,920
 I have heard tales of your bravery.

567
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,320
 I heard about her one time you smashed a rock.

568
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
 I need your help.

569
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,960
 And Joey goes, okay, what's going on?

570
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,640
 She goes, listen, me and my husband are having a fight right now.

571
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,040
 And eventually we're going to murder each other.

572
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,360
 And Joey's like, what?

573
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,200
 That's a horrible story.

574
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
 And she's like, I know it's quite terrible.

575
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
 But I'm also very lucky.

576
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,960
 She's like, sounds very lucky if you're about to get murdered.

577
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,680
 And she's like, no, no, no, I will bring you luck.

578
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,760
 I bring myself bad luck.

579
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,960
 But if you hang out with me, you'll get even more game.

580
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,760
 You'll get even more deer than you could possibly ever eat.

581
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,440
 But when my husband shows up to murder me, you must help me.

582
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
 He goes, that's fine.

583
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
 I'll totally do that.

584
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,960
 He's afraid of hatchets, right?

585
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,640
 And she's like, he doesn't know what a hatchet is.

586
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,840
 But for a time, she's hanging out with him in the woods and even more deer, even more.

587
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,360
 But what are they doing with all this meat?

588
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,400
 I guess they were probably turning it into jerky.

589
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,240
 They have to invent the canning industry just to be able to put all this stuff in 10 cups.

590
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,280
 Kevin Costner is like, hey, everybody.

591
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,640
 This episode's gone on way too long.

592
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,320
 I'm starting to lose my mind.

593
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,640
 He's hunting with the stoneclad woman.

594
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
 Even more animals are showing up.

595
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
 He's getting the most game.

596
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,520
 But one day everyone's sitting back at the base camp.

597
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:37,000
 The base camp is now just beef jerky everywhere and they see the stoneclad man, her husband,

598
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 moving through the forest.

599
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,760
 And she goes, this is it.

600
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,960
 This is it.

601
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,160
 Now is the time for you to help me in this fight.

602
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,560
 Now, I'm going to give you a little hint on how to kill us, which is good.

603
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,200
 Because even though he was able to pull that trick with that axe, could that axe have actually

604
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,760
 killed the stoneclad?

605
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,240
 She goes, we have a weakness.

606
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,320
 It's being poked with fire, being poked with a sharp, fiery stick.

607
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,800
 So we're going to fight.

608
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,120
 And if I kill him, that's totally dope.

609
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,560
 We'll have a celebratory dinner.

610
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
 I'll eat Monica and we'll sneak away together.

611
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,440
 And he's like, I don't know about that.

612
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
 She goes, OK.

613
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,360
 She goes, if I kill him, then I'll leave and your debt is repaid.

614
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,520
 But if he is about to kill me, if I'm on the ground and he's standing over me, take a fire

615
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,760
 brand, take a hot stick, take a hot stick out of the fire and jab it into his abdomen.

616
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,920
 And it'll actually go right through our stone armor and drop him on the spot.

617
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,400
 And eventually, the stoneclad husband gets there.

618
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,600
 And he looks at his wife.

619
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,720
 And his wife looks at the husband.

620
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,200
 The husband looks at Joey.

621
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,400
 Joey looks at a squirrel walking by.

622
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,840
 He's like, oh, I'm supposed to pay attention to this fight.

623
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,600
 The stoneclad woman and her husband both tear trees out of the ground and just start swinging

624
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 them.

625
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,280
 Oh, oh, just smashing them into each other.

626
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
 Just hitting each other with these giant trees.

627
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,800
 Because Bounce Monica is gone, she's like, I'm going to watch this from this cliff.

628
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,880
 Joey's standing there.

629
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,120
 And unfortunately, the stoneclad man really starts to get some blows into this stoneclad

630
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,760
 wife.

631
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,200
 And she falls to the ground and her log rolls into the river.

632
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
 No.

633
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,200
 The husband stands over with this tree ready to bring it down upon her.

634
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:21,120
 And Joey grabs the fire brand out of the pit and drives it into the stoneclad man.

635
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,080
 Oh.

636
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,440
 Stoneclad man dies.

637
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,920
 You think that would be the end of the legend, right?

638
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,040
 I mean, I don't know what the moral of that story is.

639
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,960
 It's a bunch of weird, conflicting things.

640
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
 But that's not the end of it.

641
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,840
 The woman pushes her dead husband away and she goes, perfect.

642
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
 Thank you.

643
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
 Do you have anything to eat?

644
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
 That took a lot of energy.

645
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
 Do you have anything to eat?

646
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,880
 And luckily, Monica's gone.

647
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,160
 And the stoneclad woman goes, I'll go find someone else.

648
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,960
 But thank you so much for saving my life.

649
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,840
 And you got one more mission, Joey.

650
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,400
 Remember when you showed up and you smashed the rock and everyone left?

651
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,720
 He's like, yeah, I do remember that.

652
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,160
 She goes, when everyone left, one of our people left their kid here.

653
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
 You need to raise him.

654
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
 He's like, what?

655
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,560
 That wasn't part of the agreement.

656
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
 You're going to help me hunt.

657
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
 I was going to kill your husband.

658
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
 Now I'm a dad.

659
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,600
 Now I'm a dad of a giant cannibal.

660
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,840
 She goes, you got to do it.

661
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,160
 Because you're the one who pushed us out of the area in the first place.

662
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
 And he was like, yeah, that kind of makes sense.

663
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,200
 So she said he's up on a cliff.

664
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
 He's like, what?

665
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
 How old is this kid?

666
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
 He's like 18 years old.

667
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,640
 Like who leaves a kid on a cliff?

668
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,320
 Eventually Joey and Monica meet back up and they go through the woods to this cliff and

669
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,440
 a kid.

670
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,120
 Like I imagine him like the rockbiter, like the little baby from Neverending Story 3 is

671
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,160
 swinging on a swing between two trees on the edge of a cliff.

672
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
 And this kid's giant.

673
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,240
 I mean, sure he's not the full 12 feet, but he's this giant guy.

674
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,440
 So Joey goes, okay, the only way I can get him down and this is going to be super dangerous,

675
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
 but not for me.

676
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,280
 It's going to be super dangerous for him.

677
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,160
 I'm going to chop the trees down that he's swinging from and then he'll just kind of

678
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,660
 fall to the ground.

679
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,880
 It is on the edge of a cliff.

680
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,400
 So it's pretty dicey, but what else is he going to do?

681
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:14,000
 So Joey chop, chop, chop, chop, chops the trees down and they say the boy actually like

682
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,600
 swings, he's swinging, right?

683
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,000
 He's on a swing.

684
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,360
 And then he goes, he just swings down.

685
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,120
 He's still doing the back and forth motion like he's on a swing, but he's like hovering,

686
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
 almost like a leaf falling.

687
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,520
 And they said he's singing the whole time.

688
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,280
 And then finally he gets to the bottom of the cliff and he's like, ah, Joey's like,

689
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,800
 dang it, now I got to climb down this cliff.

690
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,080
 They take the boy back to the village at this point.

691
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,920
 He's like, I can't raise this kid by myself.

692
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,920
 And like they always say it takes a village.

693
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,480
 He just wants to raise the kid.

694
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,320
 He's hoping someone else will adopt it.

695
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,640
 He takes the kid back to the village.

696
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,680
 He shows back up with all of this meat, all of this fur and everyone's like, dude, everyone's

697
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,720
 clapping, everyone's giving him a round of applause.

698
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,240
 Everyone's like, he did it.

699
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,880
 Everyone's like, oh, we didn't think you could do it.

700
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
 Everyone shows up.

701
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,440
 Kevin Costner's ghost is standing there.

702
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,360
 His blue ghost is like giving him a thumbs up and Joey gives him a thumbs up as well

703
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,680
 and the ghost fades away.

704
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,400
 This was a successful mission.

705
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,480
 The problem is, is that he brought a giant cannibal baby back to the tribe and the baby's

706
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,840
 like, me want to play, me want to play.

707
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,000
 And he's playing with the other kids and he's instantly killing them.

708
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 He's like, that's my Bob-O.

709
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,680
 The dude gets his arms ripped off.

710
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
 Let's play tag.

711
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
 I'm it.

712
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,440
 And he's like touching people in the back and their spines were disintegrating.

713
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,720
 He was so strong.

714
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,360
 They said every kid he played with died on the spot.

715
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,000
 And all he wanted to do was play.

716
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,480
 Let's play hide and seek.

717
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,040
 He's pulling their eyes out.

718
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
 He's not jigsaw.

719
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
 He doesn't know.

720
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,040
 He's not like trying to come up with ironic punishments.

721
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,520
 He's not doing that.

722
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,800
 But eventually Joey's like, okay, I came back as a hero, but this is quickly turning me into

723
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,040
 the villain of my tribe.

724
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:03,560
 He sends message back for the stoneclad woman who he saved and he goes, dude, you gotta

725
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
 pick your kid up.

726
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,840
 He's murdering everyone in my tribe.

727
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,520
 Eventually the stoneclad woman shows up and picks the kid up and the baby's like, we

728
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
 see you later daddy.

729
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,960
 And the daddy's like, sure, baby.

730
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,120
 They didn't even bother to name it.

731
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
 Sure, baby.

732
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,360
 We'll see you soon.

733
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,600
 And once the baby leaves, they're like, move, move the tribe, move the tribe.

734
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
 Let's go.

735
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
 Let's go.

736
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,800
 That's one of the stories about the stoneclad, a race of people who are impenetrable to weapons

737
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 and aid human flesh.

738
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,240
 I think it's an interesting story.

739
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,680
 There's really no moral to it.

740
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,200
 Don't bring strange kids home.

741
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,680
 Help women in need.

742
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,720
 Help them murder their husbands.

743
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
 What would be another moral?

744
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,480
 Oh, if someone ever tells you don't go in that area at Super Dangerous, go there anyways.

745
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,280
 You'll probably kill a bunch of animals.

746
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,760
 You're showing up at the zoo with a rifle.

747
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,080
 They're like, sir, don't go in there.

748
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,480
 That lion cage is Super Dangerous.

749
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,080
 You're like, I know, I heard this story on Dead Rabbit Radio.

750
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,560
 They're like, no.

751
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,080
 Pull our bears sneaking up behind you.

752
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,680
 You somehow come to the lion cage first.

753
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,200
 But I think this episode is interesting for another reason.

754
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
 We're going to wrap it up like this.

755
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
 We're running a little long.

756
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,920
 On yesterday's episode, I talked about this might seem like a leap of logic, but stay

757
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
 with me.

758
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,840
 Yesterday's episode, I talked about an alien spaceship crashing and the survivor living

759
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,640
 on his own and trying to complete his mission of scientific experimentation using old timey

760
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,120
 tools, which I thought was a really creepy visual.

761
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,840
 But when I was saying that, I actually already had the ending for this episode in mind.

762
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,320
 That was kind of an improv ending I came up with on the spot.

763
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,160
 But this episode, I kind of went in when I was prepping it with this ending.

764
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,160
 So it's a little similar, but it's interesting nonetheless.

765
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,280
 I think this idea that we have of ancient aliens, when you look at stories of aliens

766
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,360
 coming down and helping humanity, build pyramids, build the Nazca lines and stuff like that.

767
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,320
 A lot of that stuff has been debunked, but I'll put a really cool YouTube video in the

768
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,720
 show notes you guys can check out.

769
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,920
 If you want more information on that.

770
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,880
 But even if you're not looking at the big stuff like Nazca lines or the pyramids or

771
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,560
 Goblet Tepeke or any of those things, the idea of ancient aliens coming down and interacting

772
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:09,520
 with humans, it's always this idea of these gods in their spacecraft.

773
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,600
 They come down, they help us out, genetically engineer us, whatever they're doing, and then

774
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,880
 they leave.

775
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,080
 Or they still visit Earth, whatever version of the story you're looking at.

776
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:24,560
 But what would be more likely is a single ship, not an entire culture, a single ship

777
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,880
 crash landing on Earth.

778
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,880
 And those survivors would crawl out of that ship and go, "There's no way we're getting

779
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,520
 off this planet."

780
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,280
 This was our interstellar vehicle, it's completely demolished.

781
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,080
 We need to make the best of it.

782
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,920
 And we have human parallels of that on this planet.

783
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,080
 Shipwrecks.

784
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,880
 People crash on a deserted island and they go, "We're not going to get rescued.

785
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,320
 Let's start setting up a society."

786
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,040
 Let's Robinson Caruso this.

787
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,560
 Let's do this.

788
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,120
 So you don't have these wonders of technology.

789
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,000
 You don't have these backup ships that can come.

790
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,960
 You don't have these anti-grab rays that can build these giant structures.

791
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,560
 You just have 30 people from another planet who are crashed on this Earth.

792
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,640
 And they have the technology they can salvage out of their ship.

793
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,800
 Which would be things like their suits.

794
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,920
 So they have body armor that are impenetrable to human weapons.

795
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,280
 We actually covered a story not too long ago about a bunch of Russian soldiers.

796
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,720
 They find an island, they go into this base, and they massacre all the grays.

797
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,680
 There was a bunch of giants working at these control panels and the bullets were just bouncing off of them.

798
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,000
 I'll put that in the show notes.

799
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,480
 So you have that.

800
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,600
 The fact that they're locked into a particular region, they're always in cold areas, could

801
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,040
 be that this particular race of aliens needs to be in cold areas.

802
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,400
 It's interesting because we have all these different tribes in the same region have these

803
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,000
 stories of cannibalistic giants.

804
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,080
 My theory is with this story is that a ship crash landed in the Northeastern United States

805
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,440
 and they're trying to rebuild their society.

806
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,000
 Now were they eating humans?

807
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,880
 Was that actually a component of it?

808
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
 Maybe I don't know.

809
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,760
 I don't know what you're listening to, guys, are all the questions.

810
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,200
 The story is that they eat people so maybe they did.

811
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,600
 Maybe this race of aliens just love to eat people.

812
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,520
 But I think it's an interesting story because when we hear about these tribes that seem to

813
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,160
 be completely outside all of human evolution seem to be completely outside all of the other

814
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,880
 groups in the area.

815
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
 It could be a myth.

816
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,320
 It could be a group of warriors where they happen to be 6 feet tall and the legend grew

817
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,840
 and grew until they became 12 feet tall and they used to wear some different type of armor

818
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,080
 and people turned the legend into them having impenetrable skin.

819
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
 That's possible too.

820
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,640
 That's the most likely scenario.

821
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,180
 But I like the idea of a ship crash landing castaways on our planet and they do their best

822
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
 to survive.

823
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,440
 They move away from human population centers.

824
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,120
 And when humans do come in the area they see them as a threat and they kill them on the

825
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
 spot.

826
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,720
 But they do their best to try to not be a part of our world.

827
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,800
 So while ancient astronaut theorists believe that aliens would be viewed as gods, coming

828
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,240
 down from the sky in their vehicles, helping humanity on its journey, it could be the opposite.

829
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,900
 It could be a single crashed ship and the survivors were considered monsters that you

830
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,060
 had to stay away from.

831
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:34,340
 Underneath thousands of years of soil somewhere in the northeastern United States may be the

832
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,700
 wreckage of a ship.

833
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,580
 Its power cells long depleted.

834
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,900
 It's been invaded by roots and worms.

835
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,900
 And it sits there silent in the dark.

836
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,560
 It was built for interstellar travel.

837
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,460
 It crashed on the planet earth.

838
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:02,340
 And its survivors lasted as long as they could until they also eventually perished and ended

839
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,960
 up under the soil.

840
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,400
 All that remains of their story is a legend that the tribes in the area would tell each
