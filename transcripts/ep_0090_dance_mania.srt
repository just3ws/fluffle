00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 Today we take a look at the mysterious case of Jonathan Luna and then we explore the mysterious

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,400
 plague that spread across countries and centuries and it made people dance themselves to death

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:25,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,840
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,360
 I'm having a great day for the sake of the opening.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,600
 The sinus infection has really beaten me up.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,720
 I'm having to stay hydrated.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,000
 I think that's what's causing it.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I got dehydrated.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,400
 I actually had some complications over the weekend and had to go to the emergency room

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,760
 but I'm doing better now.

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,760
 I got some antibiotics.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,880
 My face is still kind of swollen up but yeah.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,560
 I mean I guess other than that I'm having a great day but I really do hope you guys

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
 are having a great day too.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,080
 Let's go ahead and get started here.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,240
 So the first thing I want to talk about is the case of Jonathan Luna.

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,240
 Now this is a really weird one because you think the story is going in one direction

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,920
 and then it just kind of stops.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,920
 It's bizarre.

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,840
 So I read about this a while back.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,800
 I don't think I read about it when it first happened but it was around then.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,640
 This started in 2003.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,720
 I remember hearing about it years and years and years before now but I was reminded of

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,000
 it recently and I was like "I wonder what's going on with that?"

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,600
 So Jonathan Luna was this young district attorney.

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,760
 He was assistant district attorney in Baltimore.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,640
 He was working on a drug case and he was working on a plea deal for these two defendants.

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,600
 So he's like "Okay, let's just go ahead and give him a plea bargain and let's just give

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,080
 this over with and move on to the next one."

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
 It's 2003.

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,120
 It's December 3rd and at 11 o'clock he calls up his wife and he's like "Hey honey, I'm

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
 going to be headed home."

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,120
 And she's like "Okay good."

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,000
 He leaves the office.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,800
 We know he leaves the office at 11.38.

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:01,680
 The next time he's really seen is at a gas station at 3.30 in the morning.

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
 And he walks in the gas station.

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,920
 He buys some water, soda.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
 He buys two tanks of gas which is kind of weird because I don't know what he would have done

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
 with the other tank because he only has one car.

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,760
 But anyways, he appears to be in good spirits.

44
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,600
 People in the gas station don't really notice anything odd about him.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,160
 He leaves the gas station at 5.30 the next morning in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,640
 So this is 95 miles away from his office in Baltimore.

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,760
 People notice a car is kind of like halfway in a creek, a little small creek, little bubbling

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
 water.

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,080
 So of course you know they're like "Oh, my department of cars and let's call the police."

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,360
 They call the police.

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,280
 Police show up and they see the car.

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
 That's not the car.

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,400
 It's the water by the car.

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,360
 And then they notice there's a body in the water.

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
 Half in the water, half out.

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,360
 Cops are like "Damn it.

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
 It's Monday."

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,880
 They just want it to be slow Monday.

59
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,080
 They go in and they retrieve the body.

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,800
 And they obviously do an ID and they're going through his wallet and they find that it is

61
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,160
 Jonathan Luna, assistant district attorney in Baltimore.

62
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,800
 So they're like "Ugh."

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,320
 Obviously they know it's going to be a big case at this point.

64
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,440
 It's going to be a, what are they called?

65
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,360
 I think they're called a blue ball.

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,720
 I think that's what they're called.

67
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,240
 It's just a high profile case.

68
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,840
 You have a public government official dead.

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
 And obviously everyone's like "Is this connected to a case he was working on?

70
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
 Is someone getting revenge for something else?"

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,720
 It was weird that he was 95 miles away from where he was supposed to be, but they start

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
 working the case.

73
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,880
 What they do is they find $200 in cash on him.

74
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,840
 They find blood in the back seat.

75
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,000
 They find blood in the back seat.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
 They find blood in the driver's seat.

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,840
 They find blood along the fender of the car.

78
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,040
 They find blood on a little toll ticket, which is weird because the car had an easy pass system

79
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,520
 which is able to electronically pay for toll roads.

80
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
 And cops are like "Ugh."

81
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,160
 I mean like this is going to be a weird case, obviously.

82
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,080
 They start examining the body.

83
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,640
 He died from having water in his lungs.

84
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,120
 So he drowned.

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,840
 However, he also had 36 wounds, 36 total stab wounds on his body.

86
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,560
 His hands were so badly stabbed that when they ended up burying the body they had to

87
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,600
 put gloves on him to keep everything together and to not be like totally gross.

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,240
 He had stabs to the neck, slashes to the neck.

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,160
 He got stabbed in the scrotum a couple times.

90
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,320
 It's pretty intense.

91
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,240
 And he also had stab wounds in the back, like between his shoulder blades.

92
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,360
 Looked like he was having a struggle.

93
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,880
 He was defending it with his hands.

94
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
 He got stabbed in the back.

95
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,040
 He got stabbed in the dick.

96
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,320
 He got stabbed in the throat.

97
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,640
 Eventually he fell in the water and drowned.

98
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,800
 Now the coroner looked at all that and he said "Okay, cause of death is he drowned,

99
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,120
 but he has all these stab wounds.

100
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,840
 We're going to list at his foul play."

101
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,920
 They started looking, retracing his steps.

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,400
 So one of the first things they realized was that in his office he had left his cell phone

103
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,600
 and his glasses, which he needed to drive.

104
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,520
 So they're like "Okay, he must have been kidnapped."

105
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960
 If his glasses are here, how would he have driven this far?

106
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,640
 Now reportedly he needed the glasses to drive, but that's the story that we're being told.

107
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,960
 And then they're like "Okay, he uses his EZPass three times."

108
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,560
 But then after it, cause he had to take multiple toll roads and bridges to get where he was

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
 at.

110
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,160
 95 miles, I think it was like three states he went through to get there.

111
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,440
 They said "Okay, so he used the EZPass three times, after that he started using paper tickets."

112
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,160
 So people are thinking it could be possible that he was kidnapped.

113
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,080
 And the person who was driving his car didn't know how to use EZPass, so he began using

114
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,580
 tickets.

115
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,040
 They have to call the FBI in.

116
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,960
 So you have the Lancaster County police working on it.

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,480
 They're calling up Baltimore PD.

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,760
 They're getting the information from the office.

119
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,680
 But because it was a assistant district attorney and because the crime took place over several

120
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,720
 states, they had to call in the FBI.

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
 So the FBI comes in.

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,480
 They talk to the Baltimore PD, they get the information from them.

123
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,120
 They talk to the Lancaster County PD, they're getting all the antinatal taken notes, wearing

124
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,480
 their trench coats taking notes.

125
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,080
 They examine the body, they're like "Mhm, okay, they're doing their investigation."

126
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,200
 They go "Suicide.

127
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,920
 He obviously killed himself.

128
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,440
 Case closed."

129
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,760
 And of course the police departments were like "What?

130
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
 How?

131
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,800
 Wait, where did you come to that conclusion?"

132
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,560
 And the FBI goes "Well, according to what we've found out, he was $28,000 in debt.

133
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
 He was involved.

134
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,960
 He was suspected to have stole $38,000 from a case he was working on involving a bank

135
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
 robbery.

136
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,000
 He was on the verge of being fired.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,520
 His boss had problems with him.

138
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,240
 That morning he got in trouble with a judge involving the case he was working on.

139
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,880
 That's why he was doing the plea deal.

140
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,080
 That late at night he had to get it done.

141
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,560
 He committed suicide.

142
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,040
 There's no defensive wounds.

143
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:11,120
 We believe that he tried to stage a kidnapping and then stage an assault and as he was cutting

144
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,200
 himself in the neck he accidentally cut a carotid artery, fell in the water and died.

145
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,320
 Oh, and by the way, Coroner, you should change your report to match that.

146
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,120
 And the Coroner was like "This was foul play.

147
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,760
 I'm not changing my report to make this look like a suicide."

148
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:35,680
 Six months after his body was found, they did find his pin knife at a rock in the creek

149
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,440
 where his body was found.

150
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,120
 That pin knife was used to inflict all 36 wounds on his body.

151
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,160
 They matched it up to all of them.

152
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,360
 To this day, the Coroner insists it was foul play that he was murdered.

153
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,960
 And to this day the FBI says, "Case closed, it was a suicide."

154
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,880
 What really happened to Jonathan Luna?

155
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,040
 Did he try to stage a kidnapping and was he so at the end of his rope that part of his

156
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,360
 staging his kidnapping to make it look like he was assaulted was to cut his own scrotum

157
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,160
 to stab himself in his genitals?

158
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,280
 That's how far he was willing to go for this ruse.

159
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:21,800
 Or was he murdered and either due to sloppy police work or something more sinister, was

160
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,360
 it classified as a suicide?

161
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,480
 It's been 15 years since this happened.

162
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,720
 And there's been no real movement on this case.

163
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,200
 Bizarre story.

164
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,680
 Fairly high profile at the time, but as the years have gone on, it's become less and less

165
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
 known.

166
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,840
 But to this day, nobody really knows what happened to Jonathan Luna.

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,200
 It's just a file sitting somewhere in a Coroner's office and a closed file sitting somewhere

168
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,480
 in an FBI office.

169
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,160
 And we'll never really know unless something else breaks with this story.

170
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,920
 The next story I want to talk about I think is equally creepy in its own way.

171
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,880
 This one is on the Conspiracy Iceberg and when I saw it I was like, "Okay, I know of

172
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
 that."

173
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,440
 I didn't think if there was anything particularly intriguing about it.

174
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,560
 I was like, "Yeah, I've heard of that before."

175
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,620
 But I decided to give it another look and it's really bizarre.

176
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,840
 It is kind of creepy again in its own way.

177
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,520
 So on the Conspiracy Iceberg it's listed the Dancing Plague of 1518.

178
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,080
 That was a situation where you had this area, you had like this small town or this small

179
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,760
 countryside where everyone started dancing mysteriously.

180
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,480
 They're just like, "Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh."

181
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,120
 I don't know why I'm dancing on a podcast.

182
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
 I'm actually dancing over here.

183
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
 I can't see that.

184
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,400
 So everyone was kind of like dancing along and people couldn't figure out why they were

185
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
 dancing.

186
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,240
 And it lasted for I think a couple weeks and a couple people died because they would dance

187
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,680
 till they got exhausted and eventually they just stopped.

188
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,400
 And I remember hearing that story and I was like, "Yeah, it's just probably a couple of

189
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,440
 nut bags in the area and stuff like that."

190
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,600
 Then I heard about Dancing Mania.

191
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,080
 Now the Dancing Plague of 1518, the reason why that kind of stands out on its own, what

192
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,840
 was because it was fairly well documented.

193
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:25,240
 But Dancing Mania was the same thing, but it was spread out from the 14th to the 17th

194
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:36,480
 century all over Europe, cities, countryside, farms, towns, thousands of people dancing

195
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
 uncontrollably.

196
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,720
 They'd have these outbreaks.

197
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,440
 People would be, this is so bizarre.

198
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,240
 So and this happened multiple times throughout the centuries.

199
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,800
 Someone would be in the town and they would just start dancing.

200
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,840
 They would just start dancing and then other people would see them and they would come

201
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,560
 out and they'd start dancing in a group too.

202
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,360
 And everyone would start dancing.

203
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,400
 It got so bad that the people, like they had to start to come up with remedies for this.

204
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,080
 So they had to start basically building up this mythology.

205
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,920
 So people started dancing and they would say, "Okay.

206
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,760
 So who is it?

207
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,200
 St. Michael and St. Vitus.

208
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
 Vitus.

209
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,720
 Or St. Vitus is the saint of dancing."

210
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,880
 So people would be like, "Oh, oh, you must have been cursed by St. Vitus.

211
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,800
 You have to go to a shrine specifically for St. Vitus and pray to him and he'll relieve

212
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 your dancing."

213
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
 So it wasn't like this one off thing.

214
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,400
 People were dancing so much that the government and the church had to figure out something

215
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,880
 to do to keep people from dancing.

216
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,080
 So St. Vitus is the St. Patron saint of dancing.

217
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,160
 He was the patron saint of dancing before all of this.

218
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,560
 So the earliest incident that they know of of dancing mania, 7th century, but it got

219
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,440
 really bad in the 14th century.

220
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,680
 So in the 1020s, so in Burnsburg, which is this place in Europe, apparently, 18 people

221
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,120
 just started dancing.

222
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,320
 Now you're like, "Okay, maybe they're just having fun."

223
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
 There was a Christmas Eve service.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 They're singing their hymns, their old-timey hymns, which we wouldn't understand because

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,320
 they spoke weird back then.

226
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,520
 And all of a sudden people just started getting up and dancing.

227
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,080
 Now you're like, "Well, they're just celebrating."

228
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,360
 No, the thing is you can't stop dancing.

229
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,960
 You dance until you become unconscious.

230
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,640
 So they're dancing in church and people are like, "Dude, I'm trying to worship the baby

231
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
 Jesus."

232
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
 And they're elbowing him.

233
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,120
 They're like, "Crunking next to you as you're trying to sing a hymn."

234
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
 And you can't stop them.

235
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,040
 Like you try to hold them down, they just keep dancing.

236
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
 What's so weird?

237
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,720
 Okay, in the year 1237, a bunch of kids were dancing about...

238
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,400
 It was a 20-kilometer journey between these two towns.

239
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,520
 And the kids were dancing the whole way.

240
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
 I don't...

241
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
 I've been dancing this whole time.

242
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,960
 Okay, I'm going to stop dancing because it's probably messing up the podcast.

243
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,760
 Anyways, so they danced for 20 kilometers from one town to another.

244
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,560
 There was another one in 1278.

245
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,080
 200 people were dancing on a bridge in Germany.

246
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,200
 The bridge collapsed.

247
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
 All the people...

248
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
 Or most...

249
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,120
 Most of the people, they're like, "Oh, we're in the river.

250
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
 Help us, help us."

251
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,720
 They get rescued by the townspeople and brought to the nearest church.

252
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,120
 A church for St. Viteus.

253
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
 What?

254
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
 That's a weird coincidence.

255
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,960
 Now, it's probably just a coincidence.

256
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,240
 But still, they're dancing on the bridge.

257
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
 It collapses.

258
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,040
 And the closest church to them is the patron saint of dancing.

259
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,160
 So they had these outbreaks all over Europe.

260
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
 Why the...

261
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,600
 Oh, and this was the funniest thing.

262
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,000
 So like I said, the church and the government are trying to figure out how to get people

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,720
 to stop dancing.

264
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,120
 Like people, they're having these massive outbreaks of dancing.

265
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,000
 And the problem was is that then people aren't working and they're dying because they dance

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
 until they became unconscious.

267
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,440
 Some people danced so hard they broke ribs, which seems kind of weird.

268
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,320
 They must have been like doing a mosh pit, like an old time mosh pit, but people were

269
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,380
 dying.

270
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,520
 So if you had to stop a group of people, you're sitting in town, you're a governor, and you

271
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,960
 look out your window and you see...

272
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,040
 Because people would dance from town to town.

273
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,640
 It wasn't always just people in your town.

274
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,720
 Sometimes dancing crowds would move through your town and people from your town would

275
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,560
 jump up and start dancing and they'd move to the next town.

276
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,240
 So you're sitting there and you see a bunch of people dancing down the street and they're

277
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,640
 headed towards your town.

278
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,160
 How would you stop them from dancing without hurting them?

279
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,760
 Because you don't want to like, you know, like bludgeon them or like...

280
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,880
 They had muskets back then, right?

281
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,920
 Or you know, arrows, shoot arrows at them.

282
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,400
 You could put like, tacks on the ground or whatever, but you don't want to do that because

283
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
 you don't want to hurt them.

284
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,240
 And attack would give you gangrene and you'd die anyways.

285
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,280
 So how would you stop a group of people dancing in your town?

286
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,240
 There's probably a bunch of different ways.

287
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,360
 Nets, you could do that.

288
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,280
 You could like tie ropes around them.

289
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
 You could like...

290
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,880
 Do they have lassoes back then or is that only from like the Wild Wild West?

291
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,280
 Do they know what a lasso was in medieval Europe?

292
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
 I'm gonna say no.

293
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,720
 But anyways, you could probably come up with a lot of different ways to get someone to

294
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,880
 stop dancing.

295
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,760
 There's one way to keep people dancing.

296
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
 There's one guaranteed way...

297
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,920
 This is when I knew I was gonna do "This is a Story."

298
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,000
 There is one guaranteed way to keep people dancing.

299
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,320
 For whatever reason, the local councils and the church believed this...

300
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,120
 If you played music next to the people dancing, they'd stop dancing.

301
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,880
 So they began to hire bards to follow these groups around playing music.

302
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,040
 And what do you think happened?

303
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,200
 More people joined the dance.

304
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,720
 Why would you even think?

305
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,560
 If you saw a bunch of people dancing in those streets and no music, you would not bring

306
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,320
 a boombox out there and turn it on and go, "This will stop the dance.

307
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,840
 This will end this celebration."

308
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,440
 They just made more people join the dance and again, you can't stop dancing.

309
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,600
 So now you've got people providing musical accompaniment to it and you just have these

310
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,160
 huge up to a thousand people sometimes just dancing through the countryside.

311
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
 We don't know what caused it.

312
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,800
 Some people say it was ergot poisoning, which people have disputed because that makes you

313
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,920
 like completely like uncoordinated and you could say, "Well, it's not like they were

314
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,000
 doing choreographed dance moves, Jason."

315
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,800
 But the fact that other people were joining in and it was moving from area to area, they

316
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,360
 go, "It could have been possible."

317
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,240
 Some people have said there's a disease called St. Vetus disease, but that's almost like

318
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
 retconned.

319
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,800
 That's where your limbs jerk uncontrollably.

320
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,240
 But that's been named more for Dancing Mania than Dancing Mania being caused by that because

321
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,800
 what would happen again, St. Vetus disease isn't something that you just contract, that

322
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,720
 someone's walking out of the street and it mostly affects children.

323
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,000
 So that wasn't the cause of it.

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,840
 That is named because of this.

325
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,560
 People have thought things like hypnosis.

326
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,920
 It's considered the first form of mass hysteria, like the first form of recorded mass hysteria.

327
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,880
 I think the best thing I saw, which again I'm still a little iffy on because we're going

328
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,880
 to get into another weirder thing, is that it was caused because people were so poor and

329
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,480
 so just like, "Ugh, life sucks."

330
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,320
 They just started dancing into like, "Dance the Blues away."

331
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,000
 Basically, their life sucks so bad that they said, "Why don't we just do a choreograph

332
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 dance?"

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
 They should make a musical called Dance Mania.

334
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,360
 It's about peasants in medieval times and it starts off with this woman just throwing

335
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
 hay.

336
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,880
 It's like rent or stomp, but with medieval stuff.

337
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,240
 I'm copyrighting that idea.

338
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
 Nobody's still there from me.

339
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,440
 Anyways, so they were doing these dances and they go, "Maybe they were just so bored and

340
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,600
 so just miserable that everyone started dancing."

341
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,120
 It was just kind of their way of giving up.

342
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
 That's possible.

343
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,680
 The thing is, is like, one, they would dance themselves to death sometimes or dance to

344
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,560
 collapse and then two, they would dance so much and they would dance from town to town

345
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,000
 that they would basically be even more poor when they went back because their crops were

346
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,800
 failing or they were selling wooden shoes and termites got them or whatever.

347
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,240
 It was very short-sighted, but I think that's probably the most likely scenario.

348
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,000
 However, then it gets weird.

349
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,120
 Everything we've talked about now, it's going to get really weird.

350
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,640
 So these people would, like I said, they dance from town to town.

351
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,520
 Now there's two interesting quirks that I left out of this because we're getting far

352
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
 enough in time.

353
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,960
 So like I said, 14th century to 17th century and we have them recorded back as far as the

354
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,120
 17th century, but 16th, 17th, 18th century, we have fairly good records from Europe of

355
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
 those time periods.

356
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
 They're really from everywhere in the world.

357
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,320
 Once we got to the point where everything's being written down and things like that, we

358
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
 have really good records.

359
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,040
 So as you go farther in time, we start to record some particular things.

360
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,680
 One, the groups of dancing people.

361
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,280
 This is what makes me think it's not like just we're so bored, we're dancing.

362
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,320
 That it is more of like this mental infection, this mass hysteria.

363
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,200
 People who are dancing, these groups are dancing, they hated the color red.

364
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,840
 If they saw the color red as they were dancing through town, they got angry.

365
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,600
 Oh, now they're dancing super angry.

366
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,000
 They're straight up like doing some like, skull moves, they're skankin'.

367
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,600
 They're not like doing like sweet little tap dance moves and now they're getting really

368
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 mad.

369
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,520
 And if you were standing on the stoop and they're dancing down the street and you're

370
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,480
 not dancing, they'd attack you.

371
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,200
 They beat you up if you weren't dancing as they moved through town.

372
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,080
 So you had a choice, you could either like fight them off, fight off a thousand people,

373
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,880
 run into your house, which is probably made of hay, or start dancing.

374
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,480
 Almost, and I was like, this is like a zombie apocalypse thing.

375
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,320
 But instead of them eating your brains, they're moving your legs.

376
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
 They're making you dance.

377
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,480
 And then once you were part of the dance, you would get swept up in this mental thing

378
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
 too.

379
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,480
 So when you saw someone else who wasn't dancing, you're like, oh, feel the beat, feel the rhythm.

380
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,760
 And then the 17th century stopped.

381
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,920
 It just didn't happen anymore.

382
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,400
 What's interesting, so all of that happened in Northern Europe, so like Germany, England,

383
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,040
 France, all that stuff, Netherlands.

384
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:15,040
 In Italy, they had the same problem, but it was called the tarantella.

385
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,560
 It's actually still like a dancer in tune nowadays.

386
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,400
 But there was this legend, around the same time, there was this legend that if you got

387
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,400
 bit by a tarantula, if you danced enough, you could shake the poison out of the blood.

388
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,680
 So you did these quick movements and your blood would separate away from the poison

389
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
 and you'd live.

390
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,120
 And so someone would get bit by a spider and they'd start doing this dance.

391
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,400
 And what happened was the person sitting next to you, they thought, well, if the poison

392
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,720
 goes out of his blood, it might go into mine, so they started dancing.

393
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,160
 And again, you'd have whole towns of people dancing, afraid that the poison was going

394
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
 to get them.

395
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,520
 And you're like, okay, Jason, that's kind of goes, that gives a more valid explanation,

396
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,400
 like that's a full reason of why people would start dancing in a group.

397
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,720
 Here's the weird thing, they hated the color black.

398
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,160
 In Italy, they'd have these huge groups of people dancing.

399
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,200
 And if they saw the color black, they'd get really, really angry.

400
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,400
 What was going on?

401
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,480
 And also that just ended in the 17th century.

402
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,120
 What was going on with that?

403
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,280
 How do thousands of people, I can understand, your sports team wins and you're out celebrating

404
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,720
 in a typical couple of cop cars and you climb up and knock down a couple light poles.

405
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,360
 I get that, it's a riot.

406
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,520
 People just get swept up in the moment.

407
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,200
 I get that, it's stupid.

408
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,840
 But it doesn't last 20 kilometers.

409
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,520
 Like you don't riot across from town to town.

410
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,600
 I mean, I guess if you really were like really glad your team won.

411
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 And I know sometimes there's like political riots and stuff like that, but those are generally

412
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,960
 confined to certain areas.

413
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,760
 You don't riot across from town to town in one large group.

414
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,160
 Mass hysteria tends to peter out really quickly.

415
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,280
 What was going on over here?

416
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,560
 I think the weirdest parts are the fact that it happened for three centuries.

417
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,680
 The fact that we still don't know what caused it.

418
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,680
 There's still a bunch of theories as much as has happened, we still don't know exactly

419
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,320
 what caused it.

420
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,440
 The thing about being angry by the colors and then we have two different countries with

421
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,640
 two different colors having the same reaction, they get angry.

422
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,800
 Because that's the thing too, people are rioting, they may be like we hate cops and they see

423
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,680
 a cop and we're like we hate you.

424
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,440
 It's not like they see like a guy wearing blue blockers and they're like we hate the

425
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,000
 color blue because the color blue reminds us of cops and they're like destroying Bluetooth

426
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,320
 stores.

427
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,280
 These people just hated these colors for whatever reason.

428
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,960
 And if you were just standing on your stoop enjoying the sight of a bunch of young busty

429
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,840
 winches dancing on the street you got beat up unless you were dancing.

430
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,720
 What caused that?

431
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,000
 What would cause people to...

432
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,200
 I can get being so bored and so just like oh my life sucks and I'm just gonna dance like

433
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,800
 Footloose style in my barn.

434
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,600
 But I don't get dancing for 20 kilometers, dancing with so many people I collapse a bridge.

435
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,240
 And the thing is could this happen again?

436
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,280
 Since we don't know what caused it, it might have been some bug in the programming of humans.

437
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,960
 Is it possible that in the next week it's like residents of Chicago woke up to an amazing

438
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
 scene.

439
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,400
 Tens of thousands of people are dancing down the streets.

440
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,800
 The police are trying to cordon them off.

441
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,920
 They're calling in Bruno Mars to try to play music to stop the dancing.

442
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
 We will keep you informed.

443
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,840
 Is this possible since we don't know what caused it?

444
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,000
 Is it possible that someday thousands or now with our population millions of people may

445
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,520
 simply begin dancing from city to city?

446
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,080
 And nobody knows why.

447
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,400
