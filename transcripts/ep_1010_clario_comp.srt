00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 When US Special Forces are given GPS locations to somewhere deep in the Ozarks, they have

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,840
 no idea they're about to uncover the truth that's been hidden from us all.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,680
 And then pack your book bags because we're headed back to school to meet a young man

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,240
 who's currently learning the three Rs.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:34,240
 reading, writing, and reaching into the human psyche to control the soul today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:45,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,240
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,240
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,240
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,240
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our Christmas live stream contributors.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,240
 Everyone get on your feet and give a round of applause for Rico in Ako Poco.

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,240
 Woohoo! Yeah, come on in Rico.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
 Come on in, do a little snazzy dance for us.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 Entertain us. Dance, dance, dance.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,240
 Rico, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,240
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally get it.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
 I know I might sound like a broken record.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
 I know I say this every single episode, but I want you to know that

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,240
 it's okay if you can't give me money.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,240
 Because a lot of podcasts don't say that.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 They think you're lame if you don't pay them.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,240
 And I'm telling you, I honestly am telling you, if you can't support the show,

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,240
 that is 100% okay. Don't feel like you're a leech or anything like that.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
 You're like, Jason, I never felt that way.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,240
 Well, there's a lot of podcasts that make people feel bad for not giving them money.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,240
 If you can't give me money, just spread the word about the show.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
 That is another way you can help out.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,240
 Make flyers, tell your friends and family, talk about it online.

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,240
 That seriously helps the show grow.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,240
 100% it is okay if you guys can't give me money.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,240
 Rico, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to a new vehicle.

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,240
 We're headed into a combat-oriented story, so everyone jump on board the bunny battle tank.

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,240
 Rico, lead us out of Dead Rabbit Command and drive us all the way out to the Ozarks.

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:22,240
 [Demonic music]

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,240
 We're headed all the way across the nation in this tank because we're about to link up with the 5th Special Forces Group.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,240
 They're not good enough to be the 1st or 2nd or 3rd or 4th. They're not only the 5th best,

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,240
 but they've been selected to do this mission.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,240
 On December 20th, 2022, in the Missouri Ozarks,

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,240
 24 members of the 5th best Special Forces Group land out in this region.

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,240
 They're like, "No, Jason, that's not how it works. We're just the 5th one created."

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,240
 "Oh, yeah, I'm sure. That's what your parents tell you when you sign up."

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,240
 They're like, "Hey, I got in the 5th Special Forces Group."

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
 And the parents are like, "Oh, yeah, we're proud of you."

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,240
 Kinda, we're the 5th most proud parents on the block.

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,240
 They've been sent out to this area. What happened is,

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,240
 the military had recently gotten GPS coordinates pointing at this area in the Missouri Ozarks.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,240
 It's real, like, just craggy areas. There's mountains and trees and canyons and stuff like that.

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,240
 Like, even hikers are like, "Ah, I don't really want to go out there."

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
 But the military, they have to, right? They're getting paid.

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
 And when the general says, "Go here," they're like, "Yes, sir."

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,240
 He's accidentally pointing at a volcano on the map.

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
 They're like, "Well, that's where he points."

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
 "Oh, daaah! They're all f*cked at the volcano."

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,240
 I mean, come on, they're the 5th best Special Forces Group. They're not the first.

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,240
 They're gonna fall in the volcano. You have to tell them exactly where to go.

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,240
 Anyways, the general says, "This is where you go.

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:50,240
 We've gotten GPS coordinates that there is a cloning center in this area."

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,240
 Now, in the real world, even if you were the 5th best Special Forces Group out of 6,

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,240
 even if you were, you'd go like, "Sir, wait, wait, you want us to go walk through the wilderness

61
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,240
 to find a cloning center? What? We didn't even know clones existed."

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:14,240
 But that's what a normal human would say. However, according to what is quickly becoming

63
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:22,240
 one of my 5th favorite websites on this show, Real Raw News, a website that exposes the truth

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,240
 about what's going on in the world. We've covered stories from them before,

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,240
 like Hillary Clinton, you might not know this, this is your first episode of "You're Not Insane."

66
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,240
 Hillary Clinton was arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay where she then went crazy

67
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
 from Adrena Kroh withdrawal and threw her poop at the prison guards

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,240
 until she was hung or hanged, big difference, in front of President Donald Trump.

69
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,240
 This has been a long-going saga, I'll put all the episodes in the show notes.

70
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:02,240
 Fascinating, it's fiction to most people, but this website takes in around $25,000 a month

71
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,240
 in just donations. It gets 100,000 views per article within the first 5 days,

72
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,240
 so we can laugh about it, it is funny, but this is actually a big mover and shaker

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,240
 in the world of conspiracy theory. That's who's reporting this.

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,240
 Michael Baxter for Real Raw News is reporting that the 5th Special Forces Group

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,240
 is finding these GPS locations, but what happens is they're not finding them,

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,240
 they actually dropped 24 troops into this area and they're looking around,

77
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,240
 they can't find a cloning facility, they're seeing trees and squirrels and ducks,

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,240
 no clones, they see two ducks walking together and they're like, "Oh, that might be a clone."

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,240
 They're like, "Ugh, that's not a clone, that's just two ducks, bro."

80
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,240
 Anyways, they're following this GPS coordinates, "Boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop."

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:03,240
 And they're like, "Sir, we're not seeing anything, we're within 500 yards of this GPS bebop boop thing,

82
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,240
 and I don't see anything, I just look, here's a mountain, here's a couple trees,

83
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,240
 I'm looking at you, you're not a whole grand more you who's poking his commanding officer,

84
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,240
 he's like, "Slove it." And then he goes, "Wait, shh."

85
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,240
 Beep-a-boop, beep-a-boop, beep-a-boop, shut that thing off, shut that thing off, beep-a-bop.

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,240
 Did you hear that? Did you hear that? Did you hear that humming? Did you hear that 46-year-old guy

87
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,240
 pressing his lips against the microphone? And they notice that one of the mountains

88
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,240
 that they're standing next to, like the base of the mountain, is humming.

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:47,240
 So they go, "I bet you anything." I mean, I'm gonna be using my deductive skills.

90
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,240
 That's where there's probably something in there. There's probably something in there.

91
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,240
 We hear this mysterious humming coming out of a mountain.

92
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:02,240
 They realize that this mountain has a holographic image over it, of like a rock face.

93
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
 It's not just a... it's a holographic image of Donald Duck.

94
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,240
 They're like, "Well, I did get kind of confused with that 30-foot tall Donald Duck over there."

95
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,240
 So anyways, they walk through the hologram, and they find themselves in a limestone cavern

96
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,240
 that had been perfectly hollowed out. Like, it was a naturally forming cave, but they made it.

97
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,240
 So they said it was actually big enough to bring in a tank. They didn't have a tank with them, but...

98
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,240
 if they had, that's how the military measures everything. They're like, "Wow, that building's at least 18 tanks high."

99
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,240
 They walk in, they go, "Man, we could have driven a tank through this."

100
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:53,240
 And they follow the source of the humming, and they see 36, what's known as maturation tubes.

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:00,240
 They're at least 7 feet tall each, and they're filled with this clear, thick liquid.

102
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:08,240
 And in each of these tubes is a clone, just floating there in this liquid.

103
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:17,240
 So the coordinates were right. Someone in the deep state had decided to alert the U.S. military who's fighting against the deep state.

104
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,240
 Donald Trump is still president in this version of history, and he's directing everyone from Mar-a-Lago.

105
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,240
 He's like, "Go do that, go do that. It'll be huge." And then they go out there and they do it, and it's huge.

106
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,240
 You walk into this room, and we see these clones, and they were in different levels of maturation.

107
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,240
 They're growing in these tubes. You had everything from a prepubescent Chuck Schumer clone.

108
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,240
 He's a senator, if you're not familiar with American politics. A prepubescent Chuck Schumer.

109
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,240
 He's an adult man. He's not like the doogie-hazard of senators. You're like, "Oh, prepubescent. He must be like 12 in the Senate."

110
00:08:51,240 --> 00:09:01,240
 So he's like barely growing in his tube, and then you have a Hillary Clinton in her mid-30s, which she used quite the smoke show in her mid-30s.

111
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:10,240
 And then you had a fully mature Joe Biden, ready to go. Just in case something happens to the real Joe Biden.

112
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:17,240
 You have his clone. And a couple other governors and stuff like that. You also had two Fauci's.

113
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:27,240
 You had two clones of Dr. Fauci, and the military is looking around, and they're like, "We gotta destroy these. We gotta destroy these clones."

114
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,240
 And then the commander issues probably the best order ever issued in military history.

115
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,240
 We're taking a Fauci in a-- [laughs]

116
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:46,240
 You're gonna check some of these clones, right? He goes, "We're taking a Fauci and a Biden. We don't have room for anymore. Leave the rest."

117
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,240
 So they pull out a naked clone. Because if they were cloned with a-- like, Dr. Fauci's not wearing a lab coat.

118
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:01,240
 They have to pull out, they have to handle the unconscious body of a dripping, wet Anthony Fauci clone.

119
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:11,240
 That's why they sent the fifth best special forces group to do this. They had to carry a naked Dr. Fauci and a naked Joe Biden out to their vehicles,

120
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:20,240
 which is way outside. They're deep in this tunnel. They keep dropping the Fauci, and then the rest of them are rigged with C4 and the men retreat,

121
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,240
 and they hit the button. [imitates gunshot]

122
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,240
 Destroyed the deep state's cloning facility.

123
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:43,240
 Now this operation is actually given us very good intel about the cloning process. It turns out that while these clones look perfect, they're not.

124
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,240
 This is the first time that the White Hats-- that's what they coined themselves, this group who's fighting the deep state--

125
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,240
 they say, "We now know the difference between a clone and a regular human."

126
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:04,240
 All clones are missing the same teeth. They're missing the second molars.

127
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,240
 None of the clones that they've been able to analyze-- they have a naked Fauci and they have a naked Biden, and they've done operations on him,

128
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,240
 and none of these clones have a pair of second molars. Plus, did you know-- [laughs]

129
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,240
 We were gonna wish you didn't know this, but you get to imagine Dr. Fauci naked.

130
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,240
 Did you know that Dr. Fauci in real life-- actually, now I say this, I don't know if this is true, I found this on real raw news.

131
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:39,240
 I don't know why I assumed this part was true. Apparently, according to real raw news, Dr. Fauci has a one-inch birthmark on his thigh.

132
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:46,240
 So I want you to imagine Dr. Fauci naked right in front of you, and you have a magnifying glass, and you're right up against his thigh.

133
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,240
 I guess you don't need a magnifying glass if it's one-inch. I just wanted you to be super close to him.

134
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,240
 I wanted you to be able to smell his musk. He has a one-inch birthmark on his thigh, but the clone doesn't.

135
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:04,240
 The clone does not, so that's one way. If you're ever in the company of Dr. Fauci and you want to know whether or not he's real, pull his pants down.

136
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,240
 Just wong up and just yank his pants down, and if he doesn't have a birthmark, then he might be a clone.

137
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,240
 Then check his teeth and wrestle him to the ground and look in his mouth and check his teeth.

138
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
 But again, it's funny because I don't even know if he has a birthmark. That's what real raw news is saying.

139
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:29,240
 So I wonder even if he did pull-- I'm not recommending you pulling Dr. Anthony Fauci's pants down for the record, but if you did, if you did,

140
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,240
 pull his pants down and he doesn't-- he might not have a birthmark. This might be like 4D chess.

141
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,240
 This might be encouraging people to tackle Dr. Fauci and pull his pants down.

142
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:48,240
 I wonder what would happen if you pulled down Dr. Fauci's pants.

143
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:56,240
 Like, I'm sure it's a crime, right? It would be battery. But I imagine someone like Dr. Fauci, because, you know, he's kind of a nerd, right?

144
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,240
 He's a scientist, dude. He's a doctor. I'm sure he got bullied in school. I'm sure he got pantsed when he was in elementary school.

145
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:13,240
 And I wonder, like, if you pantsed-- not just Dr. Fauci, but any nerd as an adult, would you-- like, would you?

146
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:20,240
 I mean, of course, it is battery. It's a crime. I'm not recommending it. But as a scientific test, if someone was pantsed as a kid,

147
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:29,240
 and then they have this long-distinguished career, and then you pants them, like, they win the Nobel Prize and you run up and you pants them,

148
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,240
 what would happen to them mentally?

149
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:41,240
 Oh, and just to be clear, Real Raw News does say, because I'm sure some of you were wondering, when they matched the clones,

150
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:52,240
 Genitalia, to-- apparently, there's photos going around of Dr. Fauci and President Joe Biden's Genitalia, they do match.

151
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:01,240
 You cannot tell them apart from their Genitalia. Real Raw News was very specific about that. So if you were thinking,

152
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:10,240
 "Well, you're pulling down Anthony Fauci's pants," that you're going to take a look at his junk just to let you know that does look normal.

153
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:21,240
 Michael Baxter from Real Raw News wants you to know that Anthony Fauci's Genitalia is normal. That is a quote from him.

154
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:30,240
 Rico and Acapulco, let's go ahead and fire up the carbonar copter. We are leaving behind the insane world of Real Raw News.

155
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,240
 Take us all the way out to a local college.

156
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:44,240
 I found this story online. We don't have a specific location. We don't have a time period.

157
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:56,240
 But I would assume, United States, I would assume within, you know, the past 10, 15 years. It's not any-- it's not like old timey college, everything's CP atone or nothing like that.

158
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:04,240
 Modern times. Modern times. We're about to meet a guy. Don't have his name. We're going to go in and call him Michael.

159
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:16,240
 And he tells us this story. Michael was a college senior. Everything was going good. You know, classes are a little bit harder. He knows, though, that the end is near.

160
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,240
 And he'll finally be able to go out, get a job, do some good stuff.

161
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:29,240
 And while he's there, he meets-- well, you know, it's funny. He goes, "I didn't know her directly.

162
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:43,240
 She was someone that I saw around campus that kind of moved in some of the same social circles I did, but it was never like a one-on-one friendship with this sophomore named Clario."

163
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:51,240
 And he goes, "For all I know, that was her nickname." I mean, it does sound like a weird name, but in college you meet people with all sorts of weird names.

164
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,240
 But he goes, "I don't know if Clario was her real name, to be honest. It might have just been her nickname."

165
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:03,240
 But anyways, this girl Clario, she just kind of flittered her way around campus. You would see her. You would know that she was there.

166
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,240
 But we weren't friends. We weren't close in any way, shape, or form.

167
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,240
 But eventually, he does end up having a face-to-face encounter with Clario.

168
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:25,240
 The very first time I actually sat and talked to her, I-- I fit-- I don't have a strong memory of the conversation, to be honest.

169
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:36,240
 Like, I can't remember what I actually said to Clario, but I knew-- it was weird. I knew what I was saying, but I don't remember what I was saying.

170
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,240
 But I was telling her deeply, deeply personal things about me.

171
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,240
 This was our first conversation.

172
00:16:46,240 --> 00:17:00,240
 He goes, "I felt myself just telling her these secrets that I had held inside to a girl that I-- I didn't know her."

173
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,240
 Like, again, I knew she kind of moved in and out of these groups and see her at a party and kind of wave-- not even wave high.

174
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
 She was just someone walking around a party. I just knew of her.

175
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:17,240
 And now the first time I'm sitting there talking to her, I'm telling her these deeply personal secrets, and I couldn't stop.

176
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:27,240
 I just kept going and going and going, and it wasn't until the conversation was over that it fully hit me exactly everything that I had said to her.

177
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:37,240
 The weird thing was, is one, that I had said any of that out loud, because these are things I would only tell my best friends or long-time confidants,

178
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:45,240
 or that I would never tell a soul. Not only did I find myself telling her these things, and I didn't realize what I had done until after the conversation,

179
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:53,240
 I couldn't remember anything she said to me.

180
00:17:53,240 --> 00:18:00,240
 I could only remember my side of the conversation, and I just couldn't stop talking.

181
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,240
 The next time I met Clario, I was on my way to an exam.

182
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:14,240
 The teacher for this exam was so strict that if you were late, it was an automatic fail.

183
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,240
 I'm headed to class. It's just minutes from starting.

184
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
 I gotta get there, and I gotta get there now.

185
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,240
 And walking towards me is Clario.

186
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,240
 Just out in the green, right? And walking down the path to get to class.

187
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
 She's walking towards me, and she stops him, right?

188
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,240
 She's like, "Hey, Michael!" And he goes, "Normally!"

189
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,240
 Like, I'm about to fail this test. I've studied for this. I know it. Hopefully I know it, but I will fail if I'm late.

190
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,240
 Normally, I would just say, "Be polite." Hey, listen, I can't talk right now. I gotta go. I got an exam.

191
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:03,240
 But the second Clario started talking, my legs stopped working.

192
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:17,240
 I'm just standing there, and she starts to talk to me. And I start to respond, but just like before, I couldn't tell you what we talked about.

193
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:29,240
 I could not tell you what the conversation was. And when it ended, I was just standing there.

194
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:40,240
 She leaves. See you later, Michael. And I'm standing there on this pathway, and I'm thinking, "What? What am I doing here?

195
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:49,240
 Why am I standing? Where? What am I doing? Not what am I doing here as in I should have made it to the exam."

196
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:57,240
 He forgot he even had an exam. He couldn't figure out why he was walking down that pathway in the first place.

197
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:07,240
 The next time he met her, he was in the gym, he was in the college gym, and Clario walked right up to him and said,

198
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:19,240
 "Hey, Michael, can I borrow 20 bucks?" The next day, Michael was sitting there and he goes, "What in the world just happened?"

199
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,240
 He goes, "It took him a full day to realize that he gave Clario $20 cash right out of his wallet."

200
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:34,240
 He goes, "I don't ever do that." He goes, "I don't even give money to friends. I'll tell them my dark and secrets, but I don't give money to people."

201
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:41,240
 I do not loan money to people or give money to people at all. She asked me for $20. Not only did I pull it out and give it to her,

202
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:48,240
 I didn't even have a second thought about it until 24 hours later when I realized that I have $20 less in my wallet.

203
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,240
 And I remembered Clario asked for that.

204
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:11,240
 He said that he spent the rest of his senior year doing his best to avoid Clario. At this point, he believes that at the very least he may have been hypnotized.

205
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:24,240
 And the very most, Clario has some sort of full-on mind control powers.

206
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,240
 He says, "I spent the rest of the year trying to avoid her." He goes a couple times. She did come up to me after that and straight up asked for cash,

207
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:38,240
 and he didn't have any on him. He just had his card. He didn't have any on him to give her.

208
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,240
 So that saved him. But he said for the most part he just tried avoiding her.

209
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,240
 It's a fascinating story. This is really cool. I like it. One, it's a mundane paranormal story. The stakes aren't super high.

210
00:21:51,240 --> 00:22:01,240
 The state, you know, did he give her $20? I wonder if he was late for his test. He didn't clarify that, but I enjoy mundane paranormal stories,

211
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:11,240
 because I think they're quite common. It's that daily paranormal stuff that I love. I love the alien abductions and the cryptids that are eating people.

212
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:19,240
 I love that stuff too. Cloning facilities, getting blown up. But I also love these paranormal stories that are just a day in the life,

213
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,240
 or, you know, a couple days in a year type of... You know what I mean? Like, it just exists alongside us.

214
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:35,240
 I also think that hypnotism, I didn't know a lot about hypnotism until we did an episode on it a long time ago, it's definitely possible to do this.

215
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:46,240
 Now on the one hand she could have just had the ability to charm people. On the other hand she could have straight up been hypnotizing him on the spot,

216
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:55,240
 which really, I mean, what's creepy is that hypnotism takes a little more setup than that. So to really do this on a hypnotic level,

217
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:02,240
 she would have had to hypnotize him, say, at a party or at some point, because remember he knew her from just kind of walking around campus.

218
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:10,240
 She hypnotized him at one point and he doesn't remember that. See, she built in, she hypnotized him at some point,

219
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,240
 and she probably, you know, "Hey, you know, let's wanted to see a trick." And the next thing he knows, he's just had the party still having a good time

220
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,240
 and she hypnotized him and put all these suggestions into his head and he doesn't remember them.

221
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,240
 And they're basically these little psychic landmines that she can then trigger whenever she wants.

222
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,240
 I mean, and it also though could be that this woman had some sort of psychic ability.

223
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:45,240
 There wasn't just hypnotist skills, which anyone can learn to do hypnotism. It's a science, really, that you can learn to put someone under

224
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:52,240
 and make a suggestion in them, whether or not they follow it is where, you know, there's the skill level of the hypnotist.

225
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:59,240
 But that is something that you can learn and that's something that obviously someone who's more susceptible is going to be more susceptible to the suggestion.

226
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:08,240
 Mind control. When we're talking about someone who removed the idea of actually using hypnotic techniques to lull someone down,

227
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:16,240
 there, I would believe that there would be people out there who could, because I believe that there are some people, I don't think it's super common,

228
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,240
 but I do believe there's some people who have telepathic powers or telekinetic powers or pyrokinesis.

229
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:33,240
 I don't think it's super common. I don't think I, the chances of me ever meeting someone who has telekinesis or telepathy or anything like that is exceedingly low.

230
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:41,240
 But out of 8 billion people on the planet, I don't think the number is zero. That's just my take on it.

231
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:48,240
 I do believe it's possible and so could you have someone that could literally stand next to you and control your mind?

232
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:58,240
 That's a terrifying thought because we sometimes in the world of conspiracy theory, we would talk about government mind control, MKUltra, things like that.

233
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:07,240
 But see, even the MKUltra program, the government would spend years trying to break a human brain and then rebuild it.

234
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:17,240
 Years. Of course, they say that the program was shut down when it was exposed in the 60s, 70s. It wasn't shut down. It was renamed.

235
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:33,240
 And imagine if what would take millions of dollars in government resources, man hours and equipment and training and years to break down someone's brain and then rebuild it.

236
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,240
 And then you have a girl on a college campus who can do it mid conversation.

237
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:49,240
 It's an absolutely fascinating idea that there would be people out there like this. We don't know if there's people out there like this.

238
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:59,240
 Michael believes, though, that he may have met one and she seemed to be doing it just for fun.

239
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:10,240
 Well, $20 as well, but you know what I mean to sit there and to get someone's deepest personal secrets out of them.

240
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:18,240
 For really no reason. She didn't blackmail him. Well, you know what's funny? Because I keep going back to this. We don't know what he knows.

241
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,240
 He says, "I never gave her money again." Did you?

242
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:38,240
 I mean, you've admitted to the fact that you don't remember what the conversations are like after the fact. You may have given her money before. You may have given her the keys to your car and you just don't remember.

243
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:45,240
 Oh, I never had money on my, I never had money on me afterwards. Well, you don't know that.

244
00:26:45,240 --> 00:27:02,240
 This is so interesting. The other earlier this week we were talking about reality warping and Mandela effects and what do you remember and stuff like that. And that's, again, like the government spending millions of dollars to break someone's brain, shifting all of reality to make you forget or alien technology to wipe your mind.

245
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,240
 Here's a girl who can do it in a conversation.

246
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,240
 For no reason whatsoever.

247
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:22,240
 Now, this girl's a college sophomore. She's walking around. She might know that she has this ability. She might not. You know, there could be the chance that she just assumes everyone has this ability.

248
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:31,240
 Just like how I assumed for the first 15 years of my life that everyone had double vision. I thought everybody saw like me.

249
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:43,240
 But what happens when she realizes at a certain point that she, if she doesn't already write, she might already know that she has this ability to make people do what she wants and tell her what she wants.

250
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:51,240
 I mean, imagine if you grew up and you realize that every time you ask somebody for something, they gave it to you. Would you think that was a special power?

251
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:59,240
 You would just assume that people liked you a lot because you would see other people go up and be like, Hey, mom, can I have 10 bucks? They're like, No, you can't have 10 bucks until you clean your room.

252
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,240
 She would go up to her parents and go, Mom, can I have 10 bucks? And the mom would reach in the person give her 10 bucks.

253
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:12,240
 She would just assume that was her life. She may not even know she has this ability at all.

254
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,240
 And so when she's in a conversation, she could be like, Oh, why did you choose your major, Michael? And then he tells this deeply personal story about why he did that.

255
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,240
 And she goes, Oh, that's fascinating. Why did that? And so it could be that she doesn't know. It could be that she does.

256
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:36,240
 And she's purposely manipulating people to get what she wants. And she wants to know people's dark secrets and she wants to make them stress out or possibly even fail these tests.

257
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,240
 She could be a supervillain. The question is, where is she now?

258
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:49,240
 Because if she doesn't know she has this ability, she could easily just find her way into a sales job.

259
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,240
 She just figures she has a certain charm about her and she goes in the interview, she gets the job, obviously.

260
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:07,240
 And she's the best salesman on the force. It seems like she can sell anything and she works her way up through the company, stops me in a salesman, becomes a manager, then becomes regional manager, and then vice president.

261
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,240
 She moves her way up through the company. That's if she doesn't know she has this power.

262
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:23,240
 But if she knows she can control people's minds, if she knows that if she asks someone for money and they have it, they will give it to her whether or not they can afford it.

263
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:35,240
 And if they don't have any cash on them, then she can have him go to an ATM, pull the money out, bring it to her, and then completely wipe his memory that he did that.

264
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:43,240
 So he goes, "I never gave her money after that. I only had a card on me." She asked, but I didn't have any cash.

265
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:51,240
 If we're talking someone of that power level and she knows that she's unique, she might be the only person on the planet who can do that.

266
00:29:51,240 --> 00:30:01,240
 Now we're talking defense lawyer that can sway an entire jury.

267
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:09,240
 You have this stenographer typing out each word said, but even she can't fully remember what she wrote.

268
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:25,240
 You could have an actor who is somehow able to amplify her power that when you see her, whether she is on stage or in a movie theater, from a film that was shot a year ago,

269
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:33,240
 somehow every performance she gives, you believe.

270
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:45,240
 You're in rapture when you watch her on the silver screen and you can't wait to see her next movie.

271
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:52,240
 Or she turns to politics.

272
00:30:52,240 --> 00:31:01,240
 You find herself winning a local seat on the city council, then mayor.

273
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:12,240
 This young woman who seems to know exactly what the people want is soon tapped to run for state senate.

274
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:20,240
 Whether or not you agree with her politics, you find yourself going, "You know what, that young girl?"

275
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,240
 She seems to have a good head on her shoulders.

276
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:33,240
 Whether or not you agree with her point of view, you always find yourself in the ballot box voting for her.

277
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:46,240
 And as her political power expands, so does the power inside of Clario, most likely a nickname that she left behind when she moved on from college.

278
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:57,240
 Young woman slowly making her way through the world with the power that most would call impossible.

279
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:09,240
 But if you have the ability to control minds, truly the only limit would be what you were willing to use it for.

280
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,240
 That would be the only limiter on you.

281
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:26,240
 If you knew that you could stare at someone and have them do whatever you wanted to, the only thing stopping you from committing the most heinous acts is your own moral code.

282
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:33,240
 Whoever Clario is, let's hope that she does have a strong moral code.

283
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:43,240
 To someone who can control one mind, is it possible for them to control all minds?

284
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,240
 The fact is we don't know, we've never experienced someone who has that type of power.

285
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,240
 Even the power to control one mind, it's a hypothetical.

286
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:08,240
 But if Michael's story is true, if you can control one mind, could you control all minds at once?

287
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,240
 The answer is we don't know.

288
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,240
 The answer is we'll never know.

289
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:37,240
 Because if Clario ever controlled everything we do, at the same time she could completely erase any trace of her existence.

290
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:47,240
 We could all be puppets on 8 billion separate strings, and we don't even know.

291
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,240
 We have a master.

292
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,240

 Tiktok is at Dead Rabbit Radio.

295
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,240
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

296
