1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
 China has a new export. Something totally gross.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we continue our stay in China to see if there's any truth to the rumor that they are working on a time machine.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,800
 And then we travel to Japan to look at a long running mystery that I explored in the early days of this show.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
 The man from Toret.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,800
 A man supposedly arrived at a Tokyo airport with a passport showing he was from a country that never existed.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,800
 And then he mysteriously vanished before he could be asked more questions.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,800
 Ladies and gentlemen, we found him. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:49,800
 [Music]

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,800
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover and we don't have a time machine, so we just got to get going.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,800
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy patreons, a longtime supporter of the show.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:13,800
 One of the veterans of the Dead Rabbit Discord. It's Swain on Discord. Everyone give a round of applause as he is coming in on his own time machine.

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:20,800
 The future is awesome, Jason. We are all super cool. So everyone give Swain the high five for giving us the great new Swain.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,800
 You're going to be our captain. You can get rid of that time machine. I'm going to give you the keys to a blimp.

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys aren't from the future, that's fine too.

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,800
 Just help us heard the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot. We're going to have flyers in the show notes below.

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,800
 You can start passing those out. Stuart Meatball already said when Scotland reopens, he's going to be plastering. He said the entire country.

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,800
 He said every single square foot will have a Dead Rabbit Radio banner there. So thank you, Stuart. I want photos.

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 I want photos, but you guys can also spread the word however you spread the word. Get the word out about the show.

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 Swain, I promise you, I'm going to talk to you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 We are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out to China.

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 It's November 2018 and Swain, I want you to take us down right over there. It's at Kagmen County in China.

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,800
 And as we're flying over this town, we see a bunch of police fans.

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:39,800
 [Singing]

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:46,800
 The officers are overwhelmed and they know where the scent is coming from. They see all these buckets full of this liquid.

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 Just bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop just sitting there. There wasn't actually bubbling. It's not a witch's cauldron.

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,800
 But as some of the cops are rounding up the perps, the suspects, the other cops are daring each other to go near these buckets.

28
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:11,800
 [Singing]

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 He's like, "The intel was right, gentlemen. The intel was right. This is a counterfeit condom factory."

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,800
 These condoms were dissolving. They had holes in them. Basically, all the things you don't want a condom to have other than lice.

31
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 These were counterfeit condoms and people were suspicious because generally a pack of condoms cost, you know, like a couple bucks.

32
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:44,800
 There were stores in the area that were selling condoms for 15 cents each. That's a gamble.

33
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,800
 That's a gamble if you're willing to trust a 15-cent condom.

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,800
 That's a game. And that's in their currency. I actually had to do currency conversions. Not like, "Well, maybe 15 cents is different in China."

35
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,800
 No, it's the equivalent of US 15 cents. The people were like, "There's no way these can be legit."

36
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,800
 And the guy with like 10 babies is like, "Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're faulty."

37
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,800
 But not only were they making counterfeit condoms, 'cause you know that's weird, but is it Dead Rabbit Radio Weird?

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,800
 No, what this next detail is, they sold $7 million worth of counterfeit condoms, but how do you counterfeit a condom?

39
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 The condoms were used previously. They were collecting used condoms and washing them off in silicon gel and then repackaging them.

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:42,800
 When the cops busted in, they had a bunch of Durex cardboard containers at the warehouse, which is great advertising for Durex brand condoms.

41
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,800
 Whenever you see this now, you're gonna be like, "I don't know about that, honey."

42
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:55,800
 Durex brand condoms were having $7 million worth at 15 cents each sold. They were all used condoms.

43
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 So that's borderline paranormal. How do you collect $7 million worth of used condoms?

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,800
 That's mind-boggling. It's not like they just sold the same condom over and over and over again.

45
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
 How would you get that many condoms? Where are they collecting these condoms from?

46
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,800
 Do they have like a giant bucket outside of like a shop or McDonald's or something like that?

47
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 It's like, "Dispose of your condoms." How do you collect that many condoms? I don't get it.

48
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,800
 How do you collect? I can understand if they were making condoms like subpar condoms that had holes in them and they dissolved and things like that.

49
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:38,800
 But how do you collect used condoms? I really can... I can understand collecting maybe like 5 or 10 at like a frat house on a Friday night.

50
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 But $7 million worth? I don't even think the entire U.S. college system uses $7 million worth of condoms that are 15 cents each.

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,800
 I'm sure they probably use that much if they're paying full, legit full prices for Trojan brand condoms.

52
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,800
 But Durex brand, Durex brand, I just... that boggles my mind.

53
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,800
 It's possible that the only way to collect this many used condoms is by using a time machine, huh?

54
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,800
 You like that segue? You like that segue/shive? Nothing else to say about that story?

55
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,800
 Other than the fact that a bunch of police broke into a room full of used condoms and buckets that were slowly soaking?

56
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,800
 That's the one crime the cops did not steal any evidence from the evidence locker. They're like, "No way! I'll take all that crack though!"

57
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,800
 Swain on discord since I've insulted the Chinese police. Let's get out of here before they arrest us and dunk our heads in the condom-soaked silicon jail.

58
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 I'm gonna toss you the keys of the Jason's Loppy. Go, go, go, go, go! We are leaving behind Cangan County and we are headed to a top secret location in China.

59
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,800
 Car is slowly but surely traveling through China and the police have just given up.

60
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,800
 Then let's go get some of that sweet, sweet crack out of the evidence locker.

61
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,800
 This is a weird story. It's one of those stories that popped up. I was expecting a couple of you guys to suggest it.

62
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 I was expecting it to hit the paranormal community pretty hard and nothing actually waited on it.

63
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,800
 I go ahead, it's gonna be a big thing. I usually don't cover well-known topics. The Hipster Paranormal Podcast, the Red Radio.

64
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
 No, I figure you guys have learned about it in other places. There's no point in rehashing it.

65
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:29,800
 No, this one, like the Army Hammer story, just kind of existed in a moment and the paranormal conspiracy community just didn't seem to know about it, I guess.

66
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,800
 I don't know. I find it incredibly fascinating. The ramifications of it are quite chilling.

67
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:45,800
 What happened recently was a leaked PowerPoint, a PowerPoint project or program or slideshow, however you want to say it, was leaked.

68
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:54,800
 So what the story is, is this. There is a group known as "Shinaxi Routai Technology".

69
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:05,800
 And apparently this PowerPoint says that this group is working with the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of High Energy Physics, which is a government-run group.

70
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:18,800
 And then you have this private sector group. They are working on something known as the "Space Time Tunnel Generation Experimental Device" or as an acronym, "Stegged".

71
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 Which they didn't say that. I just said that. I don't know if they're actually going around calling it "Stegged".

72
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 But the "Space Time Tunnel". According to this PowerPoint, what this device will be able to do is distort time and space, control the rate and flow of time.

73
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:40,800
 Specifically, it does mention time travel. It also says "Interstellar Voyage Life Extension" "Breakthrough the Barrier of Time and Space".

74
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,800
 It's not something they're saying, you know, if we use this machine, it might make a light particle move forward like 10 nanoseconds.

75
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,800
 They're saying, "No, this will actually have time travel abilities. It will have real-world applications".

76
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,800
 It also says they are going to pick a location. They need 16 acres to build this thing.

77
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,800
 And they expect it to be ready 7 to 12 months after they receive funding.

78
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:10,800
 The PowerPoint also explains that Nobel Laureate Gao Kun has recognized and praised the device.

79
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,800
 So this PowerPoint gets leaked and the Chinese Academy had to come forward and say, "None of that is true".

80
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,800
 "None of that is true. We're not building a time machine. We don't know why we're being linked to this thing".

81
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,800
 The group, the "Shinaxi Rutai Technology Group" came out and they said, "We are not building a time machine".

82
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,800
 They said, "We know how the information got out there". Apparently, they were working with a financing group.

83
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 And this was some mock-up that was made that got released.

84
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,800
 Now that makes sense. And the Nobel Laureate Gao Kun doesn't exist.

85
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,800
 And the "Shinaxi Rutai Technology Group" has only been around since December 2020.

86
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,800
 So those are all red flags. When the people are looking at this, when journalists are looking at this,

87
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,800
 they see that the Nobel Laureate doesn't exist, the company is brand new.

88
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
 What are the chances of any of this actually being real?

89
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,800
 It probably is a financing presentation that everyone thought was funny until it accidentally got leaked and they all have egg on their face.

90
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,800
 Here's the thing. Of course China is working on a time machine. 100% they're working on a time machine.

91
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
 America is working on a time machine, Russia is working on a time machine.

92
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,800
 Every country that has any money to burn, and even if you don't, you don't really have to worry about your bank account.

93
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,800
 You have a time machine, you just go back in time and you're stealing jewels from Robin Hood,

94
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,800
 or you could just mine the same gold mine over and over again, or you don't even need to do that.

95
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 You have a time machine, you just gamble. Every country is working on a time machine.

96
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,800
 You will always hear this stuff about CIA was trying to send asterially projected people to Mars and the ministerry goats.

97
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,800
 If they're willing to do stuff like that, they're working on time machines.

98
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 So of course there were, I mean this story itself may be a financial mock-up, but of course China is trying to build a time machine.

99
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 You would be stupid if you weren't. You would be stupid if you weren't spending at least a million dollars a year trying to figure out time travel.

100
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 Because that's the end of it. Whoever figures out time travel first wins.

101
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 You would be dumb if you didn't have 0.5% of your budget earmarked for time travel and you just have it filed to something else.

102
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,800
 Because we're spending money on literally every other thing.

103
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 Trying to build psychic armies, kidnapping kids for super soldiers, stuff like that, all those other things.

104
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 Build a time machine, everything else becomes irrelevant.

105
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:35,800
 What's interesting is all the articles on this is like, "China's building a time machine!" Apparently Jerry Seinfeld's now the news announcer, "China's building a time machine!"

106
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 But it was just a financial mock-up. The company is only a couple months old and this Nobel laureate doesn't exist.

107
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:49,800
 But is that true? Because with the time machine, it could have been true.

108
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 And now it's not.

109
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,800
 Chenaxi Rutai could have been around for the past 50 years.

110
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 And Nobel laureate Gao Kun has always been the head of "Can we actually achieve time travel?"

111
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,800
 And he had spent his entire career with that theory in mind.

112
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,800
 So when he backed this project, everyone was like, "There must be something to this thing."

113
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 But then someone in another country flipped a switch.

114
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,800
 This is a startup company that Nobel laureate never existed.

115
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:28,800
 They say World War III will be fought with nukes and World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.

116
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:37,800
 But with the time machine, there will never be another war. Just countless victories across time.

117
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 We would never know the battle even happened. We would just exist at the whims of our time lords.

118
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,800
 So hopefully it's someone who's not morally bankrupt who actually has this time machine swaying on discord.

119
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,800
 I'm going to give you the keys to the Carpentercopter. We're going to escape from this time vortex that's about to swallow up China.

120
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 We are leaving behind the country. We are going to outrun this time vortex that's quickly swallowing up the past and we are headed out to Japan.

121
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,800
 This is a fascinating story we're about to cover.

122
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:23,800
 The Man From Toured is one of my favorite paranormal stories. I actually covered it on episode 15 of this podcast.

123
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:31,800
 That was week 3. It was a more well-known story and again I normally cover well-known stories, but I love that story so much.

124
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,800
 I wanted to cover it like I was one of the stories that I needed to cover right away. The Man From Toured.

125
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:48,800
 I'll do a quick recap, but before we get there I need to give some shout outs. First off, we're going to give a shout out to Teso8 on YouTube.

126
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 They're the ones who actually recommended this story to me. I did not see this pop up and they said, "Hey, did you hear that the Man From Toured had been solved?"

127
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,800
 So hats off to you. Really, really great story. I also want to give a shout out to two Reddit users who did a bunch of research on this.

128
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:13,800
 Tara Ochi and Naught Carge. And also I got a bulk of my information from kookscience.com. So great research, everyone.

129
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:21,800
 Here we go. The Man From Toured is a very mysterious story. It's one of my favorites. It has to do with portals, alternate dimensions, time travels, things like that.

130
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:33,800
 In 1954, a plane landed in Tokyo. And a man tried to enter the country of Japan. He's at this airport in Tokyo and when they see his passport it says that he's from the country of Toured.

131
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,800
 It's not a real country. It doesn't exist. So the Japanese authorities are like, "What are you... This is not real."

132
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:50,800
 The guy got on a huge argument with him. He goes, "Yeah, it's in between Spain and France." He gets in this argument with him and he starts talking about these places that no one there has heard of.

133
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 The Japanese officials are calling in their supervisors. They're like, "There is no Toured." And that's when they brought a map out and they said, "Where isn't?"

134
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 And he pointed to, in between Spain and France, he goes, "There it is." And they said, "Listen, as far as we know, this is a forged document. You're an alien. His eyes move from side to side.

135
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 They're like, not a space alien." He's like, "Woo! They don't suspect that." They go, "We're going to put you in a hotel and we're going to have to question you.

136
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:23,800
 We can't let you just walk around the country that is not safe for anybody." So they put him up in a hotel until they can figure out if he's a spy or something like that.

137
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:31,800
 And then the next day when they go to question him, he ordered a bunch of room service. They see a bunch of plates outside his door. They're like, "Ahh, Toured!"

138
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:40,800
 Before they can go question him, they go to his hotel room. He's gone. And the story always says like the hotel room was on the ninth floor or the eighth floor or something like that.

139
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:48,800
 So the implication is that he vanished. He went back to his reality, which is I think how I ended my episode.

140
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,800
 I love portal stories. I love alternate dimension stories. I love The Man from Toured.

141
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:03,800
 The earliest version of that story we see is in a book written in 1981 called The Directory of Possibilities by Colin Wilson and John Grant.

142
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 Colin Wilson is one of my favorite authors. So the fact that he was a part of this mystery as well, Colin Wilson is one of my favorite authors as well.

143
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,800
 It is a lot of true crime stuff and paranormal stuff. He's passed away, unfortunately, by now.

144
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,800
 So that was one of the earliest mentions of this was in 1981. This book is a very short paragraph.

145
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 It's basically what I just told you in 1954. A man got off a plane. His passport said that he was from Toured and he mysteriously disappeared.

146
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:39,800
 Very, very short paragraph. And then over the years, over the decades, it's gone to include details about him disappearing from the hotel, the map, and pointing at the map.

147
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 That was an end of the 1981 version. But you figured, you know, there must be other sources out there, but Colin Wilson and John Grant's was the earliest version of that.

148
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
 But the legend's grown slightly, but it never got too big.

149
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,800
 But what's so interesting about this is the way that these things just kind of shake out in the end.

150
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:13,800
 It really gives a lot of hope to us paranormal researchers that huge mysteries like the Altlov Pass, the Yuba County Five, which are basically the same story, just different locations, can be solved.

151
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,800
 The lead man masks, the people with the lead masks. Those really, really popular ones.

152
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,800
 Because what happened was, Teriochi's from Japan. Reddit user Teriochi is from Japan.

153
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 And they just randomly heard about this Man From Toured story. They just came across it on Reddit.

154
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,800
 I think someone was posting, "I'm doing a research paper on the Man From Toured. Does anyone have any information on that?"

155
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:43,800
 And Teriochi looks at it and goes, "I've never heard of this story. I'm going to look into this mystery."

156
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 Now this mystery has been going on from at least 1981 to now.

157
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,800
 It may have been around before, but the earliest version we can find written down is 1981.

158
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 1981 to 2021. Teriochi did it, did it, did it.

159
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 Figured it out. Several Japanese newspaper articles were written about this case.

160
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,800
 From the time the plane landed to the time he got sentenced to prison. Here's what happened.

161
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:19,800
 John Allen Kuchar Zurgis wanted to fly the world in style.

162
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,800
 But he's just the shlub. He's just the dude. So he made up a new identity.

163
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,800
 This is 100%. There's several articles on this. There's a couple articles in English as well.

164
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,800
 And then the Japanese articles. This was cited at the British House of Parliaments.

165
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,800
 I'm a shock that everyone missed this, including me. It's very, very well documented.

166
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 John Allen Kuchar Zurgis wanted to create a new identity. Give a little pizzazz to him.

167
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,800
 He wanted to be like a secret agent. He was working for these other governments.

168
00:18:49,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 And when he landed in Tokyo, he had a passport. And this passport was, quote, "stamped as issued at Taman Rasset, the capital of Torred, south of the Sahara."

169
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:12,800
 Unquote. So there we look at the first confirmation that there was a man with a passport from Torred.

170
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 There is a difference in the location. We were always told it was between France and Spain.

171
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 It actually turns out that he said it was south of the Sahara.

172
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 But other than that detail, it pretty much matches up the story. He lands in Tokyo.

173
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,800
 The officials stop him, and he's been traveling all over the world. It is stamped in other countries.

174
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
 They were able to backtrack what this guy was up to.

175
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
 The Tokyo officials took a real close look at it, and they go, "Where's Torred?"

176
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:46,800
 They bring out a map. That actually happened. That was part of the original story, and he couldn't show on the map where Torred was.

177
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,800
 There was no him pointing at it and being like, "No, no, it's here. It's here. It must be an alternate reality." None of that stuff.

178
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,800
 Some of the articles difference in the spelling of the word "Torred."

179
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 But other than that, everything matches.

180
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,800
 There's a version of the story that's told in a Vancouver newspaper. I was able to look at a clipping of that newspaper.

181
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
 I wasn't able to get the name of it.

182
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,800
 But there was another version of the story, published in a Japanese newspaper, the Yomari Shimbun.

183
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,800
 The August 10th, 1960 version of the newspaper. This is also scanned in.

184
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,800
 You can read Japanese. You can read it. It's all going to be the show notes if you can't read Japanese.

185
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
 But you can read English, the Vancouver articles in the show notes.

186
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,800
 In the Japanese newspaper, it says, "This event happened on October 17th, 1959."

187
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 We actually have the date. It was a couple years off of what we were told.

188
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:42,800
 But on October 17th, 1959, John Allen Kuchar-Zergis, Lans in Tokyo, it also says his wife was with him.

189
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,800
 That would have made a completely different story as well.

190
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,800
 Because that would be less mysterious, I think, if him and his wife were there and she's like,

191
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 "Oh, John, John, you're not from Torred. We've been caught. We've been hoodwinked."

192
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,800
 The fact that it was a lone traveler made it seem more mysterious like it could possibly happen.

193
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,800
 One person coming from an alternate universe probably, but the man and his wife, he's like,

194
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
 "Oh, man, I wish I left you five universes back."

195
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,800
 He's like, "Who's that, Kenny Youngman?"

196
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 "Who else is 80 years old and knows a 'Hinney Youngman' joke?"

197
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 "Is that even his name? Is it Kenny Youngman?"

198
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 "Take my wife, interdimensional portal. Please."

199
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 Anyways, let's get back to the topic at hand.

200
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,800
 Benny Youngman. Wait, what was it? Doesn't matter.

201
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
 There's nothing to it with the man from Torred.

202
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
 He had his wife with him.

203
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,800
 And this isn't just these articles running these goofy stories.

204
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
 He was taken to court. He was actually sentenced to prison for this.

205
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
 He went to prison for a year.

206
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,800
 And the Japanese article says what happened was at his trial when he was found guilty.

207
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
 He had glass hidden in his mouth, a little piece of glass.

208
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,800
 He spit it out and began trying to cut his wrist open until Japanese officers dragged him away

209
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
 and threw him in prison for a year.

210
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,800
 So it's not like these articles are like, "You want to hear a wacky story like the Haunted Taxi Cab story

211
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 that we did on Monday?" No. There's court documents.

212
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,800
 The court's sonographer isn't making up a story.

213
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 She's like, "This will be super spooky someday."

214
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 This actually happened.

215
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 We do know the man from Torred now was a man named John Allen Kuchar-Zergus,

216
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
 who was committing fraud.

217
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,800
 He made a fake passport and was traveling the world in style.

218
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,800
 This was actually mentioned in a meeting with the British House of Commons

219
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
 on July 29th, 1960.

220
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 One of the MPs said, "Hey, remember when this happened?

221
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,800
 We just had a good check on it. It had to do with what he was talking about."

222
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,800
 But so it wasn't a super well-known story, but it wasn't completely obscure either.

223
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 It was being reported here and there.

224
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
 It's weird that it completely got forgotten.

225
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,800
 So by 1960, this stuff was being published next to every other article in the news.

226
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
 These weren't "Flights of Fancy." This actually happened.

227
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 And then 21 years later, it's being told as, "Here's a mysterious story.

228
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,800
 One day a man landed with a passport from a country that doesn't exist,

229
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 and then he disappeared.

230
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,800
 He disappeared and in the Japanese prison system is what happened."

231
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,800
 And from 1981 to now, the story has had even more details added to it.

232
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,800
 The idea of alternate realities, the idea of him disappearing magically from the hotel,

233
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,800
 back to his home dimension, but it was a guy who was committing fraud.

234
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,800
 I find this ending to the story, "The Man from Toread," absolutely fascinating.

235
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,800
 Sure, it would be great to be appeared from that home dimension and goes,

236
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,800
 "Hey, everyone, I have developed the ability to travel through dimensions.

237
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,800
 You have to fly on planes to do it. It's kind of like flying a plane,

238
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
 but you can just travel back and forth."

239
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 And then we would have proof of alternate dimensions and realities,

240
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 and he can finally bring me back my Bernstein Bear collections.

241
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 He's like, "Here's the true spelling world."

242
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 That's not the fact. That's not the fact of the matter.

243
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,800
 It was a man who lived on this reality who was committing fraud.

244
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,800
 And that to me is honestly just as interesting,

245
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,800
 because on this show we talk about not just the conspiracies and the paranormal stories,

246
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,800
 but a lot of times I like to look at why they exist, how they're formed.

247
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 And this is a perfect example of that.

248
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 People getting little details wrong until the wrong details became the real details.

249
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 And Colin Wilson is a huge name in true crime and paranormal literature,

250
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,800
 of the 70s to the 90s.

251
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 So you can be the best of the best and still get details wrong.

252
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 And his whole book wasn't about "The Man from Toread."

253
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
 It was almost like just an aside.

254
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,800
 It was literally two or three sentences.

255
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:46,800
 But it was a story I'm sure that he had heard that had morphed from 1960 to the time he was typing it down.

256
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,800
 It didn't really pay him much thought. It was just a weird story he was going to put in his book.

257
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,800
 And from those two or three paragraphs, it became a thing.

258
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 It became a story.

259
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 It became one of my favorite paranormal stories.

260
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 And I repeat it.

261
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 On episode 15 of a podcast that's lasted 625, 26 episodes,

262
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 I wanted to tell the story that badly.

263
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
 I got it out right away.

264
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,800
 But the end was immigration fraud.

265
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
 I find that fascinating.

266
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,800
 And it makes me think, this guy, he just heard the story on Reddit and he goes,

267
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 "Oh, I'm going to look into this."

268
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 And he started just kind of poking around and found these Japanese articles.

269
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 And he's like, "Oh, it was a court trial. Like this is totally solvable."

270
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,800
 It was solvable in 1960. It was solvable in 1981.

271
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,800
 It just took someone who had no connection to the story to look into it.

272
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,800
 So it makes you wonder, I know there's that thing, and I got a couple requests to do it as well,

273
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 but the D'Altlaw of Pass being solved with the Avalanche simulator.

274
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 And I appreciate it. I got a lot of requests to do that one.

275
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,800
 But it was super big news, and again, I didn't want to rehash it,

276
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 but I appreciate all the requests that came in to do that story.

277
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,800
 But D'Altlaw of Pass, they said it was an Avalanche.

278
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,800
 To me, that's a theory. Like, we don't know. That was just a theory.

279
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 And someone ran a snow simulation using the computer graphics from Frozen,

280
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,800
 using the physics from the movie Frozen.

281
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 Maybe. But this is actually documented.

282
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 We have an answer. This is a firm answer to the man from Torrid.

283
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
 You can't refute this now.

284
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 You can't say, "Oh, it was fake news. It was fake news that never happened."

285
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 A newspaper in 1960 knew we'd be talking about this all this time later.

286
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 No, it's provably the story's false. The story is not real.

287
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,800
 And if you didn't catch it, everything in this episode was fake.

288
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 The stories were real, but they're all fake condoms,

289
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 and is there really a time machine being built? Not officially.

290
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 And then this story, I kind of built them around this theme of,

291
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 "Stuff isn't as it seems."

292
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,800
 I mean, hopefully it's just a Torrid story,

293
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,800
 and not the condom that's dissolving on you while you're having sex.

294
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 You know, I'd rather this story be fake than that one,

295
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
 but I'm not saying it's fake that I'm trying to trick you,

296
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,800
 that all of these stories are based on things that were false,

297
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
 but the man from Torrid was provably false,

298
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 and no one knew it until someone from outside the story showed up.

299
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,800
 So is it possible at some point someone's going to walk in

300
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 and have the answer to the Yuba County Five?

301
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
 I'll put those Yuba County Five episodes in the show,

302
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,800
 and I don't know if I really like that one, but it's a group of people who went missing.

303
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,800
 There might be someone who's never looked at this stuff before,

304
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,800
 who either has the right information or knows where to look, or both,

305
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,800
 and they solve it instantly.

306
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
 And to me, that makes the search for truth even more exciting.

307
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
 Because it means that the truth is out there.

308
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,800
 It may not always be the paranormal answer, but at least it's an answer.

309
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,800
 We now know the truth behind the story of Man of Torrid,

310
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 and it doesn't make it any less interesting.

311
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,800
 It just makes the world's mysteries seem solvable,

312
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 and that is an exciting future.
