1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,620
 A terrible crime spree, an unfortunate accident, and then we travel to Spain, where a family

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:18,080
 in the 1930s was constantly being harassed by a goblin who lived in their chimney.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,040
 Sounds like a folktale, but when you had hundreds of police officers descend on the scene, everyone

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:31,040
 heard the voice of the goblin of Zargosa, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:39,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,960
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
 I really, really do.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,800
 You know, I don't think I'm gonna do anything special for Christmas.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
 I haven't figured that out yet.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,320
 I kinda, that live Thanksgiving episode, that live episode on YouTube, it took an odd amount

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,760
 of energy out of me, and I had fun doing it, but yeah, it kinda worn me out.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,280
 I'm not still worn out, I'm not all, uh, now, but it was at the perfect time, it was at

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,080
 the end of the season and everything, like, I don't know if I could pull something like

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,640
 that off at the beginning of the season.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,240
 I'll probably do something for Christmas, but I don't think it'll be a live episode

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,040
 or anything streaming wise.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,760
 You know, and I'll address this now actually, I was gonna talk about this a couple days

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
 ago.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,840
 You know, YouTube is making a big push, their anti-bullying push.

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,640
 So, obviously this show can be considered bullying for some things, 'cause I'm debunking

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,440
 or making fun of topics.

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,400
 I got accused of bullying the Forrest Finn people, I got accused of bullying Hans, and

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
 all these other groups.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,400
 Now, is it bullying?

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
 No, not really, but I mean, the argument could be made.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,840
 I don't believe it is, I think I'm attacking the beliefs, not the person behind the beliefs,

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
 but.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,000
 So, I don't know how much I'm gonna invest in a YouTube infrastructure at this point.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,800
 'Cause all it takes is for me to do one too many episodes on some weirdo group, and the

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,040
 channel gets demonetized, which isn't a huge issue, but the channel getting taken down

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
 and things like that.

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,920
 So, I don't know how much I'm actually going to be looking at doing video or building up

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,000
 the YouTube structure.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,520
 We'll still continue to post our episodes on YouTube as long as we can, but if the channel

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,200
 gets taken down, we're just gonna be doing it on the podcast apps.

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,960
 And we're everywhere that podcasts are available.

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,640
 iTunes, Stitcher, Spotify, if you can listen, I listen to it on Podcast Addict, anywhere

39
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,600
 there's a podcast feed, Dead Rabbit Radio is there, plus you can listen to it online as

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,560
 well if you go to DeadRabbit.com, you can listen to it there.

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,600
 If the channel, I don't think anything's gonna happen anytime soon with YouTube, but that

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
 may happen.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,960
 So, I don't know how much I'm going to be, I was originally going to, you know, get

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,200
 some Adobe software and start working on video editing and stuff like that, and I just

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
 don't know if that's feasible for this show.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,360
 'Cause it's not a bullying show, but you listen to how many episodes do I make fun of people's

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,960
 weirdo beliefs, weird new-agey or cultish or dangerous ideas that, you know, the channel

48
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,760
 could get taken down for all that stuff.

49
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,760
 We may end up just going strictly to being a podcast, which is how I always envisioned

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,680
 the show, and it was, sorry YouTube guys, we're gonna keep putting it out as long as

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,320
 we can, but that is unfortunately the brave new world that we live in.

52
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
 Just putting that out there.

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,080
 Let's go ahead though and get started with this episode.

54
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,160
 And we're gonna start off this episode, let's go ahead and hop in the Carvener Coptor.

55
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,960
 So get on in guys.

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,320
 We're flying away, we are flying out to Nigeria.

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,480
 It's November 2019, so super recent.

58
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,480
 We land.

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,320
 Oh, and also we have a new Patreon, Kyle Blank.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,200
 Kyle Blank, thank you so much for supporting the show, really, really appreciate that.

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
 Means a lot.

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,240
 And if you can't support the Patreon, get the word out about the show, that helps a

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,400
 lot as well, so thank you very much Kyle.

64
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,760
 We jump off the helicopter because Kyle is our Patreon for this episode, we're gonna

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,280
 give him the honor of carrying all of our luggage, we're like, ah, giving it to him,

66
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,800
 he's like, ah, thank you Jason for this great honor.

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,280
 I'm buying more luggage in Nigeria, I'm like, hey, can I, can I look at your heaviest suitcases

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,600
 just to give it to Kyle, he's like, ah.

69
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,680
 Anyways we're in Nigeria, we're in the Yukiri community in Edo state.

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,920
 And there's this woman named Ekater, Ekater, and an unnamed husband, and I know what you're

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
 thinking, this story's fake.

72
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,760
 Now generally when we come across stories and we don't have people's names, they tend

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,440
 to be fake, we don't have her, her name is Ekater, I believe that's the last name in

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,480
 the region because I was looking this stuff up, but we don't have any information here.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:51,240
 Anyways, long story short, she accuses him of cheating on her, and he slaps her, ah,

76
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,840
 we're just looking at all this through the window, we're like, oh that's horrible, that's

77
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,880
 horrible, Jason this is a horrible story, this isn't funny, and I'm like, I know, but

78
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:08,280
 it's about to get funny, kind of, kind of, if you enjoy human suffering, he slaps her,

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,640
 and she then reaches into his pants, I didn't know this was possible, I know it's possible

80
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,440
 to reach into people's pants, but I didn't know this second part was possible, she reaches

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:25,520
 into his pants, she grabs his testicles, and squeezes so hard, he dies, kills him, kills

82
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,840
 him on the spot, and she gets arrested and she says that the devil possessed her, now

83
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,560
 you may or may not believe in demonic possessions or the devil himself, however, I think the

84
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,200
 ability to squeeze testicles so hard and kill someone is definitely a demonic power, is

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,920
 definitely something that most humans don't have, but I would be wrong and so would you

86
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,480
 if you agreed with me, because it's not the first time that's happened, hop back in the

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,200
 carbonic hop to your leg, you're like, ah, you're like holding your legs, unless you're

88
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,560
 a woman then you're like, this story doesn't affect me at all, I guess it still would affect

89
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,480
 you, I remember once I kneaded this chick on accident, right between the legs and dropped

90
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,840
 her, because it's the same thing, like you have, that's your reproductive organs, right,

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,240
 it's like punching a bear in the nose, not like their nose is a reproductive organ, but

92
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,480
 it's a soft spot, I remember once, I've actually done it multiple times, but I remember the

93
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,240
 first time I did it, I was surprised because I accidentally kneaded this girl between the

94
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
 legs and she dropped, and then I remember, I don't know, a year or two later, I was with

95
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,440
 this other girl, and we were laying down and I moved very quickly and I kneaded her right

96
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,920
 between the legs and she was all, ahhh, now guys have been kicked between the legs all

97
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,800
 the time, I mean, we're not all stuntmen or we're not all members of the jackass crew,

98
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,680
 but I remember once I hit myself with a lead pipe between the legs and I was like, ahhh,

99
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,400
 it just caught the tip and that was bad enough, I'm like, oh, but I think eventually you

100
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,320
 catch so many baseballs to the crotch, that still hurts, I'm not diminishing that, but

101
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,360
 a woman who's never been in a fight, who's never been kicked between the legs, it's

102
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,640
 some brand, it's like an astronaut landing on the moon for the first time, she has no

103
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,480
 idea what to expect, anyways, so yeah, women can also be like, ahhh, anyways, June 20th,

104
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,800
 we're back in the Garbinder Copter, we're headed to India, it's June 2017, there's

105
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,000
 a cock fight, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, these roosters are pecking at each

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,040
 other, I guess Puerto Rico just made cock fighting legal or made it more legal, I don't

107
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,600
 think people weren't cock fighting down there, I mean, people cock fight everywhere, but

108
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,440
 I guess now it's legal, blah blah blah blah, these big chickens, it's brutal dude, they

109
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,880
 have metal beaks, well, they have regular beaks but then they have like a little armor

110
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,800
 put on them and then they get these gauntlets, like these Wolverine claws on their feet,

111
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,960
 super brutal, they just attack each other, now there's a man and his wife watching their

112
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:00,840
 rooster fight another rooster here in India, it's Saitola India and rooster, their rooster

113
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,960
 loses, now I don't know if they fight to the death, they might just fight to the point

114
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,720
 where the one rooster is just laying against the ring and just waving the other guy off,

115
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,800
 but most likely the loser does get turned into chicken nuggets, husband and wife start

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,760
 fighting over the fact that their rooster lost and you're like, oh, okay, is this story

117
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:30,800
 Jason, is this story gonna end with the wife squeezing the dudes, not so hardy guys, no,

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,400
 don't interrupt me, don't interrupt me, as we're having this conversation, Kyle's getting

119
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,960
 attacked by roosters, he's still holding all of our luggage, people are like Jason, we're

120
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,280
 gonna donate to your Patreon, they died, you're having Kyle Blankett attacked by roosters

121
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,160
 while he's still holding our luggage, while we're having this argument and we hear Kyle

122
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,000
 go, ah, he can't see what's attacking him, he has bunch of suitcases in front of him,

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,120
 but no, she does not reach into her husband's pants and destroy his testicles, that is not

124
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,880
 true, her father-in-law, her father-in-law steps in between the couple and goes, hey

125
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,760
 guys, break it up, it's really not, ah, he's trying to break up this fight, she reaches

126
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:21,800
 into her father-in-law's pants and squeezes his testicles so hard, he dies on the spot,

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,040
 it's a real thing, it's an actual real thing, she said it was an accident, I don't know

128
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,600
 how you accidentally, I accidentally have kneeed girls between the legs, okay, those

129
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,240
 are accidents, I didn't like square up and then like start running towards them, it's

130
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,360
 not an accident to reach down and then to close your fist, and then to hold on, there's

131
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,680
 multiple steps there, April, we got one more, April 2013, hop back in the Garbinder copter,

132
00:09:51,680 --> 00:10:00,600
 ah, fine, we're going to China now, now again, these stories seem suspiciously fake, because

133
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,400
 they take place in far off locations, unless you live in India, then it's across the street,

134
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,680
 but these stories are being put out in western media, so they seem a little fake, we don't

135
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,600
 have all of the names, but they're reported over and over and over again, so they're

136
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,800
 most likely real, the one, well I shouldn't say that, they're probably 50/50 real, the

137
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,440
 one in India, it says that she went to jail, but I couldn't find any follow up on the story,

138
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,840
 now we're in China, we're in a place called Hikau China, this one actually was real,

139
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,640
 there was a big court, there's trials for this, I was never able to find out what the

140
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,000
 sentence was, but there was several articles on this one in China about the trial, there's

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,480
 a woman who parks her scooter in front of a business, it hops off the scooter, okay,

142
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,680
 she's going to go shopping, she just needed a parking spot, now we're sitting across the

143
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,040
 street, all of us have our legs crossed, just in case she has testicle vision on, she's

144
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,080
 just looking for something to destroy, destroy, destroy, it's all red and for red vision,

145
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,960
 looking for heat signatures between legs, but anyways she doesn't see us, so she parks

146
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,920
 her scooter in front of a business, and the business owner comes out and goes, "hey you

147
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,920
 can't put your scooter there, that's parking for my business," and she wasn't shopping

148
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,360
 at the business, it wasn't like she was coming, he does that to every customer, he's like,

149
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,080
 "hey what are you doing, why are you parking there?" they're like, "I'm going to shop there,"

150
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,600
 and he's like, "oh come on in," I guess he knew that she wasn't going to shop there,

151
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,480
 and he comes out and he goes, "you got to move your scooter," and she looks at him

152
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,080
 and they get an argument, and then she reaches into his pants, okay so this one, again last

153
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,160
 one she reaches into his pants, or maybe outside his pants, maybe he was wearing like thin

154
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,520
 pants or spandex or something, but anyways she grabs his junk and she says, "I'll squeeze

155
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,120
 it to death, you'll never have children again," and he's first probably thinking, "I don't

156
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,840
 have children now, so technically I can't have them again," grammatically bad threat,

157
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,840
 second thought, "ah the pain, the pain," she squeezes his tentacles so hard they say with

158
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,040
 me now, explode.

159
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,240
 So Gizmodo actually, because of these articles have been going around for a while, when the

160
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,120
 Chinese article popped up Gizmodo, that website that I think just, they don't do video game

161
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,360
 reviews, but they do like nerd stuff, they looked into it and they asked the urologist,

162
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,240
 "is it possible to die from having your testicles destroyed?"

163
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,160
 The urologist said yes, there's actually a couple different things that can go on, you

164
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,720
 can get them crushed so badly that you bleed out, that it causes like internal rupturing

165
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,040
 inside of your body, and you can have a heart attack from the pain, the level of pain that's

166
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,200
 going on, there's a couple that you can go into shock and then die, there's a couple

167
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,040
 different things, well maybe you go into shock and then you fall down and hit your head, there's

168
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
 a couple different things that can happen when your testicles are squeezed, but it's

169
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,600
 definitely not outside the realm of possibility to have your testicles squeezed and die from

170
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
 it.

171
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,000
 I remember when I was in high school, I had a friend, so here we go, here we go, but

172
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,320
 I had a friend who told me this story, and he said, he said that, so my buddy, let's say

173
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,760
 his name is Jim, Jim tells me the story, he had a buddy named Tyler, again just making

174
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,160
 up the name, they were playing basketball, they were playing like junior varsity basketball

175
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,480
 game, and Tyler ended up getting knead in the nuts, really, really hard, he was going

176
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,200
 up for a shot, the other guy jumped up to block it, he just got knead in the nuts, and

177
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:29,880
 he, so if you're eating, you may want to pause, finish your food and come back to this, he

178
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,240
 gets knead, right?

179
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,560
 Now he continues, he's in pain obviously, but you got the adrenaline of the game, he

180
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:42,880
 keeps going, and then they go back to the locker room for half time, I was not a witness

181
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,760
 to this, this is a story I heard, maybe an urban legend, I don't want a doctor being

182
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,520
 like, well that's impossible, because actually I think it's quite possible, they go into

183
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,080
 the locker room, and the coach is like, come on guys, you guys got to do better, or maybe

184
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,640
 they were winning, and the coach is like, good job, I don't know the score, but they're

185
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,480
 taking their clothes off, they're getting ready to like, do they take their clothes off

186
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
 at half time?

187
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,080
 Maybe it was after the game, doesn't matter, the point is, is that my friend with the fake

188
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:19,200
 name of Jim, saw his friend with the fake name of Tyler, take his clothes off, and at

189
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,040
 that point he said that he could tell, just being a kid that something was wrong with

190
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,040
 his genitals, he said that it appeared, he goes, this is what it looked like, he goes,

191
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,640
 I look like his actual ball was busted, you have the testicular sack, and then inside it

192
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,880
 are two testes, and they're balls, they're like, I'm assuming you know human biology,

193
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,240
 and he goes, I look like one of them was busted, he goes, one side looks lopsided, and then

194
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:56,000
 I'll never forget this, this might have been the best analogy I've ever heard, so he's

195
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,560
 looking at this and he believes, and he saw the original accident, so he's thinking, oh

196
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,840
 I'll do this, this guy's ball must have got busted when he got in need so hard, he said,

197
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:13,480
 his testicle, his sack looked like, quote, a bag full of soup, and I remember laughing

198
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,040
 so hard, because that's such a perfect visual, because you have a sack, and then you just

199
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,240
 have, first off you never just put soup in a bag, so it's an alien idea to begin with,

200
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,880
 but then you have, you're looking at this bag, and you're looking at this, he could

201
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,360
 see the liquid sloshing around, which would technically be like, sperm and, not sperm,

202
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,200
 what's the stuff sperm comes in?

203
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:45,280
 Seamen, semen and blood, it was just full once, and thank you for listening to today's

204
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:51,480
 episode, people who were formally eating, come back to tomorrow's episode, so you imagine

205
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,000
 it's like, I don't know, just this white red mixture, something pink floating around in

206
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,160
 it, his testicle did end up getting exploded, he lost his testicle because of that game,

207
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,480
 I also heard a story once, when I was in middle school, there was a guy, this is most likely

208
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,760
 in urban legends, I don't know how this would happen, but there was a naked guy, one of

209
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,680
 my friends said he knew a guy, I believe the best, well sorry, this one I'm a little iffy

210
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,160
 on, but I still laughed hard, there was a naked, his friend was naked, and he was jumping

211
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:33,320
 on his bed, and then he jumped off the bed into his closet, and I don't know if my friend

212
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,280
 and then goes on a magical adventure with a witch and a lion, no, I don't, that would

213
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,720
 suck if you got teleported to an alternate dimension, like the lion, the witch and the

214
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,400
 wardrobe or something like that, while you were fully naked, you're on the toilet, you're

215
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,560
 taking a dump, and that's the day the portal opens up and then you're in like Narnia, you're

216
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,720
 like half pooping, and all of a sudden there's like a little satyr in front of you, being

217
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,000
 like ready for your adventure, anyways, where was I, oh yeah, yeah, so naked guy, my friend

218
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,400
 told me the story, but I don't know if he was there when this happened, I think you

219
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,400
 just heard about it later, the naked guy jumps off the bed and weee, into the closet, he

220
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:22,640
 jumps into the closet, his balls, his nutsack gets caught on a, now again, I don't, let

221
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,280
 me just tell you and then we'll discuss if this is possible, he jumps into the closet

222
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,760
 and his balls get stuck on a coat hanger, there's a wire coat hanger, because when I

223
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,320
 was a kid we actually had wire coat hangers, and it penetrates through the skin and like

224
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,160
 rips the ball out, so basically like the clothes hanger I guess was like, went through

225
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,760
 the scrotum, into the testicle, and then, or maybe just went into the scrotum and ripped

226
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,920
 it and his testicle like dangled out, like the ball itself dangled out, his ball came

227
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,280
 out somehow, it was hanging out and I think they had to remove it, I think it actually

228
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:05,160
 penetrated both, as you're eating, as you're eating Vienna sausages right now, you're like

229
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,960
 "Ugh, my morning is ruined Jason."

230
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,280
 I don't know if that's possible because you think about it, you jump off your bed into

231
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,120
 a closet, that's possible, jumping naked on a bed, that's possible, but how high would

232
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:26,960
 you have to jump in the coat hangers, clothes hangers are normally fairly high, they're

233
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:34,360
 on a, like a wooden beam, unless his closet floor was just a bunch of coat hangers down

234
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,200
 there, some sort of really like basic home alone trap, in case someone gets in there

235
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,160
 and they're like "Oh no, I'm mildly inconvenienced as I'm stepping on coat hangers, unless they

236
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,360
 were laying on the ground, I don't see how that's possible."

237
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,600
 But anyways, my friend told me that was true and I laughed super hard and had an odd fear

238
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,000
 of coat hangers and jumping around naked ever since.

239
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,600
 So yes, you can get killed doing that.

240
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,200
 That story went on way longer than I thought it would, we're going to skip the tragic accident

241
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,720
 story, that wasn't it, I had another story about a tragic accident, let's talk about

242
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,120
 the goblin of Zaragoza, I think I pronounced it wrong in the beginning, I almost for certain

243
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,600
 almost pronounced it wrong in the future.

244
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,320
 This is actually a recommendation from Pawn Rall, Pawn Rall been listening to the show

245
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,160
 for a long time, thank you so much.

246
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,560
 And this is an interesting story, it's from Spain, it doesn't have a ton of detail, I

247
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,120
 really want to cover it because of the implications.

248
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,560
 So I'm going to go over the narrative itself is fairly brief, we're in the year 1934, it's

249
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,360
 September 27th, there's a town called Zaragoza Spain, look at I already mispronounced, I

250
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,680
 already had to reload to see how to pronounce it.

251
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,280
 I've also seen it spelled with an S, Zaragoza, there's a family called the Palazón family,

252
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,240
 now there is in Zaragoza there is a really nice apartment complex, it's like state of

253
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,640
 the art for, not state of the art now, but in 1934 state of the art.

254
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,640
 And so it was real well off families, they had housekeepers and these people had good

255
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,800
 jobs and stuff like that.

256
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:13,720
 And then one day you start hearing screaming, crying, banging, kind of emanating from the

257
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,920
 walls, poltergeist, people can't figure out what's going on.

258
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,040
 And they kind of narrow it down to the kitchen and specifically the chimney that does lead

259
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,040
 to the ceiling and it's shared with other families so you're thinking well maybe someone's

260
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,720
 making noise in another apartment, but they start inviting their friends over, hey what

261
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,720
 are you doing tonight, I don't know, probably just gonna, what's 1934, there's nothing

262
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,560
 to do, listen to the radio I guess, kind of lame, gotta use my imagination, ah forget

263
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,400
 that, why don't you come over to my house, there's a goblin, there's a goblin living

264
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,960
 in the chimney, plus maybe you can help me figure it out so people, the neighbors start

265
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,800
 coming over, and it actually, this is one of the interesting things, they talk about

266
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,480
 the goblin talking to them, but there's only one transcript, there's only one conversation

267
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,920
 we have a record of, so apparently, like when we look at Jeff the talking mongoose, there's

268
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:11,440
 a lot of, it was an old episode I did, there's a lot of references to like what he was saying

269
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,520
 and stuff like that, in particular insults and things like that, like he called the guy

270
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,520
 a couch potato or a big dumb oaf, just want to really have one conversation, but so people

271
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,800
 start coming over, and of course like these things do, it's 1934, it's super boring, they're

272
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,400
 on the edge of World War 2 so everyone's kinda stressed out anyways, so the fact that this

273
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,080
 family has like a little monster living in their chimney, no one can figure it out, you're

274
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,760
 gonna get people who believe in monsters and you're gonna get skeptics, this gets out into

275
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,760
 the media, people start swarming the house, massive crowds outside, and of course the

276
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,800
 police get involved, so now you got police scooting around trying to figure out what's

277
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,960
 going on, Scotland Yard is looking at coming down because they're like what is this, what

278
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,040
 is going on, plus they also want to probably spy on the Franco government, that was British's

279
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,120
 excuse, they're like hey let's go down and quote unquote check on the goblin, as they're

280
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,520
 really putting spies in because they know World War 2 is right around the corner, by

281
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,000
 November you have, the police can evolve, so here's where we have a transcript, the

282
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,960
 police ask, who are you, why are you doing this, do you do it for money, which is a dumb

283
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,640
 question to ask a goblin, I guess they probably think it's a human at this point, but the

284
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:27,320
 voice simply says no, the police go do you want a job, like what, who are these cops,

285
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,720
 your question should, it's weird because at first they go who are you, why are you doing

286
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,520
 this, do you want to, do you do it for money, and it's like no, that should have been three

287
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,160
 separate questions, who are you, I'm a goblin, like they didn't even get that one, so they

288
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:47,960
 ask do you want a job, he says no, and then the police go so what do you want man, that's

289
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:55,360
 so weird, I didn't know they used terminology like that back then, and the voice goes nothing,

290
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,200
 I'm not a man, so if they had said so what do you want dude, would it have been like

291
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,480
 I'm not a dude, like this is such a weird terminology, that's the only conversation we have a transcript

292
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:15,240
 for, that's it, there's no follow up to that, this story is fairly obscure, especially in

293
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,240
 Spain's the west, but in English speaking countries, it's very rare, I found a couple

294
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,040
 articles about it in English, I think I only found two, and the other ones I had to translate

295
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,560
 and there's so many translation errors, so much grammatical stuff is driving me nuts,

296
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,940
 anyways what happens is the voice kind of starts being a jerk to people, and what people

297
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,760
 think to call this thing is in the culture of Spain there's a thing called a duende,

298
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,760
 which is an elf or goblin would be the best translation for it, and it's funny because

299
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,960
 those are two kind of different things, elf is kind of like this spry happy little guy

300
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,160
 in a goblin, it's a monster goblin's an evil thing, and the duende is both as well, he

301
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:59,080
 can either be totally nice or a horrible horrible jerk, it's one name that includes both types

302
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,460
 of personalities, just like humans, we don't assume all humans are good, some are bad,

303
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,060
 and so, but elves are generally seen as helpful, and goblins are normally seen as monstrous,

304
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,460
 duende kind of combines the two, so what happens is it starts basically just talking trash

305
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,980
 to people, and specifically talking trash to the maid, the maid of this family, the palazon

306
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:25,660
 family, her name is Pascuala Alosa, Alosa, starts talking trash to her and all this stuff,

307
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,040
 now the police are getting really frustrated because there's massive crowds outside this

308
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,760
 apartment building, the other tenants are getting a little frustrated because they're

309
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,920
 just trying to get into their apartments, so the police end up like cordoning off the building,

310
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,600
 they won't let people into the building, they have people on the roof, cops on the roof,

311
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,600
 standing by the chimney to see if anyone's talking in the rooftop chimney, they bring

312
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,800
 in priests, they're spreading holy water all over the place, the voice disappears, so you

313
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,220
 go "oh, the holy water got rid of the ghost" and the skeptics are going "it was the massive

314
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,980
 police presence that got rid of the ghost."

315
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,000
 Cops leave, people are let back in the building, the voice returns, and this is another quote

316
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,700
 we have from it, "cowards, cowards, cowards, here I am!"

317
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,220
 Family, the palazon family actually leaves for good, people are trying to record the

318
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,380
 voice, a radio station comes in to get a recording of the voice, and then the governor of Zaragoza

319
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,880
 is like "this is, I'm done with this, December 4th rolls around, this all happened within

320
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,240
 a course of a couple months, runs around and he says that we figured it out, it was the

321
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:36,080
 maid doing it, the maid was doing this thing labeled as unconscious vinquilitrism, and

322
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:43,200
 it was labeled as quote "a psychic phenomenon produced only in certain circumstances" unquote,

323
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,040
 so he said it was a maid, the maid was making these voices but she won't remember making

324
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,420
 the voices, she'll never admit to making the voices because she doesn't know she made

325
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,180
 the voices but she's making the voices, it's not a goblin, everything's fine, that was

326
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:05,100
 pretty much the end of it actually, the family never came back, that explanation made the

327
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,420
 crowds go away, people are like "oh it must have just been this girl doing this voice

328
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,420
 on accident or unconsciously."

329
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,500
 People still in the building afterwards said "oh you know sometimes when we walk around

330
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,120
 there's cold spots or there's like spooky stuff happening" but it never really caught

331
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,880
 back on and people never really associated, people figured you're just a scaredy cat because

332
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,520
 there used to be a goblin in your fireplace, now the building was eventually torn down

333
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,580
 you know just because it's built, well actually probably several bombs were dropped on it

334
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:41,320
 during World War II but there's a new building in that spot and it's known as edificio duende

335
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,940
 or the goblin building, I'm assuming that's a nickname, I'm not assuming that you have

336
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,340
 a law office and people are like "hey where's your office at" and you're like "oh it's

337
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,380
 being owned by goblin building" but stay away from the fireplace, I think someone's

338
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:01,500
 eavesdropping on us, it's an interesting story for two reasons, one it's one of those things

339
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,380
 that you have this massive police, first off the police getting involved in paranormal

340
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,500
 stuff I'm always fascinated by, sometimes they do it just because they're curious because

341
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,120
 police officers are humans, they still go home and watch television shows and stuff like

342
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,040
 that, they're not like this faceless force, same thing with the military, it's really

343
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,920
 easy to look at law enforcement in the military, it's just like this other part of society

344
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,240
 but they're also sitting around being like "dude I wonder what it is" but they'll have

345
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,480
 the means to say "hey let's hop in the car, let's go down there and see if we can see

346
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,520
 someone on the roof" like they have more ability to go investigate this type of stuff, they're

347
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,500
 curious also the fact that the traffic was getting snarled in the area, that's when they

348
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,060
 really had to bring in a police presence to try to find out what was going on and also

349
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:51,340
 to make sure that society can still function, that cars can still move down the street.

350
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,100
 So is it possible that she was doing the voice?

351
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,720
 Yeah it's definitely possible when everyone was moved down and the cops took over the

352
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,340
 building the voice disappeared and then the cops leave and the voice comes back.

353
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,220
 And she's never admitted to it, she goes "I don't know what they're talking about, I

354
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,160
 didn't do it, they're saying I did it unconsciously and that's kind of like the perfect alibi because

355
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,000
 then you can just end everything" but I think there's a bigger topic to this story, I think

356
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,200
 there's a more interesting thing to this story and we'll end it on this.

357
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,880
 There's an interesting thing to this story and we'll end it like this, is that you have

358
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,960
 a completely audible voice, people can hear it, neighbors can hear it, police heard it,

359
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,260
 they're interviewing it and then eventually it goes away.

360
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
 Hokes?

361
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,540
 Sure, possibly, most likely hoax.

362
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:42,740
 But let's assume, let's put on our believer hats and assume that it is some sort of supernatural

363
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,380
 force.

364
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,140
 Why don't we have stuff like that anymore?

365
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,940
 Because we do have "Gef the Talking Mongoose" which was a similar thing, it was kind of

366
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,660
 just a jerk living in the house that sometimes what appears in mongoose, again, possibly

367
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,980
 a fake, most likely a fake story, other people were hearing the voice and all that stuff.

368
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,560
 So why have we, let's assume that it's real, let's assume all of this stuff is real.

369
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,040
 Nowadays you gotta have the EVP.

370
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,600
 It used to be that you could have a spiritual thing, you could go to a spiritual list of

371
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,440
 medium, you'd ask a question, "Will I marry Bobby?"

372
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,280
 Oh yes, four knocks means yes, but it'll be a short marriage, huh?

373
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,420
 Used to be able to end that again, was mostly fake, but let's assume that at least some

374
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,740
 of them were true.

375
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:39,820
 Why is it that things seem to have gotten less concrete over the past 100 years, 150

376
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,620
 years of ghost investigations or talking to ghosts?

377
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:47,060
 It used to be you could have a spiritualist ceremony, you had these voices emanating from

378
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,100
 the walls that anyone could walk by.

379
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,740
 Now you have people walk through a haunted asylum walking with a tape recorder, maybe

380
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,080
 they'll hear like a bang down the hallway, could just be a raccoon running around, but

381
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,280
 they'll walk down a haunted asylum where people were being experimented on by horrible doctors

382
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,000
 in the 1960s.

383
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,880
 They take the tape recorder home, plug it in, slow it down and they hear "Good for

384
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,120
 out there."

385
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,840
 They're like, "It's said by oatmeal here."

386
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,240
 Oh my god, you're right, I had oatmeal on me.

387
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,960
 I forgot to wash my shirt.

388
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,900
 So what, why in the world of supernatural, why has that changed so much?

389
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,380
 It's an interesting thing.

390
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,700
 It's an interesting theory because sometimes we have to step back.

391
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,340
 It's really easy to get lost in the supernatural stories as they come about, but when you step

392
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:45,700
 back to look at patterns, you start to see some more bizarre things.

393
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:54,960
 Why is it that our connection to the spiritual world is getting less and less?

394
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,480
 Why is it when we look at old stories of aliens, there's hundreds of different types of alien

395
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,920
 races, but nowadays there's pretty much just grays?

396
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,780
 Like I'd say since the 1980s, it's pretty much just gray aliens.

397
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:17,980
 The world of the paranormal seems to be getting less and less diverse.

398
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,500
 Why is that?

399
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:28,020
 How can we go from powerful voices in the past to completely silent voices with a tape recorder?

400
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:34,460
 Why is it that we used to take photos of full body apparition ghosts and now you're happy

401
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,060
 if you can catch an orb on camera?

402
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,860
 I think the fear has always been that the divide between the dead and the living, between

403
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:47,660
 the explained and the unexplained, was going to grow closer and closer together to the

404
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,700
 point where the mysterious is right beside you.

405
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,420
 The creatures of our nightmares are truly under our beds.

406
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,140
 Maybe it's the opposite.

407
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:02,780
 Maybe the world of the real and the world of the dream are separating and growing farther

408
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,500
 and farther apart.

409
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,020
 There may be a day where there are no ghost sightings.

410
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,100
 No EVPs.

411
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,540
 No UFOs.

412
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,380
 No alien encounters.

413
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:21,380
 The rift could grow so wide between the realities that we are trapped in the mundane and the

414
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:32,220
 story about a goblin cracking jokes in a fireplace will seem not simply unbelievable, but unfathomable.

415
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:38,900
 Something that a human in the future could never even dream of in a mundane world of

416
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:58,780
 the super normal.
