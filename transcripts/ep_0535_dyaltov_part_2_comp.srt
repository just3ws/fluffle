1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
 A man meets a stranger at a cafe and invites him home.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,680
 You won't believe what happens next.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,360
 And then we've all heard the story about the Dyatlov Pass, where nine hikers were struck

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,680
 down by an unknown compelling force.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,560
 But did you know 30 years later it happened again?

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,320
 And this time there was a survivor, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:38,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,840
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,400
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so let's go ahead and hop right into this first thought.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,640
 Let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters, C. Knowles.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
 C. Knowles, thank you so much for continuing to support the show.

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,520
 We're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,920
 Whatever vehicle we take, you're in charge of.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,960
 You can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,240
 Just help get the word out about that show.

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,160
 Really really helps the show grow.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,280
 So C. Knowles, let's go ahead and hop into Jason Jett.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,640
 We're gonna take a fast journey to Brussels, Belgium.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,600
 C. Knowles got a little helmet on.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
 Taking off.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
 None of us have helmets on, we're bumping our heads.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,360
 By the time we get to Brussels, Belgium, C is doing loop-de-loops.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
 So we're extra damaged.

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,680
 By the time we get to Brussels, Belgium, we're a little woozy from the flight, but we're

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,920
 okay.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,120
 Because we're back in the year 1976 and nothing bad happens in the year 1976.

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,240
 My birthday was 1976.

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,240
 I actually turned 44 on October 4th.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,240
 What'll that be?

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,200
 Six days after this episode comes out?

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
 So yay me.

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 I'm just clapping.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
 I'm just kind of sitting there.

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,320
 I'm just clapping to myself in the middle of Brussels, Belgium.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,640
 Okay, let's do the story.

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,800
 It's 1976 as Brussels, Belgium.

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,440
 It's a starry little night, little stars twinkling up in the sky.

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,280
 There's a man who only goes by the initials VVK.

40
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
 Now I'm sure he has a real name in real life.

41
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,040
 I don't think he's like, "Hello, my name's VVK."

42
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,760
 So we'll call him Vincent.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,560
 Vincent von Krump.

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,280
 Vincent is walking through the streets of Brussels, Belgium, his town.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
 He lives here.

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
 He's not a visitor.

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
 He knows the place very well.

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
 He actually goes to this cafe.

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,120
 He's only a couple nights a week to have a nice refreshing beer.

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,240
 But one night in the year 1976 he's sitting down with his lager, drinking it, and he sees

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,400
 a stunning man sitting in the bar.

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,960
 Now this man, Vincent is happily married.

53
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,080
 He has a wife, little daughter.

54
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 He's not into dudes.

55
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,840
 But there's something about this guy that is so striking.

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
 He's handsome.

57
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,880
 He's tall with blonde hair, piercing blue eyes.

58
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,960
 Just sitting in the cafe with this glass of water, taking little sips of it.

59
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,200
 Something compels Vincent to get up and walk over and start talking to this dude.

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,080
 And he walks over and he sits down and he's like, "Hey, my name's VVK, but you can call

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
 me Vincent."

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,920
 I couldn't help but notice how attractive you were.

63
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,880
 I don't know if he actually said that, but he did sit down and he starts talking to the

64
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,080
 guy and he wants to know about this guy, what's going on.

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,080
 And this dude goes, "Well, you know, I'm new in town.

66
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
 I've never really been to Brussels, Belgium before."

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,040
 Vincent's like, "Oh, okay.

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
 Pretty neat town, isn't he?"

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,080
 He's like, "I don't know what to do in Belgium," the man says.

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,800
 I don't know what there is to do around town.

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,560
 Vincent's kind of talking about the sights, everything that goes on in the town of Brussels.

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
 I don't know either.

73
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,080
 I know you guys are like, "What does happen in the city, Brussels?

74
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
 I don't know.

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,160
 There's got buildings, the sun goes up, goes down, people go to bed.

76
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,240
 I'm sure it's like a normal town."

77
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,560
 The man also looks at Vincent and goes, "You know, between you and me, I can't even pay

78
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
 for this water.

79
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,800
 I don't have enough money to pay for this water."

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,840
 Now I do know this apparently about Brussels.

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,600
 They make you pay for water.

82
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,120
 I don't know if they do that nowadays, but in 1976, water wasn't free, doesn't grow on

83
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
 trees.

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
 What do you think?

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
 It comes out of clouds or something?

86
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
 I don't have enough money to buy this water.

87
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
 I ordered this water.

88
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,520
 I'm in a town I've never been into.

89
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,040
 I don't know what to do.

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:23,600
 I don't know how to pay for this water and," he tells Vincent, "I'm actually an extraterrestrial."

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,720
 Now Vincent is like, "Okay, this is pretty dope, right?

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
 Sure.

93
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,960
 I was a little confused about my own sexuality when I felt myself drawn to talk to this handsome,

94
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,960
 stunning man, but now he's an alien too?

95
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
 This is dope.

96
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,960
 Like, how can this adventure go wrong?

97
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,600
 Well, Vincent's going to do his best to make sure that it goes wrong because he goes tell

98
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,080
 you what, I'll pay for the water.

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,640
 Why don't you come home with me?

100
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,360
 Why don't you come home with me?

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
 Whatever happens, happens."

102
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 The guy, the alien's like, "What?"

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,840
 He's like, "Oh, no, no, no, no.

104
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,400
 Sorry, that was Freudian slip.

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,360
 You come home with me since you're an alien and you don't know what to do in Brussels.

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
 Come home with me.

107
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
 I got a wife and a little kid."

108
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,520
 This is a recipe for disaster, right?

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,960
 And also, budding serial killers out there, if you are extremely handsome, this trick might

110
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
 work for you.

111
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
 Just sit in a bar, wait till someone to invite you to their house.

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,880
 This is how horror movies start off.

113
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,480
 But, and this one might end in a horror movie, I haven't gotten to the ending yet.

114
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,400
 He tells the guy, "Why don't you come back to my house?

115
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,160
 You can stay in my house.

116
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
 Come back to my house."

117
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
 So the gentleman does.

118
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,680
 Vincent is very nice.

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,360
 He pays for the water.

120
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,200
 What type of backward country makes you buy a glass of water?

121
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,160
 They go to Vincent's house.

122
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,920
 And this dude's chilling at the pad for a while.

123
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,600
 This alien dude, this super handsome dude is hanging out with Vincent and his family, gets

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
 to meet his wife, gets to meet his little girl.

125
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,640
 Stays here a couple days.

126
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,200
 Now Vincent approaches a group called SOBEPS.

127
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,960
 It's a Belgium UFO group.

128
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,280
 It's like the society of a bunch of Belgium terms, meaning UFO.

129
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
 And he goes to the group and he goes, "Hey guys, guys, guess what?

130
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,080
 We're not going to guess.

131
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
 We're actually not going to guess.

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
 Just tell us."

133
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
 And he goes, "Okay.

134
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,400
 I got an alien at my house.

135
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,200
 I met this really attractive man at a bar and he was kind of like, "Where's this starting

136
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 going?"

137
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
 He's like, "No, no, it's not like that.

138
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 Why does everyone think it's like that?"

139
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,720
 And I brought him back to my house and he's an alien.

140
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
 He's from outer space.

141
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,920
 I would like to bring him to you guys so you guys can like interview him because you're

142
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,120
 in the UFOs, right?

143
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,640
 That's what this whole group's about.

144
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,840
 Now the group declines.

145
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,120
 They say, "No, we'd rather not meet this guy."

146
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,280
 Let's put a little feather in that part for right now.

147
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,640
 So Vincent goes back to feed and he's like, "Oh well, it's their loss, right?

148
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,360
 I happen to have the cutest alien in this quadrant living at my house, so they don't

149
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 want to meet him.

150
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,960
 That just means more alien goodness for me."

151
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,640
 But Vincent also has to work and stuff like that.

152
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,320
 In between hanging out with his new alien pal, drinking at the bar and sleeping, he also

153
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
 has to work.

154
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,320
 One day he comes home from work.

155
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,040
 Vincent's like, "Alien, honey."

156
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
 In that order, right?

157
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,680
 Because he likes the alien guy a lot better.

158
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
 "Hey guys, where are you?

159
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
 House is empty."

160
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
 Huh?

161
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,280
 "Hey, alien, honey."

162
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,680
 Then he hears, "Okay, that sounds like a drum line.

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
 It was supposed to be a little girl running through the house."

164
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
 And he's like, "Daughter, who we never named."

165
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,760
 And she's like, "Daddy, daddy, I'm so glad you're home."

166
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,160
 He's like pushing her out of the way.

167
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,920
 But where is my alien buddy?"

169
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:35,320
 He left with this dude's wife and neither of them were ever seen again.

170
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,640
 He was stuck or maybe he liked his daughter.

171
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
 I don't know.

172
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
 I don't know.

173
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,800
 Maybe he's like, "Oh man, you left me the daughter."

174
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,680
 Much rather he'd left me the alien and the wife and the daughter left.

175
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,360
 He ends up being left alone with his daughter and neither of these people, the alien or

176
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,320
 the wife, were ever seen again.

177
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,080
 The killer who's super selective and basically that's his MO.

178
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,800
 He has to be invited in your house like a vampire and stay a couple days and get invited

179
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,880
 to a UFO seminar where they turn him down.

180
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,440
 And then he's like, "Now it's my time to strike.

181
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,880
 This is what my plan has always been.

182
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,440
 This is my bizarro fetish."

183
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,800
 Actual alien who absconded with this poor man's wife.

184
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,360
 This wife left him for this stunning super hot dude who happened to be an alien or maybe

185
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,920
 it was just some really hot guy who went home with this other dude and was pulling some

186
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,040
 sort of scam and just left with his dude's wife.

187
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,520
 What's interesting is I read that story.

188
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,360
 It's fascinating to me but I read that story and got it from ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

189
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,880
 And I thought the weirdest part, the whole story is bizarre.

190
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,920
 First off I didn't know they sold beer at cafes.

191
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,080
 So I mean just from the very first sentence I was like, "Huh?

192
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,320
 What wacky alternate universe does this story take place in?"

193
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,560
 Guys drink a beer in a cafe.

194
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
 The whole story is weird.

195
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,200
 But the one thing that stuck out to me was the UFO organization turning down the possible

196
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,040
 visit from an alien.

197
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,400
 Because let's be frank.

198
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,120
 Let's be frank here for a second.

199
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:11,720
 UFO organizations have a great mix of, let's say, 90% people who are really smart and dedicated

200
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,480
 to the research of these topics and then 10% crackpots.

201
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,800
 I'd actually even give it more like maybe 2% crackpots.

202
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,040
 And you have people who are really dedicated to doing what they're doing.

203
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
 It's something that they're really engaging.

204
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,240
 It can be, it's the same way people are passionate about model trains.

205
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,320
 Like I'm sure the model train community, every show often some weirdo joins who like crashing

206
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,920
 them, "Hey guys, you know it'd be really cool if we like put this little person on the train

207
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
 track and then watch what happens."

208
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
 They're like, "No!

209
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,760
 We're not going to do that tonight.

210
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,120
 Come back to my place later and we'll do that."

211
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,600
 I'm sure there's a 2% weirdos in every subculture.

212
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,240
 But the UFO community declined to meet it.

213
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,680
 So I actually tracked down this UFO community.

214
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,560
 They're no longer SOPEPs.

215
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,840
 Now they're COBEPs.

216
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,720
 They change from the society to the committee.

217
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,120
 A lot of the same members, but they said, "We just kind of changed the way things were

218
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
 organized after the internet came out.

219
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,160
 We stopped publishing books and doing newsletters.

220
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,520
 We figured we'd change the name to give it a different feeling."

221
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,280
 So I tracked these guys down and I emailed them at like midnight last night, right before

222
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
 I went to bed.

223
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,040
 I go, "I wonder if these guys are still around."

224
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 That's so bizarre that they would turn down this story.

225
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
 And I emailed them.

226
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,400
 I said, "Hey, you know, I got this podcast.

227
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,240
 Here is the full text that I read.

228
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,400
 I sent them to thinkaboutitdocs.com link and the short paragraph that this story is based

229
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
 on."

230
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
 I go, "Do you know anything about this?"

231
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
 This was the reason.

232
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
 I got a response within hours.

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,400
 I mean, again, midnight in America on the West Coast is like Tuesday, January 14th in

234
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,560
 Belgium, but I got a response super fast.

235
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,520
 Let me read it to you.

236
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,760
 I've heard about that story.

237
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:59,880
 This man, the witness, is/was a strange person without credibility.

238
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,720
 This person was well-known from the former SOBEPs for a lot of reasons."

239
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,840
 That actually makes it more mysterious, dude.

240
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,440
 Now I'm even more curious, but I'm not going to pass through these guys, right?

241
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,520
 I just emailed them back saying, "Thanks you for the quick response.

242
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,000
 Have a great day."

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,800
 That makes it-- I want to know that story now.

244
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 But again, I appreciated that they responded so quickly.

245
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,240
 They obviously don't want to talk about it because they could have sent me a bunch of

246
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
 articles.

247
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,720
 "Local pest once again arrested at cafe trying to pay for people's water."

248
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,280
 And then the sub headline goes, "Water is free," says local constable.

249
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,160
 I don't know what was going on, but apparently when this guy walked in and said, "Hey, I

250
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,560
 have an alien in my house," they knew his reputation and they're like, "No, no thanks.

251
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
 We know.

252
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,440
 You're the guy who puts the little dude on the train track."

253
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,880
 So the story's even more mysterious at this point.

254
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,480
 That explanation actually piqued my interest more.

255
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,600
 Is he still around?

256
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,840
 Is Vincent-- who's not his real name, I'm just guessing, but-- is he still around?

257
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,240
 Is he still bringing handsome men back to his house hoping they're aliens too?

258
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,440
 He's like, "Maybe if I crack this one's head open, Green Goo will come out."

259
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
 Who knows?

260
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
 Who knows?

261
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
 Is the story real and-- I don't know.

262
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
 I don't know.

263
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,160
 They're basically-- Kobeps was like, "This guy's-- this guy-- I'm putting words into

264
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,680
 their mouth, but this guy is-- he's typing and sound effects.

265
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,240
 He has gifts in the email of Cuckoo Clocks going off.

266
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,800
 He didn't do any of that.

267
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,360
 But that was me putting words into their-- or gifts into their email.

268
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,080
 Is the story real?

269
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,180
 Basically they're saying no.

270
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,640
 This guy was-- has no credibility.

271
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,840
 Has no credibility at all.

272
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,920
 But an interesting story nonetheless.

273
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:49,000
 The moral of the story is don't invite strangers home.

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,440
 Anybody.

275
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:59,160
 Whether it's on Tinder or Grindr or Farmers Only or Plenty of Fish or-- at a cafe.

276
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
 Don't bring them home.

277
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,280
 Especially if you have other family members, i.e. other victims for the serial killer.

278
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,660
 Don't bring people home.

279
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,900
 That's the moral of the story, really, right?

280
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,100
 And I know a lot of you guys are yelling you're out dating and stuff like that.

281
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,460
 Actually, I bring people home all the time.

282
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,500
 But I have a really good sense.

283
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,820
 I can tell, one, whether or not they're capable of sticking a knife in my neck.

284
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,940
 That's usually the first thing.

285
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,540
 When I'm talking to someone-- all the bars are closed now, but you're talking to a girl.

286
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,700
 You think, "Could this woman put a knife in my neck?"

287
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,580
 Literally, I literally have to process that.

288
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,720
 And if the answer-- I'm not talking physically, because anyone can grab a knife and put it

289
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
 in your neck.

290
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,320
 But you're talking to someone, you're like, "Is this person capable of putting a knife

291
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
 in my neck?"

292
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,200
 Because I've been around people who are actually capable of that.

293
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
 So you can kind of tell.

294
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,120
 You can kind of suss it out.

295
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,560
 This guy obviously didn't have that thing, right?

296
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,840
 Because this dude did end up taking his wife.

297
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,120
 But again, I don't know if he was just really lonely and wanted an alien pal.

298
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,160
 If he just wanted to make a story up.

299
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
 Who knows?

300
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,680
 But moral of the story, don't bring people home.

301
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,340
 Don't bring people home to your house where your significant other is if they are radically

302
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,740
 more beautiful than you are.

303
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,900
 And have a UFO, right?

304
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,480
 Because even if they're uglier than you and they have a really nice ride, i.e., something

305
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,620
 capable of warp drive, your wife's probably going to leave you.

306
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,340
 Your wife is probably going to leave you for the man with warp drive.

307
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,780
 It doesn't matter how many tentacles he has.

308
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,340
 If he's capable of hitting Mach 10,000, don't bring him home.

309
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,340
 Don't bring him home.

310
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,680
 Don't let him anywhere near your wife.

311
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,960
 See, nolls, let's go ahead and hop in that carpenter copter.

312
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
 We're going to take off.

313
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,480
 We're going to start flying through the sky.

314
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,360
 Now as we're doing that, I'm going to do another real quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

315
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,280
 I just did one yesterday too.

316
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,040
 But this one is from someone who listens to the show, a listener of the show.

317
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,200
 His name is John Sharon.

318
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,240
 And he's an animator.

319
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,680
 And I'm going to post in the show notes one of his, it was actually his like thesis film.

320
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,060
 It's a short animated film called Sackhead Strikes Out.

321
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,260
 Short animated cartoon, probably the term.

322
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,580
 Sackhead Strikes Out.

323
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,740
 It's awesome.

324
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,700
 He sent me, he wanted to work with me on something.

325
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,820
 So I was looking through his portfolio and he just does this amazing animation.

326
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,380
 I'm always so impressed by what you guys are capable of doing.

327
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,620
 From Ash Black's just original Dead Rabbit logo.

328
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,780
 We had Ashley, we had John, we had Grant.

329
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,380
 With Robert Paulson doing all this great artwork, Paulie sent me stuff.

330
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,840
 I just got something from location the other day.

331
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,320
 We have all this amazing artwork coming in.

332
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
 But you guys can actually, and I appreciate all of that guys.

333
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,520
 And whoever I missed, I apologize for that.

334
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,120
 But you can check out John Sharon's thesis cartoon.

335
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
 It's really dope.

336
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
 It's really weird.

337
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,720
 It's, it's creepy.

338
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
 It's funny.

339
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,880
 I said I compared it to Ren and Stimpy and David Lynch.

340
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,440
 It's really dope.

341
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
 Check it out.

342
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,560
 It's really, really kind of unsettling cartoon.

343
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,640
 So if you're under the paranormal because you're listening to the show, check out Sackhead

344
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
 Strikes Out.

345
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,460
 It'll be in the links below.

346
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,980
 See Knowles is trying to watch the cartoon.

347
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,700
 We're all watching it on all little DVD players.

348
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
 Like can I watch?

349
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,940
 Can I watch the helicopters swerving side to side?

350
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
 You can watch it, bro.

351
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,100
 When you land the helicopter, first you got to get there safe and sound.

352
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:14,780
 We are headed out to the Hamar Dabin Mountain Range.

353
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:20,000
 The Hamar Dabin Mountain Range is in southern Siberia.

354
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,040
 As we're flying over, we notice the snowstorm is getting exceptionally bad, even for Siberia.

355
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,040
 It's August 2, 1993.

356
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,360
 Now I got so much of my research from a Reddit user named GDMaria.

357
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,440
 I had actually never heard of this story and part of me thought it was fake until I started

358
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,080
 going through their sources and I go, "Oh, this is, this is real and I've never heard

359
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
 of this before."

360
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,580
 It's super obscure because a lot of the sources aren't in English.

361
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,580
 So thank you so much GDMaria for compiling all of this stuff.

362
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,060
 Now most of us, if not all of us, are aware of the Dyatlov Pass incident.

363
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:04,100
 In 1959, February 1st to the 2nd, 1959, in the Ural Mountains on Dyatlov Pass, nine experienced

364
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
 hikers perished.

365
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,540
 The official report says six died of hypothermia, three died of physical trauma caused by a

366
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,960
 quote, "unknown compelling force."

367
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,080
 And there's been movies made on it.

368
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,480
 There was a great movie called Devil's Pass.

369
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,840
 Very, very good movie about the Dyatlov Pass.

370
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
 Very, very good movie.

371
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
 Check that out.

372
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,240
 That's a super common top iceberg conspiracy theory.

373
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,640
 The question is what happened.

374
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,400
 Some people say it was like UFOs.

375
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,320
 Some people say it was the government, the Soviet government.

376
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,080
 They had wandered into the wrong area.

377
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,760
 Some people say that a bomb was dropped.

378
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,720
 They were testing explosives and that's what killed these people.

379
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
 All sorts of theories.

380
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,100
 A very, very fascinating story.

381
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,800
 I covered a story last year about the Yuba County Five.

382
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,300
 Something similar happened in America, in Yuba County, and I think it was in California.

383
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,460
 Five men on their way to a basketball game disappeared in a snowstorm.

384
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,460
 And the mystery was one of them was found in a trailer surrounded by food and water.

385
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,800
 It was like a survivalist trailer, like an outlook station or something like that.

386
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,520
 He died, never opened a can of food, and they said he'd been there for months.

387
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,560
 So we have the Dyatlov Pass.

388
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
 It's a super famous story.

389
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,520
 Yuba County Five is starting to become famous, but I've never heard of this story.

390
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,840
 1,800 miles away from Dyatlov Pass is the Hamar-Dabin Mountain Range.

391
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,920
 On August 2, 1993, Lidmilia Corovina, she's 41-year-old woman.

392
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,440
 She's the leader of this hiking expedition, experienced hiker.

393
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,920
 Her daughter is actually running a second hiking expedition.

394
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,600
 She's like 17, 18.

395
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,560
 On another part of the mountain, they're going to meet up in this valley.

396
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,440
 These people are not amateurs at this.

397
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,720
 They've been doing this all their life.

398
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
 A little toddler.

399
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 A little toddler comes out of the womb on a mountain slope, and then the mom is at the

400
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
 top and she goes, "Come to your milk."

401
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,360
 And the baby has to climb up in the mountain.

402
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,520
 Experienced hikers.

403
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,480
 So Lidmilia has a team of six people.

404
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,600
 They're going to go up the Hamar-Dabin Pass.

405
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,960
 First day's going pretty well.

406
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,880
 The weather sucks, but what do you expect in the middle of Siberia?

407
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,200
 This was the rest of her team.

408
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,480
 You had Sasha, a 23-year-old male, longtime family friend of Lidmilia.

409
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,200
 We'll mispronounce her name differently each time.

410
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
 Let's call her Linda.

411
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
 No disrespect.

412
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,680
 Let's call her Linda just so I'm not stumbling over it all the time.

413
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,160
 So Sasha is 23-years-old, a longtime family member.

414
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,480
 You had Tatiana, 24-years-old.

415
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,000
 You had Denice, 19.

416
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,240
 Vikash, 16-year-old girl.

417
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,520
 Timur, 15-year-old.

418
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
 And Valia, 17-years-old.

419
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,640
 So it's a young group led by an experienced hiker and even the youngsters, after this

420
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,840
 is all said and done, they go, "These people weren't...

421
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,080
 This was not a bunch of people coming from Brussels, Belgium to spend the weekend backpacking.

422
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
 These were experienced local hikers."

423
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,160
 So even though they were young, they knew what they were doing.

424
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,520
 August 4th, they come to a slope on the mountain.

425
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,840
 When people are trying to put this story together, this is one of the first things that don't

426
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,480
 make sense.

427
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,400
 Because this slope has no natural cover.

428
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,520
 And they decide to make camp there.

429
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,840
 And people go, "That's a weird place for a bunch of experienced hikers to make camp.

430
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,640
 You figured they'd want to have some sort of shelter."

431
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,960
 So for whatever reason, that is where Lydia decides to build that base camp that night.

432
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:45,440
 That night, while they're nestled in as best as they can, a massive thunderstorm hits the

433
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,920
 area.

434
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
 They wake up August 5th.

435
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,240
 I don't think they got any sleep that night.

436
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,440
 Could you sleep when you're on a mountain, a massive thunderstorm going on?

437
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
 They wake up, quote, unquote.

438
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,680
 August 5th, weather's terrible.

439
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,920
 There's first off, fresh snow everywhere.

440
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,120
 The weather itself is bad.

441
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,440
 They go, "We got to get down this mountain."

442
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,600
 Like that was the point to begin with, was to go up the mountain and then come down.

443
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,480
 But we should probably pick up the pace.

444
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,160
 Because this weather's only going to get worse.

445
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,680
 They're making their way down the mountain.

446
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,440
 And all of a sudden, Sasha wipes his nose.

447
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:30,040
 I see a bit of blood on his glove.

448
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,840
 Wipes some more blood away from his nose.

449
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,200
 What?

450
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,520
 These conditions aren't hospitable to human life.

451
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,920
 So you're going to be expected to get a little bit of earring in your ears pop.

452
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,000
 Your nose gets bloody because it's dry and stuff like that.

453
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,520
 But it's pouring out of his nose at this point.

454
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,320
 And Sasha's actually wiping it and he's moving his hand away.

455
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,920
 As he moves it away, blood is no longer just trickling out.

456
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,440
 It's leaking out of his nose.

457
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,040
 Onto his glove.

458
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,520
 Onto the snow.

459
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,960
 The whole hiking group turns around and Sasha's standing there.

460
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,720
 He opens his mouth up.

461
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,000
 Blood is pouring out of his mouth.

462
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,400
 He falls to the ground, bleeding profusely from the nose and the mouth.

463
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,680
 Lydia has to make a decision right now.

464
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,280
 She is the leader of the group.

465
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,560
 But Sasha was someone she basically raised.

466
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,720
 She was a close member of the family.

467
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,480
 She viewed him as her son.

468
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,120
 She falls down in front of the body.

469
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,080
 She figures she's going to make a risk.

470
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,840
 A stupid risk, but she makes this decision.

471
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,080
 She tells the others, "Go on without me.

472
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,960
 Send back help."

473
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,120
 The others kind of turn and they kind of look at the situation.

474
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
 It's shocking.

475
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,480
 They're terrified.

476
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,760
 But they all know.

477
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,480
 Sasha's dead.

478
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,760
 The amount of blood that's coming out of them, there's no way they can get back to

479
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,880
 civilization in time.

480
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,240
 They're watching Lydia cradle the body of Sasha.

481
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,520
 She won't let him die alone.

482
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,680
 They start heading down the pass.

483
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,480
 They don't get far though when they hear Lydia herself begin to scream.

484
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,600
 Because when they turn and head back to see what's happening, by the time they get there,

485
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,440
 Lydia's mouth is wide open.

486
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,000
 Blood is pouring out.

487
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,280
 Denise is looking at the situation.

488
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,440
 He sees a drop of blood on the snow in front of him.

489
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
 Then another one.

490
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,000
 Hesitantly reaches his gloved hand up to his nose.

491
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,840
 He's bleeding.

492
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,800
 Everyone at this point is having trickles of blood come out of their nose.

493
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:50,640
 Valya, the 17 year old girl, looks and she sees Vika and Tatiana begin tearing out their

494
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,800
 clothes.

495
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,480
 Grabbing handfuls of jackets, of shirts, of sweaters, and just trying to tear them off

496
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,880
 of their body.

497
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,360
 Vika falls to the ground writhing in pain twitching.

498
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,400
 Tatiana falls as well.

499
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,280
 Denise runs and hides behind a rock.

500
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
 What else are you going to do?

501
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,360
 Even though the assailant is unseen, you're just trying to get some sort of protection.

502
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:24,360
 Tatiana begins to turn and crawl through the snow to a pile of rocks that are visible

503
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,320
 through the powder.

504
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,760
 She begins smashing her head into the rocks.

505
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,280
 Valya seeing that going, "Oh, I can't go over there!"

506
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,400
 Because that's weird.

507
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,560
 She runs over to Vika, the other girl who's still twitching in the snow.

508
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,760
 "Vika, Vika, we have to get out of here!"

509
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,080
 Vika looks at Valya and then bites her.

510
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,840
 Valya pulls away.

511
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:59,120
 She sees Timur going and what is only described as going mad.

512
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,120
 Everyone in this group is affected, but Denise and Valya seem to be holding out just a little

513
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,360
 bit longer.

514
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:14,200
 Valya and Denise meet up and they start heading down the mountain, leaving everyone behind.

515
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,320
 There's nothing you can do for these people.

516
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,920
 They don't get very far down when both of them start to complain that things are getting

517
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
 too hazy.

518
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,080
 They're having a hard time seeing.

519
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,080
 They're having a hard time thinking.

520
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,240
 Denise goes, "Listen, Valya, you have to run.

521
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,280
 You have to make a run for it.

522
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,960
 Your backpack's too heavy.

523
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,320
 Drop it, take everything essential out that you need, and then you run down the mountain."

524
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,360
 Valya just nods her head.

525
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,400
 She takes her backpack off, she opens it up, she begins going through it.

526
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,400
 After she's grabbed a few things, she hears, "Ugggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg

527
00:25:41,400 --> 00:26:11,400
 After she's grabbed a few things, she hears, "Ugggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg

528
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:35,400
 She offers no details.

529
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,600
 She responds to no questions.

530
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,920
 They do end up locating the location of these bodies, but it's not until the end of August

531
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,880
 when they can actually retrieve them because the weather is so bad.

532
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,360
 When the rescue team get rescue team, body retrieval team really at this point gets there.

533
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,240
 They notice that some of the bodies are huddled together in a final moment of comfort.

534
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,960
 Others are just splayed out, laying there alone in the melting snow.

535
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,320
 The rescue team said that all their eyes were gone.

536
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,240
 There were worms crawling out of their mouths.

537
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,000
 Now that's not supernatural, right?

538
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,840
 It's creepy and disgusting.

539
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
 That's not supernatural.

540
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
 It's scavengers.

541
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,440
 Scavengers are always going to go for soft tissue, which is your butthole and your eyeballs.

542
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,680
 The autopsy that was done on these bodies, they said the cause of death.

543
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,800
 The cause of death was actually hypothermia.

544
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,520
 They also said that these bodies all seem to show some sort of protein deficiency.

545
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,920
 They had bruising of the lungs.

546
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,840
 There's a memorial placed for these hikers in the area.

547
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
 That's it.

548
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,240
 The story that we know is from Valia telling people over time.

549
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,960
 The story has been pieced together by accounts that friends have come forward and said, "A

550
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,200
 couple months later Valia told me this."

551
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,920
 Someone else to say, "A couple months later, a couple years later, Valia told me this."

552
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,360
 The story's been pieced together.

553
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,080
 So there are pieces of it that are contradictory, which is interesting.

554
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,720
 One of the versions is when she runs down the mountain, she then goes back up the mountain

555
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,120
 and sees everyone is dead, confirms they're dead, and then goes back and is lost for three

556
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
 days.

557
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,920
 One of them is when she goes back up the mountain, not everyone's dead, that Lydia, who I hate

558
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,760
 that I couldn't pronounce her name, but the hiking commander was still alive and she gave

559
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,520
 her instructions on how to get out.

560
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,600
 People have thought that's probably not true.

561
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,880
 These people though really did die.

562
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
 Apparently.

563
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,880
 It's really interesting because it's one of those stories that's so shocking.

564
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,400
 The fact that I hadn't heard of it started making me think, is this like viral marketing

565
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,200
 for a movie or something like that?

566
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,600
 It wasn't until I started going through the links and I go up, this seems to be real.

567
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,280
 This seems to be a real event.

568
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,360
 This seems to be real people that were impacted by this.

569
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,000
 There are articles, you know, five years later saying, "Looking back on this and looking back

570
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,600
 on this tragic event."

571
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,640
 It's a very fascinating story because it's basically the outlaw of pass with the survivor,

572
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,280
 but even with a witness there, we're no closer to what happened.

573
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:22,080
 There was a Reddit user who goes by the name "NotS.Holmes" who actually gave their theory,

574
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,400
 and it's a theory that I've used for other stuff on this show as well.

575
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,320
 Hydrogen sulfide.

576
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,960
 It's a chemical, it smells like sulfur, that if you get enough of it over a short amount

577
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,080
 of time, it can kill you.

578
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,240
 And if it doesn't kill you, it can make you hallucinate.

579
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,640
 It can definitely irritate your nose and your lungs.

580
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,480
 And there was actually a paper mill in the area that got cited for polluting the water

581
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,280
 supply, and one of the things it was polluting it with was hydrogen sulfide.

582
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,920
 So is it possible that this pollutant got into the snowpack and then being in that area

583
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:08,320
 overnight, they were getting slow doses of it, or there was a massive dose at one point?

584
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,360
 Who knows?

585
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,840
 But to make this even more of a mystery, and to intrigue you long time listeners, or you

586
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,240
 100% completionists of Dead Rabbit Radio.

587
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:30,160
 This mountain range has also had UFO sightings, bigfoot sightings, and right next to this

588
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:40,400
 area, right next to this area where that paper mill is situated, is Lake Baikal, which is

589
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,640
 a place that we've done quite a few episodes early on the run of this show.

590
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:53,480
 Lake Baikal is basically Soviet Union's Bermuda Triangle/Area 51.

591
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,640
 There's long been rumors of an underwater alien base there.

592
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,720
 I think the location of these two things is not coincidental.

593
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,920
 Lake Baikal is full of rumors?

594
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:11,040
 This story is true.

595
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,720
 It's very interesting because whenever we look at cases like Yuba County 5 or DLF Pass,

596
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 or any missing person story, you always want to have a witness.

597
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,980
 You always want to have someone who can come back and tell the story.

598
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,920
 Someone who got away from Dublin, Wisconsin.

599
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,440
 Someone who moved out the day the Bellray Surge happened.

600
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
 But we don't.

601
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,040
 We don't have these witnesses.

602
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,880
 This story, we have a witness, someone who was there, who saw the unknown compelling force

603
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,920
 in action.

604
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,960
 And we are no closer to solving that mystery.

605
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,120
 Fascinating story.

606
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,520
 Fascinating story.

607
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,860
 And it just reminds us that you could literally be standing there watching something completely

608
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,620
 unknown happen to your friends, to your family.

609
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:12,000
 You could be the lone survivor of this bizarre interaction.

610
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,400
 And even then, in the end, you still don't know what happened.

611
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,640
 The famous saying is the truth is out there.

612
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:28,600
 But does that even matter if you can see the truth while it's happening and still not know

613
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,720
 what the answers are?

614
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,260
