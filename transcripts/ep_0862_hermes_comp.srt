1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 A personal mystery may lead to even bigger questions about the way the world works.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,080
 What happens when you're watching lost media being lost right before your eyes?

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,400
 And then we travel, and then we travel to Guyana to meet a young man whose village has come

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,200
 under attack from gang members.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,640
 As the chaos spreads and this young man tries to flee the gunfire, he realizes he has an

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
 ally on his side.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,000
 A man from another world.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:51,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,560
 I'm your host Jason Garvera, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, hope you guys are having tons of fun whatever

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
 you're doing.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,760
 Unless it is currently raiding an African village then that is not good.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
 Do not have fun doing it.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
 Or just don't do that.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,520
 Even if you're not having fun doing it, just don't do that.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,320
 But someone who always has fun, everyone give a round of applause for one of our Dead Rabbit

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,400
 Radio supporters.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,880
 Give it up for Shawn.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
 Wooo!

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,320
 Everyone give him a big round of applause.

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,320
 Shawn recently bought me a book off my Amazon book wish list.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
 That's in the show notes.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,280
 Shawn bought me a book titled, this is dope, Alien Invasion, the ultimate survival guide

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,240
 for the ultimate attack.

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,440
 And he read it.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,920
 He sent me a note saying that he read it and that it was an awesome book.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,880
 So thank you so much for sending that over Shawn.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,680
 I can't wait to dig into it.

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,080
 Shawn, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,680
 If you guys can't support the show financially or buy me books or anything like that, that's

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
 fine.

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
 It really is just help spread the word about the show.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,240
 That also helps out so much.

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,800
 You have no idea how much it helps when you tell people about Dead Rabbit Radio.

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,600
 Shawn, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,400
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,000
 We're gonna drive all the way down to Sacramento, California.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,960
 We're driving down to Sacramento, California because that's where I spent a lot of my

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
 adult life.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,160
 And this first segment's gonna be really, really short.

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,280
 It's a mystery that I hadn't thought about for years.

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,440
 Shawn, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jet.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,200
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:30,160
 We're flying all the way out to Sacramento.

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,080
 The reason why we're headed to Sacramento because I put together this weird pattern when I was

47
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
 dating.

48
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
 In my dating life, I started to notice something.

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,560
 Now it took me a couple years to notice this.

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,080
 I'm not really quick on the uptake when it comes to personal relationships, but I started

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
 to notice something.

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,240
 The pattern I noticed was this.

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,040
 If I was out on a first date with a woman, we're getting to know each other, trying to

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,880
 figure everything out.

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
 This is so weird.

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,640
 And I never thought about this for a long time.

57
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,120
 It popped in my head the other day and I was like, "Oh, that's super weird."

58
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,440
 She talked about it on my show about paranormal and conspiracy stuff.

59
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,800
 I'd be on a first date with a woman and if she went to the bathroom in the middle of

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,120
 the date, it was over.

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,520
 If on the first date, the girl goes to the bathroom, when she came back, she wanted nothing

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
 to do with me.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,200
 And a lot of times, it wouldn't like she'd come back and be like, "Hey, thanks for the

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
 meal."

65
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
 Or "I had a nice coffee.

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
 It's time to go."

67
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 No.

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,800
 She'd come back, she'd sit down and she would be mean to me.

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,040
 She would be mean.

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
 And I could never figure it out.

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,240
 Again, it took a long time for me to put it together, but I remember the exact moment

72
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,000
 when I go, "Oh, this isn't going to work out."

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 She went up to go to the bathroom and I thought, "When she comes back, she's going to be mean."

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Just watch.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Just watch, Jason.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,160
 I'm sure enough this girl came back and she sat down and she was mean.

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,720
 She cruel almost, right?

78
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,360
 And I didn't know what that was.

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,360
 I could never figure it out.

80
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,360
 And honestly, I had completely forgotten about it until the other day.

81
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,600
 And I mentioned it to my friend Sabine and I go, "What could have been..."

82
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,040
 No, this is before the era of smartphones.

83
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,480
 I know a lot of people just figured, she went and she looked up your social media and she's

84
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,600
 like, "Oh, this guy's a weirdo."

85
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,080
 No, it was before that.

86
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,880
 It was before you could find out I was a weirdo via technology.

87
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,480
 I go, "What could have been causing that?

88
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,320
 Why it was happening all the time if the girl didn't get up to go to the bathroom at any

89
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,200
 point in the date?"

90
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
 It was perfect.

91
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
 It was a great date.

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,680
 I had a second date.

93
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,200
 What have you?

94
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,000
 But if she went to the bathroom in the middle of the date, it was over.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,560
 They were mean to me when they came back.

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,240
 And Sabine, she goes, I'm paraphrasing, but she goes, "You're a charmer, Jason.

97
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
 You're a salesman."

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And I can just imagine when these women are with you, you're just laying it on real thick.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,080
 And then they get up and they go to the bathroom.

100
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,200
 Once they're out of your sphere of influence, once they go into the bathroom, they sit in

101
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,360
 the stall for a bit, they come out, they look in the mirror, they splash a little water

102
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
 in their face.

103
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,880
 They realize, "I don't want anything to do with this guy."

104
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,320
 Not maybe he's a nice guy, but this isn't the right time.

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
 It's not the right time for me.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 This is over.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And I go, "What?

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
 They have to be so mean when they came out.

109
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
 They get it just locked away."

110
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,120
 You said, "It was nice meeting you."

111
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,040
 And she didn't have an answer for that.

112
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
 But I remember.

113
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
 That might be, right?

114
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,560
 That could be what was going on.

115
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,000
 But I remember as this phenomenon kept happening, again, if they didn't go to the bathroom,

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 everything was awesome.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,840
 They went to the bathroom.

118
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,960
 I knew it was over.

119
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,440
 I remember thinking to myself, "I am a paranormal guy, paranormal conspiracy guy."

120
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:46,440
 I thought, "What if women have some sort of telepathic link to other women?

121
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,120
 Apparently, they have to go into the bathroom to activate it."

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,320
 They go into the bathroom and they sit down in the toilet and they play with the knob a

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
 little bit.

124
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,160
 And this holographic view screen appears and it's like, "Hello, Betty.

125
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,080
 We see that you're on a date with Carpenter, Jason.

126
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,480
 That guy's a bad dude.

127
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
 Stay away from him."

128
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,600
 And I'm like, "Yes, Master.

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,880
 Thank you, Matriarch, for giving me the orders."

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
 Then they come back.

131
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,520
 I remember thinking, "What if women have this psychological link to each other?"

132
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,880
 And they communicate and they get bad advice.

133
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
 I'm awesome.

134
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,240
 Now, obviously, I didn't put too much emphasis on that, right?

135
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,240
 I wasn't trying to infiltrate the female underworld.

136
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,960
 Tell me who your telepathic masters are.

137
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,760
 But I remember thinking that they were legitimately popping up in my head.

138
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,840
 I go, "What if they can communicate with each other telepathically?"

139
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
 But here's the thing.

140
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,640
 I can never figure it out and it was definitely a pattern.

141
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,080
 It was something that I observed over time.

142
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,320
 It's a perfect segue into the world of gang stalking.

143
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,040
 Now again, when I'm sitting here talking to these girls and they get up to go to the bathroom,

144
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,920
 I think that they may be telepathically hooking into the plumbing of a bathroom and talking

145
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
 to other women.

146
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,480
 I know that's not true.

147
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:17,720
 But to someone who feels they're being gang stalked, that would 100% be true.

148
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,000
 If I was in that paranoid state of, "I thought I was being gang stalked," this is what they

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 do.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
 They look for patterns where...

151
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,460
 What was weird is this was a clear pattern.

152
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,200
 This happened every single time.

153
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,240
 Or at least, I don't remember the times when the girls went to the bathroom, came back,

154
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,120
 and we continue to have a lovely date.

155
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,080
 I don't remember those times.

156
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,840
 Sometimes even with gang stalking, you see a pattern.

157
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,600
 If something doesn't fit the pattern, you forget about it.

158
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,440
 People who are being gang stalked, they walk down the street, they see two black Honda

159
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,000
 Civics drive by in five minutes and they go, "Oh, today the gang that's stalking me is

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,040
 driving the black Honda Civics."

161
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
 That's why I saw that.

162
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,040
 None of us would even recognize that.

163
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,760
 You'd have to see like six of them in a row to go, "Oh, now I am being gang stalked and

164
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,640
 being gang stalked by the Honda Boys, the most vicious gang in my area."

165
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,080
 But we've covered a lot of gang stalking stuff.

166
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
 We've done some great episodes.

167
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,840
 I'll put them in the show notes.

168
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,920
 This is an interesting one because this is lost media and gang stalking smashed into

169
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
 one.

170
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,440
 You can accuse people who think they're being gang stalked, targeted individuals.

171
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,720
 You can accuse targeted individuals of a lot of things, but you can't accuse them of being

172
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
 lazy.

173
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,280
 Like, they put out so much content.

174
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,720
 They're shooting videos all the time.

175
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,520
 They're constantly writing things down like long posts online.

176
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,960
 They're constantly producing content because they're trying to convince people and in a

177
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,000
 way maybe even themselves that they are being gang stalked.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,040
 So all of their faults, all of their faults, one of them is not laziness or lack of imagination

179
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
 in a long time.

180
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
 They're definitely imaginations.

181
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,280
 They're part of their imagining being stalked by everyone on the planet.

182
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,440
 A long time ago I found this and I thought about doing a story on it at the time and

183
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
 I didn't.

184
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,120
 And it's one of those things that I kind of regret because I didn't do that.

185
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,480
 We have a case of lost media.

186
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,800
 Some of this is still around, but the series is very short.

187
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,360
 So I wanted to share it with you guys and I'm hoping that maybe we can start a preservation

188
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,240
 project on this because this is one of those things that it's really just one in a million

189
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,200
 that it gets created.

190
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,000
 We're flying out to this unnamed American city because this is the location of a...

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,120
 Because this is a location where it is.

192
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,080
 The location is so awesome.

193
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
 It's so awesome.

194
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,040
 It is a gang stalking comic strip.

195
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,320
 It's the story of a man named Targ.

196
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
 It's not Viking.

197
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,160
 It's not a prequel to the Northman.

198
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,800
 It is called Targ the Target.

199
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
 And it's a comic strip.

200
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,040
 It's like set up like a Sunday morning comic strip, but instead of the story of like a

201
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,640
 talking cat or the story of a young boy and his stuffed tiger, it's a story of a man who's

202
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,080
 a targeted individual.

203
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,840
 Now obviously it's a podcast and I'm going to be talking about a comic strip.

204
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,920
 There's some stuff that's going to be lost in translation, but trust me, I think you'll

205
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
 get the gist of it.

206
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,320
 Plus go to the show notes and please help me save this comic strip if you have your

207
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
 own.

208
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,400
 You're currently a web comic artist.

209
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,920
 Maybe you can do a spin-off.

210
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,120
 Maybe you can do a crossover.

211
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
 Who knows?

212
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
 Targ the Target.

213
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,720
 So the very first comic strip.

214
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 Very first comic strip.

215
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,520
 He tells us about this.

216
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
 My name's Targ.

217
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
 My name's...

218
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,240
 My parents should have named me Peaceful or something.

219
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,520
 Instead they named me Targ.

220
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
 I'm Targ the Target.

221
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,080
 I'm being gangstocked.

222
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,760
 And here's proof.

223
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,760
 Every night someone bounces a tennis ball against my house.

224
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,840
 Sometimes when I'm walking down the street there's pennies and cigarette butts laying

225
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,600
 around.

226
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
 One time I went to work and my...

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,520
 This is actually pretty hilarious.

228
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,720
 One time I went to work and someone took apart my work chair.

229
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,280
 And the last panel.

230
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,720
 So all this stuff right?

231
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,200
 Maybe he lives next to a tennis court or maybe there's a gangstalker thrown at tennis ball

232
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,520
 against his wall.

233
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,720
 Maybe he lives in any major EO city or where there's pennies and cigarette butts everywhere

234
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,040
 or there's a gangstalker who likes to smoke cigarettes and I don't know throw pennies at

235
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
 ants.

236
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,880
 Maybe he works with me and I took his work chair apart.

237
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,720
 But all this stuff he's taught and he says like he comes home food's missing.

238
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
 And then all this stuff's going on in the last panel.

239
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,240
 He goes this is the last panel.

240
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,600
 And this shows the mind of the gangstalker right?

241
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,880
 Like he's finding patterns everywhere.

242
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:04,400
 And then the last panel he goes even my neighbors suddenly act as if I'm some kind of sex criminal.

243
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,080
 Now if you're waiting for a punchline I should tell you right now these comic strips aren't

244
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
 funny.

245
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
 It's in a comic strip...

246
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,080
 Well I am laughing at them but they're in a comic strip forum and I go wait a second.

247
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,400
 So cigarette butts and the food's missing and so that means I'm your roommate.

248
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,160
 They act like you're a sex criminal.

249
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
 What?

250
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
 That's kind of a downer too.

251
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,760
 Don't hit your comic strip like that too.

252
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,880
 Family circus is like daddy why do you have to talk to all your neighbors whenever we

253
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,640
 move and the dad's like oh I wouldn't include sex criminal stuff into your comic strip.

254
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,000
 I am not a comic artist myself but that's how it ends.

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Again not a joke.

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 It's not funny.

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I'm laughing at it because this is insane but then the second comic strip starts up

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,920
 and someone spits while he's walking past the target.

259
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,320
 And he takes that as the fact that this guy is gangstalking him right?

260
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
 This is one of these signals.

261
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,840
 If you spit near me it must be like you're trying to harass me.

262
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,040
 That's the whole thing they just want to harass you leaving pennies.

263
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,840
 Well I don't know why leaving pennies and cigarette butts would be harassing.

264
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,080
 I'd have a bunch of money each day.

265
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,120
 And on all the free nicotine.

266
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,400
 Guy spits near him and that he realizes he's being gangstalked today and then the third

267
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
 panel.

268
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
 First panel is a guy spitting.

269
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,600
 Second panel is Targ going spit like questioning it.

270
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:31,920
 And then the third panel says quote what is going on?

271
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,000
 I had something to come on to.

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,920
 There must be something else going on with you.

273
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,160
 And the third panel goes what is going on?

274
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,160
 I had someone call me pedophile the other day.

275
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
 What?

276
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,120
 He never brings that back up.

277
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,240
 He never really addresses it.

278
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,200
 I don't know if this guy actually is a sex criminal.

279
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
 I don't know.

280
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,280
 He's like man it does sure suck that people are giving me weird looks since I put my flyer

281
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,640
 up everywhere because I'm not allowed within 50 feet of a school.

282
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,600
 Why is everyone treating me like some sort of weirdo and spitting at me?

283
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,680
 He keeps bringing this up that people act like he's a pedophile that he's a sex criminal

284
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,840
 but he never addresses why those allegations would be there.

285
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,840
 What's interesting is the comic strip is written by someone called Eleanor but Targ

286
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,160
 is a dude and you could go that's fine Jason you know they're a dude to write wonder woman

287
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,000
 comic books you don't necessarily have to be the same sex as the person in the comic

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,720
 strip but this Eleanor breaks the fourth wall at one point and begins taking photos of their

289
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
 house.

290
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,160
 Targ is narrating their life.

291
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,400
 It gets so weird and all we have this series used to be super long.

292
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,080
 There used to be a time because I remember reading this probably about a year ago when

293
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
 I was laughing.

294
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,960
 I was having a good laugh when I thought but it's hard to talk about a comic strip on a

295
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
 podcast.

296
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,080
 It's really hard because you kind of have to see it and hopefully I'm making it slightly

297
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,400
 entertaining and easy to follow but he had a ton of these and he even had a spinoff series

298
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,040
 called Peter the Perp where we got to see the other side of the game.

299
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
 It wasn't as funny.

300
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
 It wasn't as funny.

301
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,320
 I was like boring but what's happened I went to I was going through my bookmarks I was

302
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,920
 looking at something else I was looking for something else and I go to Targ the target

303
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,980
 dude I'm gonna see like where this guy's at is this guy currently still putting out

304
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,920
 comic books gone it's gone.

305
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,200
 There are 18 strips on a Reddit page and I've archived the Reddit page but even then

306
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,280
 it no longer posts them you have to like click on each one and then so I don't know if I

307
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,080
 have to archive all those because that this guy already thinks he's being gangstalked

308
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,040
 to Google don't feed into that.

309
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,560
 I don't it's possible that he published something super egregious towards the end and it got

310
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:58,200
 scrubbed but it's gone like these 18 comic strips are all that we have of this long saga

311
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,960
 of Targ the target.

312
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,800
 But at one point he starts taking photographs Eleanor starts taking photographs of their

313
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:12,520
 house but it's also Targ's house and it's like photographs of a chair someone broken

314
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:20,120
 it was house apparently and sawed his folding chair in half and took the teeth out of his

315
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,200
 zipper he bought a new jacket and then someone broken it was house and pulled two teeth out

316
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,680
 of his zipper so I mean this is all still really hilarious stuff right but so he couldn't

317
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:38,440
 zip up his jacket anymore and it's so weird and it's so like we talk a lot about like

318
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,440
 the gangstalking mindset on this show we have a lot of writings about it and we have videos

319
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,960
 about it people shooting videos of them walking down the street being like why are you gangstalking

320
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,120
 me why are you gangstalking me but a comic strip like I think this is new this ongoing

321
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,440
 saga of Targ this comic strip detailing all this stuff because we really got to see the

322
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,880
 day to day life the videos are just I feel bad for the mailman some guy jumping out of

323
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,240
 the bushes and being like why are you following me why are you coming to my house every day

324
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,760
 and put stuff in a box this was really like a day to day and they were showing photographs

325
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,760
 of he had a container of creamer and he would put marks on it to show how much they were

326
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,020
 using each day and he showed his heating pad he's like someone made my heating pad all

327
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,360
 furry it's hot when I touch it it gets hot I'm like ouch ouch what did you do to my heating

328
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,200
 pad it's so weird someone messed up his velcro shoes there's photographs of this and then

329
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,600
 he just then he has a panel he has a comic strip where he goes to his boss and he's like

330
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,360
 hey boss I'm so sorry I was late for work a bunch of cars boxed me in and they made me

331
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,160
 go really slow all the way to work and then someone like at some point when my car is

332
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,000
 parked someone drilled a hole in like my radiator I'm sorry I'm late and the boss is like if

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,280
 you're late one more time you're gonna get fired you you're crazy I don't believe any

334
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,720
 of that and that probably happened not that he was actually gangstalked up that that stuff

335
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,560
 happened but I'm sure he was going to his boss and being like hey I'm sorry I'm late

336
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:12,360
 I was gangstalked on the way to work they made me be slow and how would you deal with

337
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,080
 that like I guess I didn't really thought about like on the outside because we get to

338
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,440
 see targ dealing with other people it's show like that's a real thing your boss would have

339
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,200
 to deal with that being like what in the world is going on he's telling me that there is

340
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,640
 a gang of unidentified people who not only came to work and disassembled his chair when

341
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,280
 that was clearly Jason clearly Jason did that not only did they disassemble his work

342
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,560
 chair they follow him to and from work and make him drive super slowly when in the real

343
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:49,800
 world we just call that traffic really really interesting story at one point his cat gets

344
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,680
 its throat slit I know it's a super weird escalation the cat gets its throat slit and

345
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,400
 the cops blame him and say listen you've been calling us you've been making all these complaints

346
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,760
 for a long time we're a little concerned for your mental health and that becomes a reoccurring

347
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,960
 thing he keeps bringing up the cat so did he kill his own cat did someone else kill the

348
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:21,640
 cat weird it really really is weird and it's disappearing and I wish that if someone else

349
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,520
 I'm also putting if someone else can recover the other couple dozen I think there was like

350
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,440
 30 of these comics originally I have in the show notes you're going to be able to read

351
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,920
 the first 18 strips of target the target and then there's a couple panels a couple strips

352
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:45,400
 also of Peter the perp this is a series but this is lost media that's going to disappear

353
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,960
 and it's one of those things that's lost media that nobody would have even known was lost

354
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,960
 I stumbled across it a year ago I had a good laugh I said it's really hard to talk about

355
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,360
 pictures on a podcast and let it go but now that this thing may be disappearing it is our

356
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,240
 duty as listeners of a paranormal podcast to try to save us and try to recover some

357
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:15,000
 of it because it's it's crazy it's absolutely crazy so that is the saga of target the target

358
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,800
 is this the end will it just fade away I don't know what happened to the dude it doesn't look

359
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,600
 like he's posting anything else Eleanor whatever name whoever is doing it's target the target's

360
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,520
 creator isn't putting out anything else that I can find so interesting lost media right

361
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:38,240
 for our eyes the ramblings of a madman put into comic strip form and telling a story

362
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,160
 that's just completely unbelievable but to the person in the story and the person writing

363
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,920
 the story it's true life absolutely fascinating Sean let's go ahead and toss you the keys

364
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,040
 of the carbonic copter we're leaving behind the city as I'm throwing pennies out on the

365
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:00,040
 street I'm like haha I will be part of your madness we're leaving behind the city we are

366
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:12,520
 headed all the way out to Guiana the story was posted online by a user known as GTR Nick

367
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:19,240
 so we're just going to call this dude Nick in Guiana there is an unnamed village that

368
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,280
 Nick lives at and this village is near the outskirts of Georgetown so it doesn't have

369
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,840
 the same amount of safety that a major city would have for the residents and because they're

370
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,000
 this farther off town every so often organized criminals will come through the village and

371
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,960
 basically shake down the people there Raiders I mean if any other period of time you would

372
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,000
 imagine like Mongol warriors on horseback or Vikings coming into France and just taking

373
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,960
 what they wanted and leaving but nowadays it's organized gangs with guns and cars not an easy

374
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,400
 life for Nick and to make it even worse he had chronic asthma so he had a hard time this

375
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:11,360
 is super stressful right it's super stressful and you're like you're trying not to get too

376
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,080
 freaked out because your asthma is going to kick up but constantly dudes are running around

377
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,840
 with guns taking your newest toy they're like alright so he had chronic asthma as a kid

378
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,200
 he could run but he couldn't never really run at full speed and he couldn't run for

379
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,400
 that long so it made it a little bit harder probably to play soccer and to have a lot

380
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,600
 of fun with the other kids but what are you going to do you have bigger problems every

381
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,240
 so often armed Raiders coming to your town if you're not picked first for a soccer game

382
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,360
 I think you'll be okay but Nick he was dealing with this chronic asthma as a kid and at this

383
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,800
 point when this story takes place he's 12 years old now what would happen and this this

384
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,400
 makes sense right after the umpteenth time some Raiders came into town it's not like

385
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,160
 it was even the same group of Raiders you could get a bunch of people come into town and be

386
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,120
 like give us all your money and they leave and then two days later a different gang

387
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,160
 shows up and being like hey guys guess what we're here for all your money and they're

388
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,920
 like we already gave your date your couple days late buddy you already gave all our money

389
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,520
 to someone else the leaders of this particular village were like we're not doing this anymore

390
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,400
 we're not doing this anymore we're done so they started to put up a fight now when the

391
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,480
 Raiders would show up and they weren't easily getting what they wanted a lot of times that

392
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,080
 sometimes that's all it takes right it's for someone to be like no and then they leave

393
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,240
 like I don't recommend that if you're getting mugged just give me your watch and your wallet

394
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,320
 but sometimes that's all it takes but this time in this story we don't have a time period

395
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,360
 for this story but I'm just gonna place it's probably somewhere around the early 2000s 90s

396
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,880
 probably somewhere in there on this particular time the Raiders show up to the town the village

397
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,920
 leaders go out and they say we are not going to give you anything you gotta leave and the

398
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,640
 Raiders go that we're not gonna accept that you gotta give us something you gotta give

399
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,480
 a I don't know what about that goat over there it looks a little sick you don't need to know

400
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,800
 we're not giving you anything the village leaders said we've had it up to here with you guys

401
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:29,640
 coming into town and trying to take our stuff as silence fills the village for a moment little

402
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:37,660
 nick is in his house looking through the window there with the rest of his family the village

403
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:46,880
 leaders are out there the gang members are out there there's an eerie silence and soon

404
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:58,440
 the silence was replaced with wave after wave of automatic gunfire people just start running

405
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,320
 out of their houses they know at this point the gang is most likely most likely gonna

406
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,360
 win and they're just gonna go house to house and start taking stuff and if you're in the

407
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,480
 house who knows what's gonna happen to you Nick and his family run out of their house

408
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,040
 and they're running down the street and everyone's running out of their houses trying to get

409
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:23,120
 away from what's going on and there's gunfire echoing everywhere and there's so much chaos

410
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,000
 in the street everyone's just kind of running in different directions kind of pushing stuff

411
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,120
 around Nick realizes very quickly he is no longer running with his family he's running

412
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,360
 with some people that he doesn't know and then he's running with some people he does

413
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,080
 know in this group and some of them he's like I don't know you nice to meet you my name's

414
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:48,160
 Nick but he does realize that he happens to be in the group of people out of all the groups

415
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,120
 of people that are running through the village now he's running with the village leader who

416
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,040
 started this whole thing by not giving them anything he's literally running with the one

417
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:08,160
 guy they want to kill more than anyone Nick's running with this group of adults and he says

418
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:17,320
 one by one he's watching bodies drop on each side of him because the leaders with them

419
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,200
 this is the group that the gang is targeting the most and Lil Nick 12 years old can you

420
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:29,760
 imagine this running watching adults get blown away right next to him he's never run this

421
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:37,280
 fast in his life he's never run this far in his life he physically can't but he's doing

422
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:45,480
 it because he's going to die otherwise he has to run and all of a sudden the sun in

423
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:56,840
 the sky begins to glow so bright Nick's never seen anything that blinding and this white

424
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:09,400
 light begins to encompass his entire vision until he can see nothing but the light and

425
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,160
 he thinks in his head my body's shutting down like I've run so far I'm not able to get

426
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:21,520
 enough breath my brain shutting down my body shutting down this is the end he's seeing

427
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,000
 this great white light because his body just can't handle all of the pressure he's putting

428
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,480
 on it but then the bright light focuses to a single point and once again Nick can now

429
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,800
 see the village clearly and he's running like he was running before but when he turns to

430
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:45,520
 a side he sees a stranger running next to him he says the guy was wearing this kind

431
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,960
 of weird outfit it was nothing that he recognized that any of the other people in the village

432
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,160
 would wear this guy's running next to him and he goes he was keeping pace with me but

433
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:06,760
 I knew he was running faster than me like we're side to side but he is running so fast I look

434
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,480
 down and his legs are moving so quickly they're leaving a blur he goes I can see an after

435
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:22,000
 image of his legs as he's running I'm keeping up with him and the man it's an adult looks

436
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,160
 down at him and smiles and says quote just keep running we're almost there and you're

437
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:40,280
 doing great Nick said the man was so confident he just exuded this confidence it comforted

438
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:54,000
 Nick he felt safe he felt protected he himself little Nick felt powerful in this moment a

439
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:08,160
 gunshot rings out right behind Nick it's too close it's too close and the stranger just

440
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:22,760
 gently pushed Nick's arm just gave him a little shove the world goes black

441
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:29,720
 Nick wakes up in a hospital in Georgetown he's being attended to and everyone's asking dude

442
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:37,040
 how did you get here how did you run all the way from that village to Georgetown he doesn't

443
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,680
 have an answer he didn't know he didn't know he was in Georgetown I was running this guy

444
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,560
 showed up and we were running together and then I blacked out I don't know what happened

445
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:55,640
 after that years later Nick and his family moved to the United States the land of opportunity

446
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,400
 there they can leave behind the chaos of this village him and his family come to the United

447
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:11,680
 States he said I'm in high school I'm reading this book about Greek mythology reading this

448
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,640
 book I love it I love all this stuff about all of these gods that I've never heard of

449
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,840
 in these stories and I remember I'm reading this book and I turn the page and there on

450
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:30,040
 this page was a drawing a drawing of the man who ran next to me that day he said the man

451
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:38,040
 running next to him was wearing a golden half helmet with metal boots that reached to his

452
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:47,280
 knees and he was wearing a white and gold leather vest that even in the daytime shown

453
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:56,720
 brightly looking at that page and continuing to do more research he came to the conclusion

454
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:11,000
 he was saved by the Greek god Hermes fascinating story I love this story I love this story

455
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,280
 this guy got shot out and a bunch of people got killed in his village but it's such a

456
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:20,480
 fascinating story of a Greek god coming to earth to save this kid and it's one of those

457
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,880
 things that this might be the outlier when we're looking at the world of paranormal this

458
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,000
 might be the outlier this may be the only story we can really find where a version of

459
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,400
 a Greek god comes to earth and save someone one thing I've learned on this show sometimes

460
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:40,480
 it's not the outlier it's the only story we've found a long time ago I did an episode about

461
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,680
 someone waking up in a pitch black room they're just locked into this black bedroom void I

462
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,400
 thought it was an outlier is a one-off story and then I started finding more and more and

463
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,840
 more and now it's one of the official mysteries of dead rabbit radio it's something that I'm

464
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,680
 really interested in and I cover it every time I find it because it turned out not to

465
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:07,840
 be an outlier it turned out to be it was so weird it was hard to find stories about it

466
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,320
 it was so weird people didn't even want to talk about it so could the same thing be happening

467
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:21,960
 here could people be in dire circumstances and they're being saved by old gods and actually

468
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,480
 I just thought of this what would be even more interesting is he didn't know that's

469
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:32,160
 what this was at the time if someone was a devout Catholic and they believed in God and

470
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:38,520
 the Virgin Mary and Jesus and they're in a horrible car accident and in their time of

471
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:48,240
 need Zeus showed up to help him would you repeat that story the car goes off the road

472
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,920
 crashes into a ravine everyone's unconscious there's blood everywhere I don't know if it's

473
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:02,000
 mine or my loved ones I'm hanging upside down in this car and then Zeus showed up and ripped

474
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,760
 open the car door and charge my phone my phone was dead he charged it with a little lightning

475
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:16,880
 bolt and then said everything's gonna be okay ma'am everything's gonna be okay and the next

476
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,720
 thing I know I'm in the hospital apparently I called 911 we were all airlifted out of

477
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,840
 there would they tell that story because I think if you accept the existence of the old

478
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,800
 gods you accept accept the existence of all gods and if there's all gods then where does

479
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,000
 God fit into that it's fascinating it actually might this might be a one-off story it could

480
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 be a fake it but it could be a story that it's one of those things people don't talk

481
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,200
 about it because it actually makes you question the religion that you were raised in or the

482
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,320
 religion that you converted to because it was the one that spoke most to you this might

483
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,560
 be a more common not saying super common right but saying this might happen more often people

484
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,280
 don't feel comfortable talking about it because it could make them feel like their religious

485
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:10,640
 faith their belief is a little less true whether or not this is a worldwide phenomenon whether

486
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,840
 or not this happens all the time and people just aren't talking about it none of that

487
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:22,160
 matters to Nick all Nick is concerned about all Nick cares about is that day that whether

488
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:30,760
 or not anyone else believes him Hermes the Greek God came down from the heavens to save

489
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:42,640
 his life he can't make sense of it he doesn't know why it happened but he does know the

490
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:50,680
 only reason he's alive today is because a man who the modern world says never existed

491
00:34:50,680 --> 00:35:08,200
 did in fact exist and they ran together until Nick lived to tell the tale
