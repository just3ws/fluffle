1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
 A mental delusion that primarily affected rich people 300 years ago.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,680
 And then we take a look at the often requested iceberg conspiracy.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,760
 It's just three words and a lot of people have tried to interpret them.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
 BAM!

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
 Margeras Afterlife.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,760
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:31,840
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,360
 I hope you're having a great day too.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,760
 We only have this episode and then one more before the end of the year.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,440
 You'll be getting an episode coming out on the 31st and then after that, brand new year.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
 We're not taking a break.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,160
 We take a break, a week long break, every 50 episodes so we're not going to take a break

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
 that first week.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,760
 But I got something special in store for the New Year's Eve episode.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,160
 I don't know.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,240
 It's maybe, might be a little self-indulgent.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,400
 But if I was a podcast listener, I would enjoy it.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
 So I don't know.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,280
 We'll see how it goes over.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
 It's not more music.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,240
 Okay, let's go ahead and jump into our first story.

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,880
 Our first story is going to be a short one.

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,000
 It's actually a recommendation from a YouTube viewer named Kluubitz.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,200
 So Kluubitz posts on YouTube and referenced to a video.

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,200
 Honestly, I forgot what the video itself was that they were referencing.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,680
 I think it was the one where people were thinking they were struggling to remember.

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,040
 It was something to do with people thinking they were something...

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,200
 Oh, Truman Show!

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
 Truman Show!

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
 It was the Truman Show one.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,160
 People who thought they were stuck in the Truman Show.

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,720
 Kluubitz said, "Speaking of delusions, have you ever heard of the glass delusion people

35
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,800
 think they're made of glass?"

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,480
 Now obviously, I had to go do research on that.

37
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,960
 Glass delusion was something super bizarre.

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,960
 So between the 15th and the 17th century, it was a delusion that popped up.

39
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,760
 It was a product of its time.

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,120
 And that's one thing I talked about on the Truman Show delusion episode, is that these

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,000
 type of invasive thoughts are based on the time period that they're in.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,720
 So nowadays people may think they're stuck in the Matrix or stuck in a reality show,

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,680
 but back in the 60s, it was the Russians are putting radio waves into my head.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,920
 Well, you go back in the 15th century, they didn't have reality shows, which was bleak.

45
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
 Everybody loves reality.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,240
 I don't care what you guys say.

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,160
 I don't care.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,920
 Everybody watches reality shows.

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,680
 And you go, "I don't watch Keeping Up the Kardashians."

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,960
 I'm not talking Pond Stars, Mythbusters.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,560
 Come on, those are reality.

52
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,560
 Those are reality shows at their core, because half of it is the learning part of it, but

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,520
 the other half are the personalities involved.

54
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,680
 It's a reality show.

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,200
 Those are reality shows.

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,720
 They're not scripted sitcoms or dramas or anything like that.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,800
 Everyone watches reality shows.

58
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
 So it was a bleak.

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 That's why they called it the Dark Ages, because there was no reality shows.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
 The real world had not been invented yet.

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
 Dark times for the Republic.

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,760
 Anyways, 15th to 17th century, their new technology, their new thing for people to get excited

63
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,400
 about and a little scared was glass.

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
 It was see through glass.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,080
 Now glass had been around for centuries before that, but windowpaints hadn't.

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,320
 Like actually, they had a kind of window type pain.

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,320
 It was not like glass.

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,160
 It was this other kind of see through-ish stuff that I don't remember, because I didn't

69
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,280
 put it in my notes.

70
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,200
 But having like see through windows in your house or in your castle or wherever was brand

71
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
 new.

72
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,880
 And that's why this was affecting primarily rich people.

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,680
 The Royals were the ones suffering from glass illusion.

74
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,080
 Most famous sufferer was King Charles VI of France.

75
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,520
 He believed that parts of him were made of glass, and so he wouldn't let anybody touch

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
 him.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,000
 And he had he wear reinforced clothing.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,600
 So of course my imagination took it to him walking around in the suit of armor.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,400
 But when I looked into it, he just wore like a cushion on his butt.

80
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,080
 It's this idea that they're so fragile that any unexpected movement, jumping down on a

81
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,720
 bed too hard, what have you, will cause them to break.

82
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,840
 When psychologists look back, they think it was the glass delusion was an offshoot of

83
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,960
 just like general melancholy.

84
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,800
 Which I mean it was just like this blah, this blahzay, it was this weird reaction to, I guess

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,000
 I always thought melancholy was just kind of like, you basically, you know, you're just

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,880
 like you're the living embodiment of a smashing pumpkin song.

87
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,400
 And they might have a more medical disease, there might actually be a specific term that

88
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,040
 melancholy means.

89
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,320
 But I mean maybe they just sat around so long they're like, oh, and then they basically

90
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,520
 started having anxiety attacks because their brain isn't working, their brain's not active

91
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,720
 enough and I don't know I'm making that up.

92
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,160
 That might not be true.

93
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,400
 But what is true is the glass delusion and the connection to melancholy.

94
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,200
 There actually was a book called The Anatomy of Melancholy back in 1621.

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,320
 So they were, these people were being diagnosed with this stuff.

96
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,560
 And psychologists even back then, I don't think they were called psychologists, I think

97
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,320
 they were probably called like witch doctors or something, alchemists.

98
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,080
 But they were trying to figure out why people had glass delusion and how to cure it.

99
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,360
 And what's weird is people have been cured of glass delusion, but we don't know how.

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,040
 Like when you look through the text back then they're like, oh, this young woman, she thought

101
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,840
 her legs were made of glass or she wouldn't go anywhere.

102
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,880
 And then someone, a monk showed up and she was cured.

103
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
 And then you turn the page and you're like, wait, what?

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
 So we don't know how it's cured.

105
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,880
 But glass delusion wasn't the only delusion listed in The Anatomy of Melancholy.

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
 These are the other things that people thought they were.

107
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,880
 Some people thought they were completely made of cork, which I don't know when cork was

108
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
 invented again.

109
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,120
 I think there was probably like Genghis Khan had like cork stoppers in his wine and stuff

110
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
 like that.

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,680
 But it's funny because you would basically think you were like, how would you, at what

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,280
 point do you wake up and your brain goes, you're cork?

113
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,720
 And you're like, what?

114
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,440
 Your brain's like, you're cork.

115
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,160
 You're a big piece of cork, dude.

116
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,080
 And you at first you'd be like, no, I'm not looking.

117
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,840
 And then your brain would convince you you were cork.

118
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,440
 But how would you test that?

119
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
 Just take a bath?

120
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,440
 Like if you just got in a bathtub and you sat at the bottom, you'd be like, no, no,

121
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
 I'm not.

122
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,840
 And the brain's like, dang, nab it.

123
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,400
 Foiled again.

124
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,360
 But I mean, I guess it may be like they got in the bathtub and they were kind of floating

125
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,280
 and they thought they were a cork.

126
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,760
 People also thought along the same lines as cork, they were light as feathers.

127
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,920
 So again, these are easy things to test.

128
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:45,160
 I get if you thought your legs or your stomach or your butt or whatever was made of glass

129
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,080
 that you wouldn't want to test that, you're like, no, I'm not.

130
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,000
 And then you jump down on your butt on the floor and just shatter.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
 Like I get not wanting to test that.

132
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,360
 But if I had the delusion that I was light as feathers, I would want to test that.

133
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,440
 I'd be all, wee, I'd just be like walking on the street and then a stiff wind comes

134
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
 and I fly away.

135
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,920
 I would want to test that.

136
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,480
 I wouldn't be scared if I was light as a feather.

137
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,320
 I probably wouldn't be scared if I was light as a cork, but I wouldn't test that because

138
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,360
 you would have to jump into a big thing of water.

139
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,640
 Now you're thinking, well, those are pretty good.

140
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,560
 I, you know, who doesn't want to be lighter?

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
 Who doesn't want to fly away or bob in the water?

142
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,480
 Well, some people thought they were heavy as lead, which again is something you could

143
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,440
 easily test simply by flexing your joints and doing that little thing called moving around.

144
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
 Like you could ease.

145
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,400
 I think that probably be the easiest one to fake though, because little kids do it all

146
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,080
 the time when the mom's like, come on, you got to go to bed and they're like, oh, I can't

147
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,240
 get up.

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,600
 So I mean, they could fake that.

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,360
 But again, like if someone tried to convince me that dude, you're as heavy as a piece of

150
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,760
 lead, I'd be like, no, I'm not.

151
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 And I would just stand up.

152
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,960
 And if my brain tried to convince me of that, I would still be like, oh, that's a good,

153
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,960
 easy one to test because you're not fragile.

154
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,840
 So if someone says I have the reaction times of lead, I can't move, just throw a baseball

155
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,200
 at him, throw an old time.

156
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,520
 What's the old timey equivalent of a baseball, a rock?

157
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,400
 I guess would just be you throw a rock at him.

158
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,160
 And when they grab it because they don't want to get beaned in the face, you go, does lead

159
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,000
 move that fast?

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,720
 I would be the ultimate psychologist in the old times or witch doctors as they're more

161
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,320
 commonly known as.

162
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,320
 Another thing noted in this amazing book called the Anatomy of Melancholy is this story isn't

163
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
 short.

164
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,200
 I'm actually having a lot of fun with this is frogs full of bellies.

165
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,440
 Wait, no, I wrote that backwards.

166
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,080
 It's bellies full of frogs, which makes much more sense.

167
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,000
 Frogs full of bellies would not be your problem.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,760
 That would be the problem of the frog.

169
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,320
 You got to take better notes.

170
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
 A belly full of frogs.

171
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,240
 So that would be something that would be hard to test, obviously, because you'd be like,

172
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,640
 look at my stomachs full of frogs and you're like, no, they're not.

173
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,160
 I mean, what are you going to do then cut them open because any sort of like rumbling in your

174
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
 stomach, they're just eating beans all the time.

175
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,480
 And they're like, I'm telling you, frogs are in my stomach.

176
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
 You're like, dude, quit eating beans.

177
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
 And you won't.

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,680
 And he's like, mm-mm, they want to eat beans.

179
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
 That would be a hard one.

180
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,440
 And that would be really disconcerting to think you had a bunch of frogs in your stomach.

181
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,080
 Why frogs and not other amphibians or even mammals?

182
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
 I don't know.

183
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,000
 But I'm sure somebody thought there was like a mongoose in their stomach.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,520
 And then this was an interesting one.

185
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,280
 There was one other listed here.

186
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,120
 And that was that your head would roll off.

187
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,480
 That if you didn't keep your head upright or you weren't holding onto your head in some

188
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,040
 fashion, your head would just roll off your body.

189
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,760
 That's again, not something that somebody would want to test.

190
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
 You're like, no, your head is attached.

191
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
 Just move your hands.

192
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,040
 And they're like, I believe you.

193
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
 And then the head rolls off.

194
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,520
 Like you wouldn't want to do that.

195
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,400
 Now I'm going to butcher this name.

196
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,000
 But I think you know what I'm talking about.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,440
 Chakovsky, the composer, Chakovsky, whatever, you know his name.

198
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,040
 He thought his head would fall off if he didn't hold it upright.

199
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,360
 And people thought it was a myth.

200
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,200
 Like historians are like, maybe that's not true.

201
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,400
 Maybe that was just a myth that he had this delusion.

202
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,760
 But they've unearthed writings of that time period where he was like, no, no, no, I'd

203
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,280
 really like to compose.

204
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,040
 But I got to pull my head up all the time.

205
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
 People are like, what?

206
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,320
 He's like, yeah, if I get to move away from my piano and stand up and start composing,

207
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
 how do I know where to keep my head?

208
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,960
 They're like, what are you talking about?

209
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,560
 He's like, my head's going to fall off.

210
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,640
 If I don't keep it perfectly upright.

211
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,000
 And again, he was treated for that.

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,480
 But nobody knows why.

213
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,960
 Like nobody, I mean, no, people know why, but nobody knows how he was treated for that.

214
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,000
 And eventually he realized his head wouldn't fall off.

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,960
 But again, these are interesting delusions because they tended to affect the wealthy,

216
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,560
 especially the glass one.

217
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,080
 I think probably the poor people back then didn't worry about having delusions because

218
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,600
 they were just dying of horrible diseases and preventable medical issues.

219
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,960
 They're like, oh, I think I made a glass, but also all of my teeth are infected and I'm

220
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,120
 slowly dying.

221
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,920
 So pick your poison.

222
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,360
 But for the rich people who had all the food and the medical care of the time that they

223
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,600
 needed, they would have time to sit around and think of these made up diseases.

224
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,640
 And interestingly enough, glass delusion is still around.

225
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
 It's incredibly rare.

226
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,560
 It's incredibly rare, but every so often someone pops up and they think they're made a glass.

227
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
 Recently a woman thought she was made of a clay pot.

228
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,520
 And then again, they just kind of treat it.

229
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,360
 And then one day the person goes, oh yeah, I'm not, I'm not that anymore.

230
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,640
 And they just get them and walk away.

231
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,040
 It's kind of a bizarre delusion.

232
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,120
 It doesn't, it affects them short term.

233
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
 It's super, super vivid.

234
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,880
 And then it was just with whatever treatment, they still don't know why.

235
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,360
 They just wake up one day and they go, well, I'm not made a glass.

236
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,680
 And they go out and they play rugby or something.

237
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
 Probably not rugby.

238
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
 Okay.

239
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,480
 Shrap in your sea belts, guys and gals, because this is going to be a weird one.

240
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,400
 Now this has been one of the topics that has been requested pretty much since the beginning

241
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,640
 of the show.

242
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,800
 And like I said, it's been highly requested, but I did want to give a special shout out

243
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,160
 to YouTube viewer SarahVem.

244
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,600
 You made this request fairly recently and I wanted to give you credit for it as well.

245
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,680
 When I started doing the conspiracy iceberg, a lot of people were asking for asking for

246
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
 stuff like "Agglish Travel".

247
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,680
 They were asking for stuff like "Lord of the Rings Based on Real Life", "Simpsons

248
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
 is a Reality Show".

249
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,360
 But one of the segments that they was requested, and I've covered all of those, was Bam Marjara's

250
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,000
 Afterlife.

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Conspiracy iceberg chart is a chart we reference quite a lot on this show.

252
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,280
 The top of the iceberg are very well known conspiracies.

253
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,800
 And as you go deeper and deeper into the water, you see lesser known conspiracies.

254
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,720
 And Bam Marjara's Afterlife floats around in the middle of there.

255
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,160
 Now, we're going to be getting into some crazy conspiracy theory stuff right now.

256
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,680
 Everything I'm going to read to you has been written by a real person, somebody, and actually

257
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,160
 multiple people believe these theories because I've seen them pop up from time to time.

258
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,880
 Over the course of months, I want to say off the bat, this is meant to be no disrespect

259
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,720
 to Ryan Dunn and Bam Marjara and his friends and his family and his fans and all the people

260
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,000
 around the world who have lost people in automotive accidents at all.

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,760
 This is not the point of this.

262
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,560
 The point of this is to examine the insanity behind some of the conspiracy theories and

263
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,280
 I think I actually have the answer for what Bam Marjara Afterlife actually means.

264
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,480
 We'll get to that in a second.

265
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,800
 But first, imagine you're sitting in your living room.

266
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,080
 You're sitting in your living room drinking a nice cup of diet cranberry sprite.

267
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
 There's a knock at your door.

268
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,520
 You're like, that's kind of late.

269
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,160
 Why is there a dude coming to my door?

270
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,720
 You're assuming it's a man because of the long arms.

271
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,960
 You can almost tell whoever's knocking has long arms.

272
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,040
 You're like, that's weird.

273
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,720
 I can hear the elbow joint clacking.

274
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
 You get up, you open the door.

275
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,200
 There's a familiar face in front of you, but it's not exactly who you think it is.

276
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:57,400
 Now, previously, Hans stormed into our common bedrooms and berated us on the fact that we

277
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,240
 believed the monkeys were real.

278
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,000
 But this is not Hans.

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,400
 No, for legal reasons, because Hans isn't officially sane.

280
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,160
 This is his twin brother, Franz.

281
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
 Long arms.

282
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,040
 He still has the same long arms.

283
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,880
 Hans walks in to your living room.

284
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,120
 You don't invite him in.

285
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,600
 You don't even really know what's going on.

286
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
 He just walks in.

287
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
 He sits down.

288
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 He looks around the room.

289
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,520
 You're like, damn it, not this again.

290
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,840
 He goes, oh, PlayStation 2.

291
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
 Huh?

292
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
 You like playing the PlayStation 2?

293
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,200
 You're like, kind of an old school guy.

294
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,840
 He looks on your shelf.

295
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,160
 You have the Jackass video game, which is actually a great game for the PlayStation 2 if you haven't

296
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
 played it.

297
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
 I love that game.

298
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
 He goes, oh, Jackass.

299
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
 Huh?

300
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,200
 And you're thinking, I have 50 games on my shelf.

301
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
 That's the one he sees.

302
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
 Yeah, yeah, Jackass.

303
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,400
 He goes, have you ever heard of the story about Bayon Margera's afterlife?

304
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,640
 Because I have a couple theories about that.

305
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,960
 You're like, great.

306
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,280
 You go to take another drink or your Diet Cranberry Sprite.

307
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:00,880
 He actually picks the cup up before you, looks into it, and goes, refreshing.

308
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,400
 I need a little bit of liquid in my throat to tell you these conspiracy theories.

309
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,820
 Totally true conspiracy theories, according to some people.

310
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,360
 According to Franz, you're like, great.

311
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,200
 He's talking to the third person now.

312
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:19,680
 Did you know, Franz says as he leans towards you, his voice changed oddly enough so I can

313
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,480
 differentiate between the characters?

314
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:29,520
 Did you know that Ryan Dunn, Bayon Margera's best friend and castmate on the hit television

315
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,480
 show Jackass, Jackass the Movie, Jackass, yeah, okay, dude, I know his filmography.

316
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
 Just get to it.

317
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
 Okay.

318
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,780
 I know you're trying to get me, but did you know that Ryan Dunn was trying to get Bam

319
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:50,980
 to sacrifice his parents for eternity, but Bam's purity and love for his so-called parents

320
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,580
 had been tormenting him?

321
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,820
 Ryan Dunn, see, was never alive.

322
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,740
 He was an outer spirit that got in contact with Bam, and through possession they found

323
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:10,660
 a suitable body while Viva La Bam and Jackass were being filmed.

324
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,560
 Did you know that?

325
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,320
 Did you know that people actually believe that happened?

326
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,920
 And you gotta sit back and you go, wait a second.

327
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
 Wait a second.

328
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,720
 So, so you're like, wait, no, no, so Bam and Ryan Dunn were best friends, but Ryan Dunn

329
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,560
 didn't even have a body until they were shooting Viva La Bam, which was way after Jackass.

330
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,180
 No, no, no, it was both.

331
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:42,060
 They were looking for a body in Jackass and Viva La Bam, but he was on the show Jackass,

332
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,460
 so who was that?

333
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,420
 Was that the body they found?

334
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,540
 Or was he looking for a new body?

335
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:56,460
 And why would Bam have to sacrifice his parents that he referred to as so-called parents?

336
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,460
 Why would he have to sacrifice his parents if Ryan Dunn's just looking for a body?

337
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,120
 Was he going to go into the body of both of his parents?

338
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,080
 And Franz just kinda looks at you for a second and goes, I got another theory.

339
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
 I got another theory.

340
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,120
 You're right, that one's kinda foolish, even though a bunch of people believe in that one.

341
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,320
 And it's posted multiple times over the internet.

342
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,760
 I have another one.

343
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:24,200
 Did you know that Bam and his friends performed some sort of blood magic ritual and contacted

344
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,280
 the spirit of Ryan Dunn?

345
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,760
 I'm curious about that ritual.

346
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,580
 What could it have been?

347
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,700
 And you know, you sit back and you go, that is possible.

348
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
 That's possible.

349
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,460
 I think when anyone dies untimely, the loved ones, the people around them will try to figure

350
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,140
 out, they'll go through a lot of stages, but I think of quite a common one is, can I contact

351
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
 them?

352
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,700
 And I think, depending on the religious views of the person, some people may use a Ouija

353
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,140
 board, some people may go to a psychic or a medium, save your money, but some people

354
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,800
 may go on the internet and find some sort of ritual.

355
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,640
 Some people who are wealthy and well connected, as the Jackass crew would be, could have paid

356
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,520
 someone to perform some sort of blood.

357
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,520
 That one is not out of the realm of possibility to me, because I think that would be pretty

358
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
 normal.

359
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,240
 I think that if someone really close to me died in a very tragic way, I would pull out

360
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,920
 all stops to see if I could contact them.

361
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,920
 I think that's totally a legit conspiracy theory.

362
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,140
 I don't necessarily think that it happened, but it wouldn't shock me if it did.

363
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,500
 It wouldn't shock me if it did.

364
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,780
 Franz gets a big, wide smile on his face.

365
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,660
 It's a little too wide.

366
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,780
 It's a little toothy.

367
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,820
 He's like, "Yes, you believe everything now, don't shoot the veils, been lifted.

368
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
 You've seen through them."

369
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,780
 And you're like, "Dude, I agreed with you on one thing.

370
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
 One thing.

371
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
 One thing, dude.

372
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,500
 Can I have my diet cranberry sprite back now?"

373
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,640
 And he goes, "Hey, let me take another sip and quickly let me take another sip here."

374
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
 Hands you back an empty cup.

375
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
 Okay.

376
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,160
 So, now I'm parched.

377
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,240
 You got clear liquid dripping off of your lips.

378
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
 You're gonna leave now, right?

379
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,920
 You've told me one conspiracy theory that was completely bonkers that people believe in.

380
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,680
 You told me another conspiracy theory that as tragic as it is, is something people do.

381
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,960
 You're done, right, Franz?

382
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
 Right now you're one-on-one.

383
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,580
 That's a pretty good record for you.

384
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,840
 He goes, "Ahh, ahh, ahh."

385
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,320
 See waves his finger in front of your face.

386
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,140
 Then he puts it to your lip to shish you even though you're not talking.

387
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,980
 He's like, "Hmm."

388
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,020
 Leaves it there for quite a while.

389
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,660
 Tastes like wet dog.

390
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
 He goes, "No.

391
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
 No.

392
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,720
 No, I'm not done yet.

393
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,800
 I have the biggest conspiracy theory.

394
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,200
 The one that has popped up the most on the internet is right here.

395
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,800
 You have a calculator and you're like, "God damn it.

396
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 God damn it.

397
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,200
 No, I don't have a calculator.

398
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
 Well, good.

399
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,680
 Because calculators were invented by NASA and NASA's the Illuminati."

400
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,920
 So then you kind of start to think about the advocates and the invention.

401
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
 No, no, no, no, no.

402
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
 Don't think about that stuff.

403
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,560
 Don't think about that stuff.

404
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,920
 Did you know this is gonna blow your mind?

405
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,760
 You're like, "Your voice has changed a little bit since a lot."

406
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
 Yeah, yeah.

407
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
 I'm still trying to work it out.

408
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
 I'm still trying to work it out.

409
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,880
 It's pretty much just one take if you guys haven't gotten used to that by now.

410
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:25,040
 The frons looks at you, looks you in the eyes, still holding his finger to your lip and says,

411
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,960
 "Ryan Dunn was driving a Porsche 911."

412
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,680
 Waits for you to be shocked.

413
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,240
 You're mostly just still annoyed that he's touching your face.

414
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,760
 He goes, "Wait, there's more?"

415
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,760
 He died when he was 34 years old.

416
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,360
 Three plus four equals...

417
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,680
 He waits for you to respond in simple math.

418
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,760
 You knock his hand away and go, "It equals seven."

419
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,040
 Seven, yeah, it equals seven.

420
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,320
 Yes, seven.

421
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,360
 It equals seven.

422
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,640
 Where are you going with this?

423
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:08,160
 He was born on June 11th, 19.

424
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,920
 You're like, "Let me guess, 77."

425
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,000
 Yes, 1977.

426
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,160
 He was killed on June 20th.

427
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,600
 You're like, "It's not 2077."

428
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,040
 He goes, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, 2011."

429
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:30,600
 You see, we have 61177 and 62011.

430
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,200
 Blains back in his chair, incredibly satisfied at the fact that he remembers these dates.

431
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,240
 What does that mean?

432
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,280
 You know, 20 minus 11 is 9.

433
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,800
 77 minus 11 is 66, which 6/6.

434
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,680
 Born June, died June.

435
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,680
 Born on 11th day, died at year 11.

436
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
 Date was 20.

437
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,840
 You're like, "Okay, dude, enough of the math."

438
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,240
 What you're telling me is that this was some sort of important date.

439
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,360
 A numerology was used for his sacrifice.

440
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,200
 Yes, I'm telling you that.

441
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,840
 And I'm glad that you said that because even I was getting bored by saying all of those

442
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,340
 numbers.

443
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:15,480
 Did you know that he died around 3 a.m.?

444
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,120
 3 a.m.?

445
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,400
 That's satanic time on your clock.

446
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
 3 a.m., everybody knows that.

447
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,040
 Even JoJo, the precocious little YouTube star, makes videos about being up at 3 a.m.

448
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,720
 Everyone knows that 3 a.m. is haunted, right?

449
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,160
 You're just like, "Okay, well, there's a couple questions I have with this one."

450
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,000
 One, what's around 3 a.m.?

451
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,400
 Because you think the devil would want to be a little more precise than just around.

452
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,760
 Was it 250?

453
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
 Was it 345?

454
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
 No, 330.

455
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,840
 330, okay?

456
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,240
 That's not really around 3 a.m., but close enough.

457
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,720
 Secondly, did he die in Jerusalem?

458
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,520
 This is a question that I've always had.

459
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,880
 3 a.m. being the witch's hour or 3 a.m. because supposedly Jesus died at 3 p.m.

460
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,320
 so it's like the inverse.

461
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,480
 That would only be significant in any sort of way if it was if you were in Jerusalem.

462
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,120
 Because when it was 3 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, that is not the complete opposite of

463
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,360
 when Jesus died.

464
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,200
 First off, Jesus didn't die at 3 p.m., but I mean, was that a side?

465
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:29,240
 The idea that there was a particular hour that happens 365 times a year and across every

466
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,680
 time zone.

467
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,880
 The idea that I could be like in the Colorado Rockies and it's 3 a.m. and a witch is chasing

468
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
 me or a satanic cult.

469
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,720
 They're like, "We have to kill them within the 3 a.m."

470
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,560
 And I run to California and I'm like, "Shh."

471
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,080
 Got away from them and they're like, "No, now you're in Pacific Standard Time.

472
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,600
 It's still 3 a.m."

473
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,800
 It's utterly ridiculous that a particular hour of the day has any sort of significance

474
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,840
 because one, it happens every single day and two, it's different in every single time

475
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
 zone.

476
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,640
 By that logic, some sort of Illuminati cult could just blow a dude's brains out in Japan

477
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,080
 and a researcher over here would be like, "Well, he died at 2 in the afternoon."

478
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
 There's nothing significant about that.

479
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
 Case closed.

480
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,600
 But over there is 3 a.m.

481
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,000
 It doesn't make any sense.

482
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,600
 I always think it's ridiculous when people try to tie in time.

483
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,320
 It's all ridiculous.

484
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,000
 But I've seen this a lot where they're like, "3 a.m. is a sacred hour for Satan worshippers."

485
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,800
 In what time zone?

486
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:38,240
 It's utterly ridiculous and it's not that sacred if it happens every single day.

487
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,320
 Anyways, that rant aside.

488
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,160
 Sorry JoJo that I'm ruining your 3 a.m. videos.

489
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,640
 I'm sure you'll get by.

490
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,440
 I'm sure you'll get by even though some podcaster is basically putting the kibosh on your YouTube

491
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,560
 series.

492
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,200
 That being said, let's go ahead.

493
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
 Sorry Franz, I went off on you Franz.

494
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
 It's kind of scary.

495
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,160
 He's like, "Whoa, that's probably the most animated I've seen, Jason, in quite a while.

496
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,200
 You know how fast he was going?"

497
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,560
 Franz says as he regains his composure.

498
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,240
 Let me guess, he either had a 3 or a 7 or maybe 911 miles an hour.

499
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,560
 He was going 130 miles per hour.

500
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
 Okay, 13.

501
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,320
 There's a 13 in it.

502
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
 Okay, Franz.

503
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,520
 You're kind of pushing your luck here.

504
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,200
 Do you know where he passed away at?

505
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,520
 Now it's unfortunate that I even have to have this conversation with you, honestly, Franz,

506
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,480
 because this happens quite a lot.

507
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
 There are motor accidents.

508
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,680
 He got in a car accident on Route 322.

509
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:52,240
 So 3 plus 2 plus 2 is 7 or 22 plus 3 is 25.

510
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,960
 So what you're telling me now is 25 is a sacred number.

511
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
 I don't know.

512
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,960
 It's just written down in these notes that I have.

513
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,360
 Somebody thought it was significant.

514
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,880
 Many people think this is significant because it's been posted everywhere.

515
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,600
 I'm just repeating it as Franz.

516
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,920
 And oddly enough, 322 is the number assigned to the Skolen Bones Society.

517
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,480
 Try to dispute that, smarty pants.

518
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,320
 So Skolen Bones Society, just for a little bit of reference, is a secret society.

519
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,600
 It is totally true.

520
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,720
 It's a secret society at Harvard, I believe.

521
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,040
 It might be Yale, but I'm pretty sure it's Harvard.

522
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,680
 They have the bones of the Indian chief Geronimo and they dug them up and they have them in

523
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,480
 their little headquarters at school.

524
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,480
 Notable members of Skolen Bones was President George W. Bush and presidential, no, no, what's

525
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
 the term?

526
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,480
 He ran for president of the Democrat.

527
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,120
 It was John Kerry and he was secretary of state and all that stuff.

528
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,080
 So it is a real group.

529
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,480
 Their real number is 322.

530
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,800
 And Reindon did die on Route 322.

531
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:01,360
 Why the Lumen, why a Harvard secret society that has presidents as former members would

532
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:09,080
 want to kill a star of a show that was no longer on the air?

533
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,600
 Nobody can explain in this conspiracy theory.

534
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,840
 And that's really the core of this.

535
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,360
 People have taken this tragic event and assigned all these numbers, using these real numbers,

536
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,760
 meaning all these numbers to it and saying this is why Reindon died.

537
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,080
 He was a blood sacrifice to the Illuminati.

538
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,860
 But why him?

539
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,280
 You could take any traffic accident.

540
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,760
 I think you probably have caught this on, caught on by this trick by now.

541
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,200
 You can take any accident and assign variables to the numbers and come up with these type

542
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,580
 of combinations.

543
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,280
 Because the questions that we don't have, the numbers that we don't have, if they could

544
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,080
 say he was going 130 miles an hour, what was his RPMs?

545
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,680
 What type of brakes were on the car?

546
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,680
 What was the model number of the seat covers?

547
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,360
 How many gallons of gas did he have in his car?

548
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,880
 If those numbers matched to make some Illuminati connection, they'd be in here.

549
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
 But they don't.

550
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 So there aren't.

551
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,280
 If there was 13 gallons of gas in the gas tank, we would have heard about it.

552
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,240
 If there was 4 gallons of gas, it doesn't fit the narrative, so the people who believe

553
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,440
 this leave it out.

554
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,880
 That's the key to all this stuff.

555
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,840
 That's the key to any of these numerology codes when you see connected to any sort of

556
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,440
 conspiracy theories.

557
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,040
 They take the cherry pick.

558
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,120
 They cherry pick.

559
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,800
 So, but Frans has one more card up his sleeve.

560
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 His long sleeve shirt.

561
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,160
 He has one more card.

562
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,320
 He pulls it out.

563
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,640
 He says, "Oh, no, no.

564
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,480
 See all the information I've already told you is the information that has been spread

565
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,640
 all over the internet, hasn't been disputed by anyone but you.

566
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,320
 You think you're so smart, but here's the key.

567
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,120
 You say the dates are cherry picked.

568
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,920
 You say why would they want to do this?

569
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,400
 Why would George W. Bush care about Ryan Dunn but ah?

570
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,040
 He was killed at the beginning of the summer solstice, you see.

571
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:08,600
 June 21st is one of the Illuminati's highest human sacrifice nights.

572
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,160
 That is why they killed him.

573
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:16,600
 They killed him for the Illuminati on one of their great holidays called Litha.

574
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,360
 June 21st, the start of the summer solstice.

575
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,680
 It wasn't random at all.

576
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,200
 Frans says and then goes, "Huzzah!"

577
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,240
 And that's when you remember that when he was running the numbers and the numerology

578
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,680
 and all that stuff and actually listed the date of Ryan Dunn's death, it was June 20th,

579
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,440
 just when he died.

580
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,800
 The day before this supposed Illuminati human sacrifice night.

581
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,080
 Frans, Frans, please leave.

582
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,160
 Actually, no Frans, I want you to stick around.

583
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,320
 I want you to stick around for a second because despite all the nonsense you said, we have

584
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,440
 learned one thing about the conspiracy iceberg.

585
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,240
 It isn't the word soup we thought it was.

586
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,120
 A lot of times when we first started looking at the conspiracy iceberg, we thought it was

587
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,000
 just random words put together.

588
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,320
 And it turns out that a lot of them do have some basis in, they have an origin story.

589
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,360
 So what is Bam Margeras afterlife?

590
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,560
 I found it.

591
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
 I found it.

592
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,560
 And it's very mundane, but it is what that phrase means.

593
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,520
 No blood rituals, no made up Illuminati stuff.

594
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:30,160
 He's just a real young man dealing with the loss of another young man and in the end finding

595
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,560
 some sort of peace in it.

596
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,920
 I'm going to have all the links here below in the show notes.

597
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:42,320
 On March 30th, 2015, so far predating the first conspiracy iceberg, on Bam Margeras

598
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,840
 Facebook page.

599
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,240
 He posted a Facebook post entitled, "This guy saw the afterlife while he was in a coma."

600
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,800
 What?

601
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
 And the link is gone.

602
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:00,040
 It was to link to something called TV.BamMajara.com, the actual link in the Facebook page is gone.

603
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,240
 But he did leave a description above.

604
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,640
 He said, "This neurosurgeon's whole life changed in a week flat, unreal."

605
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,160
 And using that limited amount of information, I was able to find what I believe the article

606
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
 he was talking about.

607
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,720
 It's from October 24th, 2012.

608
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,320
 And it is the typical story, and I don't mean to dismiss it in that, but it's a typical

609
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,680
 story of a man who did go into a coma, a neurosurgeon specifically, who went into a coma.

610
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,600
 He had E. coli and he went into a week long coma and his brain wasn't functioning.

611
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,960
 And they're like, "Listen, if he comes out of this he's going to be brain damaged, but

612
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,520
 he may not come out of it."

613
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,680
 And in that time he believes that he went to heaven.

614
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,600
 Let's take a quick look at his description here.

615
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,840
 My first memories from when I was deep inside, I had no language, all my earthly memories

616
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
 were gone.

617
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,680
 I had no body awareness at all.

618
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:56,360
 I was just a speck of awareness in kind of a dark, murky environment, in roots or vessels

619
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,120
 or something.

620
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,800
 And I seemed to be there for a very long time, I would say years.

621
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,960
 I was rescued by this beautiful spinning white light that had a melody, an incredibly beautiful

622
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,640
 melody with it that opened up into a bright valley, an extremely verdant valley with blossoming

623
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:20,160
 flowers and just an incredible, rich, ultra real world of indescribable complexity.

624
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,880
 Then, okay, so you're like, "Oh, that's very peaceful."

625
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
 Then it gets a little weird.

626
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,960
 A woman and him climb on the back of a butterfly and fly across space and time.

627
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,400
 So I mean, you know, which is fine, it's a beautiful image, but what if you hate butterflies?

628
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,480
 And then he's talking about this girl, this woman kind of looked at him.

629
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,880
 She looked at me, and this is a quote here.

630
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,280
 She looked at me, and this was with no words.

631
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,080
 But the concepts came straight into mind.

632
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,240
 You are loved, you are cherished, there's nothing you have to fear, there's nothing you

633
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
 can do wrong.

634
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,360
 It's just this peaceful, and then it comes back to life, obviously, to tell us all this

635
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
 story.

636
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,920
 And then you have the little twilight zone plot twist, though.

637
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,200
 I gotta throw this in, even though I think it totally makes the story ten times more

638
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
 unbelievable.

639
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,400
 So he comes back to life, and the neurosurgeon is at some point in time showing a photo of

640
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:22,400
 a sister that he had never met or seen before, and the girl in the photograph was the girl

641
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
 in heaven.

642
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:29,160
 Okay, I mean, I guess it's possible if you're flying on the back of a butterfly wing.

643
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,880
 I'm not trying to poo-poo on this guy's story, but that makes it a little...

644
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
 That made me roll my eyes.

645
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,440
 Like, the rest of it, I was like, "Oh, he was experiencing something peaceful."

646
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,720
 I think that's where Bam Margera Afterlife came from.

647
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,200
 The conspiracy theory is this.

648
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,240
 It's not even a conspiracy theory, it's just kind of a sad story, really, when you step

649
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
 back from it.

650
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,480
 A young man lost his best friend and was not dealing with it very well.

651
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,280
 Bam Margera's self-destructive tendencies are well-documented, and this made things

652
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
 worse.

653
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:04,480
 But sometimes when we lose somebody, finding a story like this about this neurosurgeon,

654
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,080
 or finding a story about somebody that is not like a religious fanatic, but just a "normal

655
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,400
 person" having this spiritual experience can bring peace to you.

656
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,280
 To prep this episode, I tried to see what Bam Margera's religion was.

657
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,120
 I couldn't really pull anything up.

658
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,720
 But imagine that...

659
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,200
 Imagine you're agnostic, or you're just kind of like, "Yeah, I kind of believe in God, but

660
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
 I don't really."

661
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,880
 And then something absolutely tragic happens, and you think, "Oh my God, what happened to

662
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,160
 my best friend?"

663
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,200
 And then you find someone who's also like, "Hey, listen, I'm not a religious person,

664
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,320
 but I died for a week, and it's absolutely beautiful on the other side."

665
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,400
 And that would give you a sense of peace.

666
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,280
 That would give you a sense of hope.

667
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,960
 That your friend just didn't end, but became part of something bigger.

668
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,640
 So I think that is what that refers to.

669
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,720
 Not the Illuminati Nonsense.

670
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,760
 Not all conspiracy theories are about fear.

671
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,360
 Sometimes they're about hope.

672
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,640
 And those are kind of the jewels that you find looking at conspiracy theories.

673
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,160
 A lot of them are very dark, and they deal with death and intrigue.

674
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,120
 But every show often you'll come across one like The Tree of Souls, or The Book of Soyga,

675
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,920
 or two episodes I did where it's very hopeful conspiracy theories.

676
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,520
 They're not about endings, but new beginnings.

677
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,960
 And I thought this was a good segment to end on as we come up to the end of 2018.

678
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,800
