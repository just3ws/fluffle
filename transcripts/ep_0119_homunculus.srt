1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 A deadly event in...let me double check where it's at.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,280
 Let me check my notes here real quick.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,120
 A fun filled event in Pakistan that is also known for its grisly deaths.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:24,320
 We look at a book that predicted the tragedy of the Titanic and then we discuss homonculus

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,320
 recipes.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,600
 Yes, I pronounced that right.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,240
 I know you're shocked.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:38,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,200
 I hope you're having a great day too.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,920
 Actually, I wasn't going to record tonight.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,000
 They'll sleep in my chair and I thought, "Yeah."

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,920
 But then I was like, "You know what?"

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,360
 I actually have about 400, 500 listeners who listen to the show day of or the next day.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,320
 And then the episode downloads on both YouTube and the podcast go up over time.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
 And I was like, "You know what?

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,400
 I got that sizable amount of people between YouTube and the podcast that expect an episode

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,760
 on schedule."

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,720
 So I fell asleep in my chair and then I woke up and I was like, "Okay, I'm going to take

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
 a shower.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
 I'm really tired.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
 I'm going to take a shower and wake up."

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,800
 And I'm going to record this episode.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,840
 For you guys.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
 So we did it.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
 We made it through Hell Week, the first week of doing the three jobs.

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
 And it worked.

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,480
 We got an episode out every day, which is good.

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,400
 That's very good for the show.

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,000
 I think I'm going to start recording earlier in the day.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,640
 I might even record extra episodes on the weekends, so kind of make the recording schedule

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,280
 a little smaller.

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
 But we'll see.

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,720
 Because I really like the process of recording and editing and things like that.

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,760
 Just when I get started late, it's like eight o'clock at night, I know I'm going to be

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,200
 up until at least 11 by the time I start uploading these to YouTube.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,800
 Anyways, so that's all extra stuff.

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,960
 You guys don't care about that.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
 Maybe you do.

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,960
 But let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,000
 So our first story is part of our new news stories from the year 2004.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,840
 Now this particular story, I wasn't able to find the original article, but I wasn't

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,300
 shocked to learn that it's still going on today.

46
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,240
 Because when I read the article in 2004, I was like, "That's ridiculous.

47
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,400
 Why would they have such a horrible event annually?"

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,800
 And when I started looking for the original article, I found an article from 2015, 11

49
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,040
 years later, documented the exact same incidents.

50
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
 It is...

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,080
 In 2015, there's this thing called the Spring...

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,360
 No, every year, every year, it's an annual thing.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,480
 But this happened in 2015.

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,120
 There's a Spring Festival in Pakistan.

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,360
 And everyone comes out.

56
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,200
 It's like everyone kind of like, I guess, leaves their house or something, and they

57
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,680
 go to like one big field.

58
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
 I guess there's like one giant field in Pakistan.

59
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,600
 And it's a kite festival.

60
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,240
 So everyone's like, "Yeah, I got my kite."

61
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,000
 You know, thousands, tens of thousands of...

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,320
 I don't know the exact amount, but let's say thousands of kites.

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,800
 They would have to be for the casualties that are about to come.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,560
 Thousands of kites lining the sky.

65
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,040
 And you're thinking, "How does a festival of kites lead to a bunch of people getting

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
 killed?"

67
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,880
 Well, in this particular event, they actually...

68
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,360
 So the year before, they said, "No more kites.

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
 No more kites.

70
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,640
 You can't bring your kite to the Spring Festival anymore.

71
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
 So many people are getting killed and injured."

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,000
 And they had just lifted the ban.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,560
 They said, "Okay, this year you can bring your kites back."

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,600
 And you're like, "Jason, just get to the kites killing people.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,960
 Just get to the kites killing people."

76
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,640
 But let me lay this down.

77
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,040
 So just this year, just in 2015, they said, "Okay, we'll lift the ban.

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,760
 You can bring your kites back."

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,240
 In 2015, 11 people killed.

80
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,320
 Over 100 injured.

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,560
 And you're like, "Why are these kites like eating people?"

82
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,520
 Well, some of them were killed and got injured because of people shooting into the air.

83
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,760
 And you're thinking, "Okay, that's fine."

84
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
 You know, people are like, "Yeah, it's Spring.

85
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,760
 Oh yeah, this is so awesome.

86
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
 Only happened once a year."

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,160
 I don't know why they even have a Spring Festival, but shooting guns in the air.

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,920
 But what they, the problem is, is that part of their kite festival, and this is pretty

89
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,320
 rad honestly, but part of their kite festival is they have kite duels.

90
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,600
 So we have a rivalry all year long.

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,760
 And I'm like, "You know what, dude?

92
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,520
 Oh, I can't wait until the Spring Festival.

93
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,880
 Only three more seasons than me, you, and our kites."

94
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,360
 And what they do is they build kites and they have kite battles.

95
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,680
 So they take kites and they build spikes on them and they crash them into their rivals'

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,200
 kites and destroy their kite.

97
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,480
 But that's not the only thing they do.

98
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,920
 The other thing they do is they, oh, and I think a couple of people got pierced by the

99
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,320
 spikes on the kites, but the big problem they had was they would take the kite string.

100
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,480
 Someone at one point during this weapon war, during this arms race of the kites, decided,

101
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,080
 "Oh, you know what would be great?

102
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:13,800
 If I took my kite string, coated it in glue and then rolled it around in broken glass."

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,440
 So their kite string, their kite's like, "Meow."

104
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,240
 It's making, you know, the noises Snoopy's doghouse makes when it flies around, just

105
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,520
 really like, "Meow."

106
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,040
 And the string would hit the other guy's kite string and cut it in half.

107
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,880
 And you'd be like, "Oh, no, my kite string and his kite would fly away."

108
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,560
 And then the arms race evolved to some people would take, like I said, the glue, just put

109
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,760
 glue and broken glass on their kite strings.

110
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,000
 But the more industrious ones would say, "Oh, I'm actually, I'm going to make my kite string

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 bulletproof.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,680
 So I'm going to use metal wire for my kite string, thin metal wire."

113
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,160
 Now you can start to see how this kite festival can become quite deadly.

114
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,160
 Because you have kids running around, you have people just sitting there at their picnic,

115
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,200
 enjoying eating apples or whatever, just having a good old time.

116
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,120
 And a metal kite string wraps around their neck.

117
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,440
 And the kite is like just getting like tons of like air flow, whatever the thing is that

118
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
 lift.

119
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
 And you're like, "Ahh!"

120
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
 And your family's watching.

121
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,200
 And you're like slowly being suffocated.

122
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,240
 People have just gotten their throat slashed by these super sharp wires.

123
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,440
 People have been electrocuted because they're flying their kites.

124
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,240
 And they, I mean, because again, you have this huge mass of people and the people who

125
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,760
 show up late, they're like, "Oh man, I don't have anywhere to fly my kite."

126
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,480
 But except by these power lines, they get electrocuted.

127
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,440
 People were falling off buildings trying to get their kites that had crashed.

128
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
 11 dead, 100 wounded.

129
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,920
 The article that I read back in 2004, because I had remembered it when I saw the headline,

130
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,920
 was that a young girl bled out because a kite string coated in glass wrapped around

131
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,160
 her neck and sliced her throat open.

132
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,200
 Because the thrust of the lift, I don't even know the technical terms, but the like

133
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,120
 lift of the kite just tightened the string enough that it just cut her throat open.

134
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,680
 And I was like, "Ugh!"

135
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,200
 And so they're still doing it.

136
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
 And now they have a band again.

137
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,000
 They'll probably be lifted in a while, but it's just such a bizarre, I mean, I get that

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,040
 there's like weird festivals and traditions around the world, but most of them don't involve

139
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,280
 groting, nor just people who are like eating a picnic.

140
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,920
 Not eating a picnic, but having a picnic.

141
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,480
 You know, there'll be guys, some people are having a picnic and another guy eats their

142
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
 picnic.

143
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
 I don't know that.

144
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,600
 Okay, okay, we're done with that.

145
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
 We're done with that story.

146
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:40,840
 The next one we're going to look at is the story of the man who predicted, in a way,

147
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
 the sinking of the Titanic.

148
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
 And you may go, "Ah, Jason, I've heard this story before."

149
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
 And maybe you have.

150
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,440
 I'd actually heard it a couple times.

151
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,680
 But anyway, so this is the story of the man who predicted the Titanic.

152
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,040
 And there's a lot, you know, the thing is, is like conspiracy theories a lot of times

153
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,160
 hinge on coincidences.

154
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,680
 And like my good friend, Garrick, said, "I believe in coincidences.

155
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,120
 Coincidences happen all the time, but I don't trust coincidences."

156
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,080
 Now, when you put out so much media as we have as a world, you're going to get stuff

157
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,320
 that eventually does line up to real life events.

158
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
 And it's weird.

159
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,080
 Sometimes there's so many coincidences, you really have to like step back and go, "That's

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
 eerie."

161
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,480
 To be fair, when I read about this guy, they said he also predicted the Pearl Harbor attack.

162
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,640
 And I was like, "What?"

163
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,960
 And I was like, "That's like two for two."

164
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,000
 And I looked it up and he just predicted that the Imperial Japanese Air Force would attack

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,560
 the US Navy.

166
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,000
 And I'm like, "Oh, that's kind of just, that's not really Pearl Harbor."

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,200
 And it was like out in the middle of the ocean.

168
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,360
 So he's not two for two.

169
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,160
 But anyway, so Morgan Robertson was the author and he wrote a book called The Wreck of the

170
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,040
 Titan or Fertility, Fertility, Fertility, The Wreck of the Titan.

171
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,000
 Anyways, that was the name of the book.

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,960
 And he wrote in 1898 and this is the plot of the book.

173
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,600
 The plot of the book is worthy enough to talk about.

174
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
 I think it's pretty funny.

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,240
 There's, the plot is there's a disgraced naval officer named John Rowland.

176
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,960
 And he gets, I don't know why he was disgraced.

177
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,760
 Maybe he was, I don't know, stealing sea water.

178
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,160
 But anyway, so he gets a job, like a low down dirty job on the Titan.

179
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
 He's like, "Oh, this sucks."

180
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,920
 But he has to like make money.

181
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
 So he's like, "Oh, this sucks.

182
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,760
 I'm just shoveling coal into this engine."

183
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,560
 The Titan in the book hits an iceberg.

184
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,160
 So what happens is the boat, it's a thriller.

185
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,480
 The boat hits the iceberg and it's starting to sink.

186
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,840
 And John Rowland is trying to make his way off of the ship.

187
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,760
 And he comes across the daughter of his ex.

188
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,480
 I don't know where the ex is at.

189
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,000
 I was just reading the plot.

190
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,600
 But anyways, he finds the daughter of his ex and he's like, "Oh, I have to save you.

191
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,640
 Maybe that'll, maybe it'll get me out of the friend zone."

192
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,080
 So he like saves the girl.

193
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,160
 He saves the kid by jumping onto the iceberg.

194
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,480
 So the boat hit the iceberg and he jumps onto the iceberg with the kid.

195
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
 A polar bear shows up.

196
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,720
 He fights the polar bear.

197
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,200
 I mean, come on, dude.

198
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
 That should have been in the movie.

199
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,640
 Instead of Jack just floating to the bottom of the earth.

200
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,800
 They should have had a polar bear fight scene.

201
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,960
 John Rowland fights the polar bear.

202
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,960
 Then after having saving this kid, he gives it back to his ex and goes here.

203
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,200
 I've saved her.

204
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,400
 And the ex has him arrested for kidnapping.

205
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,960
 Even though he was kidnapped, he was kidnapped and he was off of a sinking boat.

206
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,960
 Eventually he's found innocent and because then it becomes a court drama.

207
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,000
 The trial is not taking place on the iceberg.

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,080
 They're like, "Is there a judge on here?"

209
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,000
 Anyways, so they all get saved.

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,720
 He goes to court for kidnapping.

211
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,000
 He's found innocent and the ex is castigated for being lame.

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,920
 Like, "You shouldn't have done this."

213
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,160
 They're like, "Listen, dude, you're lame."

214
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,600
 This guy obviously was simply trying to save her.

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,560
 He wasn't doing anything wrong.

216
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,920
 And John, then the happy ending, he becomes homeless.

217
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,360
 He slowly works his way up and he gets a good government job.

218
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,240
 So basically he's kind of just like a cog and a machine at the end, but that's happier

219
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,480
 than where he was at.

220
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,720
 This is actually the end of the book.

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,560
 Spoiler alert for a hundred year old book.

222
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,800
 This is the last part.

223
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,680
 So it says he finally gets a civil service exam, and this is the quote, "to a lucrative

224
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,160
 position under the government, and as he seated himself at his desk in his office, could

225
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:31,200
 have been heard to remark, 'Now John Rowland, your future is your own.'

226
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,560
 You have merely suffered in the past from a mistaken estimate of the importance of women

227
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
 and whiskey."

228
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
 What?

229
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,760
 So basically it was the migthal version of the Titanic.

230
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,600
 But this book came out 14 years before the Titanic sank.

231
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,800
 It actually was written before they even started building the Titanic.

232
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,560
 So you're like, "Okay, Jason Iceberg, Boat hits Iceberg, the name's similar."

233
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
 They both sank in April in the Atlantic.

234
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,840
 They both came from England.

235
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,800
 The Titan was 800 feet long.

236
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,720
 Titanic was 182 feet long.

237
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,440
 Both had similar tonnage.

238
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,600
 Both called unsinkable.

239
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,760
 Both had a shortage of lifeboats.

240
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,000
 Both hit Icebergs.

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,160
 Both on star sites.

242
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,240
 Both 400 nautical miles from Newfoundland.

243
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,280
 What's interesting was that, so he wrote the book and it was a pretty good seller.

244
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,920
 People had read it, and then people still were like, "Hey man, remember that book you

245
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
 read?

246
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
 That was awesome.

247
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
 Hey, you want to go on this boat called the Titanic?"

248
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
 Oh yeah, totally.

249
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,400
 Where is it leaving from?

250
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
 England?

251
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
 Oh cool.

252
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
 How big is it?

253
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 So on and so forth.

254
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,640
 For years, Pester the author about being a clairvoyant.

255
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:47,120
 And he goes, "Listen, everything that I came up with was because I know nautical stuff.

256
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,040
 I know boats and I know how they move.

257
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,400
 I know how they go through, not go through the water, but I know what routes they'll

258
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,240
 take and things like that and the chances of them running to an iceberg in April and

259
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
 all this stuff."

260
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,400
 So he denies it.

261
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,560
 He denies that he's a clairvoyant.

262
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,400
 And that he's probably right.

263
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:10,640
 It is, even given all of the saying, you know, I know a lot of stuff about nautical stuff,

264
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,440
 it is still weird about things like the name and the idea of it being built as an unsinkable

265
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
 ship.

266
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
 I don't know.

267
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,880
 It's just the shortest of lifeboats.

268
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
 It's a lot of stuff.

269
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,960
 Now obviously, no one jumped off on the iceberg.

270
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,320
 Actually, I wonder why nobody jumped off on the iceberg.

271
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,360
 Probably because they saw too many polar bears over there, but that probably would have been

272
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
 fine.

273
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,120
 I guess you probably can't hold onto an iceberg or you just freeze quicker because it's ice

274
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
 ice.

275
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,000
 I wonder if the iceberg got damaged.

276
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,080
 Dude, I wonder if the iceberg is still out there.

277
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,720
 That sunk Titanic because it must have been a big iceberg, right?

278
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 Just floating around.

279
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
 They don't...

280
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
 Icebergs break off of stuff and then just float around, right?

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,040
 I wonder how long icebergs live.

282
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,400
 Okay, so our next story is an interesting one.

283
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,120
 It is on the conspiracy iceberg, which you know what?

284
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,320
 We don't see much conspiracy iceberg around anymore.

285
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,640
 Not just on this podcast, but in...

286
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,320
 We do it once a week on this podcast, but on 4chan they'd always discuss the conspiracy

287
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 iceberg.

288
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
 It's kind of died out.

289
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,640
 I guess that meme's over there.

290
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
 But homunculus.

291
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,240
 Trust me, I'm pronouncing that right.

292
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,880
 It's not homunculus.

293
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
 Hom...

294
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
 Homunculus.

295
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
 I don't know.

296
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
 Maybe I'm pronouncing it wrong.

297
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
 But anyways, homunculus.

298
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
 What homunculus is?

299
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,180
 It's a tiny human.

300
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,120
 It's a human that's a little, little dude.

301
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,800
 He's like the size of the palm of your hand.

302
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,840
 So let's measure him in centimeters.

303
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:37,120
 Let's say he's probably like, if I'm 136 centimeters tall, he would be like 13 centimeters tall.

304
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,360
 So he's a tiny little guy.

305
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,760
 And they're not made by normal reproductive practices.

306
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,920
 I.e. you don't bang a woman in a homunculus comes out.

307
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,120
 It's a really old belief.

308
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,640
 We actually have references to homunculi type creatures going back as far as 3a.d.

309
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,920
 But the earliest mention of the word is from the 1500s.

310
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,280
 So this is a longstanding tradition.

311
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
 Tiny little guy.

312
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
 A little tiny guy.

313
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,320
 Now, it was a big thing in the alchemist circles.

314
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,380
 They're like, now, when I say, let's get down to brass tacks here.

315
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,680
 The goal is to make a tiny person out of, without banging a woman.

316
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
 And they have special powers.

317
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,760
 And we'll get into that in a second.

318
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,160
 But really, I think these alchemists just really wanted to have a reason to masturbate

319
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
 all day long.

320
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,080
 You'd think that was most likely the scenario.

321
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,480
 They're like, Sir Edmund, Sir Edmund, what are you doing?

322
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
 He's standing in the corner.

323
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
 He keeps moving his beard out of the way.

324
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,680
 And they're like, what are you doing?

325
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,640
 He's like, I'm working on a spell.

326
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,880
 What type of spell?

327
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
 Tiny human.

328
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 They're like, oh, OK.

329
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,400
 And he's like, leave me alone.

330
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
 Leave me alone.

331
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
 Leave those wood carvings.

332
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,880
 Leave those sexy wood carvings.

333
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
 And I'll be out in a bit.

334
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,320
 That's mostly, I mean, let's be honest.

335
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,080
 But anyway, so they thought back then, back in the olden times, that you didn't need an

336
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,120
 egg, like a little woman egg, you know, the little tiny egg that comes out of a woman.

337
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,880
 They didn't think you needed that to reproduce.

338
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
 You just needed this.

339
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,800
 The semen was where all the life was.

340
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,480
 You just needed a warm place for it to grow.

341
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,960
 You just needed to give it some food and some like just like a little bed.

342
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,760
 And it would turn into a tiny human.

343
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,200
 You know, so they came up with all sorts of crazy schemes.

344
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,040
 The question is, is will any do any of these work?

345
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,160
 And we'll get to that in a second, because that's an actually interesting question.

346
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,560
 So first off, you could take a homunculi and they had special powers.

347
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,400
 These are their special powers they have listed, other than being a tiny human that didn't

348
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
 require a mother, which is pretty special.

349
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,760
 They have the ability to control the motion and appearance of the moon.

350
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
 What?

351
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
 Who?

352
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,680
 Okay, first off, that's not a good power to have.

353
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,720
 People are like, "Ah, like giant tidal waves are coming after them."

354
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,520
 They're like, "Look at moons closer.

355
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,440
 The gravity pull is getting all messed up.

356
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,560
 Cows don't know where to jump."

357
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,760
 Like it's, that's not a good power to have.

358
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,760
 That's so overpowered for a tiny person to have.

359
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,200
 They've given them the ability to send the moon far away into the solar system.

360
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:18,040
 They also, speaking of cows, to allow humans to transform themselves into sheeps and cows.

361
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,480
 Why would any human ever want to transform into a sheep or a cow?

362
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,520
 The two most easily killable animals on the planet, next to a caterpillar.

363
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,840
 Why at what point in your life as an alchemist do you go, "You know what I've always wanted

364
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
 to do?

365
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
 I've wanted to be delicious meat.

366
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,440
 I've wanted to be something that is known to be eaten or melt."

367
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,440
 Okay, there's probably some perverts out there who would be into that.

368
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,280
 But for the most part, I think most of humanity wouldn't say, wouldn't take, what do you want

369
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,400
 to be, a were-cow?

370
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,880
 It doesn't work that way.

371
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,040
 These powers are dumb, which makes me think that these things might be real.

372
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,360
 Because if you were making it up, you'd be like, "Oh, you turned into this big badass

373
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,680
 wolf with like a metal chain collar and there's like old-timey heavy metal music."

374
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,840
 Like, you know, like with leers, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down,
