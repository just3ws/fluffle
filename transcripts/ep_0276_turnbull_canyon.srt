1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
 A Russian super weapon backfires, a bizarre vandal strikes a small town in Virginia, and

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,640
 then we take a look at the story of Turnbull Canyon, a winding little piece of road in

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,800
 California, but it is no one to hold Satan worshippers and drifters who kill without

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,200
 warning today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:34,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,520
 Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,360
 We got a lot of stuff to get through today, so we're just gonna get started.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,600
 We're gonna go with this, the first two stories are actually incredibly recent, so I wanted

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,240
 to kind of put them in one episode because they're really kind of going on right now.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,160
 But let's start off on our journey of the weird in Russia.

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,240
 We're headed to Russia, Mother Russia, the icy continent.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,040
 I have nothing else to describe Russia.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,480
 Anyways they have funny looking buildings.

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,520
 We go to Russia, it's all hop on board, we're just gonna walk there, it takes us a long

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
 time but we get to Russia.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,960
 And the date is August 8th, 2019, so last week, really unless you're listening to this

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,960
 episode in the future, people are hanging out in town, this little Russian town called

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:25,680
 Severodosvinsk, Severovinsk, Severovinsk, anyways it's a town in Russia, people are

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
 hanging out in this town.

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,600
 And they start to get news filtering to the town saying, "Hey, hey, they're walking down

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
 the street."

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,280
 Guys are like, "Oh, I don't feel so good, I wonder, I don't feel so good."

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,720
 My clothes are starting to get a little tight, what's going on here?

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,800
 Someone runs out of the house and it's like, "Everyone, everyone run to the store and

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,080
 take your iodine pills or buy them first and then take your iodine pills."

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
 And we're like, "Why?"

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,280
 Their skin starts to turn green because radiation had spiked in the town, everyone's starting

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,320
 to mutate, people are elevitating cars, one of them can suck the power from other people.

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
 So for 40 minutes, the radiation spiked in this town.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,000
 Now Russia, the government is not seeing anything, they're just like, "So people are freaking

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,680
 out, why is the radiation level going up in this town?"

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,880
 But after 40 minutes they started to go down and everyone, their mutations disappeared and

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,440
 one guy was in mid-flight and he's like, "Ah, it dies."

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,320
 Now, so what we think has happened, because again the Russian government really isn't

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,440
 giving a lot of details on what's going on, what we know and we being the rest of the

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,880
 world, you may know more if you live in Russia, or a member of the Russian parliament, is

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:41,640
 that there was a giant oil rig type platform out in the Arctic Sea.

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,800
 So it was by that town, it was by that town, right?

39
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,360
 And they were testing or building some sort of new weapon and it exploded and it killed

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,480
 five scientists.

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,480
 Now these scientists have been named and they are now considered heroes of the Russian

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,840
 government, which I mean in the pursuit of science they died, they gave their lives.

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,160
 But these were like the best of the best, these were some of Russia's best scientists on

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,360
 this platform working on this and we don't know what they were working on.

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,120
 But because of the radiation spike and because of the area it was in and just general intelligence,

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,520
 this is what they believed they were building, this is nuts.

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,480
 They call it the 9M730 beer vestnik.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,080
 It is known as a vengeance weapon.

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,600
 I was reading an article about it and one of the people said the only reason why you

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,120
 would ever use this weapon, the quote was, "It's impractical for anything short of an

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
 all out nuclear war."

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,320
 It's a missile, not just a nuclear missile, but the fuel is nuclear.

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,480
 So it has unlimited range.

54
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,240
 It has a nuclear fuel source.

55
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,400
 It's not using jet fuel or anything like that, rocket fuel I guess is what it would be.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
 It's not using any sort of traditional propulsion, it's powered by nuclear power.

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,920
 This weapon is supposedly designed to be used after all other nukes have dropped.

58
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,600
 This is basically like an FU to whatever country they're attacking, most likely America or

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 China.

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,760
 And it's impractical other than an all out nuclear war because the engine itself is basically

61
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,280
 a dirty bomb.

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,400
 So you wouldn't use it as like a tactical strike.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,080
 This weapon was built for the last stages of a nuclear war, a doomsday weapon, an apocalyptic

64
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,520
 weapon.

65
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,080
 That's what we believe blew up.

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,640
 There's another suspicion, I thought this was crazy too, there was another suspicion

67
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,360
 that what blew up was they were building a missile, a top secret missile that could fly

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,160
 eight times the speed of sound.

69
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,160
 And just for comparison, that's as fast as Iron Man flies in the comic books.

70
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,360
 That is how fast a fictional superhero flies.

71
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,200
 His top speed is like 8.8 times the speed of sound.

72
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,720
 They were building a missile that can go, we'll say almost as fast as a cartoon hero.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,600
 That's the level of weaponry that's being built out there.

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
 Because you can't stop it.

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,120
 There's no anti-missile system that can stop something that's hypersonic.

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,360
 Just doesn't exist.

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,360
 But yeah, coming soon to a neighborhood near you.

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,640
 You know, in Hood River here where I live, we have Hanford nuclear power waste dump.

79
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,320
 It used to be a nuclear power plant, I don't know, 40-50 miles down the river.

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,400
 It's a total mess over there and they've tried cleaning it up but they don't know what to

81
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
 do with it.

82
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,440
 That is actually a third phase target for the Soviet Union, Russia now.

83
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,920
 The first strike you want to take out military infrastructure and heads of state, chain of

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
 command, stuff like that.

85
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,960
 The second strike was big cities.

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,040
 So the first strike was basically, let's see what we can do to their military might.

87
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,360
 But if we're still lobbing missiles at them, they're like, okay, now let's target the civilian

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
 population, let's start taking out major cities, financial centers and stuff like that, because

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,040
 now we want to bring them to heel.

90
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,600
 But then they have what's called third phase, which is basically like that one, just the

91
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,760
 effet, let's just do as much damage as we can to our enemy.

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,520
 And Hanford, or Hanford, however you pronounce it, is a third phase strike.

93
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,680
 Basically if a nuclear missile detonated there, it would radiate the Pacific Northwest.

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,160
 It would basically turn miles and miles of soil into a giant dirty bomb.

95
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,120
 You turn Pacific Northwest itself into a dirty bomb.

96
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,120
 I welcome the new mutant powers I will get during the nuclear war.

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,560
 I'm not afraid, but I'm hoping I get a cool mutation like healing.

98
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,000
 I guess I would need that, because I'd be dying of radiation poisoning all the time.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,120
 Telepathy I think would get boring, but I want super strength.

100
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,120
 Flying doesn't make sense unless you're invulnerable, because otherwise you're going to be hitting

101
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
 birds all the time.

102
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
 People just shoot you out of the sky.

103
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,640
 You need to have one of the big ones.

104
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,280
 A lot of people go, "I wish I was invisible."

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
 No, lame.

106
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,240
 Telepathy is kind of lame because people I don't think are thinking about you that much.

107
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,480
 You'd be talking to a girl and she'd be thinking about someone else.

108
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
 You'd be like, "Oh, this sucks.

109
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,160
 I thought I was going to be reading all these sexy, sexy thoughts."

110
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,360
 Super strength, super strength, invulnerability, regeneration, teleportation.

111
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,800
 Nah, teleportation would suck.

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,920
 I'd get stuck in something.

113
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,040
 Okay, but let's go ahead.

114
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,200
 I welcome my mutant powers though.

115
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,440
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

116
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,520
 Our next story is super, super short, super, super mysterious.

117
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,600
 Happened August 11th, 2019.

118
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,200
 So just a couple of days ago.

119
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,360
 We're in Henrico.

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,080
 Let's all use our mutant powers to fly now to Henrico County, Virginia.

121
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,720
 Stop, evil doers.

122
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,280
 It's totally peaceful suburb.

123
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,240
 Actually, no, there is an evil doer in this story.

124
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,240
 This is actually going to work.

125
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,360
 We're flying around.

126
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,160
 You're like, "Hey, Jason, look."

127
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,640
 And you're like my kid's sidekick.

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,800
 I'm like, "What is it?

129
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
 Youngling?"

130
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,400
 It's a mysterious man and we're like looking.

131
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,560
 We're hovering in the air looking at the student.

132
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,400
 And we see a man walking through the neighborhoods of little suburbs in Henrico County, Virginia.

133
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,880
 And he's carrying a big box and I'm like, "Ooh, could that possibly be a bomb?"

134
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,680
 And you're like, "Golly jinkies, I don't think so.

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,000
 That is a TV set."

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,920
 I'm like, "Oh, you are right."

137
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
 So we land.

138
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
 The gimmick's done.

139
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
 That gimmick was going nowhere.

140
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
 We land.

141
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,760
 We go back in our civilian clothes.

142
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,560
 Now we're hiding in the bushes like a bunch of weirdos.

143
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,560
 We're hiding in the bushes and we want like we normally do in our civilian clothes.

144
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,920
 And we're watching a man carry an old CRT television set up to a house and we look at each other.

145
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,840
 We're like, "Oh, this is weird."

146
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,320
 And he sets it down on the porch and turns and walks away.

147
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,840
 And that's when we notice his head is an old television set.

148
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,440
 Now this isn't creepypasta.

149
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,880
 This isn't rumor.

150
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,440
 There is videotape of this.

151
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,640
 You know, they have those little ring doorbell cameras.

152
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,160
 So when people walk up to your front door, it goes off and it records what's going on.

153
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,200
 They have footage of this guy walking through the town, walking up to a door, putting down

154
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
 an old CRT.

155
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,040
 And he's wearing like all blue, like blue work slacks like Dickies and then like a Dickies

156
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
 top.

157
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,560
 All the labels are covered up, which is smart.

158
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,440
 He's wearing a big CRT on his head, big old tube television set.

159
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,000
 Now he, in one night, this guy or men, we don't know, his face is covered up by a television

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
 set, dropped off 50 big giant television sets.

161
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,600
 Now some of them were only like 13 inches, but if you know those old TVs, if you grew

162
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,640
 up in that, those are still quite heavy, but some of them are bigger, some are like 27

163
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
 inches and stuff like that.

164
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,200
 But anyways, 50 television sets, a little over 50 television sets, appeared on front

165
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,560
 porches all over this small, sleepy little suburb in the course of one night.

166
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,800
 And it's funny because they called the cops out and there's video of the cops having

167
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,040
 to lug these television sets and they're throwing them in a big moving van.

168
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
 So I mean, that sucks.

169
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,760
 There's their Monday having to pick up all these things.

170
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,040
 But the police said, "Listen, this is probably a prank.

171
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,640
 We don't know what's going on, but it is illegal because it's illegal dumping."

172
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,600
 And the residents seem to be pretty amused by it.

173
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,800
 They're like, "It's kind of funny.

174
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,600
 Someone must have a lot of time in their hands and obviously a lot of television sets."

175
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,640
 But what's weird about it is that this happened in Henrico County.

176
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,280
 It happened in the same county, different little town, but in the same county last

177
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
 August.

178
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,400
 So the same month a year ago, someone dropped 20 television sets off, one at each different

179
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,720
 house.

180
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 They caught the guy.

181
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
 He wasn't on video.

182
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,680
 Now they have video of him wearing this television head.

183
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,280
 College prank, hazing ritual, TV repair guy trying to get rid of some product.

184
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,240
 Or what if that's not a mask?

185
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,120
 What if that CRT helmet is his real head and he's dropping off his babies at people's houses

186
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
 hoping someone will take care of them.

187
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,960
 But you see, then police take the babies and put them in their impound lot and then the

188
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
 babies hatch.

189
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,720
 And the next time you get pulled over by a cop, you're like, "Oh that's weird.

190
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
 Cop box up.

191
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
 It has television forehead."

192
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,880
 And they're just taking the government over from the inside.

193
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,720
 One police department at a time.

194
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,560
 Now obviously that's, I'm joking around, but that'd be pretty awesome.

195
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,240
 As long as the television head overlords don't bother me.

196
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
 I think it's a prank.

197
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,000
 I actually think it's quite a funny prank.

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,680
 But yeah, it is also illegal dumping.

199
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,120
 So if these guys get caught, they'll get a fine or something like that.

200
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,640
 It'll be interesting to see if they do it again next year.

201
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,840
 Maybe it'll become a tradition.

202
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,800
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

203
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,400
 Our next story is the story of Turnbull Canyon.

204
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,640
 Turnbull Canyon is a winding canyon, little winding country road.

205
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,440
 It's about a four mile loop.

206
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
 It's down in California.

207
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,560
 It's in Whittier, California.

208
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,240
 So weird USA, we've talked about them before.

209
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,960
 They're a mixed bag as far as their research goes.

210
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,360
 And this was their headline.

211
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
 This was their headline.

212
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,960
 "Saintness, Child Snatcher, and Drifters in Turnbull Canyon, Whittier."

213
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
 And I was like, "What?

214
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
 That sounds interesting.

215
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,040
 A little dubious of the source, but we got Satanists, we got babies getting kidnapped,

216
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,360
 which I'm not a fan of.

217
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,560
 I'm not a fan of that.

218
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,040
 But Drifters, you got like Drifters, like homeless people hiding in the bushes with sickles,

219
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
 cutting people up.

220
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,480
 Anyways, supposedly this place, this bushy little canyon, a little sage brush, let's

221
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,400
 walk along, let's take a walk along the canyon.

222
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,360
 It's super dusty, we're all dirty now.

223
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,120
 There's a tumbleweed rolling by, lizards on rocks, looking at us and stuff.

224
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,320
 Just walking, walking through the canyon, right?

225
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,880
 Keeping an eye out for them Drifters, keeping an eye out for Saint worshipers, hoping to

226
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,520
 rescue some babies.

227
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
 But we don't see any of them.

228
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,600
 But before we wrestle a Drifter, we have to talk about the history of this place.

229
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,520
 Supposedly it was known as, yes it's the episode where Jason can't pronounce anything, Hutt

230
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,960
 you Kunga, Hutt you Kunga.

231
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,400
 So the natives in the area called it that, and it means either the dark place or the

232
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,320
 place of the devil, depending on what translation you go with.

233
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,080
 And the natives in the area stayed away from it.

234
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,680
 That's part of the old legend.

235
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,280
 In 1845, the Spanish governor of Alta, California, which was the region there, gave it to two

236
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,280
 settlers and then the natives started raiding the property because they didn't want the

237
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
 settlers there.

238
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,640
 So right there, you should start setting off your skeptics alarm.

239
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,640
 If the legend is the natives stayed away from the area and then they started doing raids

240
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,480
 on the area and later started working on the area, that doesn't jive at all.

241
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,120
 I couldn't find any reference to the place actually being called that outside of these

242
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,440
 ghost stories.

243
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,640
 So a little skeptical right off the bat.

244
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,360
 But we got a lot of other good elements, right?

245
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,720
 The past may have been added and maybe put a little lipstick on it, but we'll keep going

246
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
 forward.

247
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
 And then down, turn bowl canyon.

248
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 Keeping an eye out.

249
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
 What's that?

250
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,640
 It's just a vulture flying by.

251
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,360
 And then you get a little suspicious because they start circling us.

252
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 I'm like, "Oh no, that's fine.

253
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
 They do that all the time.

254
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,720
 I see it all the time in cartoons."

255
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,760
 You're like, "This isn't a cartoon, bro."

256
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,000
 We're walking through the canyon, sun starting to set.

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,400
 You're no longer scared of the stories of the natives calling to the place of the devil.

258
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,360
 You think, "Yeah, it's probably pretty skeptical, right?"

259
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,320
 But let's get into some more recent events.

260
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,800
 So the sun completely sets.

261
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
 You're around.

262
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 Where'd that owl come from?

263
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
 I like it.

264
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,360
 So during the Depression, there was a rumor in the area.

265
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,120
 The Great Depression, I should say not just an A Depression.

266
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,680
 Some guys all sad and a rumor starts.

267
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,200
 During the Great Depression, people were having a hard time feeding their kids.

268
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
 This part's true.

269
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,600
 This happened all over America and probably other parts of the world.

270
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,760
 Probably happens today, unfortunately.

271
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,360
 But people had a hard time taking care of their kids, so they would sell them off to

272
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,920
 get money to feed themselves, which sounds a little cruel, but they're figuring out,

273
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,160
 "I'll sell it to a rich family, kid will be brought up."

274
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,040
 Well, I get to eat today and it's a win-win.

275
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,200
 But the rumor became a little more sinister because people said that in Turnbull Canyon,

276
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,960
 these wealthy families were buying babies, going around like poor people.

277
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,640
 Poor people around the street corner going, "Baby's, baby's."

278
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,200
 They have a wheelbarrow full of their kids and rich people are like, "Oh, awesome."

279
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,520
 And they would buy these babies and they said, "I will provide them a perfect home."

280
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,000
 Fingers across and the guys like, "Oh, awesome."

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Goes away.

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,200
 Guys buying a bunch of bread.

283
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,120
 And the rich people were really Saint worshipers and they were sacrificing the babies in the

284
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,620
 canyon.

285
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,840
 That was a rumor that was going around apparently back then.

286
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,520
 There is no verification of that.

287
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,560
 It's an easy rumor to start and for people to buy into because you did have people selling

288
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,560
 their kids.

289
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,640
 You never know what happened to those kids.

290
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,040
 So it basically mixes the fact it would basically demonize people who did sell their kids.

291
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,360
 It would go, "Hey, man, you don't know.

292
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
 You're just going to a nice house.

293
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
 You might be like, you know, getting sacrificed to the devil."

294
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,960
 And guys like, "Oh my God, why'd you tell me that?

295
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
 Now I'm super paranoid.

296
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,000
 I got these two more kids to sell.

297
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,800
 Now I don't want to, but I'm gonna because I need to eat."

298
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
 That was a rumor that was going around at the time.

299
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,840
 Again, there's no verification of that.

300
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,080
 We could never really prove that either way.

301
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,420
 But people in the area still talk about these things.

302
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:46,280
 Even today there are stories of satanic cults in this canyon doing these rituals.

303
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,600
 Now at this point we're walking through Turnbull Canyon.

304
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,720
 The large canyon walls are steep on both sides of us.

305
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,480
 There is no way out but to walk the four mile loop.

306
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,400
 And you're thinking, "Jason, why didn't you tell me about the more recent Saint-Warsher

307
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,720
 Wars before I started walking through here?"

308
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,120
 Now it is almost pitch black.

309
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,540
 The moon is just kind of peeking over one of the sheer faces of the canyon.

310
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,540
 Super spooky.

311
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,740
 Now, people are posting online about running into Saint-Warsher Purs and things like that.

312
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,060
 You had one guy tell a story that him and his buddies were driving through the canyon

313
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,420
 and they went on some off-road, right?

314
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,780
 And they get out of their car and they start walking.

315
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,060
 They're ghost hunters, right?

316
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,660
 And then they hear a bunch of hooded people walking behind them.

317
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,020
 I don't know how they could tell you.

318
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,940
 They sounded like they could hear the hoods shifting against their head.

319
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,520
 They ran and they jumped in the bushes and they saw all these people in black hoods start

320
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,280
 doing a chant right in front of them conveniently enough.

321
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,720
 And then cops showed up and everyone scattered and they hid in the bushes and then one more,

322
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
 they saw like black boots walk by the bush.

323
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,240
 They're like, "Ugh."

324
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,560
 And then the person left and they all ran back to their car.

325
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,720
 And there's no police reports verifying that.

326
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,080
 That's one person's story but that's a common story that goes on with Turnbull Canyon.

327
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,880
 People in the area go there for ghost hunting.

328
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,320
 It's fairly remote.

329
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
 It's not like in the middle of the boonies.

330
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,860
 You could get there but it's also not on the beaten path.

331
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,060
 It would be a good place to go to look for ghosts, to smoke weed, stuff like that.

332
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,180
 So people still talk about same worshipers there as well now today.

333
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,820
 Now there have been murders linked to the area.

334
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,380
 There was a young woman who was shot in the head and it took them a couple years to arrest

335
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,500
 the guy but that seemed to be drug related.

336
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,540
 It was two gang bangers who shot her and they set her body on fire or something like that.

337
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,940
 But you know, people just, you know how stories evolve in these areas.

338
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,560
 People stumble across the body that's burned up and be like, "Ah, same worshipers!"

339
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,240
 And then after years of police investigation they go, "Oh no, it's actually these two

340
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,360
 idiot gang bangers who shot her over like a drug dead or something like that."

341
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,280
 There was a plane crash in the canyon.

342
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,840
 I thought this one was fascinating.

343
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,720
 There was a plane crash in the canyon.

344
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,440
 In 1952, I read this and then I had to go find verification of it and I came across

345
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,760
 this guy who said he's done thousands of hours of research on Turnbull Canyon.

346
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,040
 This was his account.

347
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,140
 In 1952 this plane crash is 29 people were killed.

348
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,700
 21 of them were children.

349
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,140
 But see, when everyone saw the plane crash or they heard the plane crash because it was

350
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,060
 kind of far away, but when rescuers finally got to the area and they started digging the

351
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,220
 bodies out, everyone on the plane was killed.

352
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,260
 21 of them are children but the other eight were also killed as well.

353
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,220
 They're not invincible because they're not children.

354
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,940
 When they bought the bodies back to the corner, none of the bodies could be identified.

355
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,920
 They were all just basically bodies that no one had ever seen before.

356
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,140
 Not like just strangers, not like they're out of towners, but there was no record that

357
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,600
 these people ever existed.

358
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,920
 There was no record that the plane was ever registered, so it was just like a ghost airplane

359
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,720
 full of ghost people basically.

360
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,840
 And the rumor in the area was that the dark magic of the area actually pulled the plane

361
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,200
 out of the sky.

362
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,000
 The canyon itself wanted fresh blood.

363
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,360
 Maybe the plane came out of some sort of portal from an alternate dimension or from

364
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,960
 the future and it was pulled in via dark magic into the canyon and blow up.

365
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,400
 The only thing that is true about that statement is the plane crashed in 1952.

366
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
 At 29 people did die.

367
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,800
 There was almost no children, if any.

368
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,200
 It was mostly US servicemen.

369
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
 They were all identified because they were US servicemen.

370
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,720
 We have the names of everyone who died in that plane crash.

371
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,600
 We know who flew the plane.

372
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
 We know who chartered the plane.

373
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,640
 We know what airline company owned the plane.

374
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,720
 We know the airport the plane flew out of and where it was headed.

375
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
 And it didn't crash due to magic.

376
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,120
 It crashed because it was really foggy and the landing gear was down and the pilot didn't

377
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,280
 know it and it hit the rock.

378
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,720
 Now you could say, "Well, what if Satan made the landing gear come down and it was Satan's

379
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 fog machine?"

380
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,840
 Fine, I'll give you that.

381
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,640
 But thousands of hours of research, he needed a thousand hours and ten minutes of research.

382
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,320
 Because that's the problem with Turnbull Canyon is that it's really hard to separate the myth

383
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
 from the legend.

384
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,360
 I'm sure that stuff went down there.

385
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,760
 But when one of the stories is back in the 60s a bunch of dudes ran this is one of my

386
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,840
 favorite things.

387
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,240
 There used to be an insane asylum in this remote canyon in this desert road.

388
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,520
 There used to be a full-fledged insane asylum.

389
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,800
 It burned down in the 1940s.

390
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,560
 And then in the 1960s some crazy far out trippy dudes was like walking around Turnbull Canyon

391
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,000
 being like, "Oh man, isn't this cool?

392
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,520
 We got owls and tumbleweed and stuff."

393
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,320
 And they come across the burnt down remains of this insane asylum.

394
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,640
 One of the hippies is like, "Look at me, man.

395
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
 Look at me.

396
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
 I'm crazy!"

397
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,600
 And he sits down in an electroshock chair and he puts on the cap.

398
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 He's like, "Shock me, baby!"

399
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,960
 And then the girl hits the switch and he actually gets electrocuted even though the place had

400
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
 absolutely no power.

401
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,760
 It was a burned out shell.

402
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,280
 Nothing had existed really in it for 20 years.

403
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,760
 Somehow this hippie gets electrocuted.

404
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,400
 Now that's not, that's 100% not true.

405
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:01,000
 There, there, that, that not only bends the logic of what ghosts can, if a ghost can electrocute

406
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,600
 you then ghost turning your lights on or making your faucet run is so low level lame.

407
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,360
 Like if a ghost can actually bring electricity into a building where there's been no electricity

408
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,960
 for 20 years and give you enough volts to blow your brains out, I am no longer impressed

409
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,840
 when people say, and then the book fell off the bookcase.

410
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
 I'm like, did you die?

411
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
 Did you get electrocuted?

412
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,400
 I'd be like, what are you talking about?

413
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,040
 I'm like, do not tell me a ghost story that doesn't involve a hippie getting his brains

414
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
 melted.

415
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
 And then I'll just leave.

416
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,080
 I hope someday someone invites me to a paranormal convention.

417
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,680
 So I don't believe that story.

418
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,360
 Either that story is 100% made and of course I can't verify it.

419
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,120
 People said there is like a bit of a ruin, like a flat.

420
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,320
 Looks like something was built out there, but other people have said there's no, there's

421
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,240
 no record of an insane asylum out there.

422
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,960
 I believe this story is not true, but if that story is true, it is the greatest ghost encounter

423
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
 of all time.

424
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,440
 It should be, every episode of Ghost Hunters should just be people sitting down with electro

425
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,560
 shock elements at that location.

426
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:12,360
 So let's get to the part I was the most excited about, because again, we had sane worshipers,

427
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,880
 child snatchers and drifters.

428
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,040
 I was like, oh, so sane worshipers, you can assume like someone walks around with a creepy

429
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,520
 mask on, you go, oh that person's sane worshiper, they could just have a fetish, they could

430
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,120
 be a sane worshiper, I don't know.

431
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,120
 Child snatchers, that's just horrible, I'm like researching that stuff but a drifter,

432
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
 like a homeless person hiding in the bushes.

433
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,280
 I've had 100 encounters with homeless people over the years.

434
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,600
 I'd say maybe 30% of them are good.

435
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,040
 I've had friends who were homeless, there was a time where I lived in my car because

436
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,360
 I lost my apartment, I was going to college, I lived in my car.

437
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,040
 But my friends who were homeless and they went around panhandling when I was living in my

438
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,400
 car, I would never consider them drifters or myself a drifter, we were still in the

439
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,760
 same area.

440
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,160
 But I've run into actual drifters and it's always been an unpleasant experience.

441
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,000
 Generally homeless people themselves are fine but in Hood River we get a ton of them because

442
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,880
 as the weather kind of warms up, they migrate.

443
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,120
 They get a ton of them.

444
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,800
 So anyways, drifters, I'm like, drifters, my mortal enemy, the blood feud continues.

445
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 I should just do a whole episode about my drifter stories.

446
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,440
 So as I'm reaching for my screwdriver in my pocket you're like, whoa, whoa dude, you're

447
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,680
 not getting ready to stab that man over there.

448
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,640
 I'm like, you don't understand the war is today.

449
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,920
 But I was so excited to read about drifters because they were saying that drifters had

450
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,320
 killed people in Turnbull Canyon.

451
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,280
 I'm not excited that they're murdering people, but I was like, that's something that I can

452
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,640
 sneak my teeth into.

453
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,160
 That's something that can be verified.

454
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,280
 I can just pick up the bum daily and flip through it and go to the drifter murder section.

455
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,240
 It's the biggest part of the newspaper and read about it, right?

456
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,200
 So I'm reading this main article in Weird USA about Turnbull Canyon and I get to this

457
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
 quote.

458
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,600
 Oh my God, I get to this quote.

459
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,480
 And it says, "I live near Turnbull Canyon."

460
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,080
 This is a guy's first person, obviously.

461
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,280
 I live near Turnbull Canyon and yes, I've heard all about this.

462
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,880
 It is one hell of a scary ass place to be in if you're by yourself and you aren't familiar

463
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 with it.

464
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,200
 I remember seeing people walking around with hoods on, but I'm not sure.

465
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
 That's a little vague.

466
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,960
 I could have had hoods on, could have just had a weird haircut.

467
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
 I don't know.

468
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,600
 So, where did I leave off?

469
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,000
 Oh, I remember seeing people walking around with hoods on, but I'm not sure.

470
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,080
 For sure though.

471
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,280
 I know that there are many devil worshipers/colds in that area.

472
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,440
 Also, they found some rapist killer hiding there also.

473
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,720
 That was written and I'm reading that and I was like, oh, just another piece of the puzzle.

474
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,880
 And then I get to who wrote it.

475
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,720
 They included his name.

476
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,400
 Counterlock, Drifting.com, and I'm like, my heart sunk.

477
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,960
 Because then I realized that Counterlock from Drifting.com was one of the Drifters.

478
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,800
 Let me re-read you that headline here.

479
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,840
 Let me re-read you that headline.

480
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,160
 "Saintness, Child Snatcher, and Drifters in Turnbull Canyon, Whittier."

481
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,920
 In that context, would you think Tokyo Drift?

482
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,320
 In that context, would you think a bunch of lowered Hondas going around corners super

483
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
 fast?

484
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,600
 No, not at all.

485
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
 Drifters have killed people in this area because the road is so curvy, people race out there

486
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,000
 and they drift in their cars and they hit people.

487
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,880
 They hit a police officer, they've hit some people standing on the side of the road.

488
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,320
 That is not a g- I get technically they are drifters, but in the context, if you said,

489
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,840
 "Hey, you want to go see a movie about Saint worshipers and drifters killing people?"

490
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,480
 You would go, "Oh yeah, is that from Blumhouse?

491
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
 What is this?

492
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
 Is this some new horror movie coming out?"

493
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,840
 And they're like, "No, it's Fast and Furious 11 where they have to drive their cars underneath

494
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,320
 the statue of Baphomet and if they drift just right they can break the ankles of the statue

495
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,000
 and save humanity from the Satan."

496
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,680
 You'd be like, "What are you talking about?"

497
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
 That movie doesn't exist.

498
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,560
 That movie would never exist.

499
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,320
 So if someone says, "Hey, you want to go see a movie about street racing and drifters?"

500
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
 You're like, "Yeah."

501
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,520
 And then he realizes it's about homeless people driving cars.

502
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,680
 Context is important.

503
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,920
 Context is important.

504
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,720
 And I came across that linearly.

505
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,960
 I came across that and I was like, "My heart just sunk."

506
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,360
 I was like, "Are you kidding me?

507
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,920
 Those are the drifters killing people?

508
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,080
 Those drifters kill people all over the place."

509
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,440
 It's really bad in Tokyo, apparently.

510
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,240
 My thing is this.

511
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,360
 That guy who I read about who did thousands of hours of research and was talking about

512
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,320
 playing crash, he does this huge write up on the history of Turnbull Canyon.

513
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,520
 He's also on Drifting.com.

514
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,160
 So apparently Drifting.com, a website dedicated to getting the best drift out of your car,

515
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,240
 to living life a quarter mile at a time, to beating your enemies and winning those pink

516
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,920
 slips and hooking up with some hot girl in a bikini, also has an entire section of their

517
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,840
 form dedicated to hauntings of Turnbull Canyon.

518
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,520
 So I guess Turnbull Canyon is really famous among drifters, but if I'm going to Drifting.com

519
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,640
 I want to know how to get like, nauseous to shoot out some part of my car, right?

520
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,560
 I want to learn how to like, spin the wheel just right so I can *imitates wheel wheel*

521
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,000
 right in front of the ladies and impress them.

522
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,520
 Not ghost planes and Saint worshipers and all sorts of nonsense.

523
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,240
 Drifting.com, I have an eternal war against drifters of all kinds now.

524
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,600
 Not just the homeless people who harass me violently harass me, but you guys spinning

525
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,840
 around in your cars doing those doughnuts and stuff.

526
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,720
 Not a Monquito so I especially hate doughnuts.

527
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,200
 Turnbull Canyon is an interesting story because after all you're like Jason, you told us

528
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,400
 this crazy story and you pretty much just said this is why this isn't true, this is

529
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,720
 why this isn't true.

530
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,000
 The child selling thing could possibly be true, the electroshock therapy is just hilarious.

531
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,080
 But what's really interesting and I want to leave you with this note as we're walking

532
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,360
 through the darkened canyon, is that people have come out in the area and said it's not

533
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
 haunted.

534
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,860
 I'm up in this area, those are just rumors, there are no Saint worshipers, there are no

535
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,400
 child sacrifices, there are no ghost you guys, you children are foolish, I've lived here

536
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,640
 all my life.

537
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,800
 I read this as looking around online because I had to do a bunch of research on these type

538
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,600
 of stories to see whether or not any of it's true.

539
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,960
 And this one poster was saying, listen, I've hiked there with my dog all times day and

540
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
 night.

541
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
 It's a very relaxing place.

542
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,960
 I take my dog, we walk out there, just enjoy the splendor of it all.

543
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,400
 It is definitely not haunted, there's no dark magic there, there's no baby ritual sacrifices,

544
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,640
 that doesn't happen here.

545
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,320
 But one day I was walking through the canyon and I saw a stick and on top of the stick

546
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,560
 was the severed head of a deer that was mounted on it so I was looking up at the sky.

547
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,920
 And this is her quote, this is her exact quote.

548
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,480
 So I'm not saying that stuff doesn't happen there, animal sacrifice to be specific, but

549
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,720
 most of this crap is just urban legend best ignored.

550
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:00,160
 If the people disputing the urban legends have to admit they themselves have seen the

551
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,520
 signs of ritual animal sacrifice, that doesn't do the debunkers a lot of good.

552
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,320
 It's possible that the canyon does hold some dark mysteries.

553
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,920
 It's right on the precipice of the perfect place to commit some sort of heinous act.

554
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,080
 But you'd also have to be aware that some ghost hunters could stumble across you at

555
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,060
 any time, like we were walking down Turnbull Canyon late at night.

556
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,880
 You could go there and use the fear of the area, use the history of the area.

557
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,840
 Whether or not it was true, people believe that the place is soaked in evil and it basically

558
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,640
 could become some sort of topa.

559
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,200
 People think the area is evil, so it gets slightly evil over the years.

560
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,800
 And you go to this place to commit your sacrifices out of the eyes of all the prying people around

561
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
 you.

562
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,600
 You've got to be careful of those drifters coming around the corner, but they're going

563
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
 too fast.

564
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:04,000
 They don't see you and your cohorts in the hooded gowns walking through the canyon.

565
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,760
 But they see us.

566
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,760
 A pair of ghost hunters, goofing off, debunking these stories and laughing about it.

567
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,640
 You just have ghost investigators and paranormal people, drunk teens, coming to the area to

568
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,560
 investigate these stories.

569
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,960
 We came here to go for a walk and look into the history of this canyon.

570
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,640
 And as we sit there laughing about the goofy stories we've heard, having a good time,

571
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,600
 the cult leader is watching us from the darkness.

572
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:39,280
 Many think the best thing we ever did was start these legends about this canyon.

573
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,840
 Not only did it charge this area with negative energy, but it convinced gollible people to

574
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,360
 come out here in the middle of the night on their own, looking for some answers.

575
00:30:50,360 --> 00:31:01,360
 When in truth, we were just looking for sacrificial lambs to deliver themselves to our doorstep.

576
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,200

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,760
 But I'm glad you listened to it today.

582
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,280
 Have a great one guys.
