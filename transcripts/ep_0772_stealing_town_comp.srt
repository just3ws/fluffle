1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 What would you do if you were walking down the street one day, you saw an old lady waving at you?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,080
 It's spooky, trust me on this one, you're like, I love old women.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,880
 And then we travel to Russia to meet a 12 year old girl who has a fantastic tale to tell us.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:26,880
 She will tell us about the time the aliens robbed her city blind today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
 I'm a walking down.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
 Actually, I'm a walking down.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio on my host Jason Garvin.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,880
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,880
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover so we're going to slide right into this and get it going.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,880
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy patreons coming into Dead Rabbit Command.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,880
 Everyone get ready to give a round of applause for Rage Cat.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
 One of our legacy patreons, Rage Cat.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,880
 I'm supporting the show.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,880
 Rage, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,880
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,880
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,880
 Just let people know that Dead Rabbit Radio is a really cool podcast.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,880
 You can be a little more eloquent when you say it, but just let people know how much you enjoy this show.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,880
 Rage Cat, I'm going to go ahead and touch you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
 We're driving all the way out to Johnson City, Tennessee.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
 (Tenney's voice)

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
 (Tenney's voice)

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
 Driving us out there and guess what guys?

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,880
 The year is 1989 and it's Christmas time.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
 The snow's falling softly on the ground.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:44,880
 People are buying presents, walking around, and then with a perilous ear we hear a shriek pierce the air.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
 And that shriek is near.

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
 So we grab our who wetsits, our goobles and nooks.

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 And we run down the street.

32
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 We run down the street to put out a fire.

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
 I can't think of anything else.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
 So we're running down the street. It's December 24th, 1989.

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
 And we're headed to the Hotel John Sever.

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,880
 It used to be a luxury hotel, but by 1989 it had been converted into a retirement home.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 How's that to retire in a former luxury hotel?

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
 I imagine it was still fancy.

39
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,880
 Like maybe they took down the chandeliers, but I don't imagine it was like overrun with cockroaches.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,880
 And if it was, they would have been very polite cockroaches, little butler uniforms.

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,880
 December 24th, 1989, a horrible fire breaks out in the retirement home.

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
 And it's near the bottom.

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
 So it's like a hotel.

44
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
 You know, hotels go up.

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
 If you didn't know this, this is a little thing you'll learn on this episode.

46
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,880
 Hotels go up and motels go horizontal.

47
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,880
 So the hotel has multiple stories. There's a fire at the bottom.

48
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
 I know there's so much people fact checking that right now.

49
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
 I'm pretty sure I'm correct on that.

50
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:56,880
 But there's a fire going on and the people at the top can't get out.

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,880
 But fire crews are showing up and camera crews show up as well.

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,880
 And they're filming this. This is Christmas Eve, 1989.

53
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,880
 And there's live footage coming from Johnson City, Tennessee of this building on fire.

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,880
 And you see people in the windows waving for help.

55
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,880
 And firefighters are doing their best spraying water everywhere.

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,880
 And then like they're using axes and they're chopping down doors.

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,880
 They're probably on those ladders getting people out of buildings.

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880
 But remember, this is a retirement home.

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,880
 So we're not talking about the most spry of victims.

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,880
 You know, it's not like they can go out of the way. Firefighters, wee!

61
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
 And they can like slide down the ladder.

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,880
 These people need assistance just to use the bathroom.

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,880
 So the... I'm not saying everyone in the retirement home can't poop.

64
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,880
 But the fact is it's very difficult.

65
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,880
 But on the other hand, you figure they probably weigh less because they're so old.

66
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,880
 And normally old people are like super skinny.

67
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
 But anyways, look that up Jamie.

68
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,880
 Look that up. See if old people are easier to carry.

69
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,880
 In the end, 16 people die in this fire.

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,880
 16 people die.

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
 This really...

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,880
 Okay, you guys are gonna...

73
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,880
 I haven't some real mixed emotions telling this story and I'll get to it in a second.

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,880
 I didn't even think about this when I came up with this.

75
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,880
 16 elderly people died in this fire.

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,880
 And to this day, the building is still there.

77
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
 The hotel is still there.

78
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,880
 To this day, you're walking down the street in Johnson City, Tennessee.

79
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,880
 You're walking by the John Severs Center.

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
 You can look up.

81
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
 You can do that anyway.

82
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,880
 You're like, "Oh man, my neck hurts. I hope I can pass this building so I can finally look up."

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,880
 But if you look up at the fourth floor, as you're passing this building,

84
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,880
 sometimes when you look up and you look up at the fourth floor,

85
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,880
 you'll see an old woman.

86
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,880
 I'll get in this retirement home.

87
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,880
 You went in, you'd see dozens of old people.

88
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,880
 But this one, you look up and you see this window and you see an old woman

89
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,880
 who is waving at you.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,880
 But she's waving in slow motion.

91
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,880
 This was a video podcast.

92
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,880
 Those seconds of silence was me waving in front of the microphone.

93
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,880
 So, damn it.

94
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,880
 Anyways, let me tell you a little bit about this story.

95
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
 I totally spaced on this whole thing.

96
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
 So, let me finish the story.

97
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
 So, that is creepy in and of itself.

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,880
 I think the idea of ghosts as creepy, obviously, ghost killed in tragic events,

99
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
 are creepier than, say, a ghost who doesn't know that they're dead

100
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,880
 or a ghost who has a mission to finish, things like that.

101
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,880
 But when someone dies tragically and their ghost is stuck here,

102
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,880
 that's always extra tragic.

103
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,880
 That adds a layer of spookiness to it.

104
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,880
 And then the idea of her waving in slow motion

105
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,880
 makes me think of some sort of time distortion as well.

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
 It's like, it'd be one thing if the ghost was waving at you,

107
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,880
 "Hi!" and sits down and is reading a newspaper,

108
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,880
 but the fact that it's so tormented, it can't even wave at a regular speed.

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
 Does that make sense?

110
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,880
 Like, if you were walking down the street, you're walking to your car late at night,

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,880
 and you see a little kid standing behind you

112
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
 and he's walking, like, in super slow motion,

113
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,880
 you're like, "There's no way a kid can walk that slow.

114
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,880
 I've chased many kids in my life and trust me, they are not that slow."

115
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
 And he's walking in a real slow motion,

116
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
 or if you turn around, there's a kid walking normal.

117
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,880
 Like, your brain automatically, you saw a kid walking behind you normal,

118
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
 you may think, "What's he doing out so late?"

119
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
 But if he was walking in slow motion,

120
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
 it's the same reason why I think like ghost kids in movies,

121
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
 they kind of have that herky-jerky thing,

122
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,880
 because it's when you're not moving the way you expect someone to move,

123
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
 it makes it creepier.

124
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,880
 So the idea of this woman waving in slow motion makes that alone makes it creepier.

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,880
 She was just waving and then disappeared in a puff of smoke.

126
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
 I'd still be scared, I don't know if I'd be scared, I'd go, "Oh, ghost!

127
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,880
 A ghost who's 40 feet above me."

128
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,880
 But if she was like, I could see the look on her face and her hands are slowly moving back and forth,

129
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,880
 it just adds to the torment, it makes it seem like she's trapped in some sort of time distortion,

130
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
 this pain in the universe.

131
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,880
 Horrible, horrible. And now I'm going to go into my next part,

132
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,880
 which I had not planned on doing, by the way, but I guess I should address it now.

133
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
 I want to tell you this story.

134
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
 No, man, it's going to ruin everyone's day.

135
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,880
 That story may have come off a little more jokey than I normally would.

136
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,880
 I do stories where a bunch of elderly people die.

137
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,880
 While I was reading it, I remembered, I've actually never forgotten this fact.

138
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,880
 The reason why I was kind of laughing my way nervously through that story,

139
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,880
 because I realized that it did hit a little too close to home.

140
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:02,880
 I had a friend named Jennifer Olson, who died back in 1990, during Christmas time due to fire.

141
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,880
 And she was a good friend of mine, we were little kids at the time, but she died a hero.

142
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,880
 She actually saved her brothers and her sister and her grandpa, got them out of the house after it caught on fire.

143
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,880
 I had always heard that it was the Christmas tree that went up, or some electrical thing,

144
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,880
 but she gets them out of the house and then she went back in for the pets.

145
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,880
 She died of smoke inhalation, so...

146
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,880
 Yeah, normally, normally I don't laugh as much when we're talking about a bunch of elderly people dying.

147
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,880
 Maybe 14 elderly people, but 16, no way.

148
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 Normally I don't laugh so much, but yeah, as I was reading that, I was like, "Uhhh..."

149
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,880
 I guess I shouldn't have laughed at all at any of these stories, usually I'm better at that, whether or not I'm related to them.

150
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,880
 You know, the interesting thing about, you know, one, Jennifer Olson has a park named after her in Alameda.

151
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
 That's where this happened at Alameda, California.

152
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,880
 Another interesting thing is, I just wanted those moments in my life.

153
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,880
 I remember I was not in town when this happened, I was in Sacramento.

154
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,880
 I was watching television, I was watching "Alf" or something like that.

155
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,880
 And my great-grandma Maggie, she would always read the newspaper, and one day she's reading the newspaper and she goes, "That poor, poor girl."

156
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,880
 "Oh, that poor girl, but she died. She died in the fire, but she saved all those people."

157
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
 And I remember her saying this, she would always read the newspaper out loud, right?

158
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:33,880
 I remember her saying this, and I remember being so blasé about the whole thing, that I didn't ask any details.

159
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,880
 A young girl dies in a fire, and I didn't ask anything about it.

160
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,880
 I just went back to watching my sitcom, and then two weeks later when I came back home,

161
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,880
 my buddy Fernando Mendoza was like, "Hey, are you going to the funeral?"

162
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
 He's like, "What?"

163
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
 "Superman? Did that the Superman happen? Oh, no!"

164
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 I don't know why, I don't even know why I'm still making- It was heartbreaking for me, it was heartbreaking for me.

165
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,880
 Jennifer Olson was a really, really good friend of mine, and life wasn't super easy for her.

166
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,880
 We had some long conversations about things, but yeah.

167
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,880
 So anyways, yeah, that's why that story was just a little more giggly.

168
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,880
 It was nervous laughter, and yeah, I'm not a huge Christmas fan.

169
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,880
 If you can believe it, I'm not a huge fan of Christmas, considering one of my friends was literally killed by the holiday.

170
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,880
 But, Ragecat, I'm going to go ahead and toss you- I have no other way to segue out of this.

171
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,880
 Ragecat, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter we are leaving behind Johnson City, Tennessee.

172
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
 We're headed all the way out to Russia.

173
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,880
 [imitates car noises]

174
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,880
 I also can't segue really good into this promo read, but this movie I actually can't wait to watch.

175
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
 It looks really cool, so here we go.

176
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,880
 The Underwatt- Dude, listen to this description, okay? Listen to this description.

177
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:03,880
 The underwater horror film, The Deep House, is now available on digital and on demand.

178
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,880
 When a young couple sets out to explore a house at the bottom of a lake, they discover a sinister presence.

179
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,880
 Can they escape the underwater house of horrors before it's too late?

180
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,880
 Buy or rent The Deep House today to find out!

181
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,880
 Unrated from Paramount Pictures.

182
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,880
 I watched the trailer. It's a haunted house underwater.

183
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
 That is- that's awesome!

184
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
 And you know the filmmakers probably have a bunch of scuba diving gear and they're like, uh...

185
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,880
 That's great. I'm a huge horror fan. I watch more horror than anything else.

186
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,880
 And when you can come up with something that excites me just from the premise?

187
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,880
 An underwater haunted house. I already hate being an underwater- right?

188
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,880
 I can't wait to watch this. You guys can buy or rent it as well. I have to check it out.

189
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 I'll probably watch it this weekend. The Deep House looks really, really cool.

190
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,880
 Rage Cat, we are now headed to Russia. Specifically, we're headed to Vykovo.

191
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,880
 That's in the Yaroslav province in Russia.

192
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,880
 The year is 1932. It's not Christmas time. Don't worry. I won't tell you any more depressing Christmas stories.

193
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
 It's in day. It's the daytime.

194
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,880
 And we're gonna meet a young girl named Vera Alexandra Dronova.

195
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,880
 She's 12 years old and she's sitting there. She's like, "World weary. She's sitting on this rock."

196
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,880
 We walk up. We go, "Hey, Vera, what's up?" And she's like, "Uh, look at these wrinkles in my face."

197
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,880
 "Don't I look like I'm at least 65?" And we're like, "Eh, I'm stressed. Look at me. I'm super stressed out."

198
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,880
 And she does seem a little on edge. We're like, "Vera, why are you so upset?"

199
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
 And she goes, "I'm gonna tell you the crazy story. You're not gonna believe me."

200
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
 She goes, "Maybe about a week or two ago. We're all just kind of doing our thing in the village.

201
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,880
 Some people are farming. Some people are milling, whatever that is.

202
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,880
 Some people are like grinding stones together. I don't know what they did in the 1930s.

203
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:06,880
 And then all of a sudden, this large flying ship begins to streak towards their village.

204
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,880
 It is coming so fast and so low. It causes...

205
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,880
 This is fascinating to me because we don't get a lot of these details from many UFO stories.

206
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,880
 It's coming so fast and so low. It causes the river to have a tidal wave.

207
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,880
 I didn't know that was possible. The boats that were going down the river, this *shrrr* ship is so low with so much force,

208
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,880
 the boats are thrown out of the river. And that is the best thing that happens to this village.

209
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,880
 The townspeople start to run out to where they think this thing is going to land,

210
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,880
 and they get to this nearby potato field.

211
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 And while they're there, they watch this ship. She doesn't really describe the shape of it,

212
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 but they see the ship and it begins to go *mimics ship*

213
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:07,880
 It starts to go *mimics ship* and dirt is spraying in every direction. It's drilling into the earth.

214
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,880
 And she says this UFO goes so low you can just kind of see the top of it.

215
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,880
 It's almost completely covered and now it is SNESLED in the potato field.

216
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,880
 People are like, "Well, I guess that was a good show. No one's going to go near this thing."

217
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
 It already threw the boats everywhere and now the potato crops are ruined.

218
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,880
 Shortly afterwards, shortly after this ship lands, *mimics ship*

219
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,880
 the people in the town start to see little green men.

220
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,880
 But it was actually more... they were more grayish.

221
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,880
 That's the fact that they were aliens, right? We're not going to quibble over what color they were,

222
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,880
 but it was like a greenish gray. And they were the size of children. They were tiny little guys.

223
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,880
 They had four fingers, no thumbs, no toes, which is interesting because that means they're not wearing shoes.

224
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,880
 I mean, I guess the fact that they landed in a UFO is more interesting than the fact that they weren't wearing shoes.

225
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,880
 But to see that they had no toes, I'm imagining that they were barefoot. How would you even balance like that?

226
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,880
 They have four fingers, no toes, and they're wearing these tight little silver outfits and they're walking around town.

227
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,880
 *mimics*

228
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,880
 And they're followed by a man. Like an adult human-sized man who was the same skin color.

229
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,880
 It was the greenish gray, but he didn't act so weird.

230
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,880
 And as the town people were talking about this, they didn't really have a word for what they thought the children were,

231
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,880
 but they... the modern term would be "bio-robots." The old intern would probably be a bunch of tiny weirdos,

232
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,880
 but they could tell there was a difference between the tall man and these little guys who were just kind of bumbling around the scene.

233
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:06,880
 In fact, the tall man talked to the locals. And again, at first, I can't think of another time we've encountered this in UFO lore,

234
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,880
 he starts cracking jokes. Unfortunately, she hasn't written out what the jokes were.

235
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,880
 He's like, "Ugh, how many parsecs does it take to feed a space chicken?" or something like that.

236
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,880
 Or they could have been really good, right? They could have been local jokes, they could have been making fun of the villager people.

237
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,880
 Look at that little girl over there, she's ugly. People are like, "What? That's horrible, Aileen. Why'd you say that?"

238
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
 'Cause she is.

239
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,880
 This tall alien, too, might have been a little bit of a lethario, because Vera says...

240
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,880
 In her narrative, this guy shows up, he's tall, I don't know if he's handsome, he's greenish gray,

241
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
 I don't know how handsome you can be with that skin color.

242
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,880
 He's cracking jokes, he's doing finger guns, which Aileen likes, and Aileen power, everyone's getting evaporated.

243
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,880
 He's walking around, he's the cool guy, and Vera goes, "Yeah, and he also stayed at my aunt's house."

244
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:06,880
 He didn't stay in the UFO. He didn't stay with the little green guys, he slept at my aunt's house, and she just kind of leaves it at that.

245
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
 That aunt.

246
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,880
 That aunt was getting banged by this tall alien.

247
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,880
 'Cause there was no way he wasn't partaking in earthly culture. Let's put it that way, right?

248
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,880
 And if you were chilling at your place and some alien showed up and they were attractive, right?

249
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,880
 No one likes thumbs? Blech. Those are gross.

250
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
 No toes? Right? Oh, she didn't have a foot fetish. You'd bang that alien.

251
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,880
 I'm not saying you'd bang this dude, but if it was someone you were attracted to, you're like, "Yes, Jason."

252
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,880
 If you were saying yes, I would have sex with someone I'm attracted to, you would.

253
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,880
 Alien or not. Anni's telling jokes, they might be super hilarious jokes.

254
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:53,880
 Over time, 'cause this is not a one night event, people start to refer to the little ones as the medics.

255
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:01,880
 And what they would do is they'd walk around with these big cylinders on their back that would have tubes coming out of it.

256
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,880
 They'd walk to and fro into people's houses in the middle of the night, mind you, while people were sleeping.

257
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,880
 [imitates sound of a baby]

258
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,880
 And then leave, looking for another house to enter.

259
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
 And the tall man explained, "Oh, oh yeah, no, they are..."

260
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,880
 "How do you humans put it, invading your personal space and taking samples of your tissue and blood while you're sleeping?"

261
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:35,880
 They're measuring something. So don't mind them. If you wake up, if you wake up with a little less blood, don't worry about it.

262
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,880
 They would also see these little men walk around and they were doing the same thing to the livestock.

263
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:48,880
 Putting the tubes in them, extracting tissue samples, blood, and then just kind of going, "Chase the chicken, chase the chickens around."

264
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,880
 Which would be hilarious to watch aliens chase the chicken.

265
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:59,880
 Oddly enough, not only were they doing this to our livestock, they brought their own menagerie of animals.

266
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:07,880
 Vera said that every show often, they'd see a new dog coming in. It's not like they'd usually have pit bulls.

267
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,880
 This is a Rottweiler. These were alien dogs. She said they looked just like regular dogs.

268
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,880
 But their head was on top like a human's head.

269
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,880
 And I'm trying to picture that. Don't dogs have necks?

270
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,880
 But I guess that you're like, "Yes, Jason, dogs do have necks." But does a dog neck go out straight in a human neck go straight?

271
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,880
 I can't picture that. My mind's boggled. I don't understand. The exact sentence was, "Like dogs."

272
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,880
 But their heads were located straight up like those of a man.

273
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
 So maybe it was just dogs that needed some chiropractic work.

274
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:53,880
 But they'd see that and the other animal they would not see are the monkeys, the space monkeys.

275
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,880
 What would happen is people would wake up. First off, they wake up. They have less skin and less blood than they had the day before.

276
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,880
 But then they would be like, "Oh, man, I really need to eat. I really need to eat to replenish my bodily fluids."

277
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,880
 They'd go to get the eggs out of the fridge or it's 1932. They went to go get the eggs out of the chicken.

278
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:19,880
 And the eggs would be gone. Chickens would be gone. Milk gone. The whole pantry. Nothing's in it.

279
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,880
 But poop. They slammed the pantry door shut. They're like, "You monkeys!"

280
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,880
 What they were finding all over town was monkey poop. We're in Russia. We're in Russia, by the way.

281
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,880
 Again, there's no monkeys native to Russia. They're finding monkey poop everywhere.

282
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,880
 They said that you would catch a glimpse of the monkey running away with a chicken under one arm and a carton of milk under the other.

283
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,880
 Maybe once every so often, but you would find his poop everywhere. There was so much monkey poop.

284
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,880
 It actually started to affect the local economy. It's not like they could start burning the dung. That's probably what I would have done.

285
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:04,880
 They couldn't feed their livestock. There was so much monkey poop. The monkeys would poop everywhere.

286
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,880
 And then they were, for whatever reason, they came all the way from Alpha Centauri. They've learned to love hay.

287
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,880
 So we were trying to feed the hay to the cows and the horses. And the cows were like, "Mmmmm."

288
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:26,880
 And they'd walk away and they'd be like, "I'd rather starve over here." There was poop stuffed into the hay. It was full of excrement.

289
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,880
 So now the farmers are like, "I have no chickens because these monsters ate the chickens."

290
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,880
 "I have no eggs because I have no chickens. I need milk."

291
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:44,880
 I can't even feed my livestock because they're polluting the environment. They're poop polluting the environment.

292
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,880
 I just want to be clear. I do not write these jokes in advance. I do not write these jokes in advance. I do not spend a week working on that.

293
00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:00,880
 You'd walk into your house. You'd probably slip on some monkey poop. Then as your unconscious guys are sucking blood out of your body,

294
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 it was a horrible thing to be in. And then, just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, you have no milk, you have no eggs,

295
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:15,880
 you have no cows, they're slowly starving to death. There's monkey poop everywhere. There's dogs that you can't comprehend where their heads are.

296
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:25,880
 You're waking up with less blood. This guy is most likely banging this ant. All the potatoes in town disappear. All of them.

297
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,880
 I mean, these guys have nothing to eat at this point. Every single potato disappears.

298
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:44,880
 Cheese and grain. What little they had left is being stolen straight from the industrial buildings that is making the cheese and the grain.

299
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,880
 And Vera tells a story. She goes, "One day I'm sitting there, sitting by a silo." I don't know why she's sitting by the silo.

300
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,880
 Maybe it was the most boring day. How could it be boring actually? There's space monkeys running around.

301
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:09,880
 But anyways, she's sitting by the silo and she says, "I watch an elephant with no trunk start walking through the village."

302
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:22,880
 And I'm walking alongside it where these little men, these medics, and they each have their little hoses and the elephant, or elephant-like creature, has these giant containers on its back.

303
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:32,880
 And she goes, "And I watch these little dudes and this elephant-like creature walk up to the silo full of grain, full of food for us."

304
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:46,880
 They attach these tubes to the grainery and then all the grain got sucked up into the elephant's tanks and then they just turn around and walk.

305
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,880
 And when they go into the silo, when the humans check the silo, there's no food whatsoever.

306
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,880
 So the local economy completely collapses. You have no way to feed yourself. You have no way to sell anything.

307
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 You can't really have a tourist destination. You can't be like, "Come see the space monkeys."

308
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 Because you can't see them. You only see the poop.

309
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:15,880
 They can't stop it either, these guys. And it's funny because she says we can't stop it, but I wonder what they actively did against him, right?

310
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:22,880
 You would assume right there that this guy's from another planet. Just as ship landing would be such a show of power, you wouldn't need to see a space gun.

311
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,880
 He moved the water. Like, this ship came down and was throwing boats everywhere.

312
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,880
 So people start leaving. That's the path of least resistance, right?

313
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,880
 It's 1932 Russia. I'm sure there's not a famine somewhere else in the country. I'm sure everything will be fine.

314
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,880
 You can go all throughout this communist paradise. So these people start leaving the city.

315
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,880
 And then this is where the story takes...this is such an interesting fact.

316
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,880
 All of that stuff is a great UFO alien story. But then we get this final tidbit here.

317
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,880
 Eventually, the Soviet Union gets wind of what has happened in this town.

318
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:09,880
 So they send some investigators out. They get investigated by the Soviet Union. What happens is the investigators get there. There's no aliens.

319
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 All they see is a town that is so poorly run. It has no food. It has no goods that it can trade with.

320
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:32,880
 Half the population has disappeared into other towns. So the local officials are charged with sabotage and arrested.

321
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,880
 And most likely died in some gulag somewhere. That is the story that Vera tells us.

322
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:46,880
 That story came from the Yaroslav UFO group. I got it from thingaboutadox.com, but they got it from the Yaroslav UFO group.

323
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,880
 Fascinating story on the two levels. One, just the idea of aliens coming down and just taking what they want.

324
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,880
 Taking what they want. We did an episode recently about the aliens that just came down and pointed at people and then they disappeared.

325
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,880
 That was a chilling one. This one's a little more lighthearted. They're just destroying an economy.

326
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,880
 But what could you really do? I can walk into a bunch of beavers and start taking logs off their dam.

327
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,880
 And be like, "Thanks. I'm going to go burn these in my fireplace."

328
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:24,880
 Surely they can probably hit me with their tails or maybe do some sort of over the hedge or furry vengeance thing.

329
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,880
 Build a trap and have a skunk fart in my face. Yeah. But I mean, really, what are you going to do? Bite me?

330
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,880
 I'm sure they could probably injure me with a couple bites to the Achilles tendon.

331
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,880
 But at the end of the day, like, I'll just be kicking them. Kicking the beavers into the water and then watching them swim away.

332
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:47,880
 That's what aliens would do, right? We have these Independence Day, these ideas of "do, do, do, shoot aliens" and stuff like that.

333
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 But Robotech fighting off this intrati menace.

334
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,880
 But remember the thing about Robotech? You're like, Jason, I remember what you think about Robotech.

335
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:04,880
 Robotech, the only reason why the humans were able to fight this intrati was because an alien spaceship crashed on Earth first.

336
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 So we had all their technology. We knew they were coming and we could retrofit it.

337
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,880
 Or what are they called? Reverse Engineerate to build the Veritech fighters.

338
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,880
 And then this intrati showed up and Min-May tried taking Rick Hunter's heart.

339
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,880
 But we all know he belonged with Lisa Hayes. The point is, is that have this intrati--

340
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
 I forget the Robotech example, I think you guys got it.

341
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,880
 If an alien just came down and we didn't know they were coming down, they would walk all over us.

342
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,880
 They wouldn't have to use space lasers. They could just show.

343
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 And we may have some sort of resistance against them, but at a certain point they go,

344
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,880
 "How many times do we have to do finger guns and evaporate your stuff before you just let us take your potatoes?"

345
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,880
 All we want is your delicious potatoes.

346
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 And the other reason why I really love this story, and we'll finish it up like this, is,

347
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,880
 there is a chance that this was all a fraud.

348
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
 Now I'm not saying the Yaroslav UFO group made it up or that Vera made it up.

349
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,880
 I'm talking about back in 1932, it would have been really easy to have a couple people dressed up as elves

350
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,880
 and walk into a town and be like, "Hey everyone, we're from the elf dimension."

351
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,880
 You know that elf dimension that you guys heard about on all those old legends?

352
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,880
 Don't make me give you the evil eye, guys. I'm taking all your potatoes.

353
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,880
 And you might think that's farfetched, but we actually covered something like that far more recent.

354
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,880
 It was like in the 1990s, 1980s.

355
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,880
 Still to this day, my favorite episode of Dead Rav radio, the vampire sex cult of Yoruba Buene,

356
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,880
 three people just showed up in this Mexican village and said, "Oh, we're ancient Mayan deities.

357
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,880
 Worship us." And people were like, "Okay."

358
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,880
 And they robbed the town blind. I love that episode. That is still to this day.

359
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,880
 If you could take any episode and turn it into a movie, it would be that episode.

360
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,880
 I'll put it in the show notes. It's still my favorite episode. It's like episode 151 or something like that.

361
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,880
 But you could easily commit fraud.

362
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,880
 I mean, okay, wouldn't it be super easy to cut the trunk off an elephant or rearrange a dog's head?

363
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,880
 But you could show up to some small, po-dunk town and be like, "Hey, we're from the future."

364
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,880
 And get people to go along with it and rob them blind.

365
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,880
 I find that so fascinating. When I read this story, that was kind of what was going in the back of my head.

366
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,880
 I go, "It would actually be pretty easy to pull this stunt off."

367
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,880
 And over time, some of the details may have been maybe they weren't child-sized.

368
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,880
 Maybe they were just shorter than the normal Russian of the time.

369
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,880
 But you could pull this scam off. And we have people run these scams today.

370
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,880
 Now they just say they're reincarnated from Atlantis. Watch my show on this Gaia channel.

371
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,880
 I mean, it's the same scam, right? It's the same scam.

372
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,880
 Well, I guess one guy's just telling you to give him money and to support his show and buy his merch.

373
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
 And the other guy is eating your chickens.

374
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,880
 But the point is, is someone is using the belief of the paranormal to manipulate somebody else.

375
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,880
 And I just find that fascinating. And really, when we look at it, what's more likely?

376
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,880
 The fact that a bunch of humans got together and came up with this perfect plot, this Ocean's Eleven,

377
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,880
 but involving eating chickens and potatoes, or an intergalactic alien ship coming to Earth.

378
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,880
 I mean, just on the face of the matter, one is more likely than the other.

379
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:28,880
 However, I still can't figure out how a bunch of scoundrels and scam artists could cause a tidal wave in a river

380
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:37,880
 and knock boats out. But I do find even that earthly explanation very, very fascinating.

381
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,880
 So was it invaders from beyond the stars looking for a little bit of human blood with potatoes on the side?

382
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:51,880
 Or was it humans manipulating other humans using their fear of the unknown to their advantage?

383
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,880
 And if it was the second one, if it was the humans doing that, where--

384
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,880
 I just realized this-- where did all the poop come from?

385
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:06,880
 Was that really human poop? Some mysteries are best left unanswered.

386
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,880
