 It's the beginning of Insanity Week. It's the craziest stories that I could find. I didn't actually want to find them
 They found me were covering some of the craziest stuff this week on Dead Rabbit Radio
 first off a time traveler appears in a city in Wyoming his mission
 Warn us of the massive alien invasion coming in the year 2018
 and then we meet a group of people who have pierced the veil between reality and
 fantasy
 using methamphetamines and
 They've started their own religion their gods the shadow people today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carvin or I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys had a great day, too
 Hope you guys had a great weekend
 It was a calm one because this week this week we're gonna cover some of the craziest stories
 We've come across on Dead Rabbit Radio
 It didn't go out of my way to find them
 They just somehow dog piled on me no matter what I researched this week
 Turned into just a super bizarre rabbit hole so to start off Insanity Week coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now
 It's our newest patreon supporter. He's dressed up as one of those old-timey mental people
 Not the guys in the asylum. He's not walking around a straight jacket. You know what old-timey people they used to carry around the nets
 They had like the funny wagon
 They didn't actually have his people Jesse everyone give a round of applause to Jesse he runs in he's he's drawn like an old
 Bugs Bunny cartoon character. He's running in with his net. Did they used to do that?
 They used to like drag you off nowadays. They're like police come to the hospital
 But I guess in the old I saw this documentary once about Bugs Bunny and Debbie Duck
 Didn't they used to throw a net over you Jesse's like no that didn't exist that didn't exist
 There was a cartoon Jesse you're gonna be captain our pilot this episode. He's shaking his head. Oh, you think this is bad
 I feel really bad for the patreon supporter on Thursday's episode
 But Jesse you're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon work
 You have a job that actually exists. That's fine, too
 Just help spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot
 Jesse I'm gonna go ahead and touch the keys of the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command
 We are headed out to
 Casper
 Wyoming
 Old Jason Jalopy is driving down the road. It's October 2nd
 2017 it's 10 30 p.m
 a
 Man appears in the middle of the street. He's like what where am I?
 And someone goes you're in Casper, Wyoming and he goes no I mean the date
 Yes, where you were and today's like no the date the date and they said it's October 2nd
 2017 and he goes
 They've sent me back too far and he's running through the street of Casper, Wyoming
 I have to warn somebody have to warn anybody. He's running around this man's name is Bryant Johnson. This is true story. Well
 The true part is there's a man named Brian Johnson in Casper, Wyoming. He says he's from the year
 2048 he's running around he starts saying he has to talk to the president of town
 Who's the president of the town and people are like what are you talking about?
 Then he'd like run away and then he'd run into someplace else and he'd be like
 What year is it? He knows the year that's just the best way to start the conversation
 He wants people to know he's a time traveler. He's doing this the police are called out
 They come out and they see this man. He's running around. I
 Was kind of making the story more exciting
 It was more like he was stumbling around town going where's the president of town people are like what the alien invasion is coming
 He wasn't this super active Kyle Reese character. The reason why I had to add that disclaimer
 Was one because it's the truth. I wanted to make sure it's telling the truth
 But two what's coming next when the police show up this man who I previously said was running all over town
 The police walk up to him and they can obviously tell he's incredibly drunk
 They give him a breathalyzer test. He blows a point one three six
 Which a point zero eight is
 Illegally drunk or at least illegally drunk to drive
 So this guy is off the sauce or on the sauce or off his rocker or all sorts of stuff, right?
 This guy's super drunk. That's an illegal term the guy was super drunk your honor
 So the police question them they're like listen
 You're drunk. There's not really a question. It's a statement
 We're gonna say that you're drunk and he goes that's funny that you say that it's funny that you say that because you're right
 I am drunk. I am drunk officer, but not by my own accord
 You see in the future
 This is the greatest excuse. This is the greatest excuse I've ever heard in the future
 The only way you can time travel is to be incredibly drunk
 You're like Jason
 Excuse at all. That's the worst excuse. I think it's a creative excuse
 He says listen, so what happened was in the year 2048
 I was put on this giant
 Transportation pad and to make it so I could actually time travel. I was force fed liquor is his favorite liquor
 Honestly, he's like and I object Daniels, please go go go go go go. They don't give him like gin or something disgusting
 They force fed him liquor and the liquor is the body has to be saturated with alcohol to travel back in time
 The police are looking at each other and they're like that
 We don't know how time travel physics are going to work near 2048. All we know is that you're drunk here now
 and
 You're running around you're asking you're not
 He's adding that detail. You have laser blasters. You're shooting everyone. You're stumbling around town. You're harassing people
 You're publicly intoxicated. We're bringing you in and he is like no no you can't do that because he does have this mission
 He was sent back in time to warn about this alien invasion that's coming in the year 2018
 He was supposed to return to the year 2018, but he was sent back to the year 2017 instead
 So Jason, why are you covering the story? It seems like just a local weirdo got a little drunk hallucinating whatever
 I mean, it's not outside the realm of what I cover on this show doesn't involve aliens
 But there's a specific reason why I'm covering this story
 It's funny. It is funny and it does give us an idea of what time travel may be like
 What I thought was really interesting was that he was sent back in time to warn us of an alien invasion of the year 2018
 Now obviously it's the year 2021 it never happened
 But the people who sent him back now, this could just be his alcohol-addled brain
 But the people who sent him back were aliens
 Aliens
 Time traveled him back to the year 2017 to warn about an upcoming alien invasion
 That's been under conspiracy caps here for a second when I read that I go
 Why would aliens send back somebody to warn about them invading?
 What if aliens in the few let's let's say this in 2018 aliens invaded the planet
 It was a blowout the aliens spaceships flying around
 Dropping drop and bottles of Jack Daniels and people are like what this is the best weapon ever and they're drinking it
 And everyone's just taking big naps and the aliens are just kind of like walking into Congress and they're like
 I guess we won we didn't know humans we didn't know humans would react so poorly to our biological weapons
 We thought it well we thought it would kill them, but instead it just put them to sleep
 So it's now that you're 2048 and the aliens who've invaded Earth hate it here
 So they decide to send the most sober human back. They're like this man only has a blood alcohol content of point one three six
 They send him back in time. He runs around Casper, Wyoming. He's saying aliens are gonna invade and
 Aliens
 Also read the local newspaper of Casper, Wyoming. You didn't know that that's the only newspaper aliens read the aliens get all their information
 From the Casper Gazette some little newspaper and they can read this report and everyone laughs at this guy
 I'm not laughing at you Brian Johnson. You're a hero. You saved us
 But Brian Johnson comes back and he's like oh no don't invade the aliens send me back and the alcohol pad and all this stuff and
 Everyone laughs at him and throws him in jail, but up somewhere in recticuli seven the aliens are like
 Oh my god, did you read today's issue of the Casper Gazette?
 Of course, I did that's the only newspaper we read and they saw this and that's why the aliens didn't invade
 So thank you Brian Johnson. Thank you for saving the planet
 All you had to do is sacrifice your own liver and 48 hours in jail. You were able to
 Keep us from being taken over by aliens as we all laid around in alcoholic stupors a true
 Hellish future
 Jesse I'm gonna go ahead and touch you the keys of the carboner copter. We're leaving behind Casper Wyoming. We are headed out to
 the school of shadows
 This is where the insanity starts this is where the insanity of insanity week starts
 We're gonna take a look at a group of people
 Who have formed a new religion and I got to give a shout out to Fabio
 Nurbon he actually recommended the story he's recommended a lot of good stuff really really appreciate it
 Jesse you see that school down there and that's spooky spooky swamp. There's no roads connecting it to anything
 It's all like dark and moldy and everything like that. That's where we're going
 So hope you guys me and Jesse have on our gas masks on our PPE
 Hope you guys brought those and you came to listen to a podcast
 We're walking through the swamp we open up the school doors
 I
 Don't know why they sounded like that either don't need to I imagine they are like moldy they make a weird sound
 We're walking into the school of shadows
 This school was set up by a man on reddit
 No one is thought bought 100 and I'm I couldn't verify it, but I think we've covered him before
 We've done a lot of meth stories on this podcast
 Even starting early on if you have a so before had a meth story
 So I think I've covered him before but he created a subreddit back in February 2021 has a hundred and eighty five members
 Which is a hundred and eighty five members more than it should have
 And I'll explain why I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous, but I'll explain why
 But let's take a look at the theories here. So we walk into the school of shadows and
 We sit down in the desk. We all sit down on the same desk. It's a quantum desk
 You can hold all of us. Let's take a look at what thought bought 100 is teaching
 He has a philosophy known as the life addition theory
 Where life is about adding things life is constantly about growing as a person
 Fascinating really if you think about it, and it's quite simple
 You gain experiences. You don't really lose experiences
 You gain knowledge. I mean you can forget things, but it's not really that you forget it
 It's that you just don't have access to it anymore every life is always about addition
 So you constantly need to be adding observations to your life adding information to your life adding
 Experiences that is what the universe wants
 life is
 perception
 perception is thought thought is reality
 So
 What you perceive is reality that is the secret that is the science to getting rich that is an old
 Philosophy you can warp reality
 Through your own thoughts and if you get a bunch of people together and they agree on reality
 That is what constructs the universe. This isn't groundbreaking stuff. It's interesting. It's not groundbreaking stuff
 I hadn't heard of the life addition theory before but the idea that thoughts and reality is and we've all decided
 That's wood. We've all decided that my hand won't go through oak
 That'd be awesome if everyone on the planet just goes Jason's hand can go through oak like if everyone just believed that
 I'm just like sticking my hand pulling squirrels out of trees all day long. I'm like thanks world
 But those are all I remember hearing that type of stuff in high school. That was like high school philosophy
 So that's all well and good and I can understand where that logic is coming from
 This is where it starts to get darker. This is why it's the school of shadows and not the school of intro to philosophy
 If thought is reality and everyone's combined thoughts is what makes up the reality of the universe the shared reality
 psychosis
 bends the rules of the universe
 quote
 We believe psychosis has contributed to dismantling reality and making it more simulation
 unquote
 Which we hear a lot about in conspiracy theory today
 That we're moving to a reality that's so
 cartoonish
 That you can look at and go how are things playing out the way they are it feels like we're in a simulation
 It feels too dynamic to action-packed too full of mystery
 Like constructed mysteries. It seems like we're in a simulation rather than a random chaotic universe and
 You could say predictive programming isn't the Illuminati putting stuff in television shows to predict what they have to do because some sort of
 weird cosmic rule
 It's the opposite the universe is so bizarre now
 That it's replicating what is in the popular culture that it is a natural phenomenon
 And that's kind of what's going on here
 The psychosis is actually bending the universe and making it less real and more simulation
 So the goal of the school of shadow is to continue this process and the best way to continue this process is
 with the deities of the universe on your side
 aka the shadow people
 We've talked about shadow people a lot on this show shadow people I've had personal experiences with shadow people
 I'll put those up cut all put those episodes in the show notes
 There's a whole bunch of theories whether they're interdimensional whether they're gin
 Whether they're alien whether they're the original
 Inhabitants of hell who were pushed out when demons came down. There's a ton of different theories on these guys
 Are they ghosts are they more malevolent ghosts?
 But the shadow people you can see them when you are
 In an area where shadow people normally inhabit a haunted house a normal house
 The shadow person wants to pay you a visit another way that you can actually see shadow people anywhere
 You can be at the mayor's office. You can be talking about the upcoming alien invasion
 smoking meth and staying up
 Will allow you to see the shadow people
 I don't really think just staying up on its own will allow you to see shadow people
 But definitely a site a very well known side effect of smoking meth of meth psychosis is seeing the shadow people
 I used to follow the subreddit the meth subreddit and I
 Had a hard time telling because I also cover
 I also follow a bunch of paranormal subreddits and I would see shadow people pop up all the time in
 My reddit thread and I would have to look to see if it was a meth subreddit or if it was the truth is here or
 Ghosts or some other subreddit they talk about shadow people all the time in the meth subreddit
 But thought bot 100 has an idea here. We should worship the shadow people. They're the closest we have to real
 Gods real angels real demons are the shadow people
 That's an interesting thought because I guess I guess I should add this in now thought bot 100 smokes a lot of meth
 He does a lot of meth
 He's on a lot of the meth boards as well, and I might have mentioned that earlier
 I think I did in passing but to be specific he does smoke a lot of meth and he's very open about that
 How many people can say they've actually seen God? I can say I've seen the work of God in my life
 But I've never seen him. I mean my eyeballs are still intact. I'm not a pillar of salt
 So but I've never seen God, but you can see you can see the shadow people
 Tomorrow if you start or maybe tonight depending on how quickly you can get it if you I'm not I'm not recommending this
 But if you did start using meth and had meth psychosis, you could see shadow people don't do it. It's not worth it
 But if you had questions about faith do angels exist do demons exist you can see shadow people with the right amount of chemicals
 I'm sure with the right amount of any drug or lack of sleep you might be able to have other spiritual experiences
 But it's almost guaranteed with meth. So when you have a religion geared towards meth users
 They've all seen the shadow people. There is no faith. They've seen them. They've interacted with them
 The shadow people thought about explains that they want to be worshiped, but it's not like the traditional build a shrine kill a calf
 bow before it
 They clone you
 The shadow people clone you for two reasons
 One the first one is
 Incredibly disturbing
 I mean anyone cloning you for any reasons probably creepy, but when I read this I go that's creepy
 They clone you for two reasons one the shadow people clone you and they keep this clone
 So when and I'm gonna keep using this term over and over again. It's thought-bought 100s term. It's a catch-all term
 I'm not saying that everyone who suffers from this does this but just because I'm gonna be quoting a lot because he says it's schizophrenic
 He's constantly talking about people who are schizophrenic hear voices and I know not everyone who hears voices schizophrenic and vice versa
 But he says when a schizophrenic hears a voice in their head
 That's somebody else's clone
 So think about that for a second extrapolate that for a second was really creepy that means that somebody who is hearing a voice in their head
 Could be your voice
 Could be you
 Isn't that's creepy
 Some dude who's dealing with some sort of mental issue
 And he hears a voice telling him to do horrible things that could be your voice
 Now I'm not saying this is true. I'm not saying it's true
 But that's a creepy theory
 That's one reason the other reason is that they
 feed off of this clone
 Emotionally and this clone of you is called the ego
 And so this is how you worship the shadow people you have to go in front of a mirror and you remember good memories about yourself
 You think good thoughts about yourself you build up your ego
 And you look in the mirror and you talk yourself up you make this cloned version of you a
 shining star a
 Dazzling light in a world of darkness and it has a two-fold effect one the shadow people get more energy to eat from this clone to
 absorb from this clone and
 You start to become more like your ego
 You start to become the superior clone the superior version and the shadow people reward you with this
 Because you're giving them more energy. They will help you in your reality
 Bending quest
 Another interesting thing that thought bot points out is that almost every religion
 reveres the prophet
 But we are all prophets we all predict things every single day in our dreams
 Second rule of the school of shadows well first one is it helps to smoke meth right it helps to smoke meth
 So you can see the shadow people
 - every day look in the mirror do this multiple times a day
 Give yourself a big ego like literally talk about how great you are remember great things that you did
 Imagine yourself being great. That's giving the shadow people more energy to feed off of
 Three keep a dream journal
 Because the more you write down the more dreams you remember and the more you write down you can start to make
 connections between your dreams and
 Reality you're actually seeing the future
 Thought bot goes on to proclaim that all schizophrenics could be a prophet
 The voices that they're hearing since they're us since their actual voices their egos that are spread out across the planet
 They could be telling them your dreams that you had and it's their job to make sense of them
 Just like any prophet it is their job to make sense of the vision
 one of the quotes in
 This is quote we believe in the voices
 This is
 Deeply unsettling stuff honestly you notice I'm cracking a bunch of jokes. I find this very very unsettling for a couple reasons
 but
 We'll get into this
 I want to get into a little bit more, but yeah, I find this deep deep stuff deeply unsettling
 I think you can tell my tone has changed a bit. I definitely can tell as well
 But let's let's talk about this real quick a thought bot 100 himself is currently creating a new heaven for us a new
 Afterlife I guess I'm using the word heaven. He uses the word afterlife
 He also proclaims that he slammed meth for two years slamming is where you're injecting it so that'll be interesting
 It's always nice to know that the person in charge of our afterlife is a hardcore meth addict
 This is highly dangerous stuff that he's messing with
 It's highly dangerous and he's uncontested in this space
 This is the equivalent of
 One nation having a nuclear bomb. No, it's not even that this is the equivalent of
 One drug addict having a nuclear bomb. I
 Have never come across
 Somebody trying somebody organizing a religion around worshiping shadow people
 shadow people are
 The X factor in this whole paranormal game
 Like we can say maybe they're aliens. Maybe they're interdimensional. Maybe they're demons. Maybe they're
 Ambivalent towards the whole thing. We don't know
 They're the only X factor in the paranormal game
 We know what the alien factions want. We know what the angels want. We know what the demons want
 We know what the ghosts want. We know what the cryptids want
 But we don't know what the shadow people want
 They're like the mercenaries, you know what I mean like we don't know what their intent is
 So that means that whoever figures it out first has an edge
 And while everyone else is just kind of dismissing them or not not dismissing them
 But as everyone else is just saying maybe they're this maybe they're that we have a meth addict a a
 Self-proclaimed meth addict trying to disparage this guy. He says it himself
 Worshiping these things and building a cult around worshiping these things
 185 members now let's say 30% of them are in it for the lulz
 They just thought it was a funny thing to add on to their subreddit. That's still over a hundred people
 Who may be doing this and nobody else is
 No one else is experimenting with this they're
 Afterthoughts they're not part of the lore the mainstream. This is extrude. I am not joking
 I think this is one of the most dangerous cults we've covered on this show and we've covered cults like the Leopard Society
 That actually murders people
 still
 Deeply unsettling story deeply disturbing story when I talk about insanity week
 This is the type of thing I'm talking about like the stories are more lighthearted than this
 But this is insane and this is insanity that can actually affect us all building a new afterlife
 From a guy who's been slamming meth for two years and you're like Jason
 You don't really think he can do that
 We don't know what the limitations are of the shadow people. We don't know we know nothing about them
 We can't even agree what they are
 You hear but you're knock on the wall you can go maybe that's a ghost maybe that's the plumbing
 Da-da-da-da-da you can debate that but ghost in and of themselves we we for the most part you go they
 Are trapped here. They didn't go under the light
 They have something that they didn't finish those are small variations whether whether or not you go know they have to do this
 Those are small variations, but we know that ghosts are human
 We know that they're human spirits. We know that demons are fallen angels
 Angels are messengers of God
 These are all things that the lore
 Says we know that Bigfoot is a cryptid that lives in these particular parts of the world
 You can debate whether or not these things exist all day long, but they have an alignment
 Shadow people don't and we've covered them so many times on this show
 They are a loose cannon
 They are a mercenary group and it is extremely dangerous that the people who are communicating with these things the most are the most
 unstable of society and
 If they succeed in this goal
 If these things do work
 It's bad for everybody
 Outside of the realm of talking like outside of paranormal stuff
 Does any of this stuff make sense? No, I'm not gonna be running through the streets of Casper, Wyoming
 Getting people to shut down the school of shadows like outside of the realm of the paranormal
 It's a group of a hundred plus people who are worshiping a what they perceive to be their God or their ruler
 But when we talk about in paranormal when we're talking about this type of stuff
 This is one of the most dangerous groups. I've ever come across
 Because if they can actually alter reality they can get enough of them together and
 Use group psychosis to bend the rules of the universe
 Would we even know that it happened?
 Because it's the rules of the universe
 99.9% of us just kind of wake up each day and we know what the world was like before and we expect the world to continue like it was
 And I'm not talking about geopolitical events. I'm talking about stuff like gravity or the fact that care bears aren't real
 But if there was a shift like this
 It wouldn't be like the Mandela effect where people go
 I remember there was a cornucopia on fruit of the loom you'd wake up
 Your doctor would be a care bear and you wouldn't even think twice about it
 You'd be like dr. Hugs a lot sure is good with my carpal tunnel syndrome
 But even that would be nothing compared to an afterlife
 crafted
 by a man who suffers from meth psychosis and
 afterlife the rest of eternity
 Trapped in a reality made by a man who injects toxins into his bloodstream
 for fun
 We may wake up tomorrow in a new reality a new dimension
 Ruled over by mad men who have now ascended to become insane gods a
 World inhabited by shadow people. We are simply food sources for them
 They feed off of our light
 They feed off of our hope and
 When those are gone they feed off of our fear our
 anger or
 sorrow
 This is the new reality this is the world that the school of shadows prophesied
 It is the one they crafted it is the one they made it is the one we all now exist in
 And it is one that we can never escape from
 We called them crazy
 We laughed at them
 But in the end
 They succeeded where we failed
 Their gods came and showed themselves to the world and while the rest of humanity
 ignored them
 The school of shadows worshipped them
 Their reward was total power our
 Punishment was unending pain
