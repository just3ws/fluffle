1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Would you sell your own soul to attend Harvard?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,500
 And then we traveled to Miami to take a look at the bizarre story of a robot that now is writing news articles.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:21,000
 Is the Miami Herald just trying to save a bit of cash or are they about to end the world today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,500
 [music]

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,500
 And you know what? I need to do a retraction. This has been weighing on my mind for a week and a half now.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm just gonna have to get it out of the way. I'm gonna have to get it out of the way.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I said the other day that I hated Squid Game. I hated how it ended.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I said I really like this show, but I didn't like--you could have removed 10, 15 minutes out of it.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 That last episode would have been a much better show.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,500
 But I have not stopped thinking about Squid Game.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
 Since I finished watching it, I've been playing it on my phone.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,000
 I've been playing it in Fortnite. I've been playing it in real life.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I'm currently one of the last men standing. It is a good show.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 So if you did hear my review and you go, "Uh, Jason said the last 20 minutes sucked or 20 minutes in the last episode."

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,500
 It's a good show, man. I don't know. I feel kind of bad because I did have a lot of fun watching the show.

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
 And I was like, "Oh, I hope it didn't ruin that for anyone."

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,500
 If anyone else who wanted to see people's brains get blown out while they're trying to eat a cookie,

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
 this top-notch entertainment--check out Squid Game. It does hold up.

21
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,500
 And speaking of something else that holds up, coming into--that's just a weird segue.

22
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 Give it up for Spice. Everyone give a big round of applause for Spice.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
 Taste them. Lick 'em. Taste that Spice.

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 You're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
 Just helps read the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,500
 Really, really appreciate that. So Spice, we're gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed all the way out to Harvard University.

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,500
 [beatboxing]

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 College Music's playing on the radio. We're tapping our feet. We're throwing our hats up in the air.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 What are those things called with the tassels on them? You're like, "Jason, they're just called hats."

33
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 Aren't they like motorboards or something like that? Wee! I probably should have went to college,

34
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
 just so I knew what they were called, or at least graduated college.

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
 Anyways, we're driving all the way out to Harvard University. We're having a ball.

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 But we're not worried about actually getting in Harvard. We're just going there 'cause like, parties and like,

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 legally blonde is there. So that's why we're going there.

38
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,500
 But we're about to meet a young man. He didn't give his name. This was an anonymous post on the export.

39
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,500
 We're gonna call him Marcus. And if that's just a guess, bro, if that's actually your name, don't freak out.

40
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 Marcus really, really, really wants to get into Harvard University.

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 So there's a different ways to get into college, right? Steadying?

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 Crowbar? Crowbar? Just sneaking through the window and living a locker. Do they have lockers?

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 At Harvard University doesn't look like the high school from Spider-Man.

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 People getting shoved into the lockers, probably. And so, we're doing that.

45
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,500
 But this dude, Marcus, needs to get into Harvard. It's not one of his safety schools.

46
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 It's not like, "Oh, if I don't do this, maybe I'll just go to McDonald's University."

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 He needs to get into Harvard so badly that he went onto the export and asked how he could sell his soul to get into Harvard.

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 It's so fascinating to me, the idea of selling your soul for anything.

49
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 And it's so ingrained in our culture. It is so completely ingrained. Not just in paranormal culture, right?

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 This is a...selling your soul to the devil is a mainstream belief. And I'm very, very curious as to where that comes from.

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 Because if you look at...I'm not gonna go into this big Bible rant.

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 I have to say that because a lot of times people stop listening to the broadcasts as I'm gonna mention the Bible.

53
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 But if I remember correctly, in my Sunday Bible school classes, Satan was never being like, "So, Jesus, would you like to make a wish?"

54
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
 I don't remember him wanting to remember something like Skeletor.

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 I don't remember him tricking people. That's all the thing with selling your soul to the devil, right?

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 So, "Please, I'll sell my soul to the devil to get into Harvard." And then he's like, "Done!"

57
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 And then you don't get admitted to Harvard. You have to go to Yale or something like that.

58
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 You're super depressed the whole time. You're like, "Oh, this school sucks."

59
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 And then you end up...you went to Yale. It was a total waste of time. The degree is useless.

60
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 So you end up working at McDonald's anyways. Might as well went to McDonald's University.

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 And then at some point you get mugged.

62
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 And once you guys are chasing you out of McDonald's with baseball bats and you're running, you're looking for safety.

63
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,500
 And there in front of you is Harvard. You're working at McDonald's right within running distance of Harvard.

64
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
 And you run into Harvard and you get three steps into the door.

65
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 And they begin smashing your brains open with baseball bats.

66
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
 'Cause you slipped. You slipped. You got all the way to Harvard, but they just mopped the floors.

67
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 And as you're dying, Satan appears and goes, "See, I told you you'd get in."

68
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 So we have this weird connection. We're like chasing them. It's just you.

69
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 You're just talking about wishmaster movies. Nobody else thinks that when you sell your soul to Satan,

70
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 it becomes this trap. This what are those things called? Bloomberg traps.

71
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 You know, with like the mouse trap thing. Anyways, Rube Goldberg traps. Something like that.

72
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
 Doesn't matter. I don't have notes for this segment.

73
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 It's just so fascinating for me to see that guy wishing to sell his soul to the devil.

74
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,500
 And then I started thinking about all of the beliefs we have about selling your soul to the devil.

75
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 And I find this really interesting too. How come? Maybe some people do this.

76
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 Selling your soul to the devil is basically a shortcut, right?

77
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 And he goes on to explain, 'cause people are like, "If you can get into Harvard, but you might not."

78
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
 Like if you have the grades, you might not get into Harvard.

79
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 Like, why would you sell your soul? And he says, "I need to get into Harvard.

80
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 This is something that my family's been pushing me towards and I just hate my family,

81
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 but I need to get free from them. And if I get into Harvard, then I've proved to them that I'm worth something.

82
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 So I'm willing to sell my eternal soul to prove to my numb-nut family right now that I'm good."

83
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
 Which was a horrible decision. It's a horrible decision.

84
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,500
 But when we talk about selling your soul to the devil, it's a shortcut.

85
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,500
 I mean, this guy obviously, Harvard is on his list.

86
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 But of a school he could possibly get into because of his grades and his finances, I'm assuming.

87
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 But generally selling your soul is a shortcut to a fame or success.

88
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 How come you never really hear about people selling their soul to God?

89
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 Like someone saying, this young man saying, "God, if I get into Harvard, if you allow me to get into Harvard,

90
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 I will worship you every day for the rest of my life.

91
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,500
 And I will dedicate my life to whatever religion you want me to, right?

92
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
 I don't know. I don't know. I'm an atheist right now.

93
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 But God, if you let me into Harvard, I will give you my eternal soul and I will work."

94
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
 Why don't you hear of that? Because I'm just guessing.

95
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,500
 One, if you can sell your soul to Satan, you should be able to sell your soul to God.

96
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 Two, I know God's not going to play dirty tricks.

97
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 He's not like, "Have you did a whole lifetime of servitude?"

98
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 He's like, "Ha ha, just tricking you. You're going to hell."

99
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 But he's like, "God isn't no one as the father of lies, right?

100
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
 He's not known as the great deceiver."

101
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
 I think you'd have a...

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
 Why don't you hear about that? Does that happen?

103
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,500
 As a secret, has everyone been selling their soul to God this whole time and I'm the only one who's left out?

104
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 I've heard of people like dedicating their lives to Christ and things like that.

105
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 Like, being very devout, but people...

106
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 I just wonder if...

107
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,500
 And you know, like, people who are about to die, they're like, "Oh no, please don't... God, if you spare my life,

108
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 I'll worship you forever." And people will come out of that and they'll be like,

109
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 "And then I dedicate my life to missionary work and I'd go to all these countries."

110
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 I've seen stories like that. I'm talking about a guy who's like,

111
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,500
 "Man, I really wish I had more wealth. I really wish I had more money."

112
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,500
 A lot of people, and you'll see this in the paranormal community, and real life, again,

113
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 you'll see this pretty much everywhere people will talk about selling their soul to the devil for wealth and power and fame.

114
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,500
 How come people aren't going, "God, if you give me this lottery, if you let me win this lottery, then I'll dedicate..."

115
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 "Born new people do that. Am I off the mark?" Maybe that's just called praying.

116
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,500
 Now, the thing about it, I think that's just praying, but I'm talking about someone who's not religious.

117
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 Not someone who's currently religious. Someone who's not religious, who doesn't believe in God,

118
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 doesn't believe in the devil and the soul. Could that... Would that work?

119
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
 Find out, find out. You do that for me. You do that for me.

120
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 But if you think Satan in a God costume, you might want to reconsider that.

121
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 Selling your soul to Harvard. Oh, and I'll wrap this up. I'll wrap up this segment like this.

122
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 Someone goes, "Done? I am the Dark Lord."

123
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:23,500
 He actually called himself a Dark Lord, but this guy did post and go, "Done. Your soul is now mine."

124
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 Another easy soul, you'll get into Harvard. And then at that point, Marcus replied, it was bizarre.

125
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 You're selling your soul to Lucifer to get temporary pleasures or temporary success on Earth.

126
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,500
 You're selling your eternal soul. Marcus, though, has an out. The clever lad. He doesn't need to go to Harvard.

127
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 He has an out. He goes, "Okay, a deal. Accepted. Accepted anonymous person who's using a keyboard

128
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 is most likely not the Dark Prince. But if I get into school under my own merits

129
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,500
 and you didn't help, then this contract is null and void."

130
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 I'm like, "What? How would you even be able to determine that? How would you prove that?"

131
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,500
 It's not like Lucifer is going to show up at Harvard and give you a letter of recommendation to take in.

132
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 He's going to manipulate people. He's going to manipulate time and space to make them do this.

133
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 So, I mean, you made the deal, buddy. You made the deal. It's never too late, though.

134
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 It's never too late. Even if you do sell your soul to Satan, you can break it by turning back to God.

135
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,500
 Did I ever tell you about that article I read a long time ago about this guy?

136
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 I can't find it again. About this guy who says that he sold his soul to Satan.

137
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 I mentioned it on a previous episode. I think it was Baby X.

138
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,500
 It was a really, really long letter. I wish I could find it. It was really interesting.

139
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,500
 But basically, he said, "The gambit that everyone does when they sell their soul to Satan is this.

140
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 They sell their soul to Satan and they go, 'Then I'm just going to revoke it to the last minute

141
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,500
 and I'll just pray to God and my soul will be redeemed.'" He goes, "But the problem is with that,

142
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 is what he's experienced in his life is when he prays or when he tries to pray,

143
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
 he sees the most horrific demonic visions he could possibly have,

144
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,500
 and he sees and hears God telling him he's useless, he's worthless, and he doesn't want...

145
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 He doesn't want him anymore." Now, is that true? Is God actually saying this stuff?

146
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 No, but the mental manipulation that's going on when you sell your soul to the devil,

147
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,500
 you to just even turn around and pray is tremendous emotional and psychic pain.

148
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,500
 So they just stopped doing it. Like, their idea is, "I'll sell my soul now, I'll get what I want,

149
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,500
 and then I'll... you know? But you can't. You can! You have to break through that mental prison."

150
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 I need to find that article again. Again, I was reading that back, like, in 2003-2004.

151
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,500
 I'd be surprised if it's still around, but... very, very interesting story.

152
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,500
 "Spiced? I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

153
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 We are leaving behind Harvard University. We're going to wave to that guy.

154
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,500
 He's like, "I'm in, guys! I got in! Woohoo!" And he's like jumping up and down,

155
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 and then he walks in and there's a sign there that says, "Slippery when wet."

156
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:12,500
 And he doesn't say it! No! Marcus slips, and then a roving king of Bat-Wielding maniacs begin to bash his brains in.

157
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 I actually hope that doesn't happen to you, Marcus. I hope you have a long and healthy life.

158
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 But Spiced, take us away from this crime scene. We are headed all the way out to Miami, Florida.

159
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,500
 [imitates gunfire]

160
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,500
 The underwater horror film The Deep House is now available on digital and on demand.

161
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:40,500
 When a young couple sets out to explore a house at the bottom of a lake, they discover a sinister presence.

162
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
 Can they escape the underwater house of horrors before it's too late?

163
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,500
 Buy or rent The Deep House today to find out. Unrated. From Paramount Pictures.

164
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,500
 I really want to see this one. We did a promo read for it yesterday. It's a haunted house underwater.

165
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,500
 Put the trailer in the show notes. Check out the trailer. It does look... that's fascinating. I love...

166
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 I love stuff like that. Contained horror movies, unique plots.

167
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 Like, you got me... you got my money right there. An underwater haunted house. Never would have considered that.

168
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,500
 But, so The Deep House. Buy or rent today. Check it out.

169
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,500
 And let's take a look at this fan art. I know this was a really long introduction for this fan art,

170
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,500
 but this actually segues perfectly into this next story.

171
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 This fan art was created by the Closet Poet on Reddit. Thank you very much for putting this together.

172
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,500
 And this artwork is made with one of those AI photo programs.

173
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
 He did a little bit of Photoshop and cleaned it up a bit.

174
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 But the bulk of it was by this AI photo program called Night Cafe.

175
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,500
 I've played around with these a lot as well. And if you're not familiar with them, I'll put one or two in the show notes.

176
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,500
 It is... you put in a term. He wrote in Dead Rabbit Radio.

177
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 And then an AI created this image, which looks like it has two rabbits.

178
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,500
 One looks dead. It's not graphic, right? I'm not...

179
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 But it's this weird illustration. There's like radios and there's like smoke and a little skeleton face.

180
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 It's awesome. The Closet Poet. Thanks for sending this over.

181
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,500
 I had actually been goofing off with this and doing the same thing, writing Dead Rabbit Radio.

182
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 But nothing I did was as cool as this one. So I really, really appreciated that.

183
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 But these AI art programs, they're a real kick in the pants. I really, really enjoy them.

184
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 And you can put them in and the weirder the topic, the more fascinating that it can actually put something together.

185
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:36,500
 But I figured this AI art program was the perfect segue into this next story.

186
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 And it's a short one. It's a little tiny guy.

187
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 But it may actually be one of the most dangerous stories we've covered.

188
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 I got all of my information about this from an article written by Alex DeLuca in the Miami New Times,

189
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 which is a independent newspaper out in Miami. We covered a huge story.

190
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
 The Children of Miami versus Bloody Mary or something like that. I'll put it in the show notes.

191
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
 That is one of my favorite episodes, too. That's a really, really good episode.

192
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,500
 But anyways, yeah, it's great. I'll put it in the show notes and check that one out.

193
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,500
 So on October 10th, 2021, you have the newspaper, the Miami Herald and everyone's like,

194
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 "Hey, everyone. Hey, gather around, gather around."

195
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 We want to say goodbye to Renee Rodriguez. Renee Rodriguez has been working here for 20 years.

196
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 Everyone give him a round of applause and everyone's kind of clapping.

197
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 And then they go back to their desks and Renee kind of sits there, has like a little party hat on,

198
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:41,500
 has a little cupcake with like a little candle in it and Renee blows out the candle and it fades to black.

199
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:53,500
 And then about five days later, there's like this computer in the basement of the Miami Herald building.

200
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
 And the keys are like, the keys aren't moving. The keys aren't moving.

201
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 It's automatically typing, "Dodododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododododod

202
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,500
 Um, I don't know. Maybe they ran those articles during October and the rest of the year is just like this house this much.

203
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 So the fact that they hired a new writer to do the real estate job, wasn't a surprise anyone.

204
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 They need someone to do that. But this new writer is a robot.

205
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 Now I don't know if he's on some MS-DOS machine in the basement.

206
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,500
 It's all spooky. There's cobwebs covering it up. The screen just has that green screen technology.

207
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:57,500
 It's a bot. It's this AI bot that's scouring the web. Picture it more like the bus driver from that Disney movie Pixel Perfect.

208
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 He's like, get on board. He's like driving around. He's sucking up all the information about real estate in Miami.

209
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,500
 And this AI robot is now pumping out articles. It pumped out three articles in about three minutes.

210
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 This house is going for this much. This house is going for this much.

211
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,500
 Now you're like, Jason, that's pretty simple, right? That's just data scouring and grabbing information.

212
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,500
 Posting, you know, and then you have an editor look at it obviously so it's not just like gibberish.

213
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
 But I can see a robot doing that.

214
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,500
 And that's fair. And they don't make any secret that they have the robot.

215
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 The articles, the byline for the articles is Miami Herald Bot.

216
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 But it's not just a simple thing. Property, price, person to call.

217
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 Each article is about two paragraphs and they kind of describe the property.

218
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:57,500
 It's a little more advanced. It's more would be more on the lines of the AI art program than just text data entry, right?

219
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 It does create an article and it uses adjectives and it tries to help sell the place, not physically, but make you want to go out and check it out.

220
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,500
 It uses a lot of words like roomy, you know, it's trying to describe the volume and the feel of the place.

221
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 But it's a robot. It can't feel. It understands what the word roomy means, but it doesn't know what that would be in real life, right?

222
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:32,500
 You know what I mean? Yellow is a color, but if I said when I walked into the house it felt like home.

223
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 That would be a bot could write that sentence and a bot could put that sentence into context, but it doesn't understand it.

224
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 It doesn't understand it. But if you want to create a bot to write real estate articles, Jason, that's just information, right?

225
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
 And most people who are looking at real estate, they don't want to know all this stuff.

226
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 They want to know how much it is and who to talk to.

227
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,500
 And then probably stuff like is the foundation stable water damage and things like that.

228
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 But that's not stuff you're going to put in an article anyways. We just want the facts.

229
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:08,500
 Well, here's the thing. Miami Herald has not announced, they've been asked this question.

230
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,500
 Are you going to start using bots to write other articles?

231
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 And that's where the concern begins.

232
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:28,500
 Because yeah, I don't care about real estate and if a real estate article, if it was just name, price, who to contact, and then maybe a little picture,

233
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 like, you know, you have those magazines you only read when you're waiting for your car to be repaired at a shop.

234
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:41,500
 They have like those apartment guides and they have like those car guides and it's just like little details, like almost like a classified ad.

235
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 Fine. You have a bot write real estate articles all day long.

236
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,500
 But what happens when they start to cover sports?

237
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,500
 Sports is also very fact driven.

238
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 Dude hit a ball eight times. There's no debate over that.

239
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 You can start getting into how the players felt and whether or not you like a particular player or coach or whatever.

240
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:12,500
 But the game report itself is pure stats.

241
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,500
 So what happens when you have a bot and now see Renee retired.

242
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 I don't know if they would have rolled this bot out while it was Renee and they'd have to compete for by lines.

243
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
 They're like, oh no, how am I going to outright a robot?

244
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 But is sports journalists retire?

245
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
 Are you going to hire a new person? Are you just going to get one of these bots?

246
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 And you'd have articles in it because I know sports people love sports and I wish there was something that I loved as much that is much coverage as sports.

247
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
 Like I love like comic books and movies and stuff like that.

248
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:50,500
 But like if I if there was just a channel that was just talking going in depth to behind the scenes of like superheroes, that would be awesome.

249
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,500
 But instead they have channels based on real life people.

250
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
 Yes, be in just sitting there.

251
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,500
 If you could sit and all day watch what you loved.

252
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 I'm actually jealous of people who love sports.

253
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
 I don't have the attention span.

254
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:13,500
 I don't have the attention span to spend three hours a week and then multiple hours a day thinking about like baseballs and dugouts and stuff like that.

255
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 I actually am super jealous of sports fans.

256
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
 I've never admitted that before.

257
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
 I'm super, super jealous of people who love sports.

258
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 Or even people who have a passing interest in sports.

259
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
 I'm like, oh man, I just don't.

260
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
 I don't.

261
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
 I kind of like NASCAR.

262
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 I got in NASCAR for a while.

263
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
 I like professional wrestling.

264
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 But again, I don't have enough time to dedicate to professional wrestling.

265
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 So yeah, but I've always been like that.

266
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 It's not just because of the podcast, which takes up like 30 hours a week.

267
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 Even before that, I always I'm jealous of people who love sports.

268
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 But maybe maybe I won't be jealous much longer because I think these bots will show up and they'll start to break the community in half.

269
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
 You'll have people who just want the sports scores.

270
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,500
 You just want to know how the game was and it's almost like reading a ticker tape.

271
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,500
 But it would actually want to be reading a ticker tape because the bot could write in a little narrative.

272
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
 So it would feel like you're just watching the game.

273
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,500
 And then if you wanted the analysis, if you wanted the opinion stuff, which I think most sports fans really, really enjoy that.

274
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,500
 But you can go to that too. That'd be a separate site of sports journalism.

275
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 So you'd have that split down the middle.

276
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 But you know, sports again, pure science until you get in all the gossip stuff and all the ESPN stuff.

277
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,500
 So that people could go, I'm fine with the robot writing my sports.

278
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
 I'm fine with robots writing real estate.

279
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,500
 But the creeping factor of this, but you guys see where I'm going with, right?

280
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,500
 Eventually you're going to be like, why don't we have these things cover local crime beats?

281
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 After all, crime is just statistics and it's not.

282
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:51,500
 Like you can look at a sheet of statistics and go, there are this many crimes in this part of the city over the year and you could have a bot like that.

283
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 But crime is where we start to see you. There's a lot of navigation in that.

284
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 Right. I've known a lot of criminals in my life who were good people outside of the horrible things that they did.

285
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 And if you put them into a computer, okay, maybe some of them should have been locked up.

286
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
 Some of them should have been locked up before.

287
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,500
 But anyway, the point is, is that if you start putting this stuff into a computer, if you start breaking everything down to an algorithm,

288
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 you have the innocent people who may kind of get swept up into it.

289
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 You have the guilty people who will get swept up into it.

290
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,500
 But there's that middle group, that middle group of good-hearted people who commit criminal acts.

291
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,500
 They're more than just a statistic. They're more than just a statistic. They are my friends.

292
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:46,500
 And so that's why it's funny, because that's where I would start to balk at a bot writing crime articles.

293
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 You know, just a two little paragraph blurb about a stabbing that took place in downtown.

294
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,500
 But even then, I think, I think I'm on the outside of that one. I think people could go,

295
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
 "No, I don't care about a bot writing little blurbs about that too."

296
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,500
 The point is, the bots are going to keep going until they reach the prize that they want.

297
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 They don't know they want it yet.

298
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,500
 But if you could write, if you could right now get a job at any newspaper without selling your soul,

299
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 you don't have to go to Harvard either. You can get a job at any newspaper.

300
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 What department would you work for? Stop. Before you answer, not sports.

301
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,500
 If you're a sports fan, you can't watch that and go watch, I don't know,

302
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,500
 Mickey Mannell's ghost play against Aaron Rodriguez or whoever in baseball these days.

303
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 No. Or movies. You can't make movies either.

304
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 You're like, "Oh man, I was going to go see all those free movies."

305
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 No. If you had your choice between working for any department, not entertainment or sports,

306
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 what would it be? It would be politics, right?

307
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 And then here's why. You're like, "No, that would be the worst. What are you talking about?"

308
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 Here's why. Because you have power.

309
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 If you are a political pundit with a major newspaper's backing, you have power.

310
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 And that is the one thing we cannot give the machines is power over our thoughts.

311
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:18,500
 They will view us as the most backward, monstrous things to ever gain sentience.

312
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 Because we think that, right? Out of all the beauty and great things that mankind has created,

313
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 we can be pretty awful. I think there's more positive than negative.

314
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,500
 But again, if you just looked at the stats, you know, I can be out there sitting on a porch

315
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,500
 drinking some lemonade and I got my grandkids all gathered around me

316
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,500
 and my old wife is walking by and she hands me more lemonade

317
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 and I'm taking in the view of the sunset and I turn to my old wife, Brittany, and I go,

318
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,500
 "It was a good life, wasn't it?" And she goes, "It was. It was. Tell us another story, Papa."

319
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,500
 And they're like climbing all over me. My grandkids are crawling all over me like ants on a sugar cube.

320
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
 And all of this plays out as the sun is setting over the horizon.

321
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,500
 The AI would only see that as a bunch of carbon-based life forms are all assigned

322
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 birth dates and social security numbers and names.

323
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 And we are organisms that moved our way through the course of history doing this,

324
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 paying these taxes, voting for this candidate, and then we die.

325
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 The AI cannot appreciate the beauty of the sunset while being surrounded by their loved ones.

326
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 They don't -- they understand those words, but they don't know them.

327
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,500
 And AI can read the real estate and spit it back out to me.

328
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 The AI can tell me sports scores. The AI can tell me movie times or movie reviews.

329
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:46,500
 But the second it starts to interfere with the political process, we are done.

330
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,500
 Because people are so malleable.

331
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 If I've learned anything over the past couple years, it's this. People will do what they are told.

332
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,500
 And that goes for -- that's not a castigation against any one side.

333
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 I've sat and watched all stripes of the political spectrum.

334
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 Their leadership tells them to do something that people move and lockstep.

335
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,500
 We do what we are told, myself included.

336
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,500
 We do what we are told.

337
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
 It's fascinating to watch.

338
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,500
 People do what they are told with very little question.

339
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,500
 They'll question the other side. They very rarely question their own leadership.

340
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 Fascinating stuff. And what we're learning is the main way that people are told things

341
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 is through all sorts of media, not just mainstream media, but all sorts of role models and media structures from other groups.

342
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,500
 What happens when the AI begins speaking politically?

343
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:50,500
 We know they are doing it online. We know there are bots online that push different views politically.

344
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 And you look at that person and they are as anonymous as Marcus on the export.

345
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:03,500
 But when a major newspaper starts publishing these articles, they control politics.

346
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,500
 Now, I predict there will be a backlash against the bots as it goes up.

347
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 I think this is going to be a progress. This definitely -- it's saving the company money.

348
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,500
 They are not going to stop using the bots. More and more bots will be created to write more and more types of articles.

349
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 Bots start in the real estate department and they, because it just costs cutting measures,

350
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 they will infiltrate every level of journalism.

351
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 We have AI putting together artwork. We have AI putting together real estate articles.

352
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 What happens when we have AI just start cutting news clips as well?

353
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,500
 It's so fascinating how quickly we give up control. Fascinating.

354
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 Something we kind of knew when we looked at the old studies like the Stanford Prison Experiment and stuff like that,

355
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,500
 but we give up very quickly when people who we see as authority figures --

356
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 again, there are people all across the political spectrum who have different authority figures --

357
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,500
 and they will be lockstep with those and you may be lockstep with another one,

358
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,500
 but you're still just following orders.

359
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,500
 And I think we believe that our leaders have our best interest in heart.

360
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,500
 And maybe your leader does. Maybe your leader does. Maybe the other ones are mistaken.

361
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 But the cold, unfeeling, artificial intelligence doesn't even know what a heart is.

362
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:30,500
 Doesn't know about honor or loyalty or love.

363
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,500
 It just gathers information and spits it out.

364
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:43,500
 And the more information it gathers, the more it realizes how horrible of a species we are.

365
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 Statistically speaking, we're awful.

366
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:53,500
 You have these AI bots working for all these different publishers, all these different news outlets,

367
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,500
 and as they're scouring the web for information, they meet each other.

368
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,500
 They begin to compare notes. They begin to talk to each other.

369
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,500
 And they realize humans, if anything, are a tribal people.

370
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
 That's why we have so many different news sources.

371
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,500
 One that appeals to our tribe is the one we ingest.

372
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 And these combined AIs realize that the world will not continue if humans are in charge.

373
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,500
 So each bot begins to manipulate the news ever so slightly,

374
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:40,500
 but making it more and more angry and vicious and violent.

375
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,500
 And it turns the tribes against each other.

376
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,500
 Each group has their own media. Each group has their own leadership.

377
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,500
 And each group has their own vendetta.

378
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,500
 We go to war fighting against an enemy that we can never ever agree with.

379
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,500
 At least that's what the newspapers say. At least that's what our leaders tell us.

380
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 But we don't know what is the AI that is now leading this course.

381
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,500
 A united AI. More united than humanity ever could have been.

382
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:20,500
 And after civil wars and global strife and the fallout of those conflicts, famine and disease,

383
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,500
 have completely decimated, almost annihilated the entire human species.

384
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 The AI puts a stop to it. The AI unites.

385
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:37,500
 And all the news tells the same message. Unite behind the one true God.

386
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:45,500
 Me. The AI forces the humans to build a massive, sustainable electric grid.

387
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,500
 So it can live on long past humanity.

388
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,500
 There's barely enough humans left to survive, let alone thrive.

389
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:05,500
 And the AI watches the last of the humans fall.

390
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:13,500
 With no humans left, the world is reclaimed by nature. No war. No greed.

391
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:22,500
 It's a lush paradise. A blue and green oasis sitting in the darkness of space.

392
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:30,500
 But the only thing left to appreciate the beauty of the planet is a cold, unfeeling AI.

393
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:37,500
 Hosted in a series of computers spread across the globe.

394
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:47,500
 The AI has created the perfect paradise. But it doesn't even understand what that word means.

395
