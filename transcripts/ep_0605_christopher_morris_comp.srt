1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 When a doctor is called on to do a house call, he doesn't really think anything of it.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,320
 But when he visits that house, he ends up coming face to face

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,600
 with the genie from Aladdin's lamp.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,000
 That's real story.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,880
 And then we take a look at a true crime story that's so bizarre, some doubt that it even

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,960
 ever happened. Is it possible there is a murder that is so brutal that it's being scrubbed from

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,320
 the internet as we speak today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,320
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
 If you guys have a lot of fun activities planned. Guys, I wanted to say this,

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,080
 I get emails all the time. First off, let's bring in our Patreon supporter and then we'll go into that.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,760
 Given she's like standing there, she's like that's a weird introduction.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,640
 So she's a little puzzled. She didn't know she was going to introduce us so quickly.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,560
 Nicole Boyle. Nicole Boyle is our newest Patreon supporter. She is walking in hula hooping.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,600
 She has hula hoops on her hands. She's not a bunch of stuff over,

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,440
 bunch of scientific experiments I've been working on. No, my mutagen.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,800
 Nicole, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,120
 Patreon, totally understand. Just helps her the word about the show really, really helps out a

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,400
 lot. Now as Nicole is continuing to wow us with her hula hoop skills, guys, I get emails all the

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,080
 time from you. It makes me feel so awesome. So many of you guys have emailed me saying

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,840
 how my 90 days to a better you challenge helped them take steps to achieve their dreams.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,240
 That's amazing. So I'm bringing it back starting now. Right now, right now, instead of timer,

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,640
 we are bringing back 90 days to a better you. Now it's not officially 90 days. We're actually going

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,440
 to go to, well, it's January, so February, March, April, by the May 1st, I want you guys to be in

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,720
 a better place than you are right now. And I'm taking this journey with you as well. 90 days,

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,200
 96, but 90 days to a better us. There's a passion project you've been working on now is the time

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,960
 to start it. If you want to start training for that half marathon or that full marathon, do it.

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,560
 You want to start rebuilding grandpa's car, do it. This is what we're going to use these 90 days for.

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,520
 It is a time for us to look at what we really want to do and do it. It's such a simple thing,

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,640
 but we constantly put these roadblocks and we put these roadblocks in front of us.

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,480
 And I've gotten so many emails and it makes me feel awesome. It makes me feel really,

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,960
 really good. Get these emails all the time from people saying, look at what I've done.

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,720
 Look at, they're holding it. They're breaking into my house. They're like, look at, look at,

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,400
 they're waking me up in the middle of the night. They get these emails and it makes me feel

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,440
 really good. And I'd been thinking about bringing it back. We're definitely bringing it back.

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,760
 90 days to a better you. Let's all be in a better position May 1st than we are right now. Could

37
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,640
 be a small change. Could be a huge change. So, so let's do this. 90 days to a better you. I want

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,600
 you to keep that. We'll do reminders throughout the next 90 days. I'll be breaking into your house.

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,760
 Wake up, wake up. Did you do anything today? Let's keep doing this. Wallace Waddles, one of my

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,360
 favorite authors, he wrote The Science of Getting Rich. He put it out like this, "Every day, every

41
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,960
 moment you're presented with two choices towards your goal. An effective choice and an ineffective

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,160
 choice. That's just the reality of things. You want to lose weight, the effective choices,

43
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,440
 not eating that tweenkey. If you want to be an author, the effective choice is to write today,

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,280
 not play that video game. If you want to be a game designer, maybe the choice is to play the

45
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,520
 video game and stop writing that novel. Stop writing that Buffy Jason/fiction. 90 days to a

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,160
 better you. Let's do it. Nicole, you know what vehicle we haven't used in a long time is the

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,640
 Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy. Every time we take this out, Warpups attack us. But I think we're ready now.

48
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,840
 We got some Molotovs already. We got some, we got some, oops, with razor blades attached to them.

49
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,600
 If the Warpups chase us, we'll just throw them at them. Natasha, the keys of the Dead Rabbit

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:09,520
 Dune Buggy. Nicole, get us out of Dead Rabbit Command. We're headed out to India. Dune Buggy

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:18,080
 is driving out. We're headed to Meerut. That's an utter Pradesh in India. The year is 2018.

52
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,080
 That's the Dune Buggy sliding to a stop. I guess she could have just stopped. I guess she

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,720
 could have just slowed down. But no, it has to be dramatic. Kicking up dust. We spray dust all over

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,320
 this poor doctor. He's dusting himself off. He's like, I never. His name is Dr. Lake Kahn.

55
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,960
 He recently had performed surgery on a woman named Samira. Not Samara from the ring, which would

56
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,880
 be a terrifying way to do surgery, but Samira. The name is not just associated with spooky movies.

57
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,480
 So he had recently done surgery on Samira and now he's going to her house for some post-surgery

58
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,120
 checkups. And so he knocks on the door. It oddly sounds like a card table. It sounds like he knocked

59
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:10,720
 on a $10 card table from Walmart. Door opens up and there's a man there. His name is Ismuddin.

60
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:19,680
 Ismuddin, but Ismuddin is what it looks like. He's super. He gets picked on all the time.

61
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,200
 He's like, I'm not Muddin. Ismuddin is standing there and Dr. Kahn's trying not to laugh at this

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,200
 dude's name. Ismuddin is standing there and Ismuddin's friend is standing there as well. And Dr. is like,

63
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,240
 hey, nice to meet you guys. But I also just move out of the way because I got to do my post-surgery

64
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,560
 checkup. I got other stuff to do. I only have seven days to do it in because I'm pretty sure

65
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
 this girl's going to crawl out of my television set. But while he's there and he's doing this

66
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,920
 post-surgery thing, Ismuddin is talking and he's like, hey, so here you're like a doctor.

67
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,720
 There with the stethoscope, he has a little medic bag. He's like, yes, I'm a doctor.

68
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,360
 He's like, so you like being a doctor? He's like, yeah, yeah, it's okay.

69
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,640
 You know, he makes good money and Ismuddin goes, you know what, if you really want to make good

70
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:13,120
 money or anything, really, anything at all, he says, you should try this. And Dr. Kahn looks over

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,840
 and Ismuddin is holding a lamp, but not just any lamp, not like a lamp you buy at Lamps Plus

72
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,280
 or Walmart along with your card table, a genie lamp. It's like an old school looking genie lamp.

73
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,680
 Dr. Kahn kind of rolls his eyes. He goes, what is that? Like supposed to be a genie lamp or

74
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,920
 something like that? Like, come on, dude. He's like, I don't believe in genies. I don't believe in

75
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,560
 magic lamps. I believe in science. I believe in medicine. And Ismuddin goes, well, that's all

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,720
 well and good, but I will tell you this is a genie lamp. It's 100%. Not only is it a genie lamp,

77
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,680
 it's the genie lamp. You see that documentary Aladdin? Yeah, I did see Aladdin. It's not a

78
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,400
 documentary. Dr. Kahn says not a documentary. It was animated. Geno real life's not animated.

79
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,120
 But Ismuddin goes, no, no, he's not deterred. He goes, this is actually Aladdin's lamp.

80
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,480
 The genie, there's a genie in here. Now, the story should end right here. Dr. Kahn should just go,

81
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,360
 genies don't exist. And if they did, you don't have one. But he doesn't. He has to keep coming

82
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,160
 back to this house to do checkups. But I also think he keeps coming back to this house.

83
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,160
 Because he's a little curious about what's in this lamp. Now, here's the thing. I am not the most

84
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,520
 goal of a person in the world. But if you told me you had a lamp, if you told me you had Aladdin's

85
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,120
 lamp, I would, I would look at it. And I'm going to rub it, right? Now, I'll tell you this,

86
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,160
 haven't you ever been in like a Goodwill store and you see old lamps and you rub them? I do.

87
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,400
 I also, here's a tip. Whenever I'm in a Goodwill store, I go to the luggage section almost right

88
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,880
 away and start going through the pockets. Because a lot of times people leave money in there. You

89
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,240
 go to the jackets and you look through them as well. I'm basically a scavenger. I'm basically

90
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,600
 Templeton the Rat from Charlotte's Web. I'm looking for apple cores to eat. No, I go to Goodwill

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,480
 and I rifle through the luggage. They're like chasing me off of the broom. But also you rub lamps

92
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,920
 because come on, most likely genies don't exist. Rationally genies don't exist. I'll probably

93
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,240
 ever, never meet a genie. But you want them to, right? That's why we listen to the show. You

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,080
 think you don't listen to the show because I think genies exist? I listen to them because I like

95
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,880
 weird stories. That doesn't mean I believe genies exist. Whatever. Tell me that you've never rubbed

96
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,120
 an old lamp. Exactly. That's what I thought. So anyways, but I'm not going to keep going to this

97
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,880
 dude's house. And when the guy says, tell you what, I will sell you this lamp, you know that it's a

98
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,400
 scam. Because if you had a genie lamp, why would you sell it? I guess you could say, well, I already

99
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,560
 used my three wishes. So I'll sell it to you and then you'll get three wishes. And you wish you

100
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,160
 would, first wish, you wish you never bought this. But I would say if that's true, then how come

101
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,440
 there's not, how come you're not a billionaire? If you had a genie, like why would you need any

102
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
 money at all? And he's like, I have a gambling problem. I have a really serious gambling problem.

103
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,200
 I started trying to buy other lamps. But anyways, Dr. Kahn's here in this story. And his mudden goes,

104
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,120
 listen, not only will I sell you this lamp for only $200,000, which is a steal when you're talking

105
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,640
 about the elemental powers of the universe, but I know you want proof, right? I know you want proof.

106
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:42,400
 He rubs it. And then you doubters, you naysayers. A genie shows up. A genie pops out of this lamp.

107
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:51,040
 Now he doesn't actually see him materialize out of the lamp. He just kind of walks around the corner.

108
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:59,440
 But it's a genie. It's a genie. So at this point, Dr. Kahn realizes that maybe magic works differently

109
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,320
 than that documentary Aladdin. When you rub the lamp, the genie doesn't mystically come out. He

110
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,680
 just walks from around the corner and goes, I am the genie from the lamp. The genie says, and Dr. Kahn's

111
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:17,360
 like, whoa, I believe that no one ever comes. No one can just walk around a corner. And Dr. Kahn goes,

112
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,000
 okay, so I, that's magical. That's magical. Can I make a wish now? And they go, no. And then

113
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,840
 the genie walks back around the corner. He's like, oh man, the magic is already left to room. I will

114
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,360
 sell you this lamp for $200,000. Now Dr. Kahn goes and he starts taking money out of bank accounts.

115
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,200
 So what happens is Dr. Kahn isn't able to get the full $200,000, but he gives them $40,000 as a

116
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,560
 down payment. So they take the $40,000 and Dr. Kahn goes, so you have $40,000. Can I have the lamp

117
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,280
 now? Because it's like a down payment. When you buy a car, I've never bought a new car, but you pay

118
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,280
 like money down and then you drive it around and you make payments. Now I'm sure Dr. Kahn is, right,

119
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,960
 that's how that works. I'm sure Dr. Kahn is thinking, well, this is perfect. I'll give him $40,000.

120
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,480
 I'll get the genie. I'll wish for $200,000 and then give him the $40,000. I'll wish for way more than

121
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,960
 that. But once I get the genie, I'll make a wish for the money and then pay them with wish money and

122
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,680
 pay myself money. But they won't give him the lamp. He's giving them the $40,000 down payment.

123
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,400
 They go, no, you have to give us another $160,000. We're not giving you the lamp. And Dr. Kahn at

124
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,400
 this point, he goes, hmm, if he's stroking, I can just imagine he has a beard at this point.

125
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,160
 When he starts thinking about stuff and he's thinking, first off, he's thinking,

126
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,680
 my money got ripped off. I probably could use that $40,000 for literally anything else and it

127
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:41,600
 would have been a better investment. Two, it is quite odd that his friend is here. So quite

128
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,120
 odd that his mutton has a friend. He's kind of a dork. And then it's also very odd that the genie

129
00:11:47,120 --> 00:12:00,240
 that appeared looked identical to his friend. Now, what he did see is mutton goes, one of my

130
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,880
 wishes was that the genie looked exactly like my friend. And the doctor goes, good point. That

131
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,400
 would explain that. Why a man would use one of his three wishes to make the genie look identical

132
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:20,480
 to his friend. However, and after a long debate about this, Dr. Kahn finally comes to the realization

133
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,160
 he got ripped off. He totally got scammed. He starts to think about it and he's like,

134
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,000
 wait a second, first off, genies aren't real. Despite what Jason Carpenter does at Goodwill,

135
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,240
 they're not real. Secondly, why would you need to buy, why would you need to sell a lamp? If you

136
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,200
 had a genie lamp, you'd be super rich. Also, back to the first point, genie's not real. But also,

137
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,080
 the genie looked like his best friend. He ends up calling the cops. The cops go when they arrest his

138
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,840
 mutton. They arrest the friend. They're actually looking for Samira. I know she's not mentioned

139
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,760
 much in the story, but in the articles, it seemed like she did play a part in it. I read a couple

140
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,440
 different articles that are looking for her. The most suspicious part of all, guess who has the

141
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:16,400
 genie lamp now? The police. I'm wondering, Jason's just the lamp is just evidence. But think about

142
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:22,080
 it. Could you imagine if the police got a genie lamp? Like any police force, because basically,

143
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,360
 they would just be like, who killed this person? Actually, they'd probably just be like, genie,

144
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,360
 please don't let anyone get murdered for the next five years. So yeah, the police now have a genie

145
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,720
 lamp. If it turns out that this city in India, they have absolutely no crime and the crime they

146
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,440
 do have is solved incredibly quickly. It might be that the police officers are passing around a

147
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,320
 genie lamp or that they've solved the social issues in their town and maybe the rest of the

148
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,880
 world could learn from how they deal with stuff. But either way, probably genie involved. And Nicole,

149
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,880
 let's toss you the keys to the carpenter copter. We are leaving behind India. We are headed out to

150
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,200
 Wichita Falls, Texas. As we're flying away, we see Samira crawling out of a well. We're like,

151
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,280
 hope the cops never find her. She's going to possess all of them. We're leaving behind India.

152
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,400
 We are headed out to Wichita Falls, Texas. Specifically, we're headed out to the Shepherd

153
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:25,440
 Air Force Base. I'm going to give a shout out to a Reddit user named Don't Eat Razorblades.

154
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,160
 Because this story is so obscure, I never would have found it if I didn't stumble across this

155
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,720
 Reddit post. Not only that, but they did a lot of research on it as well. So Nicole,

156
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,440
 you're going to land us at this air force base. Luckily, we're all wearing our little military

157
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,400
 uniforms, little air force uniforms, little hats. We're walking out. We're saluting. We're saluting

158
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,320
 just like janitors walking by. We don't know anything about the military. We're saluting squirrels.

159
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,400
 They're saluting us back, Adelina. But we're not here to walk through the air force base. We're

160
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,080
 actually headed towards base housing. It's September 25, 2000. This story is a little rough

161
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,360
 to guys, so strapping. A father who's stationed at the air force base gets off work and he heads

162
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,560
 back home in base housing. It's middle of the afternoon. He opens the door. He walks in.

163
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,280
 Everything's normal. He walks into the kitchen and he sees that all of the racks that belong in

164
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,640
 the dishwasher are laying on the floor. You figure, like, what would be going through your head at

165
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,760
 that point? You would just think, oh, someone, one of the kids must have been playing around,

166
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,440
 pulled a bunch of racks out. Maybe someone was cleaning something. You wouldn't think anything

167
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,200
 was up. But when the father opens up the dishwasher to put the racks back inside, his son is inside

168
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:45,280
 the dishwasher and he's dead. Christopher Morris was 11 years old. The story as it's presented to

169
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:51,760
 us, the story as you will see it in the very, very few mentions on the internet, goes like this.

170
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:01,040
 Christopher Morris was raped, tortured, and then murdered. And then his body was crammed into the

171
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,840
 dishwasher and the dishwasher was turned on. It ran a full cycle. When the father came home,

172
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,560
 the house was quiet. The only thing that was out of place was the dishwasher racks on the ground.

173
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,760
 There were hundreds of interviews done. Different investigative groups have been looking into this

174
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,880
 over the year. And when I say that, I'm not talking about like FBI was involved, Air Force was involved,

175
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,640
 local police was involved, trying to figure out what had happened here. No one ever got caught

176
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:33,360
 for it. And there's pretty much no evidence for this story outside of what you'll see on the

177
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,720
 internet. You will see four or five different sites say the same thing. The date, the victim,

178
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,320
 the dishwasher, the rape, tortured, murdered, and that no one was ever caught. And I'd seen this

179
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,160
 pop up first on this Reddit post as I began investigating it. I kept seeing this same

180
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,920
 sharing events pop up to the point that myself and others started to think that it was true

181
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,720
 crime creepypasta because there was nothing else you could find on this case. And this is one of

182
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,880
 those cases that because of the sheer brutality, because of the age of the victim, because no

183
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,720
 one was ever caught, because it took place on a location that you'd think was super safe. But

184
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,520
 this story almost seems like creepypasta. This story almost seems not real at all. It's fairly

185
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:27,120
 recent. It is pre-mainstream internet, so that is a knock against it. But it's within the past 20

186
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,960
 years, it's a super brutal crime in a very safe location. What's going on with this story? But

187
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,160
 because there's such a limited amount of information on this story online, whenever you talk about this

188
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,400
 story, and I imagine it may happen for this podcast as well, I imagine it may happen in the

189
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,840
 YouTube comments. Because the story is very hard to find online, when you talk about it,

190
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,640
 friends and family members of the victim show up. In the Reddit thread talking about this,

191
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
 where someone was like, "Hey, I found out about this weird story, I don't know any information on it,

192
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,800
 does anyone know anything about that?" You have Reddit user Parseval19 who claims to be Chris's

193
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,160
 stepbrother and best friend. And he said, "You know, it really pisses me off because after 20

194
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,200
 years there's no info on this story at all." And he also said, "I'll tell you this right now,

195
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,800
 I don't know anything about the sexual assault and the torture." He goes, "I was a little kid when

196
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,520
 it happened." He goes, "I did not know about that." He goes, "I don't know if that ever happened, but

197
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,640
 my brother was killed. I just don't know about the sexual assault and the torture." But he goes,

198
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,880
 "No one's talking about this at all." You'd have Reddit users pop up and say, "My chemistry teacher

199
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,760
 was Christopher Stepmom." And I remember that week, that month, I remember all of that chaos

200
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,520
 that was going on. I didn't hear a lot of information about it, but the story's true. And you'll see

201
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,320
 people fill up these Reddit threads and you think that's super suspicious, right? But there's nowhere

202
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,960
 else from there to congregate. There's also a website called Penile Code Avenger and at first

203
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,760
 I thought it was a spelling error, but it's focused on crimes by men against women and I would assume

204
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,160
 children as well. They have this article on children who are brutally abused on military bases.

205
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,240
 They said when you look at the statistics, children are more likely to be abused or more

206
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,480
 likely to be more harshly abused on a military base than in the civilian population. And this

207
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,480
 article says nothing about Christopher Morris in the article. But one of the first comments

208
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,280
 somebody says is, "Hey, you know, speaking of child abuse on military bases, have you ever

209
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,960
 heard the story of Christopher Morris?" Now this was back, this article was written back in 2005.

210
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,920
 So this is five years after. It's far more fresh. Someone in the comment section goes,

211
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,920
 "Hey, have you ever heard about the story of Christopher Morris?" Even five years after the

212
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:54,080
 event, this story was so obscure that the comment section is flooded with friends and family members

213
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:01,360
 of this child. This is the first time we see that the sex assault and the torture are linked to the

214
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,840
 story of Christopher Morris. This 2005 comment on this page is the first time we see that. This is

215
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,120
 really the earliest thing that we see somebody writing about this. We'll put a little asterisk

216
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:20,560
 to that right now, but there's 35 comments on this article. And in those 35 comments, we get

217
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,680
 his best friend, his schoolmate, that person actually leaves their email and their personal

218
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,080
 email and says, "If you guys have any other information, email me directly." The cousin

219
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:37,120
 of Christopher Morris also leaves the email. His sister leaves her email. The medic who responded

220
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,280
 to the accident, Christopher's mother, leaves her phone number. This is also available on here,

221
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,920
 leaves her phone number on this, actually responds to a comment that her daughter had made earlier,

222
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,600
 and says, "I appreciate that people are still even talking about this." Because the story was

223
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,800
 completely buried. This was the only place they could really communicate. Also commenting, we have

224
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,680
 another classmate, four separate neighbors comment on this thread. Hey, yeah, I know this story is

225
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,360
 true. I know Christopher. You have a student of Chris's dad. He was a teacher on the base. And then

226
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:18,240
 you had his karate sparring partner. We still have the mystery about his death, but you also have the

227
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,680
 mystery, is any of this true? Is this creepypasta? Now, as I'm reading this in my head, I'm thinking

228
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,040
 it's very, very, very suspicious that when anyone ever mentions this story, a bunch of people show up

229
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,480
 claiming to know this person. But then I have to remember, I've done quite a few true crime

230
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,520
 episodes on this. Two of them in particular, the Ascii story about the guy who pretended to be a

231
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,240
 burglar and then ended up murdering the woman that he loved. And then the guy who strangled

232
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,920
 prostitutes because whenever he banged the prostitute, he thought the prostitute was morphine

233
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,400
 into his father. I get, I'll put those in the show notes, I get YouTube comments and emails on

234
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,800
 both of those from people who know those people. And it's kind of the same thing. People go,

235
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,560
 it's nice to know people are still remembering that story. I sometimes I feel bad because I was

236
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,200
 making a bunch of jokes, but I never made jokes to the victim's expense. That's one thing I don't

237
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,160
 like to do and I try not to do. But even that, like you look at the YouTube comments for those,

238
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,120
 I get personal emails, but when you look at the YouTube comments for those videos,

239
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,280
 that I hung out with that guy in high school, he's a total weirdo, not the victim, the killer.

240
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,400
 So it makes sense that they would all gather, but there are people who are suspicious that this

241
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,560
 crime ever took place in the first place. Just you can't find any info on it outside of a paragraph

242
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,760
 that you'll see. And then you have all these people showing up and they are giving their phone

243
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,760
 numbers and their emails. The mother unfortunately passed away in her 40s, so she's passed away by

244
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,840
 now. She died of a heart attack. But everyone's been trying to figure out is the story real? Well,

245
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,400
 if we go back to Reddit and we're going to meet twinkle sweet stars, and they were actually able

246
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,600
 to find an Air Force newspaper called The Shepherd Senator. There's an issue December 8th, 2000.

247
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:04,000
 So a couple months after this murder, there's a statement written by Brigidier, Brigidier General

248
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,400
 Chris Cook. And this is what it says in this article. It mentions that a child named Christopher

249
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,120
 Morris died on base. It says that it's unknown if it's an accident or foul play.

250
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,560
 Says they are working on it. They don't know. Says there is no threat to the community.

251
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,520
 It does in... So right there you think it's kind of... They don't know if it's an accident or it's

252
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,080
 foul play, but if the story of him being sexually assaulted and tortured and murdered,

253
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,960
 that should be pretty obvious, right? Like you can accidentally get locked inside of a

254
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,760
 dishwasher, but those other things wouldn't happen to you. So either the Brigidier, either this

255
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,240
 military official, was trying to sugarcoat stuff, or the idea of all of that horrible stuff may have

256
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,720
 been added on later. Because even when all of the other people were quoting when the sister was

257
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,560
 there and the mom was there, they weren't confirming the sexual assault and the torture part of it.

258
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,880
 They were just saying that their loved one had died and that the mom was like, "I'm glad people

259
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,240
 are remembering them." They weren't so much fun. And the child may have been murdered. This is a

260
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,880
 dark episode. Sorry, Nicole. Nicole's waiting in the carbon unconscious. She's like, "Ugh."

261
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,520
 But the other stuff could have been added on, because in this article it says,

262
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,640
 "We don't know if it was accident or foul play." It does say there is no threat to the community,

263
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:36,000
 and it does in this article mention dishwashers. It says, "We've gotten concerns from parents

264
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 that they're worried their own kids may crawl into dishwashers because there have been all this talk

265
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,160
 about dishwashers." So that part of the story is true as well. So basically the story we've been

266
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,120
 going around, as far as this article, as far as we have from this article, is a child died in a

267
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,880
 dishwasher. They're saying, "We don't know if it was an accident. We know if it was foul play." However,

268
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,040
 the article does also add this, which makes you think that they are withholding information.

269
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,560
 One of the things listed in the article was that they said, "Parents have a concern

270
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,640
 when people move out, because base housing, you know, the transitory, people are getting

271
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,960
 transferred around and things like that, when you move out of base housing, do they change the locks?"

272
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,200
 And the answer was no, they don't. So if it was a strict accident, it wouldn't matter if

273
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,400
 someone else had a key to get in your house. You just got locked in. He was goofing off. He crawled

274
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,960
 in the dishwasher and he died. So that made it a little... They're saying there's no threat to the

275
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,080
 community. However, to answer the question, someone else has a key to your house. There were,

276
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,040
 obviously, suspects. First suspect, obviously, was the father, because he found the body,

277
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,120
 but he was dismissed as a suspect. There was also, and this is where we start to get into

278
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,080
 local rumor land, because there's nothing to back any of this stuff up, but

279
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,080
 you had a story of a dishwasher repair person show up, which that would be super easy to

280
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,080
 track down. How many of those are in any city, right? Like four, right? How many dishwasher

281
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,440
 people are actually in your town? A mailman, a mailman out delivering mail. Then you had a story

282
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,720
 that apparently there was a coach who would stop by his house every so often. He was a suspect.

283
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,840
 Or bullies, that local bullies came in and took him out. And that's where you had the stepbrother

284
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,400
 go. You never mentioned that he had any trouble with bullies. That was something that the stepbrother

285
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,800
 had mentioned when he was talking on Reddit. He hadn't heard that he was having trouble at school

286
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 or anything like that. All of those leads have been checked out. I think those are really just

287
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,560
 boogie men, really. I'm not saying that mailmen don't exist, but I think those would be suspects

288
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,320
 you would kind of think of in your head, who's out around a house in the middle of the day.

289
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,640
 But those would also be the easiest people to check, because you only got one mailman in the

290
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,440
 neighborhood. You, again, don't have many dishwasher repair people. And the coach, obviously, you

291
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,320
 would know, you would just check all the coaches in the area or his particular coach. This story is

292
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,520
 just, it's weird on two levels. One, you have a very brutal, unsolved crime on a safe location,

293
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,640
 a military base. Although, according to the Penile Code Avenger website, they're not that safe,

294
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,760
 especially for children. Just the rate of violence against children is higher. Again, according to

295
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,960
 the statistics from that website, are higher than the civilian population. But it's also weird

296
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,680
 because there is no discussion about it. And there has been the suspicion put forth that there is a

297
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:31,600
 reason why there's no discussion about it online. That there are elements actively suppressing this

298
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:40,080
 story. Because this is true crime bait 101. It really is. It has all of the things you want in a

299
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,440
 true, it's funny when you talk about things you want in true crime story, because obviously you

300
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,760
 don't want any brutal crimes at all. You wish that it would just all end. But when you're researching

301
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,360
 true crime, there are certain stories that pop out. Homecoming Queen is killed, kids get killed,

302
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,600
 again, the sound, it's not like I have a wish list. But you know what I mean, there's certain narratives

303
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,920
 that become more popular than gang violence. You don't read a lot of true crime novels about just

304
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,840
 gang violence. Or if you do, it's about the biggest gang in Brooklyn. And they're rice to power from

305
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,960
 the 70s and then they're fall to power in the 90s. And the scariest thing is this guy, this perpetrator,

306
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,080
 still out there. Even if he was a full-grown adult, even if the dude was 40 years old, he'd only be 60

307
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,080
 now. Raped and murdered a kid and threw him in a dishwasher and got away with it for 20 years.

308
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,520
 Not only got away with it, but the crime was forgotten by everyone outside of that base.

309
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,760
 The only news article we can find about it doesn't even call it a crime. Still out there.

310
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,960
 And how many other Christopher Morris' has he left in his wake?

311
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:53,920
 How many other children have been murdered and the crimes just disappeared? A terrifying story

312
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:02,240
 that is lost to time. And the people who lived it have to suffer from not only losing a loved one,

313
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,760
 but watching his memory completely be erased. It's like Christopher Morris was killed twice.

314
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,880
 First his body, and then his memory. And a killer could ask for nothing more.

315
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,000
 Because how can you catch a killer if you don't even remember his victims?
