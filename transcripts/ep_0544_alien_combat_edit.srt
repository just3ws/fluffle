1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Two friends out for a night drive see a ghastly figure standing at the side of the road.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 What are the ramifications of technology being used to bring the dead back to life?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we take a look at the story of two roommates who are getting ready to go to sleep.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 They thought they were going to have peaceful dreams.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Instead, they found themselves separated by force fields in a world where the laws of physics no longer apply.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had an awesome week.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today, so we're going to get started.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 First off, coming in through the door like the entrance of a WWE wrestler's fireworks going off.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Emmanuel Martinez. Emmanuel Martinez is our newest Patreon.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I should introduce people like, why is he walking in like a WWE guy?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 He's just like some dude walking around. He's a Patreon supporter.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Thank you so much Emmanuel for supporting the show.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot of this episode.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Really, really helps out a lot. After the fireworks are all done and Emmanuel's done posing.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I'm going to toss him the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're going to go for a little drive.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 We're headed out to Roberts Road. That's in Chicago, Illinois.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I was recently told I was pronouncing it wrong by horrible night to have a curse.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Threatened to put his head through the wall if I mispronounced it with the S one more time.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I was tempted because I like heads going through walls.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Emmanuel, we're going to start tailgating this car down this lonely dark road called Roberts Road.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 It's February 1992 and it's 3 a.m. The witch's hour. It's not really,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 but we'll just pretend that's the spookiest hour. I think the spookiest hour is like 4 a.m.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Because everyone's asleep then, right?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Like at 3 a.m. people are still kind of partying and stuff like that, but like 4 a.m., 5 a.m.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 There's not even garbage men on the roads. It's usually when the cops are changing their shift too.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 So if you really want to get some mischief going, between 4 and 5 is the best time to do it.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 We're driving down this road and there's two guys driving in front of us.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 This was actually a call into the show Coast to Coast AM.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Someone told this story. We're going to call this guy Cole, the driver of the car.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 We're going to name him Cole. He's driving with his buddy down the road, down Roberts Road.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And they see someone standing on the side of the road, which isn't odd in and of itself.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 There are people standing by roads right now probably, but as they start to get closer to this figure,

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 they realize something. He's holding a lantern.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Now that's odd. If you ever see someone with a lantern and you're not in an Amish country,

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 you're probably looking at a ghost. And that's what they see.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 That's the only reason why you'd hold a lantern.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 They see this ghastly figure at the side of the road holding a lantern out.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 While they're looking at this arm, they see that the arm holding the lantern is bandaged up.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Bloody bandages hanging. Imagine Super Spooky Music playing right now.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Bloody bandages just trailing off of his arm and it's holding this lantern.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 They're like, "You should probably hold it with his other arm since that one's obviously injured."

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 They're driving closer and the figure starts to move across the street.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And it's walking in a bizarre fashion because it only has one leg.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Its mouth is wide open.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 This figure walks across the road. Now I don't know if he's hopping. There's a couple things that I'm wondering.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Well actually, I'll finish the story first.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 This guy's walking across the road on one leg and they drive past him.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 But the figure is continuing to walk as they're slowing down.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Now they're looking in the rear view mirror.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 There's another car behind him and they see that car drive right through him.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And then there's another car behind them and that car drives through him as well.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And then he slowly walks across the street and disappears into the darkness.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And across the street was a cemetery.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Now I know what you're thinking. Jason, first though, you really are just telling Arlsteins stories at this point.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 It's really, really hard to find a super good ghost story.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 That's always been one of my big struggles on this show.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So this is one of those. I would have preferred someone to get possessed or to wake up and be covered in bloody bandages

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 or find out they were the bandages all along. Plot twist.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 But really it's just this super gross phantom walking across the street.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I've always been intrigued. A long time listeners of the show know this. I've always been intrigued by ghost physics.

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So if the ghost only has one leg, there's no mention of a crutch.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Was he hopping across the road? Did it look like he was walking on two legs but you can only see one?

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 How did that work? Was he floating like Casper? Was it Casper?

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Was Casper accounted for at 3 a.m. in 1992 in August? Where was he?

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 All sorts of stuff to go on. Now obviously him crossing the street and going into the graveyard.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 That's pretty cliche. Cars, multiple cars passing through him is interesting.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 It would make me think if it was a trick of the light anytime he introduced a new element into the environment.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 The reflection of the light is going to change.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 So let's say that it was morning dew or yeah, it would be 3 a.m. morning dew on their windshield or it was raining or something.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 It was causing some sort of smudge.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Once they're looking out their back window, they shouldn't have seen it if it was some sort of optical illusion.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And every time more metal passed through the apparition, had it been an optical illusion, it should have dissolved at that point.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Anytime he introduced a new element, like if you have a sunbeam coming into your house, which I often do,

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 and then it hits the hardwood floor and then hits me in the eyeball, I have to cover up the light beam,

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 the sunbeam, with a blanket that I throw on the hardwood floor.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I guess I could shut my window, but I throw a blanket on the floor so the beam can't get me anymore.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 I introduced a new element. So the fact that other cars are passing through this makes me...

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I mean, the guy could be making it up, but let's assume that he did experience something.

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 The fact that other elements are moving in the story makes me believe that he saw this thing.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Outside of him just making the story up for attention. You know what I mean?

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Like, it wouldn't be a mistake and identity at this point.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 A creepy ghost story. I'll give it... This is a new thing I'm going with.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I would give it 7 out of 10 booze. Like little ghosts. Imagine little cartoon ghosts.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Could be scarier. The bandage man could have appeared in the back of his seat.

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 He could have appeared in his seat. He could have turned out that he was the bandage man all along.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 He could have done a lot of other stuff, but I guess if I'm...

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Aurel Stein can actually make stuff up.

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 If I'm telling the story as a story, it's pretty spooky. No one likes driving around roads at night.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 That's spooky. Blood, bloody ghosts are always spooky. Ghost physics always spooky.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 So 7 out of 10 booze. That's the only time I'm ever going to use that segment.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Emmanuel, let's fire up the Dead Rabbit Durgeable. We're going to leave behind Roberts Road in Chicago.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 We are headed out to a computer laboratory.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Durgeable is flying over. Nerd headquarters. We land on the roof.

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 We're kicking over their air conditioning vents so all their servers overheat.

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 What? No, they were like that when we came up here. They're like, "Dude, there's obviously...

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 We heard you kick any. We have security cameras." We're like, "Ah, I should have kicked those too."

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 After we get detained by security and then we're able to talk our way out of that,

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 we're walking around this computer laboratory and we're going to meet a bunch of eggheads.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 They're sitting on there. They're like running all these algorithms and stuff.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And we're like, "Hey, what's going on?"

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Did you just try sabotaging? No, no, no. That was the other guy. That was Emmanuel.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 He's still detained. He's still locked up. We pinned him for it.

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Anyways, we're talking to these guys and this is this interesting story.

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 This is actually recommended to me by John from SCAR. Thank you so much for the recommendation.

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 When we had that shooting at Stoneman Douglas, the high school in Florida, it was obviously a tragedy.

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I don't remember the exact amount of death, but it doesn't matter.

113
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Like one or 17, I think anyone is too much. That's horrible.

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 You're going in there to learn some idiot comes in with a gun and starts shooting the place.

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It doesn't matter if it was one or a thousand. It's horrible any other way.

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And obviously you have families grieving from this.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Recently, the parents of Joaquin Oliver, he was one of the young men who was gunned down that day, murdered.

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And so Joaquin Oliver is, he's passed away during the shooting.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And his parents, working with Unfinished Votes Campaign, have created a one minute long,

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 for lack of a better term, deep fake video of their son saying,

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 "Hey, I died two years ago. Here's what you can do to prevent more deaths."

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Now, the technology is amazing. I obviously never knew the young man while he was alive.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 So I don't know how accurate it is, but it looks and sounds like a real person.

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I don't, apparently they took video footage of him or took, you know how they normally make deep fakes,

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 is they take video footage, they take photos, you need like a thousand frames of one person.

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And then you can lay them over somebody else and this looks incredibly authentic.

127
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I don't, personally speaking, it's kind of being played, they released this and it's kind of being played up like,

128
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 "How dare this family do this to their son who's passed away?"

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 If the son agrees with what he's saying, like if when he was still around and they were talking as a family,

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 and he was like, "Yeah, yeah, I can't believe, you know, like these laws are allowed and stuff like that."

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 If it was something the son agreed with, I personally don't have a problem with this family using their son in this way.

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 I don't have a problem with that. What my concern is, is where this technology can lead.

133
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 So now we're in the same laboratory, it's eight months from now.

134
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And the same dudes are working, they all have eight months worth of stubble, they haven't left the building,

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 they're working on all their equipment, we're like, "Hey, so what are you working on now?"

136
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And they go, "Oh, dude, check this out." They hit the play button.

137
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And we see a man, he's like 65 years old, he's standing there and he goes,

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 "You know, I didn't believe that COVID-19 was a problem.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I was one of the guys outside, spitting people's faces and coughing and doing all sorts of crazy stuff, and look at me now."

140
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And then they show this image of the 65-year-old man get bloated and stuff like that, and then he's a big old purple corpse,

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 and he goes, "I should have listened to the experts."

142
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 We're like, "What? Who made that?" And the computer technician goes,

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 "Oh, well, you know, his family had a big divide about how to deal with COVID-19, and he didn't agree with it."

144
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And so he went out and he went to the big town spitting festival, was spitting in people's faces.

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It wasn't really a festival, he just like, spitting people's faces.

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And he got it and he died, and the family wanted to basically send this message that this is what happens

147
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 if he's spitting people's faces. And we're like, that's a weird example, but that's where I could see this technology going,

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 is being used to penalize the dead.

149
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Again, this kid, he may have been an avid gun control kid, right?

150
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He could have totally been against guns, and the family's like, "Oh, no, he believed this anyways."

151
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It's this application, or imagine this. You have a young man who is sitting there and we're watching this video,

152
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 and he goes, "Shouldn't it have been gay? Shouldn't it have been gay?"

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I went out, I went against my parents' wishes, I went out, started doing all this stuff, and I'm dying.

154
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And as the video progresses, he's getting more and more emaciated, he dies of AIDS.

155
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 That is where I think we'll see this technology next. I think it'll be used to penalize the dead.

156
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I think we'll see that very, very shortly. I think we will see people be penalized for their decisions

157
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 after they die via this technology. That's the creepy part of it.

158
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 We already have something like that anyways, where when people die of COVID-19,

159
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 have you ever gone to any of their Facebook pages? Because it'll be in the news when someone doesn't believe

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 in the virus or says it was a hoax or whatever they're saying, and they die of it.

161
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 There will be articles being like, "This guy a week ago said it was fake on Facebook, and now he's dead."

162
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 They'll post the Facebook post, they'll have the dude's name, you go find his name,

163
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 and it's people talking trash on the dude's Facebook page about him not believing in the virus and dying of it.

164
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 The implication is if he had followed every recommendation, he would still be alive.

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 We know that's not true. We know people who do follow every recommendation who pass away.

166
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 I follow every recommendation. I'm very, very safe. I try to keep myself as safe as possible with COVID-19,

167
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 but we already see people penalizing the dead. And I saw it as myself as a kid during the AIDS crisis.

168
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 When people died of AIDS, it was their fault. I remember that growing up.

169
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 We see the same thing with lung cancer, too. When someone passes away of cancer,

170
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 the first question somebody asks, because you have a loved one who has lung cancer or is suffering from cancer,

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 the first question people ask is, "Oh, did they smoke?"

172
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 We have a tendency to blame the sick and the dying anyways.

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And I think this technology, while being used by this particular family, may be fine,

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 because if that's what they agree on and that's what he agreed on, then whatever, then that's fine.

175
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 But I think it'll be used to penalize the dead.

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 I think very, very shortly we will have people who are dying of stuff and we'll see videos of them saying,

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 "Oh, I shouldn't have eaten at McDonald's all the time. Look at my big fat bloated corpse.

178
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I should have eaten in Subway instead. It's a commercial for Subway."

179
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 We're going to see that, unfortunately.

180
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 "I mean, well, we are leaving behind this scientific laboratory. Let's call in that carpenter copter.

181
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 We are headed out to a place not disclosed."

182
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I just looked at my notes. There's no location.

183
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 [imitates car engine] Flying around for about three years until we finally find this. This also takes place in 1992.

184
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 This is August of 1992. We're going to land at this house.

185
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Now, we walk into the house. We made a key when the occupants weren't looking.

186
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 There's two dudes living in this house. They have fake names, Jake and Hal.

187
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 It's time to go to bed.

188
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 They got their little pajamas on, their little cap, the little pointy cap with the ball on the end of it.

189
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 "Good night, Jake. Good night, Hal."

190
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And they go into their separate bedrooms. Their bedrooms are actually separated by a hallway that's about three feet wide.

191
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And they're exactly looking in on each other if they close the door.

192
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I mean, it's not like they lived in gerbil cages.

193
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Jake is deep asleep.

194
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And all of a sudden- [gasps]

195
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 He wakes up in his dark room and he feels the blanket slowly being pulled off of his body.

196
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 That's enough to alarm you. He sits up in bed and he sees something standing next to him.

197
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 We don't get much of a description of this creature.

198
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 We get a description of its eyes which are described as being side by side and long, almost like they were squinting.

199
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And it also had very, very long fingers.

200
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 We don't get any description of height or head size.

201
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Because of the other things that follow, it is probably a gray alien.

202
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And it's interesting actually now that I say that because this story is taking place in 1992, gray aliens weren't as well known.

203
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 This was before X-Files.

204
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 This was after Communion, but before X-Files.

205
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 So little green man was really the description of him and the idea of the gray alien wasn't universal.

206
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 But anyway, so he wakes up and he sees this creature slowly pulling the blanket off of him and he sits up in bed.

207
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 The creature with really no visible reaction is not angry or anything by getting caught.

208
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 He's like, "Oh no! The blanket banded has been caught!"

209
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I've been across eight galaxies and I've never been caught.

210
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 He's pulling the blanket off the bed. Jacob sits up.

211
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 The alien simply touches Jacob's chest and Jake immediately falls down, paralyzed.

212
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Now he's flat on the bed.

213
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 He's screaming out for help.

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 "How? How? Help! Help! The blanket banded! He's finally in our galaxy!"

215
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 How here's the screaming jumps up out of bed and he opens the door and he can see into the bedroom.

216
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Jake is laying there and he goes, "Somehow, I don't even know how this was physically possible, but somehow I'm laying there perfectly still."

217
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And this creature is no longer standing next to me. It's standing over me.

218
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 But it's not even really standing over me. It's simply over me.

219
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And he's screaming out for help. And he hears how screaming as well.

220
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 "Jake! Jake! What's going on? Let me... let me..."

221
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 The room has become as silent as a vacuum.

222
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 There is no noise now.

223
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 He just sees this thing over him and can hear nothing.

224
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 How, on the other hand, is trying to get into Jake's room.

225
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 He goes to run into the room and he bounces back.

226
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He goes up to the door again. He can see perfectly well into the room, but he can't get in.

227
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 It was like a force field had appeared.

228
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 He punches the doorway and his hand bounces back.

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 He begins beating on this force field.

230
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 What he sees gives us a better idea of what Jake was going through.

231
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 This creature was floating over Jake.

232
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 He said he saw a dark mass. That's all he saw.

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Floating over Jake.

234
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And as he's banging on this invisible barrier, the mass begins to lower itself.

235
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Lower itself. Lower itself.

236
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Until it touches Jake's body and then is absorbed by Jake's body.

237
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 A bright blue light comes in from the outside window.

238
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Jake begins to levitate off of the bed.

239
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 How wakes up?

240
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 What was that?

241
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It was a horrible dream.

242
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 It's 7.30 in the morning. He wakes up.

243
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 He goes, and even though he's dreaming the whole thing, right?

244
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 He goes and he checks on Jake.

245
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Jake's like, "You won't believe what happened last night."

246
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I don't know if it was a dream or what, but something came in my bedroom.

247
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 This story was first reported by Carla Turner in "Unexplained Universe #1."

248
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 It's interesting, because we've done a lot of stories recently where that start off in bed,

249
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 and I always do the caveat going, "I think I'd just be dreaming."

250
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 This could all be a dream.

251
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Dreaming is one of the most fantastical things happen.

252
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 But you can't have two people dream the same thing.

253
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 If two people are sharing a dream, that is not scientifically possible.

254
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 You can have two people, say, both eat a bunch of black licorice ice cream,

255
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 and watch "The Walking Dead," and then that night they both dream about zombies.

256
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 But in the dream, one guy's like, "Charlie, hand me that axe!"

257
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And then Charlie throws the axe to Joe.

258
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And they both remember that exact same thing.

259
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 They remember the exact same color of the axe.

260
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 He probably actually fought zombies in the middle of the night.

261
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 That's not possible for two people to have the same dream at the same time.

262
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Also from different points of view.

263
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 This would have to, and again, we always have to say if they're not making a story up,

264
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 this would have to be an actual encounter of an alien kind.

265
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 That's not unusual for the show, though.

266
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Again, like I was saying in the beginning, I'm always intrigued by the physics of ghosts.

267
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I'm also intrigued by the physics of aliens.

268
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 The fact that they can defy them.

269
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 The fact that they can shut off sound.

270
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 That they can...

271
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 There is nothing on Earth right now that can create a force field.

272
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 We actually covered a story a long time ago at the 3M factory,

273
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 where they had these two big giant rolls of like cellophane.

274
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And the machine was faulty, and it created a force field between those two things.

275
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Flies were getting stuck in it.

276
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 So you can do it. I'll backtrack. You can create a force field.

277
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 They didn't live in a 3M factory.

278
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 They lived in a house.

279
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Whatever this thing was, was able to do quite a few things that are deemed impossible.

280
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Levitation.

281
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Absorption.

282
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 It's not just going to absorb, but like absorbing matter and energy.

283
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Force fields, destroying sound.

284
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And the other thing is why?

285
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 That's actually now that I say that it's interesting that it did eliminate the ability for Jake to hear.

286
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 What would be the technical benefit or the strategic benefit of doing that?

287
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 We talk a lot about aliens abducting people.

288
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 But every show often you pop up in a story where aliens are replicating people.

289
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 There's been that long term theory that aliens are actually demons.

290
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 That's been a long time conspiracy theory.

291
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 So it's almost like it possessed him.

292
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And it would make sense to shut off the noise in that factor.

293
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Because if you're in a situation where you could get rescued, let's say you're in a cave-in,

294
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 and you can get rescued, hope is what keeps you going.

295
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 If you're in a cave-in in a 10.0 earthquake in the middle of Tokyo,

296
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 and you're in the middle of nowhere, you're in a cave and the city got destroyed,

297
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 and you're in a cave-in, you know that they're never going to find you.

298
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 No one knew you were in the area.

299
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Even if they did, there's 10 million other residents they need to take care of first.

300
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Hope is what keeps us alive.

301
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 If he could hear his buddy calling out to him,

302
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 "I'm going to help you, I'm coming in, there's an invisible barrier, but I'll get through, don't you worry, Jake,

303
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 you hold on just another second buddy."

304
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You would hold on another second.

305
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 But if you couldn't hear them, you know, he's paralyzed on his back.

306
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 He couldn't even really see what was going on.

307
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 If he thought that there was no rescue, that Hao wasn't coming to get him,

308
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 that the only thing in that room was him and this creature that's slowly lowering itself on top of you,

309
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 your will to fight is lessened.

310
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 You have no reinforcements, there is no escape, just give in.

311
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Aliens truly are a supernatural menace.

312
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 I'd say other than demons,

313
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 they are the one element that is constantly sowing chaos on the planet.

314
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Ghosts are something you stumble across.

315
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 You don't come home and there's a ghastly man with one leg and bloody bandages going through your refrigerator.

316
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 If there's a ghost in your bedroom while you're sleeping, it's at best mildly inconvenient.

317
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And at worst, absolutely terrifying.

318
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 But it's just a ghost.

319
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 At a certain point you're like, "Oh, it's just a ghost. It's just a ghost walking around."

320
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 I mean, again, it's still terrifying, right?

321
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 But you can live your normal life in a haunted apartment.

322
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 You can't live a normal life in an apartment full of aliens.

323
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 You can't live a normal life if demons are after you.

324
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And both of those creatures seem to be so malevolent.

325
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 You do have a lot of stories where you have aliens as the good guy,

326
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 but for the most part, alien lore, they are jacking people up.

327
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 They're taking buttholes out of cows.

328
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 They're poking you stick needles in your brain.

329
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Every so often, an alien makes pancakes for a farmer.

330
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 We covered that story.

331
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 That was nice.

332
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 That was nice that they did that.

333
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 But for the most part, aliens seem to be very malevolent.

334
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 They're truly one of the biggest adversaries in the paranormal world.

335
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 They're one of the biggest adversaries that we have to face.

336
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 And they might actually be more common than demons.

337
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 They may be more common than demonic activity.

338
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 That'd be actually interesting to look into.

339
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 So if you ever find yourself in a situation where you have an alien force,

340
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 corner you.

341
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Don't give up.

342
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Don't give in.

343
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Fight back.

344
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 If they paralyze you, fight back with your mind.

345
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 If they mind wipe you, fight back with your spirit.

346
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 If we make every alien encounter with humans a struggle,

347
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 if every time they show up, we fight back, they will back off.

348
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 If every time you went to pet a dog, the dog snapped at you,

349
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 and then every dog snapped at every human, they no longer wanted to be petted.

350
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 They no longer wanted to be subservient.

351
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 They wanted to get off their leash and go on their own.

352
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 If that happened every single time, people would stop treating dogs as pets.

353
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Wouldn't it be worth it?

354
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Because you know eventually that snapping is going to draw blood.

355
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 That's how we fight back.

356
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 On the other hand, if every time we went to pet a dog, it snapped at us.

357
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Would we keep dogs around at all?

358
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Would we let their existence be a thing on this earth?

359
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 If every encounter with a dog had a high possibility of turning violent.

360
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Would aliens stop harassing humans if we fought back every single time?

361
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Or would they simply realize the experiment has become too dangerous to continue?

362
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It's time to cleanse the planet and start over.

363
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 We won't know until that day comes.

364
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 But until that day comes, I say fight back.

365
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Give them nothing.

366
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Take from them everything.

367
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Do not let the aliens push you around.

368
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000

370
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I just started an intergalactic war.

371
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Also, I don't mean hybrids either, right?

372
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Because we didn't have that guy a while back who was like,

373
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 "Oh yeah, shoot hybrids in the face.

374
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And how can you tell the difference between a hybrid and an alien?"

375
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 You couldn't.

376
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Don't do that.

377
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 But if a bunch of great aliens or reptilians or whatever show up in your bedroom,

378
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 fight back.

379
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 But if you just thank your mailman as a hybrid, he's not.

380
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 He's not.

381
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Don't fight back against him.

382
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 He's just trying to bring you your mail.

383
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 But I'm glad you listened to it today.

389
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Have a great day, guys.
