1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,740
 A man waiting for the bus falls into a world of horror.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:15,080
 A man uses a bizarre tool kit to enact revenge against his killers.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,560
 And then, you guys have been waiting for it all week, I keep postponing it.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,120
 We travel to San Francisco to meet a film director who decides to lay the perfect trap

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,680
 for the Zodiac Killer.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:34,640
 All he needs is 5 men, a walk-in freezer, and a movie starring the Zodiac Killer.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,320
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:46,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
 great day too.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,880
 I'm gonna tell you guys right now I'm a little hungover because I was watching the election

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,120
 all night, you guys who are long time listeners of the show know I'm a huge political junkie.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,400
 It's like elections are like my world series/ubervol/curling championship.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,800
 Um, basically anything, anything other than an election is like an election to me.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,880
 I love politics, I love the art of campaigning and all that stuff.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,840
 It's one of the very few times that I actually drink, and last night I drank and went on

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,920
 forever, it's not decided at this point.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,120
 I also ate a bunch of pizza.

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,200
 Both of those things combined, you're like Jason I do that every day, why are you complaining

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,320
 about this?

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,960
 My body is now probably 30% marinara, probably another 20%, I had two beers, okay?

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,600
 Let's be honest, I had two Budweisers and I'm all "Uhhh" and that's, I'm just a lightweight

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,880
 when it comes to alcohol and apparently also when it comes to Domino's pizza.

24
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,120
 But anyways, the only reason why I'm explaining that now is because I'll probably be a little

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,960
 more surly this episode.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,280
 I'm still feeling the effects of all that stuff, I'm just like "Uhhh" that's a good

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,600
 product placement for Budweiser and Domino's, right?

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,240
 They're like "Uhhh" makes you feel like you're sweating out pure chemicals.

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,400
 But you know what doesn't make me sweat?

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,920
 Our newest Patreon supporter, you like that segue?

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,240
 Our newest Patreon supporter, Ragecat!

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,080
 Everyone give Ragecat a round of applause, scratching behind the ears, rub his little

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
 belly.

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,040
 You're like "Dude, I support the Patreon, I never got my belly rubbed well, maybe we'll

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,920
 rub your belly at some point."

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,520
 But Ragecat is going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,560
 Just helps read the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,480
 So Ragecat, let's go ahead and touch you the keys of the Jason's Loppy.

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,160
 First off, very, very short story.

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,200
 We're headed out to New York City.

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:46,400
 *meows* After I made that sound effect, I took a nap for two or three hours.

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,560
 But I'm feeling a little more energetic now, so we got Ragecat driving us out to New York

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
 City.

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,200
 This first story is actually pretty short.

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,320
 But I want you to put yourself in this situation.

47
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,560
 So we are in New York City.

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,520
 Like "Dude, I'd never go to New York City."

49
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,880
 But for this story, you don't have a choice.

50
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,720
 You're there anyways.

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,200
 It's October 28th, 2020.

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,960
 Very, very recent story.

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,560
 You're standing there waiting for the bus and you see me and Ragecat walking down the

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
 street towards you.

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,440
 You stop a safe distance away, kind of waving to you.

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
 You're like "What?

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
 That's kind of weird."

58
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,960
 And then you take a step towards us and then you disappear.

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,600
 Now it's not a time warp.

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,680
 It's not Mandela Effect, nothing like that.

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,280
 It is the enemy to all mankind, whether we want to believe it or not.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,600
 It's the sinkhole.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,000
 You fall down into a pit.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,720
 Fifteen feet deep and on impact, break your leg.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,520
 You're like "Why am I listening to this podcast?

66
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
 This is horrible."

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,760
 You're in a pitch dark pit.

68
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,720
 Previously you were standing up on the street in New York City.

69
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,080
 You don't know which one's more dangerous, but you're in the pit.

70
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,400
 "Oh my leg."

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,000
 And not only do you have a broken leg as you were falling, you broke your arm too.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,600
 And you're screaming out in darkness.

73
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,880
 Now there's a beam of light coming down from the hole that you made and you see people

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,840
 looking down trying to figure out a way to help you.

75
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,520
 That's when you begin to scream out for help, but you very quickly keep your mouth shut

76
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,680
 as a giant rat crawls onto your shoulder.

77
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,320
 And then another one scurries across your leg and then a third is sliding up under

78
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 your shirt.

79
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
 You're crawling all over your skin.

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,560
 They're everywhere.

81
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,760
 You can't even cry out for help because one of them may crawl into your mouth.

82
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,040
 This actually really happened to a guy named Leonard Shoulders the other day.

83
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,920
 The exact same story I just told you.

84
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
 Fell down, broke his arm, broke his leg.

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,840
 I spared you this fate.

86
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,960
 As he was falling through the concrete, there was a hole opened up.

87
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,320
 It wasn't like a perfect loony-tune hole that he could go through.

88
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,120
 It was jagged concrete.

89
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,080
 So part of the concrete scraped away a chunk of his face.

90
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,240
 He falls 15 feet into this hole.

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,720
 It's covered in rats.

92
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,720
 And he said that he wanted to yell out for help, but he didn't because he felt they

93
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,240
 were going to crawl into his mouth.

94
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,800
 These huge rats were swarming this abandoned basement that was rotting away underneath

95
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,960
 the city street.

96
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,840
 He was down there for 30 minutes.

97
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,640
 He was down there for a half hour before authorities could rescue him.

98
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,000
 I understand that from a logical sense.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 It's not safe.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,120
 The firefighters aren't like "hey come over here everyone" and they run over to the

101
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,080
 hole and then they all fall in and break their arms and legs.

102
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,880
 I'm actually surprised that no one else fell in.

103
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,920
 His mom was standing next to him apparently when he fell in.

104
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,200
 But I don't know why that's an accident.

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,160
 He tells not like she made the hole or did she?

106
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
 But I mean like there were people standing around.

107
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
 You can actually watch video.

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,320
 Video will be in the show notes of this happening.

109
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,680
 And you see everyone just kind of checking their phone.

110
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,280
 There's a delivery man making a delivery and then "dook" like "dook" just...

111
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,360
 First off when he falls he braces himself.

112
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,600
 But I think that might have actually been his downside because one of his legs is like

113
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
 bent up.

114
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,360
 He's holding onto the ground and he's only able to hold himself up for like two or three

115
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,000
 seconds if that.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,480
 And then falls 15 feet and he fell on the leg that wasn't folded against his clavicle.

117
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,320
 So it's not a good landing.

118
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,000
 He sat down there for a half hour.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It's just a compounded terrible story.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,120
 Falling into a hole sucks.

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,400
 Falling into a hole full of rats sucks even more.

122
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
 Breaking limbs.

123
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,160
 Can't even really fight him off at that point.

124
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
 What are you doing?

125
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
 Shrugging him?

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
 Take that.

127
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,240
 Take that slight movement you rat.

128
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,720
 And then being down there for a half hour the rats continue to scurry around.

129
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,480
 Now they've actually shut down this part of New York.

130
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,680
 They shut down like three buildings on this block until they get the basement fixed.

131
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,960
 So if you're looking for a job, if you're looking for a job in the New York area, maybe

132
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,520
 you can go down there and get a job as a professional basement fixer/rat avoider.

133
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,800
 I wanted to cover that story for a couple different reasons.

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,320
 One, it's absolutely terrifying.

135
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,120
 Two, there's a video of it.

136
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,440
 That's a great combination.

137
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,920
 The other reason why I wanted to cover it, and I don't remember if I saw this on X.

138
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
 I think I did.

139
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,360
 I might have seen it on Reddit.

140
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,840
 I just read so much stuff, but I don't remember exactly where it came from.

141
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,120
 Someone put out this theory that what if, not all of them, I'm not gonna say all of

142
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,920
 them, but what if an amount, well let's just throw out there, 10%, 10% of missing kids

143
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
 are falling into the sewer.

144
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,560
 And this is the person who laid this scenario out, pretty interesting.

145
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,000
 This kind of makes sense.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,800
 It's really easy to fall into the sewer.

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,160
 I mean it's not, they're kind of designed not to fall into, but people do fall into

148
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
 them.

149
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,400
 There's a lot of things in waterways and things like that.

150
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,920
 You fall into the sewer, you're out playing in the neighborhood.

151
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,040
 Everyone's like, "Hey look at this, there's a little Billy running down the street and

152
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,680
 then Billy rounds the corner and he's never seen again."

153
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,880
 It's not a super common story, but it happens enough to creep us out.

154
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,320
 Everyone's looking for the kid, they never find him.

155
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,920
 Suspect may get arrested and then it turns out that he was killed, which is horrible

156
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,440
 ending obviously.

157
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
 Most of the time the kids are found.

158
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,200
 Most of the time it's a runaway situation or they're just lost statistically they're

159
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
 found.

160
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,280
 But in the horrible cases where they're not found and there's no suspect and there's

161
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,280
 no arrest, this poster said, "What if they're falling into our water systems?"

162
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,480
 And you go, "Well Jason, I'm sure you would find the body within at least the maintenance

163
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,800
 schedule of a sewer."

164
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,760
 They don't just build them and they're like, "It's the alligator's problem now boys.

165
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,360
 Let's leave and hope everything goes fine."

166
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,520
 There's constantly workers down there, but if it's a sewer system or a storm drain system

167
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,280
 that has enough flow of water in it, either during the time of their disappearance or in

168
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,920
 between the maintenance schedule, the body's gone.

169
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,240
 The body's absolutely gone.

170
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,880
 Case in point, there was a woman, let me pull my notes up real quick.

171
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,000
 You can tell I'm super prepared for this one.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,240
 Now this is an extreme circumstance because this took place during a storm, but on July

173
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,520
 6th, 2020 in Paseik, New Jersey.

174
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,400
 This was over by the Dairy Queen on High Street in Benson Avenue.

175
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,640
 If you want to go there, if you want to reenact this event.

176
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,040
 A young woman named Nathalia Bruno, 24 years old.

177
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,760
 She was a door dash driver.

178
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,680
 She was trying to make a delivery during this massive storm and a flood hits, a flash flood

179
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
 hits.

180
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,520
 And her car gets lifted up by the water, it's floating down the street, everyone's seeing

181
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,000
 what's going on.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,280
 And it's headed towards a giant storm drain entrance, like this tunnel that's perfectly

183
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,520
 car sized for her car.

184
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,160
 The water's carrying her away, she's getting pulled into the tunnel and she has to make

185
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,040
 an executive decision really really quick.

186
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,520
 Do I stay in the car and hope that it provides me some sort of protection?

187
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,800
 Or do I get out and swim?

188
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,000
 Now anyone who knows anything about physics knows that neither is optimal, neither is

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 a great option.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,400
 And people are standing there in their houses, in their warm and cozy houses, and they're

191
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,040
 seeing this car go into this storm drain and they see Nathalia jump out and then the car

192
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,400
 gets sucked into the storm drain and she gets sucked into the storm drain too.

193
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,920
 They're immediately calling 911.

194
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,400
 They didn't wait until that.

195
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,280
 Once they saw the car floating, some guy's like "Oh no, my Taco Bell!

196
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,840
 She's supposed to deliver it to me!"

197
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,560
 Car's going into the sewer.

198
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
 As the fire department is getting these phone calls to get out there, they're rushing out

199
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
 to the scene.

200
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,000
 Nathalia has already been sucked into the storm drain.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,440
 Before they even get to the location, there's a bunch of other 911 calls from a mile away

202
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,360
 because people are sitting in their warm cozy houses and you know just enjoying the view,

203
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,800
 enjoying the storm drain view of New Jersey.

204
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:03,480
 People are looking out their windows and they see a woman shoot out of a storm drain as if

205
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,360
 she was going down a water slide, crashes into this rapidly growing reservoir river, and

206
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,120
 she swam in and then she crossed the land and then she just kind of collapses.

207
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,000
 What had happened was she got, she survived.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,880
 She got sucked into the storm drain and she basically within 30 seconds ends up a mile

209
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
 away.

210
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
 Whoa!

211
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,380
 Totally tubular dude!

212
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,380
 She's all swimming.

213
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,040
 She actually, she wasn't swimming.

214
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,920
 She's been sucked along by water going 30 miles an hour.

215
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,200
 It takes her from that main storm drain and deposits her in that river.

216
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,120
 Had she at any point, she had no control over which way she was going.

217
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,680
 At any point if the water had zigged instead of zagged, she would have ended up stuck

218
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,640
 underwater drowning in the darkness of a sewer.

219
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,760
 Instead, in some bizarre like dragon's layer like choose your own adventure, the lights

220
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,200
 are flashing.

221
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,480
 The water made every perfect choice to lead her to safety because it had all these other

222
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
 inlets in there.

223
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,760
 Her car, they show a photo of the car, was completely crushed.

224
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,040
 There's a photo looking down a manhole at her little dot's in or whatever it was, smashed

225
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,440
 the pieces and it was wedged into the storm drain.

226
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
 I have no idea how they're going to get it out.

227
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,600
 They're just going to have to like cut it out, cut it out piece by piece, lift it out

228
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,920
 of the manhole and then reconstruct the car.

229
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,280
 She did end up making the right choice.

230
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,520
 If though the water at any point had tried to put her down one of those side areas, she

231
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
 would have been dead.

232
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,800
 It would have been a tragedy.

233
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,400
 But instead, she had a really fun time, right?

234
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
 Whee!

235
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,520
 But imagine now this happening, people aren't viewing it, it's a kid falls into a storm

236
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,600
 drain and is then drowned.

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,280
 This is dark, this is super dark, but a kid falls into a storm drain and gets washed away

238
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:05,320
 and ends up in a reservoir somewhere or deposited into a river and is never seen again.

239
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:15,320
 I think I have limited my amount of morbidity on this episode, but you know what I mean?

240
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:26,800
 I thought there was an interesting theory that you could have a lot, maybe 2% maybe

241
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,000
 1%, but maybe enough that these kids that go missing, especially younger kids, maybe

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,440
 they're falling into storm drains and getting washed away, they're not going to the water

243
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,040
 reclamation plant, they're not going somewhere into the sewer where they could eventually

244
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,680
 be found, they're being deposited in the waterways that lead off into the rivers and

245
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,560
 the lakes and the oceans, never to be seen again.

246
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,200
 Sorry, that's a good dark turn, you're like "woo!

247
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,320
 Rats, that's cool, I'm not afraid of rats" and then we end up talking about that.

248
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,560
 Ragecat call in that.

249
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,560
 Dead Rabbit Durgible, we're leaving behind New Jersey, we're headed out to Pompano Beach,

250
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
 Florida.

251
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,240
 Dead Rabbit Durgible flying over the eastern seaboard.

252
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,600
 This is a really weird one, I actually came across this one today, that happened about

253
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 a month ago.

254
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:25,920
 It's October 18th, 2020 and we're standing outside our new job, we now work at WastePro.

255
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,560
 We are professional garbage men, or garbage people, I guess is their call today, although

256
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,200
 that makes them sound like some sort of cryptid.

257
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,600
 But we are now professional garbage people.

258
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:44,680
 It's October 18th, 2020, it's 2.15am, there's video footage again of this, a man walks up

259
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,080
 to the front gate of the WastePro parking lot.

260
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,240
 So we have a building that is where all the garbage people work.

261
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,600
 Oscar the Grouch is the boss and super smelly, there's banana peels everywhere, and then

262
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,560
 they have this parking lot that's full of their garbage trucks.

263
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,640
 And a man walks up to the gate that's holding the garbage trucks and he's standing there.

264
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,840
 This man is wearing goggles and he's dressed as trash.

265
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,440
 He's disguised as trash.

266
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,120
 Specifically they said he has a suit made of garbage bags, but we'll put a pin in that

267
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,840
 because I have a theory about that.

268
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,560
 He gets to the front gate, there's many ways to get into a sealed location.

269
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,440
 You can cut the lock, you can pick the lock, you can have a key, you can blow it up if

270
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,760
 you're adventurous.

271
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,440
 This guy does something that I've never seen before.

272
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,440
 He sets the gate on fire.

273
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:50,360
 And apparently the gate was made of coal because it burns.

274
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,280
 He sets it on fire, it's so hot.

275
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,840
 I guess he melted the lock or something like that.

276
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,040
 He opens the gate, flames still flickering where a lock once sat.

277
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:07,600
 He begins walking into the parking lot and setting garbage trucks on fire.

278
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
 They're going up in flames.

279
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,800
 There was actually at least one explosion when he was doing this thing.

280
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,400
 There were residents who had their windows shattered.

281
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,360
 It's 2.15 in the morning, you're worried about gray aliens coming in your house or something

282
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
 like that.

283
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,920
 You're worried about your missing kid, he's been gone ever since that storm.

284
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,720
 And then all of a sudden, pshh, glass comes shooting in.

285
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,400
 Ah, what is it now?

286
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,920
 You see a fire.

287
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,840
 Several fires from the WastePro location.

288
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,160
 Then he kicks in the door of the WastePro building, pulls out a bottle of liquid, sets

289
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,920
 it on the ground and sets the building itself on fire.

290
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,080
 At that point, this garbage shaped man gets into a black sedan.

291
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,840
 I know it kind of ruins the mystique, right?

292
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
 You were just kind of hoping.

293
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,280
 You have like the garbage mobile or something like that.

294
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,000
 No, it's just like a Chevy.

295
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,080
 He goes and he gets in his black sedan, rrrrrr, drives away.

296
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,600
 There's no word on whether or not he peeled away his tires left fire marks, but you know,

297
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,880
 you can always hope so.

298
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,120
 Apparently, and tad another bizarre twist, there was also a white SUV that the police

299
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,960
 are looking for because they think it may have been a lookout.

300
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,520
 So the police are looking for two vehicles, a black sedan, probably smells like garbage.

301
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
 Probably a good tip.

302
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,360
 What I find interesting about this story, other than every single part of it, I didn't

303
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,600
 know you could open a gate through fire, what if, let's put on our conspiracy caps here,

304
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,200
 let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second, what if this man is some sort of

305
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,920
 garbage, I'm being serious, I'm being serious, I'm not saying this is true, but this is what

306
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,320
 I thought when I finished reading this article.

307
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,400
 You may be thinking it as well.

308
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,480
 What if this man is like garbage incarnate?

309
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,120
 What if this man is a garbage vengeance spirit?

310
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,360
 And for 10,000, no, 100,000 years from the first time that a caveman ate a banana and

311
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,200
 looked at the peel and goes, what's this for?

312
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,120
 And throws it on the ground.

313
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,240
 Or a little kid unwraps a toy, a little caveman unwraps a toy, they invent wrapping paper,

314
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,760
 they invent paper first, and he unwraps a rock and he's like, awesome, this is what

315
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,920
 I always wanted.

316
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,040
 And then throws the new invention wrapping paper on the ground, the garbage spirit standing

317
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,600
 there in the shadows.

318
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,360
 He's slowly collecting all this refuse to become sentient, and he waited all this time.

319
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,560
 This is his first strike against humanity, setting garbage trucks on fire.

320
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,440
 I do find it really weird, like if I was going to break into a toy store, I wouldn't

321
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,800
 dress up as a giant teddy bear.

322
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,640
 Although they should actually, maybe this guy is a garbage vengeance spirit, maybe he's

323
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
 just ahead of the curve.

324
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,360
 Maybe someday you'll be sitting in a bank, getting ready to deposit a check, and a giant

325
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,960
 money bag runs in with an AK-47.

326
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
 Give me all your me.

327
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
 And everyone's like, what?

328
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
 That's super confusing.

329
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,400
 He's like, I'm money, give me money.

330
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,080
 From now on I decree that every criminal should be dressed as what they are doing.

331
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,840
 In hypodermic needles standing on street corners, pimps and prostitutes.

332
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,160
 They just look normal.

333
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
 They just look like normal pimps and prostitutes.

334
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,360
 You're driving through a desolate area of town, you see a man dressed as a hatchet hiding

335
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,500
 in the bushes.

336
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,880
 So is garbage man actually a sentient spirit, or is he just a trendsetter?

337
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,960
 We won't know until he strikes again.

338
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,960
 I'm telling the story as I'm looking at two bags of garbage I gotta take out to my garbage.

339
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,040
 But one thing we gotta do first, this episode may run long, I don't care.

340
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,240
 Rage cat, fire up that carbonar copter.

341
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,480
 We are leaving behind Florida.

342
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,960
 We are headed out to San Francisco.

343
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,240
 It's the year 1971, we are walking down the streets of San Francisco.

344
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,360
 We're having a ball, we're dressed up in bell bottoms, medallions, this is totally dope.

345
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,360
 Speaking of dope, there's a giant hypodermic needle man standing on the corner there.

346
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
 But we're not there to buy drugs.

347
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,800
 We are there to watch a movie.

348
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,480
 The movie called The Zodiac.

349
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,880
 Now all this information actually got from an article written by Jake Rossin.

350
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,440
 He wrote this for MentalFloss.com.

351
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,000
 So really appreciated Jake.

352
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,480
 We walk into the movie theater, we see all the candy, we see old 1970s gross candy like

353
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
 dots and candy corn.

354
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,320
 I don't know if they have candy corn in the movie theater, but it's gross anyways.

355
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,480
 Then we see an unusually large podium, like a lectern.

356
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,640
 Like we're expecting Billy Graham to show up and start giving him a speech.

357
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
 I've never been to a movie theater in 1971.

358
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
 Maybe this is normal.

359
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,960
 What's not normal is the Kawasaki motorcycle.

360
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,960
 The guy standing behind the lectern goes, "Hey, you guys want to enter the drawing for this

361
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
 Kawasaki motorcycle?"

362
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,400
 Just write down your name, address, phone number.

363
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 We're going to put it into this giant, this massive lectern.

364
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 Kawasaki can hold a person, doesn't it?

365
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,480
 And when we look at each other, we're like, "Yeah, I guess it's big enough to hold a

366
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
 person."

367
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
 He goes, "Well, it doesn't!"

368
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,320
 There's no one hidden in this podium.

369
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
 Why would you even think that?

370
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,960
 And we're like, "You kind of brought it up."

371
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,240
 It's also weird that now we hear the sound of someone eating dots and they're getting

372
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,800
 stuck in his teeth.

373
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,720
 But whatever, we don't care about personal privacy.

374
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
 We fill out all of our information.

375
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,640
 I'm filling out extra information for you.

376
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,000
 We drop it into the podium and then we go in to see the movie The Zodiac.

377
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,400
 Now this movie came out in 1971.

378
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,960
 I guess I should spoil something right now.

379
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,200
 We to this day still really don't know who the Zodiac killer is.

380
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,400
 There's been suggestions that it was this dude or that dude or whatever.

381
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,520
 This whole plot, I just realized there's something wrong with this segment.

382
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,760
 Or at least the way I'm presenting it.

383
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,000
 I think it's a fascinating story.

384
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,520
 But this whole plot is, they're trying to catch the Zodiac killer, but we know for a fact

385
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,680
 the Zodiac killer is never caught.

386
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,040
 I'm trying to figure some stuff out of my head on how to...

387
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
 You're like, "What?

388
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,720
 He was never caught!"

389
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
 Click off the episode.

390
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,320
 I'm trying to figure out a way to continue the rest of the story.

391
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,520
 I do have to say this though.

392
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,600
 I think the Zodiac killer is one of the lamest of all the serial killers.

393
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:18,200
 The only thing the Zodiac has going for him is the fact that he has that gimp suit.

394
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
 Which is what it is.

395
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
 Like I remember when I was a kid, I'll say this too.

396
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,080
 I have a personal beef with the Zodiac killer.

397
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,680
 He ruined one of my Halloween's.

398
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,120
 I was probably like 9 or 10 years old.

399
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,200
 So it was like 1985, 1986.

400
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,040
 I was living in the Bay Area.

401
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,600
 My dad was going to seminary at the time.

402
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,360
 So it was in Marin County.

403
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,240
 This is when I went to Strawberry Point Middle School.

404
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,000
 This is when I was involved in the gate program.

405
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And I made that weird sculpture.

406
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,360
 That episode was a while back.

407
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
 Check that one out.

408
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,600
 The dragon is what that one was called.

409
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,440
 I'll put it in the show notes.

410
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
 I was going.

411
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,280
 I was in the area as Marin County.

412
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,400
 I didn't know who the hell the Zodiac killer was.

413
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,440
 I was 9, right?

414
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,040
 And he had done all of his kills back in the 60s.

415
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,240
 So even by the time they were making this movie, he stopped killing people.

416
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,640
 Actively killing people.

417
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,360
 But Zodiac killer, and let me say this too if you don't know, Zodiac killer was this

418
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,400
 quote unquote famous serial killer who killed like 6 or 7 people.

419
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,680
 I'm not entirely for sure.

420
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,280
 And he would leave these cryptic messages in the newspapers.

421
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,160
 This little symbol and he's like, "I leave this code and it's like I'm the Zodiac killer.

422
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,640
 I'm going to kill again."

423
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,920
 You know, I'm such a bad boy.

424
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
 Catch me cops.

425
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,600
 It's just all that cringe, edgelord nonsense that you would laugh at today if someone posted

426
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
 it online.

427
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,400
 But he was posting it in this paper and they were publishing it and everyone's like, "Oh,

428
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,840
 who's this total badass Zodiac killer?"

429
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,960
 He'd point a gun at you.

430
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,760
 He would make you like restrain.

431
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,320
 He'd make the guy restrain the girl and then he would restrain the guy or whatever order

432
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,440
 they'd both end up being restrained then he would stab him to death.

433
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
 Come on.

434
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,880
 I mean like to me, see I don't have a huge opinion of serial killers to begin with, but

435
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,360
 that's pretty lame.

436
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,600
 He wasn't enough of a fighter.

437
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,560
 He wasn't enough of a scrapper to actually try to go at two people with a knife.

438
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
 He was a big punk.

439
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,440
 So he had to tie him up and then stab him and whatever.

440
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,760
 And then he'd get an erection because these guys, their dicks don't work unless they're

441
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
 committing violence.

442
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,560
 That's one of the reasons, if your penis doesn't work or if you don't have one, I don't care.

443
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,360
 That's totally fine.

444
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,080
 My thing with serial killers is they are almost always a sexual dysfunction.

445
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,400
 But yet society's like, "Oh dude, this guy's a hunter of man and he left these cryptid notes."

446
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,640
 He couldn't get it up and so he killed people.

447
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,560
 I don't have a high opinion of serial killers to begin with.

448
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
 I definitely don't have a high opinion of serial killers.

449
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,440
 You have to wear gimp suits because they look so neb-ish.

450
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,120
 Like if you saw Ted Bundy coming out of the woods after you, he looks like a serial killer.

451
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,920
 He's like this tall, handsome guy and you would think that guy's probably gonna kill him

452
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,080
 because he's running out of the bush with a knife, but you're thinking, "I might not

453
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,400
 be able to take that guy in a fight."

454
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,160
 Now again, he attacked co-eds in their sleep where people trying to help him put a bicycle

455
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
 on his car.

456
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,760
 Like he was just a gross loser.

457
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
 But at least with Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer, that dude had the lame.

458
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,560
 That dude was tall, right?

459
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,320
 So if you were like boxing with that dude, he's got a little bit of reach on you.

460
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,120
 But again, he was drugging men.

461
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,320
 He wasn't going toe to toe with these dudes.

462
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,240
 None of these serial killers are leading them into the octagon and goes, "Ugh, only one

463
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,560
 of us is gonna leave here alive because they would lose every single time."

464
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:33,320
 The Zodiac Killer was such a dork that he had to hide his face behind a mask.

465
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,760
 Now he looks like someone that Seymour Krellborn would push down the stairs.

466
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
 He looks like a big old nerd.

467
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,760
 I'm not saying you should pick on people just because of what they look like.

468
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:49,200
 But if they are also serial killers and they look like dorks, it's fair game, right?

469
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
 He's not like, "Oh, I feel the need to kill.

470
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,040
 I'm gonna go join the Liberation Army of the Congo and fulfill my needs," because he'd

471
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
 get blown away.

472
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,200
 So he's just shooting people who are defenseless.

473
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,680
 But I have a personal beef with Zodiac Killer.

474
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,200
 When I was like 9 years old or something like that, 9 to 10 years old, Halloween was cancelled

475
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
 because of this jerk.

476
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,680
 He didn't just say his reign, his murders ended back in the 60s.

477
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,600
 Well they did, but because they never caught him, people were always afraid.

478
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,200
 We were getting ready for Halloween.

479
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,440
 I was probably dressed up as Yoda or something like that.

480
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,840
 And it was just normal Tuesday, it was June, I was dressed up as Yoda.

481
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,240
 Halloween was coming, everyone was getting ready to go out and get our food.

482
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,840
 And the newspaper got a letter from the Zodiac.

483
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,920
 They got a coded message from the Zodiac saying that they were going to drive around shooting

484
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,080
 kids on Halloween.

485
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,560
 Now it didn't happen, it turns out to be a hoax, but I didn't get to go trick-or-treating

486
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
 that year.

487
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,040
 I think this, it wasn't like a city-wide canceling trick-or-treating, everyone was just like

488
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
 be a little cautious.

489
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,800
 They might be a serial killer, out to kill your kids.

490
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,680
 So parents weren't letting the kids go out, people who normally did give out candy were

491
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
 giving out less.

492
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
 It was truly a drought.

493
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:14,800
 And as I stood there on that moonless night, holding half a bag of Snickers, instead of

494
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,920
 the full bag I normally would have, I raised my hand up into the sky and said, "Damn you

495
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,960
 Zodiac killer!"

496
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
 Probably wasn't him.

497
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,920
 Probably was just someone having a laugh.

498
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,000
 But anyways, I never liked the serial killer.

499
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,200
 After that people were like, "Dude, you know that, people actually lost loved ones."

500
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
 That's horrible.

501
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,080
 Sure, but 9 year old Jason lost Snickers because someone wanted to pretend to be the Zodiac

502
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
 killer.

503
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,600
 Let me get to this, let me get to this actual story.

504
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,880
 It's actually not super long now that I'm thinking about it, now that I kind of gave

505
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 it away.

506
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,600
 What it is, is that Tom Hanson, he was a fast food chain franchisee guy, he had all these

507
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,280
 fast food restaurants, but things weren't going well business wise.

508
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,640
 And he was thinking about cashing out and moving back home.

509
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,640
 He lived in the Midwest, at this point he's in San Francisco and he goes, "You know what,

510
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,800
 I've always wanted to be a movie director/producer."

511
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,160
 He had done bit parts in movies in the area.

512
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,360
 And he figures out, it's interesting because this is both like being a vigilante and having

513
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,760
 a gimmick for your film.

514
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
 He comes up with this idea.

515
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,720
 I'm going to make a movie about the Zodiac because the Zodiac killer was a publicity

516
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
 hound.

517
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,400
 In one of his coded letters where he's like, "You will find the eighth body near the tenth

518
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,120
 reservoir if you look at some."

519
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,840
 He's like, "I wonder who will play me in a movie."

520
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,800
 So I mean, you know, again, he was just adored.

521
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:45,040
 If TMZ was around back then, he would be walking down the street in a Zodiac suit, leaving

522
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,960
 San Francisco airport and they're like, "Hey, Zodiac, Zodiac, is it true you're dating

523
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
 Jennifer Aniston?"

524
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
 He's like, "Get out of my way."

525
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
 "Yes, it's true."

526
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
 Also, will you tie yourselves up there?

527
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
 Like, no.

528
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
 And he's like, "Ugh."

529
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,080
 He was a publicity hound.

530
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,640
 He was super vain.

531
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,680
 So Tom Hanson comes up with this idea.

532
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,960
 He goes, "Maybe I'll make a movie about the Zodiac killer."

533
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,640
 Having premiered in San Francisco, the Zodiac killer is going to show up.

534
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,360
 I got two ways to catch him.

535
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,360
 One, no serial killers love Kawasaki motorcycles, right?

536
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,440
 So they can chase their victims down.

537
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,520
 So he got a Kawasaki motorcycle and he said, "We're going to have people fill out these

538
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
 cards.

539
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
 We're going to put them in the podium."

540
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,600
 And inside the podium, don't tell anyone this, inside the podium there was a man.

541
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,920
 There was a man inside of this lectern with a flashlight.

542
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,880
 Every time a card was dropped in there, he would match it against no one's samples of

543
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,560
 the Zodiac's handwriting.

544
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,400
 The address is written down as a bunch of glyphs.

545
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,120
 He's like, "Hmm, these look familiar.

546
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,520
 I'll put this in the maybe pile."

547
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,080
 "That's not good enough, right?

548
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
 Who knows?

549
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,840
 This Zodiac already has a Kawasaki motorcycle.

550
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,680
 Maybe he's a Harley man."

551
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,840
 So he had people posted all around the theater and they had to steady a picture of the Zodiac's

552
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,000
 ... This guy walks in with a giant mask on.

553
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,800
 Because they did have a sketch of what he looked like underneath the mask.

554
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,160
 So everyone had to steady the sketch and they go, "Just keep scanning the crowd.

555
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,200
 See if you recognize this guy."

556
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,160
 And then they had a guy in a walk-in freezer for some reason.

557
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
 I read the article multiple times.

558
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,080
 I'm going to make heads or tails of that if they just tricked him into going in there.

559
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,400
 Apparently there was a guy in a walk-in freezer and there was a light in the walk-in freezer.

560
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,520
 Now the guy in the lectern, if he caught a signature that was correct, he would hit

561
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,360
 a button and then the light would come on in the walk-in freezer and then the guy would

562
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,920
 come out of the freezer and just go, "Surprise!"

563
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,440
 He's like, "I don't know.

564
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,120
 Okay, you know that there's a signature match, but the guy walks out of the freezer isn't

565
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
 going to know who that is."

566
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,360
 He just walks out and he's super cold.

567
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,600
 He's like throwing popsicles in every single direction.

568
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,960
 How did that help anyone?

569
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,320
 They actually ended up foiling part of their plan because the guy in the walk-in freezer

570
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,320
 one night, this went on for multiple nights.

571
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,440
 The movie premiered for about a week.

572
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,160
 The guy in the freezer runs out of oxygen, starts to pass out.

573
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,800
 He's somehow able to signal he's running out of oxygen.

574
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,000
 It's a poorly thought out plan.

575
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,800
 So other people in on this plan had to go and rescue him, including the guy inside the

576
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,760
 podium jumped out and ran.

577
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,120
 That'd be shocking.

578
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,440
 You're buying your candy.

579
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,240
 You see a full-sized man jump out of a lectern going, "Oh, I'll save you!"

580
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
 And run off into the freezer.

581
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
 You're like, "What?"

582
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,480
 That was more entertaining than anything going on in the movie.

583
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,600
 When everything settles down and the guy gets back into the lectern, he finds a card

584
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,880
 that says, "I am the Zodiac.

585
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,400
 I was here."

586
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,400
 Later on, investigators like private investigators, I don't know if this ever got turned over

587
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,520
 to the police, but people who looked into the case said that wasn't a match for his

588
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,760
 handwriting.

589
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,160
 I find it odd that that card was deposited during this whole craziness.

590
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,640
 So was someone actually watching this and figured out the rules and put it in there

591
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
 as a joke?

592
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
 Who knows?

593
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,760
 Or was the real Zodiac killer there?

594
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
 Who knows?

595
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,720
 But that's not the end of the story because Tom Hanson believes that the real Zodiac killer

596
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
 did show up.

597
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,080
 Because Tom Hanson, you know, he goes, "I worked at a lot of fast food restaurants.

598
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
 I owned them.

599
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,760
 I'd been working at them for a while.

600
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,280
 I'd been robbed a lot and I learned how to steady people's faces.

601
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,040
 I knew exactly what the Zodiac killer looked like."

602
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,800
 One day in the movie theater, the movie's playing, I go to use the restroom and I go

603
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,640
 into the men's restroom and I'm peeing and a guy walks up to the urinal next to me and

604
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,200
 it's peeing as well and he says, "That's not what blood looks like.

605
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,640
 That's not what it looks like when you stab somebody."

606
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,800
 Tom Hanson, his pee runs cold.

607
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 It freezes.

608
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,720
 It's all slow motion.

609
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,720
 And he turns and he looks at the man at the urinal next to him.

610
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,240
 It is the Zodiac killer.

611
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,760
 He goes, "That was the guy.

612
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,280
 That was 100% the guy.

613
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
 I know what he looks like.

614
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,360
 I've seen many sketches in my life.

615
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,040
 He looked like that video from AHA.

616
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,280
 He was all animated."

617
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,360
 So he actually convinces this guy, "Hey, yeah, you know, yeah, blood looks like that too.

618
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,160
 Hey, you mind if we go and talk in my office?"

619
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,520
 And the guy does.

620
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,080
 The story does get weird here because you would think an innocent person would be like,

621
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,840
 "Let me finish peeing and then no.

622
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,040
 I don't want to go in an office with someone I just met in a bathroom, but this man says,

623
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
 "Yeah, sure.

624
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,360
 I'll go in the office with you."

625
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,800
 So as they're going into the office, Tom starts giving the signal to his other conspirators

626
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,080
 who are there to help catch this guy.

627
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
 The movie's still playing.

628
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
 Everyone's having a good time.

629
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
 The movie about the serial killer.

630
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,400
 They're like, "Ha, ha, ha."

631
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
 They're laughing.

632
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
 You can watch this movie.

633
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,680
 It's actually, I don't know if it's available on Amazon, but you can watch it.

634
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,440
 It'll be in the show notes as well.

635
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,000
 I don't know if it's Laugh Ride or not.

636
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,880
 So I do know there's some interesting twists and turns.

637
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,760
 It's actually fairly well reviewed for like a Grindhouse movie, but they all walk into

638
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,280
 Tom Hanson's office and Tom Hanson's sitting there, he's talking to this guy, and he said

639
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,480
 the guy seemed extremely relaxed.

640
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,040
 Wasn't nervous at all that he was in this room full of a bunch of people who were there

641
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,760
 to catch a serial killer.

642
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,080
 Now he didn't know that obviously.

643
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,280
 He just thought Tom Hanson liked their own parties in his office.

644
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,920
 But he said, he goes, "It was interesting because of this guy.

645
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,120
 I was trying to be combative."

646
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,240
 I actually said to him, because we were talking about the Zodiac Killer, we were at the movie

647
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
 theater.

648
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,680
 I said that I was the producer of the movie.

649
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,040
 Tom Hanson said, "I had said the reason why I made the movie is that one of my relatives

650
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,280
 was a victim of the Zodiac Killer."

651
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,800
 So I have a personal stake in this.

652
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,480
 And the man didn't even react to that.

653
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,680
 He didn't get nervous, but he also didn't show sorrow.

654
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,760
 He'd be like, "Oh, I'm sorry, bro."

655
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,960
 It's just kind of no reaction at all.

656
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,480
 He also noticed it was weird because the man started winning over the room almost instantly.

657
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,600
 He said that he had served in the military.

658
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,040
 There are other people in that room who had served in the military, and they're kind

659
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,160
 of bonding over a military experience.

660
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,400
 And Tom Hanson thought it was weird.

661
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,040
 He was basically working the room.

662
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,600
 He was turning the temperature down.

663
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,400
 This stranger among all these people who were there to catch someone who looked just like

664
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
 this guy.

665
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,440
 Now Tom Hanson didn't really have anything to hold him.

666
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,080
 And this was a flaw to the plan to begin with.

667
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,760
 Even if you caught the guy, what could you really do?

668
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,640
 You could call the police and he'd be like, "Okay, I'm just gonna walk out the door because

669
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,480
 you can't prove I'm the Zodiac Killer.

670
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,160
 You definitely can't hold me captive.

671
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
 That's kidnapping."

672
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,240
 So he just kind of left at a certain point.

673
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,240
 They're talking, he's like, "Okay, I'm just gonna leave now."

674
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,400
 And Tom Hanson is sure this is the Zodiac Killer.

675
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,520
 He kind of walks out of the office.

676
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,880
 And that was totally his right.

677
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,080
 Tom Hanson doesn't...

678
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,240
 The movie, it's not a flop, but, well, one, it didn't catch the Zodiac Killer show.

679
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,960
 I mean, I guess it could be considered a failure, but it also didn't catch on.

680
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,080
 It didn't make a ton of money.

681
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,720
 It's more notorious now for the backstory to it, but like I said, you can now find it.

682
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,640
 You can now watch it on digital.

683
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,000
 So then he comes up with another plan.

684
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,160
 These next couple of plans were not nearly as audacious and were actually kind of messed

685
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
 up.

686
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,880
 If this guy was the actual Zodiac Killer, then I don't care.

687
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,640
 But if he wasn't, it's kind of mean.

688
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
 It's kind of mean.

689
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,840
 First off, you can decide which one you think is worse.

690
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,040
 He hires private investigators, they track the man down, they get his address, and then

691
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,240
 he tells the man, "Hey, remember that contest you entered to win that cowsocking motorcycle?"

692
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,440
 And the guy's like, "Yeah?"

693
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,280
 They're like, "You didn't win that."

694
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
 "Aww."

695
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,840
 "But you did win another prize."

696
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,340
 "Oh, right, awesome."

697
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,560
 "We're gonna give you this prize.

698
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,040
 We're gonna send someone to your house with this prize."

699
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,040
 He's like, "Okay, that's a weird detail that's normally how prizes are delivered."

700
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,560
 Our suspect opens the door and there's a man holding a box and he hands the box to the

701
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
 suspect.

702
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
 The suspect's like, "Aw, awesome.

703
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
 What?

704
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
 I've always wanted a box wrapped.

705
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,400
 Wrapped in some sort of thing.

706
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,200
 I don't know what's in the box yet."

707
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,720
 And then the guy goes, "Oh, oh, oh, sorry.

708
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,880
 You didn't get the prize."

709
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,320
 And then he takes the box away from the dude and walks away.

710
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
 What?

711
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,840
 What is that even?

712
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
 That's your plan?

713
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,000
 It was.

714
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 This is weird.

715
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 This is spooky.

716
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 He takes the box.

717
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,240
 He gives the box to the suspect, immediately takes it back.

718
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,840
 And then this guy, with the box now, takes it to a forensic investigator or just a guy

719
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,760
 with some baby powder and a magnifying glass.

720
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,840
 I don't know.

721
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,780
 The goal was to hand it to the dude, get his fingerprints, immediately take it back,

722
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,800
 and then match those fingerprints to known fingerprints of the Zodiac killer.

723
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,120
 That's not a bad plan, other than the fact nobody likes getting presents taken away from

724
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
 them.

725
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
 Alright, that's kind of messed up.

726
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,120
 Alright, it totally, aw, I didn't win anything.

727
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
 That sucks.

728
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,520
 I don't know if I'd wish that on anyone other than the Zodiac killer.

729
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,720
 But here's the weird thing.

730
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,840
 The hand in the box, he takes the box back, they take it to the lab, they check it out.

731
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
 No fingerprints.

732
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,320
 Now, the dude wasn't wearing gloves, right?

733
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,040
 That would be a dumb plan.

734
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
 He handed it to a guy with gloves.

735
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,560
 You're like, "This time it'll succeed."

736
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,200
 The guy obviously wasn't wearing gloves, our suspect.

737
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
 Touch the box, still no fingerprints.

738
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,200
 Now, maybe you have to touch it a little bit longer, or maybe he had his fingerprints burned

739
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
 off.

740
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,760
 I guess there's a huge thing.

741
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,400
 Could be anything in between there as well.

742
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,640
 But, or maybe the guy just wasn't going to take his fingerprints, he didn't hold it

743
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
 long enough.

744
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
 Who knows?

745
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,120
 But there are no fingerprints on that.

746
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,360
 So he tried that, that didn't work.

747
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,560
 I think that's kind of miserable to give someone something and then take it back.

748
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,840
 But then, because Tom Hanson is not one to give up, he finds out where this guy works.

749
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,200
 So he works at Bank of America.

750
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,360
 And he calls up Bank of America and goes, "Hey, can I get the personnel file of one of your

751
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
 employees?"

752
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
 And the manager goes, "No.

753
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,720
 We don't know who you are.

754
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
 I'll open an account.

755
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,760
 I'll open one of your SuperSaver accounts."

756
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,520
 And the manager's like, "Tell me more."

757
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,400
 But no, the manager goes, "No, we will not give you access to this employee's files."

758
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,360
 And then the manager asks the question, which I think he would ask.

759
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,120
 I don't know if Tom Hanson called him up from the Kentucky Fried Chicken he was managing.

760
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,760
 You hear a chicken grilling in the background, chickens getting chased around the kitchen.

761
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,120
 I think he had one of the private investigators call him up.

762
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,880
 But anyways, the private investigator calls up the bank, asks for this guy's personnel

763
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
 file.

764
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,000
 They tell him, "No, but what do you want it for?"

765
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,520
 And they said, "We think he's the Zodiac killer."

766
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,080
 So that guy got fired from his job.

767
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,640
 That guy straight up got doxxed and fired from his job.

768
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,320
 And then pretty much just disappeared.

769
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,600
 Which would make sense if people were calling up your workplace and telling them you were

770
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,000
 the Zodiac killer.

771
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,560
 Most estimates are now that whoever the Zodiac killer is, he's long dead.

772
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,200
 Some people say it was some dude's dad, like this guy's written a book saying, "My dad,

773
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
 the Zodiac killer."

774
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,000
 I was always a little confused because my dad didn't teach me anything about the planets.

775
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,200
 He'd only talk about the constellations all the time.

776
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,640
 And before I learned my ABCs, I learned to write in rones.

777
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,960
 I was like, "Hmm, my dad might be a serial killer."

778
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,560
 He has extra Snickers.

779
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,960
 In 1986, he got extra candy from a little boy.

780
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,680
 And then I've heard that, you know, like he, that he died back in like the 60s or 70s,

781
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,960
 or he was arrested and thrown in prison for something else.

782
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,400
 There's always these interesting things.

783
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,440
 Jeffrey Dahmer, there's always been a theory that Jeffrey Dahmer may have killed that little

784
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,720
 Adam Walsh.

785
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,600
 There was, that was a big case when I was a little kid.

786
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,240
 I remember that was the first year I was like, "Oh, great.

787
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,440
 I'm not going to be able to play in where the Red Ferns grow anymore."

788
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,800
 There was that young boy.

789
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,440
 It's a horrible story.

790
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,520
 Adam Walsh was kidnapped from like a local strip mall.

791
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,160
 This is all off memory, so.

792
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,880
 But Adam Walsh was kidnapped from a local strip mall, and then they found his head in

793
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,360
 a swamp, or they found his body and not his head.

794
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
 It was one or the other.

795
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,880
 It's grisly either way, and then you may know the name Walsh, his dad.

796
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,540
 I don't remember his dad's full name, but he was the one who started America's Most

797
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
 Wanted.

798
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,080
 He had started all these child protection groups after his son had died.

799
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,480
 So it was a super high profile case, especially when I was a kid.

800
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,280
 They made that movie, "Where's Adam?"

801
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,520
 Like, I was six, man.

802
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,600
 I was, I don't think I was six when the crime actually took place, but I remember being a

803
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,880
 little kid in the 80s, and it'd be like, "ABC tonight.

804
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
 Adam!

805
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,000
 A nation in the grip of terror.

806
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Where's Adam?

807
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 I don't know.

808
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 You tell me where he's at."

809
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,320
 And then they'd see scenes of cops walking through a swamp tonight on ABC.

810
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,520
 I was terrified, man.

811
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,320
 Some spooky stuff to see as a kid.

812
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
 Spooky.

813
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,280
 And I remember, though, that was when I remember that movie, "Where's Adam?"

814
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,480
 And I thought, "Oh, this isn't good."

815
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,040
 Like, obviously, it scared me to feel bad for the kid.

816
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,440
 I also remember, though, that there is a sea change coming as far as, like, what we could

817
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
 do as kids.

818
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,640
 I wasn't a dummy.

819
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
 I wasn't the smartest kid on the planet.

820
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,680
 But I wasn't a dummy either.

821
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,720
 Like, I could sense social changes, I think, even back then.

822
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
 I knew I was like, "Hmm.

823
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,040
 I don't have a lot of memories as a kid, but for some weird reason I remember that.

824
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,160
 I remember watching commercials for that movie and being like, "Oh, this is why we can't

825
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,880
 go out anymore because ABC made a movie of the week."

826
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
 Horrible story.

827
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:07,840
 Major, it was a national crime, it was one of the first big missing kid things.

828
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,840
 One of the first big national missing kid things.

829
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:18,000
 And now there is a theory that that was Jeffrey Dahmer who did that because he lived in, he

830
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,480
 was in the area at the time.

831
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,000
 But I don't know where I was going with that.

832
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,160
 I think now I'm just saying basically serial killer true crime trivia without being trivial,

833
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,360
 just kind of weird elements in it.

834
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,360
 I do want to end the episode with this, though.

835
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,320
 I think it's fascinating.

836
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,760
 We used to, I'll say it, we used to glorify serial killers.

837
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,360
 You'd be books and movies based on these people.

838
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,960
 How many movies about Ted Bundy?

839
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,000
 Again, super boring serial killer.

840
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,240
 I'm going to make a prediction.

841
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,360
 I think they're holding off on it because on the one hand they say they don't want to

842
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,520
 glorify it, but I think they're just waiting for the right moment.

843
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,000
 I think we've moved past glorifying serial killers and I think we're moving closer to

844
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,560
 glorifying mass shooters.

845
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
 I think we already do that.

846
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,400
 I think there's already parts of society that do do that.

847
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,800
 I think you're actually going to start seeing movies and books based on mass shooters.

848
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,800
 Now I know you have had Columbine.

849
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,680
 You know movies based on Columbine, like Elephant.

850
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,680
 You've had movies that are like slightly based on the events.

851
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,280
 I think you're going to start seeing more of that.

852
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,720
 I think the kids who grew up with that as they start to control the mechanisms of culture.

853
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,440
 When my people were in charge, my age range was in charge.

854
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,080
 We had Transformers movies.

855
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,280
 We had movies, G.I. Joe movies and stuff like that.

856
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,280
 We're still running the things.

857
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,280
 That's why all these Marvel movies are so huge.

858
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,480
 We're the controllers of the mechanism.

859
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,000
 Just a generation or two ago, remember you had the Flintstones and the Adams Family movies?

860
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,640
 You had this whole retro-bingion and they appealed to everybody, but when the generation

861
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,840
 is in power, they go, "Hey, remember those times?"

862
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,160
 I think we're going to get to a point where they're making live-action Ed Edd and Eddie

863
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,600
 movies and a live-action Ren and Stimpy movie.

864
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,320
 And the kids who grew up with Are You Afraid of the Dark and all this stuff, they're going

865
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,560
 to want to tell more stories about these mass shooters.

866
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,440
 The people who were watching Virginia Tech and it really affected them.

867
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,720
 By the time it was happening, when it happened, I was older and I go, "Well, that's a tragic

868
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,720
 thing.

869
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
 It didn't affect my psyche."

870
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,480
 Columbine did slightly because my younger brother was in high school at the time and

871
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,600
 it was just this bizarre thing.

872
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,920
 But I've never had a massive fascination with Columbine itself.

873
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
 But I think you're going to see that.

874
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,360
 I think you're going to start seeing more movies, more books and everything like that.

875
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,440
 I think there's less of a mystique because they get caught right away.

876
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,920
 They usually die right away.

877
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,120
 But for some people, that adds to the mystique.

878
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,120
 So we'll see.

879
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,440
 We'll see if culture starts to move away from these Netflix movies where Zac Efron

880
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,200
 is playing Ted Bundy and we start to see movies with Keenan and Kel shooting up a nightclub

881
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,200
 or something like that.

882
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,920
 Like, I think, I know that's a flippant joke, but it's actually not a joke.

883
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,400
 I think we're moving in that direction.

884
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,080
 I think we'll see that.

885
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,000
 My thing I'm curious about is we've moved past serial killish in the most part, they're

886
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,160
 kind of lame.

887
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,320
 Now we're going to be, I believe we're moving into an era of the mass shooters being celebrated.

888
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
 Dorner, that guy.

889
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,320
 You got a whole bunch of them.

890
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,440
 A whole bunch of hits you can unfortunately choose from.

891
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,440
 I wonder what the net, let's prognosticate 50 years in the future.

892
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,520
 What's the next big crime that's going to capture the imagination of humans?

893
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,520
 What's next?

894
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,920
 What else is coming down the pipe?

895
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,640
 Because in the 1910s, you never would have thought you would have a bunch of serial killers

896
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,320
 running around from the 60s to the 80s and to the early 90s.

897
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,680
 You don't have many nowadays.

898
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,080
 When you were in the 60s, 70s, 80s, you would never think, even though schools were getting

899
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,720
 shot up all the time in poor neighborhoods, in black neighborhoods, school shootings were

900
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,000
 quite common.

901
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,840
 You would have never thought in the 80s that schools would be war zones and colleges and

902
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,320
 nightclubs and things like that would get shot up.

903
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,000
 So now we're here today.

904
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,760
 What is going to be the next big crime wave that's just going to shock the nation that's

905
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,560
 going to keep happening over and over and over again?

906
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,160
 Who knows?

907
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:33,120
 All we can guarantee is that someone will make a movie about it.

908
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,700
 (upbeat music)

909
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,280
 (upbeat music)

910
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,860
 (upbeat music)

911
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,440
 (upbeat music)

912
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,020
 (upbeat music)

913
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,600
 (upbeat music)

914
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,180
 (upbeat music)

915
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,760
 (upbeat music)

916
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,340
 (upbeat music)

917
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,920
 (upbeat music)
