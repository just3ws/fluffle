1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 In an era before mass shootings, a school game kills multiple school administrators in Texas.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:18,640
 And then we travel to Glen Rock, Wyoming, where we hear the mysterious tale of an entire town that woke up at 2.45 AM

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,200
 because someone or something was knocking on their doors today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,800
 *music*

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:48,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. However, I have some bad news and the interesting thing about bad news is you never really appreciated life before the bad news.

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,800
 9/11, for example. We didn't know Generation X. We didn't know how good we had it.

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,880
 We had great music, great movies, great television. We had it all.

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,640
 And then we were attacked, terrorists took down the Twin Towers, 3,000 casualties.

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:16,080
 And we look back and we can see a clear line demarcation I believe is another word I can use. Could be using it incorrectly, so...

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,080
 Anyways, there's a line there. Pre-9/11, post-9/11. We just had another event like that.

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:36,600
 We will always remember the times before this. The Halloween on 2019, October 31st, 2019, will forever be no one as the last holiday before Baby Yoda.

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:44,280
 Prepare for the next 10,000 Halloween, the rest of our lives at least, Baby Yoda's.

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:54,280
 Every baby is going to be dressed up. I am so thankful that we got to experience just one last Halloween. One last Halloween before the Mandalorian came out.

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:04,120
 It's Baby Yoda's all the way down. It's going to be so many dads, maybe some moms dressed up as the Mandalorian.

16
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,400
 Or Hilby the Mandalorian and the mom will dress up as Kara the drop trooper.

17
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:20,880
 Baby Yoda's. So many Baby Yoda's. And we will as an entire species remember the good old days.

18
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,400
 When people dress their babies up as corn on the cob or bunnies or princesses. That's...

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,880
 It's nothing but Baby Yoda's. And I know what you're thinking, Jason, you're doing a bit and it's barely funny. This is no bit.

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:43,680
 This is serious, guys. This is DEF CON Yoda green. I think we should just cancel Halloween at this point before it gets too out of hand.

21
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,520
 Let's go ahead and move on with our first topic here. Finally, we're moving on to our first topic. We are headed to Texas.

22
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,400
 Houston, Texas to be specific. The year is 1983. So put on your cowboy hats.

23
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:05,280
 We're walking around Texas, got our cowboy hats and our big old cowboy boots and we're going to high school. So we're also now de-aged. We're teenagers.

24
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,960
 So we walk on to high school, we're walking around. And I'm going to try out for the football team. I don't know, you go to the Science Lab or Drama Club or whatever.

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,640
 I'm going, so I'm at the football. I've ditched you. You're like, "Hey, dude, I want to listen to your podcast." I'm all running. Yay.

26
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,160
 I'm young again. I can, I'm doing cartwheels. I can never do a cartwheel.

27
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,480
 Now I'm trying out for the football team and you're like sitting in the bleachers and I'm just yelling the rest of the story.

28
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:36,160
 And as we're talking, as I'm talking and you're like, "What? What? I can't hear you." Over the sounds of testosterone.

29
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:47,880
 All of a sudden an announcement comes over the loudspeakers. This is your principal speaking. Everyone hide somewhere. Go, go, go. Run, run, run.

30
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:57,080
 We're like, "Ah, hurry up. Go, go, go. They're coming. They're... And then we hear like the thing, the microphone is what it's called to go out."

31
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,880
 We're like, "Ah, we're running, running across the football field." Nowadays we would assume, you know, like a school shooting is happening, right?

32
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,000
 But back then, 1983, there really wasn't a thing. I mean, it was when that dude climbed up that, wasn't that in Texas too?

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,040
 The guy with the rifle who was shooting kids at this episode's World Research.

34
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,040
 What was that guy? He's real famous, not Lee Harvey Oswald. He was the guy... I know a bunch of you guys are yelling right now.

35
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,200
 He was the guy who climbed the clock tower and like shot like a bunch of dudes.

36
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:34,700
 Anyways, anyways, that's not the point. So, as I'm standing in the football field, trying to remember this guy's name, everyone else has run off in a panic.

37
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,080
 And you're like, "Jason, Jason, it doesn't matter. Just run, run, run." I'm like, "Hmm, what is that guy's name? Maybe I should look it up."

38
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,580
 The point of this segment is not to do with that guy. The point of this segment is this.

39
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:56,080
 In 1983, around January 1983, the schools of Houston, Texas were plagued by a street gang that was killing school administrators.

40
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,080
 Principles were getting killed, left and right. This gang may kill you, but you could avoid them.

41
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:12,080
 If you wore blue, you were spared. Or, if you wore blue, you got killed. So now you don't know what to do, right?

42
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,080
 Depending on the school, you gotta wear blue to be protected. Or, if you wear blue, you're a target.

43
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
 Sky blue, to be exact. You just can't wear like a other blue. Sky blue.

44
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,080
 You would know this gang though. See, they had their colors. They'd wear black jackets.

45
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,080
 Wait, no. Depending on the school, sometimes they wouldn't wear sky blue clothing.

46
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,080
 Wait, no, no. This other school, they actually didn't wear any clothes or didn't wear any shirt, I guess.

47
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 They wore pants, but their body was painted sky blue. Which would honestly be the worst gang ever.

48
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:55,080
 One of the advantages of being in a modern gang, especially, is you have colors that you can fly very, very quickly and discreetly in the right areas.

49
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:02,080
 So this gang, though, they're just painted blue. So, if cops are driving on the street and they're like, "Be on the lookout for this gang,"

50
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,080
 and they see a bunch of blue people, blue man groups in on the corner, they're like, "There they are!"

51
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,080
 They're leaving blue hand paint everywhere when they're running. So, who are these guys?

52
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,080
 Even though each school had a different description, a different way how to avoid getting killed by these guys,

53
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,080
 some people said that they showed up at your house, some people said that they beat you up in the bathroom, killed you in the bathroom.

54
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,080
 Everyone agreed on the name of this gang. They were called the Smurfs. These guys were the Smurfs.

55
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:43,080
 It was a street gang that actually existed in Houston, Texas. And they pretty much -- there was about 50 members, 50 people got arrested for petty larceny, stuff like that.

56
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,080
 But the legend grew that the Smurfs -- rumors are going around, they're killing principals. It's not true.

57
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,080
 Principles who were rumored to have been killed over the weekend had to get on the loudspeaker out of their school and be like,

58
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,080
 "Attention, class, I'm not dead. I was not murdered by Smurfs. Please calm down."

59
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,080
 Parents were keeping their kids out of school. They thought they were going to be attacked by Smurfs.

60
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,080
 I always think it's interesting when -- this is like an urban, urban legend.

61
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,080
 I like -- we hear all sorts of stories about hitchhiking ghosts and stuff like that.

62
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,080
 You know what I mean? Like, urban -- but this is like an urban legend from the streets. And I don't mean that from like a black thing.

63
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,080
 I mean that like -- how many urban legends do you hear that start off in densely packed cities?

64
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,080
 Usually they're in between the cities or their remote stories or they're in the suburbs.

65
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 Every so often you'll come across an urban legend that is city-based. We covered one with the bus in Detroit or Michigan or wherever that was.

66
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,080
 That would take away your soul. We had the Decepticon urban legend and this one.

67
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 I really like the fantasy kind of urban stories that actually take place in an urban environment.

68
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,080
 So I thought there was interesting. And this is a lead-in because tomorrow we're going to talk about demonic Smurfs.

69
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,080
 These ones were people who just took on the Smurf name. Apparently huge fans of pale.

70
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:16,080
 Tomorrow we're going to talk about real life, supposedly real life stories about Smurfs themselves, three apples high, appearing in our world and attacking children.

71
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,080
 But first, I got another story for you. So we're leaving behind Texas, hopping the Jason's Loppy.

72
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,080
 You know what? I'm going to let you drive this time too. So I'm going to kick back in the back with my cowboy hat.

73
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,080
 I got a little piece of wheat in my mouth saying goodbye to all my high school friends.

74
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,080
 And then I'll come back for the homecoming game and they're like, "Don't! You're 43 years old! That's weird!"

75
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 I'm like, "I'll see you guys later!" We get to Wyoming. It's 2.45 a.m. We're in the town of Glenrock.

76
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:52,080
 Not only is it 2.45 a.m., more importantly, it's February 27th, 1988. This is out of our 1988 file that I've been doing recently.

77
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,080
 I've been finding some really good stuff. These are supposed to start off to be short stories, but I'm finding some really cool stuff here.

78
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,080
 So Glenrock, as of 2010, had a population of about 2,500 people. So in 1988, it's going to be less than that.

79
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,080
 Just giving you an idea of how small this town is. Very, very small town. And it's 2.45 a.m.

80
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,080
 Ring, ring, ring, tch. Glenrock Police Department.

81
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:24,080
 Hey, um, apparently Michael Jackson lives in this town. Hey, um, I think there's someone outside my house.

82
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,080
 There's something going on. Can he send someone out? Yeah, yeah, I'll get the information. Click ring, ring.

83
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,080
 Glenrock Police Department. Hey, yeah, um, I think there's a prowler outside my house.

84
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,080
 Oh, oh, okay, we'll get your information. We'll send someone over. Click ring, ring.

85
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,080
 Glenrock, yeah, you gotta get out here. There's someone outside my house.

86
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,080
 That goes on. Do you like that theater of the mind? Did you feel like you were in that police station?

87
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,080
 50 calls within 15 minutes. Someone is outside. Someone's in my backyard.

88
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,080
 I'm in my car. And I think someone's outside my car.

89
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,080
 Now, obviously, the last one, you could look out the window and you could go, there's no one out there.

90
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:14,080
 But across the town of Glenrock, at 2.45 a.m., people woke up.

91
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,080
 What? Who's knocking on my door at this hour?

92
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:31,080
 Well, I might have imagined the first set, but if I'm hearing it again, there must be three sets of three knocks each.

93
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,080
 And the way I was doing it was very human. That's how a human would knock, right?

94
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,080
 They said it almost sounded, it was so rhythmic, it was mechanical.

95
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,080
 This one woman, she hears the first set of knocks, she wakes up, "Oh, I'm in the world."

96
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,080
 Here's the second set of knocks, goes into the living room, and her dog is just sitting in front of the door staring.

97
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,080
 And then the third set of knocks.

98
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,080
 One woman's upstairs, here's the knocks. As she's coming downstairs, here's the second set of knocks.

99
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,080
 And her living room was bathed in an orange glow.

100
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,080
 One woman hears the knocks, she goes to the door, she opens the door, looks out at the dark neighborhood.

101
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,080
 But was it really dark? This is how she described it.

102
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:23,080
 I saw the stars, but there was a very bright haze.

103
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,080
 Then I saw shadows running against the garage.

104
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,080
 Her dog, her protector, right next to her, just stayed there.

105
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,080
 Didn't chase the figures that were moving across her yard.

106
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:44,080
 Reportedly the town was covered in a thick fog, but it hovered 10 feet off the ground.

107
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:51,080
 Which I think technically is a cloud. But for sake of atmosphere, they used the term "fog."

108
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:58,080
 The police calls were coming in, someone's outside my house. Again, someone was in their car, they heard the knocks on the side of the door of their car.

109
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:06,080
 People said that it sounded like a sledgehammer.

110
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,080
 Some people said they could hear it coming from the roof or the attic area.

111
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,080
 Second story, the phone calls go in, the police start looking around, rumors start to spread.

112
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,080
 There was a metallic object spotted hanging over a trailer park at the edge of town.

113
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,080
 Police cars in pursuit of subjects stop working out of nowhere.

114
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,080
 Children in aluminum suits running through the darkness.

115
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,080
 Those last three weren't reported anywhere else but one article.

116
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:41,080
 What's interesting is that they say that this was reported in a newspaper called "The Glen Rock Independent."

117
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,080
 But when I looked around, when I was looking this information up, because I had the 1988 file,

118
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,080
 which is just if you're not a regular listener of the show, I have a series of stories that all take place in 1988.

119
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,080
 There are small little paragraphs and sometimes they're interesting enough that I extrapolate out from them.

120
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,080
 I had that to go off of them. When I was typing in "Glenn Rock, Wyoming, Knockings" and stuff like that,

121
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,080
 there's quite a few websites but they all seem to kind of go back to each other.

122
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,080
 And none of them I could find was actually showing the exact article.

123
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,080
 Now we've done stories where we find articles from 1898 boat crashes and old ghosts and stuff like that.

124
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:24,080
 Old newspapers. 1988 is not long ago. I was 12 in 1988. That was 30 years ago.

125
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,080
 I could probably find a physical newspaper from 1988, go to a library or something like that.

126
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,080
 So that's not, maybe not physical. It'd be on microfiche. The point is, is that.

127
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,080
 It's not super long ago. That makes me a little suspicious.

128
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,080
 Now this story got popularized by Whitley Striper.

129
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:47,080
 He's the guy who wrote Communion, which really popularized the idea of the gray aliens of getting abducted and all that stuff.

130
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:55,080
 I've never read Whitley Striper. It's funny. Obviously I know of him. He's very famous in the UFO community.

131
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,080
 But I've never read it. I've never been a huge fan of the stories of gray aliens or alien abductions

132
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:08,080
 where they take you aboard and either give you some hippy nature lesson or they put, you know, like, they examine you.

133
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,080
 That stuff's never been intriguing to me. So that's why I really don't cover a lot of that stuff on my show

134
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,080
 and that's why when it's down to read this guy's books, whatever, I get it.

135
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,080
 Aliens abduct you and... If it happened to me, it'd be the most important event in my life.

136
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,080
 But it hasn't. I don't find it particularly fascinating unless there's some other crazy element.

137
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 We have some crazy stories coming up. But anyways, the point is, is that I've never read this dude's books.

138
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,080
 But he wrote a book about his experience. So this is where it gets a little trippy.

139
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,080
 Now, again, let's assume this is true because it's also possible that this was completely reversed in "Engineer."

140
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:50,080
 It never existed. And Whitley Striper wrote his account of something that happened and then...

141
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,080
 But let's just assume that it's real for right now, for the narrative of where we're going.

142
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,080
 Whitley Striper's hanging out in a cabin. This is after he got abducted by gray aliens the very first time.

143
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,080
 Very, very popular story. I'm not knocking it. I'm not saying he's a fraud or anything like that.

144
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,080
 I don't know enough about it. I just know that it's gray aliens and stuff like that.

145
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,080
 Trusting in that, you know, knock yourself out reading his books. I don't know anything about him to debunk him.

146
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:18,080
 But he writes communion and he ties a lot of the alien stories into folklore,

147
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 which I've actually been reading about that as well.

148
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:29,080
 "Valley" he writes... His idea is that all fairies and gnomes and stuff like that are the same as aliens.

149
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:37,080
 Aliens are some sort of interdimensional thing that uses our myths or uses what we currently believe in to communicate with us.

150
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:44,080
 So back in the old times, people believed in magic, so they would communicate with us and kidnap us, abduct us as fairies and gnomes.

151
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,080
 As technology started to get more advanced, it became "Durgeables," mystery airships. We talked about that recently.

152
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,080
 And then as we started dropping nukes and building jet fighters, now they're appearing in these metallic disks and stuff like that.

153
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,080
 He believes aliens are interdimensional. We'll do a whole story on him, I think, because that's fascinating.

154
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
 But the point is this.

155
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:08,080
 "Witley Shriver" kind of believes the same thing, that folklore has a lot to do with aliens.

156
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,080
 And if you look back, "knockings" is a thing. "Poltergeist" had the rapping during this...

157
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:21,080
 They have a stupid joke. They have the knockings as spiritualists. That's how they communicate with knockings.

158
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 There's old occult ceremonies that you open and close portals through knocking as well.

159
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:34,080
 So he believes, "Witley Shriver" believes that the knocking, specifically the three sets of nine knocks, had some cultural or folklore significance.

160
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:43,080
 What happened to him was in August 27th, 1986, I believe, August 27th, 1986, he'd already been abducted by aliens.

161
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 He's still trying to figure that stuff out. He's at a remote cabin.

162
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:57,080
 It's the last place I would go if I've already been abducted by aliens. He hears knocking, three sets of three knocks each, on his second story near the roof.

163
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:03,080
 Wakes him up, totally freaks him out. His cat apparently runs and hides and doesn't come out of its hiding spot for the next day.

164
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:12,080
 He hears this knocking. He attributes it to some sort of opening ceremony, folklore relation thing.

165
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,080
 Because nothing comes through, nothing dramatic happens at night. He just hears the three sets of three knocks.

166
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 He publishes that in a book, transformations, I believe.

167
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:27,080
 And that book comes out a month after this incident in Glenrock.

168
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,080
 So it's not like these stories were influenced by his books and his books were huge bestsellers.

169
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,080
 He actually wrote horror books before this.

170
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,080
 So he was already an established author. He writes communion, which is supposedly a true story. It's a bestseller.

171
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,080
 He's writing these books so it's possible if the book came out before that it was totally just inspired by the creepy story.

172
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,080
 He's saying not only is that not the case, my book was published after Glenrock happened.

173
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
 It was written before, but it was published a month later.

174
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,080
 His event happened on August 27th, 1986.

175
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,080
 This event that we're talking about now happened on February 27th, 1988.

176
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,080
 Exactly 18 months apart. Now, when I counted it, it was 19 months, but whatever.

177
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,080
 Whatever. I think if you go day to day, it may be 18 months.

178
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:22,080
 And 18 months is three sets of six. Six is three. So, three, three, three.

179
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,080
 So other people have kind of glommed onto the story that a portal...

180
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:34,080
 Here's a couple different scenarios. One, Whitley Stryber, the knocks he heard was the opening of a portal.

181
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:41,080
 And he was in the middle of nowhere. And when I say middle of nowhere, it was the middle of nowhere, but it was in the state of New York.

182
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
 So it wasn't in Wyoming. It was nowhere near that.

183
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,080
 But he was like a little cabin out in the middle of nowhere in the state of New York.

184
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,080
 So the knocking he heard may have been the opening of some sort of portal.

185
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:59,080
 Now, because he's in again in the middle of nowhere, there may have been other knocking that was happening in the vicinity, but he was the only person to report it.

186
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,080
 It may be some sort of event. Knock, knock, whatever.

187
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:10,080
 So you have that theory, and then whether or not it was just his house or the wrapping happened throughout the forest, who knows.

188
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:19,080
 But 18 months later in Glen Rock, Wyoming, you have this massive amount, and that was the closing of the portal. That's one theory.

189
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:26,080
 The other theory is that Whitley Stryber, that was an opening of a portal, and Glen Rock was the opening of an even bigger portal.

190
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:35,080
 There's been theories that us dropping nukes and experimenting with nuclear technologies, what attracted UFOs to the world.

191
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,080
 I've also heard theories that it could have been Alistair Crowley. It could have been the creation of magic.

192
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,080
 And it's funny because when we look at the early rocket program, you had that dude, Jack Parsons.

193
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,080
 Jack Parsons was a rocket specialist and an occultist.

194
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,080
 He used to run with L. Ron Hubbard. They had this thing where they were trying to get... Did I cover this on an earlier episode?

195
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:06,080
 He was trying to get this chick to be pregnant with the anti-crash or something like that, like banging this chick and L. Ron Hubbard.

196
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,080
 It was weird three... I don't remember exactly the details.

197
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,080
 But the point is that we had these things coinciding at the same time.

198
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:24,080
 So what was weird is you had this dude, Jack Parsons, you had the culmination of human scientific discovery and people starting to open their minds up to magic.

199
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 To rediscovering magic.

200
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
 Wiccan was becoming a big thing as well.

201
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,080
 So is it possible that it wasn't the nuclear weapon testing that made aliens come to us?

202
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,080
 Is it possible that Alistair Crowley and these people were actually successful and they opened up some sort of portal?

203
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:48,080
 That the super bizarre conspiracy theory that aliens are demons from hell may not be that far-fetched.

204
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:57,080
 That they may not be this super advanced technological species, but a species... Another species, yes.

205
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:05,080
 But not just from another planet, not just from another dimension as Valet would say, but from hell. Demons.

206
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,080
 The knocking of nine is an occult thing. It's a numerological thing.

207
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 You can find occult references to three sets of three knockings.

208
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:22,080
 Does that do these simple little stories put together make us think that, yes, all aliens are demons?

209
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
 I don't think there's enough evidence there to support that.

210
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,080
 I do think that it's a path worth looking into, but I don't necessarily think it is.

211
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,080
 I think the answer might actually be more mundane than that.

212
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,080
 And no, I'm not going to be so skeptical that I think a guy was running around, glen rock,

213
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,080
 knocking on people's houses in the car doors and stuff like that.

214
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
 Here's the thing. We don't know what...

215
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,080
 Whitley Stryber, sure, got abducted by aliens, but nothing ever happens in a vacuum.

216
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,080
 I could be abducted by aliens tonight and they would get wrecked.

217
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,080
 I would break their bones, but I could get abducted by aliens tonight.

218
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,080
 That wouldn't mean that all the stories I've ever experienced with ghosts and demons and stuff like that

219
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,080
 doesn't mean those things never happened, right?

220
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,080
 Nothing happens in a vacuum. Well, this is the vacuum of space and you're on a UFO.

221
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,080
 I could have ghost stories and see all this stuff and interact with this crazy stuff

222
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,080
 and get abducted by aliens. It's possible that Whitley Stryber, the knocking on his house,

223
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,080
 was not an alien at all. He was in a haunted house, right?

224
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,080
 It's possible.

225
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,080
 So what does that have to do with glen rock? Glen rock, now this might not fit so magically, numerically,

226
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,080
 and things like that, but glen rock was actually the site of a mass casualty event.

227
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,080
 No, it was in the Smurf's. They didn't attack the school.

228
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,080
 On September 23rd, 1923, there's a lot of threes there, isn't there?

229
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,080
 2323 and I'm not one of those guys. Also September's the ninth month of the year.

230
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,080
 You can listen to countless episodes where I talk trash about people who do stuff with numbers.

231
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 However, there are some weird numbers in this one.

232
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,080
 September 9th month of the year, nine knocks, 23, that we're back to that satanic number six,

233
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,080
 1923, 923. Train is driving through glen rock.

234
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,080
 Now there was a massive rainstorm for the previous three days,

235
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,080
 and it wiped away one of the bridges over Cole Creek.

236
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,080
 Now this train has a bunch of passengers on it, choo choo, going through.

237
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:30,080
 Rain's coming. This is terrifying, and I always hate this image, but the train's coming around the track,

238
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,080
 and right when you come around the track, that's where the bridge is supposed to be.

239
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,080
 They're war survivors of this incident, and according to them, the train's going at normal speed.

240
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,080
 It's going like 30 miles an hour, and it comes around the track,

241
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,080
 and that break is pulled a couple feet before it goes off the rails.

242
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,080
 Like imagine going off a cliff and then hitting the brakes,

243
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,080
 and again, you could be 10 feet from going off the cliffs and hit the brakes. It's not going to do any good,

244
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,080
 but you still have that natural instinct, the conductor,

245
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:07,080
 pulled that break as the train is going into the air, crashes into the river,

246
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,080
 it actually digs into the soft silt and the dirt, the water, it's still flooded down there.

247
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,080
 It had five train cars, the first car goes in, just completely destroyed on impact.

248
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,080
 The next three cars pile on top of each other, completely destroying the third car,

249
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,080
 it's sandwiched in between the second and the fourth car, the fifth car is kind of off somewhere.

250
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,080
 They have to start rescuing people. Rescue train shows up,

251
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
 and even though there was such a thing, it has a big siren on it,

252
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,080
 it's good it's not any louder than the train itself, so it doesn't really work.

253
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,080
 Rescue train shows up. You have to throw a rope over this raging river,

254
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,080
 and people are having to climb, just passengers on a train.

255
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,080
 This isn't Sylvester Stallone's cliffhanger, they're not going to the Alps,

256
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,080
 these are just normal people and they're having to do hand over hand over this raging river

257
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,080
 to get one guy was carrying a baby, it was nuts, but anyways,

258
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,080
 66 passengers are on this train, 30 dead.

259
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,080
 Now again, not a huge fan of numerology because you can bend them into anything,

260
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,080
 but there's a lot of three. So what does this have to do with anything, Jason?

261
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,080
 Well, what if this was just ghosts?

262
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,080
 Instead of aliens, instead of it matching up 18 months from Whitley Straber's thing,

263
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,080
 what if Whitley Straber's thing wasn't some sort of portal?

264
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:26,080
 What he experienced was ghostly activity, and what these people in Glen Rock experienced was ghostly activity.

265
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,080
 There's no proof that there was some sort of metallic object over the trailer park,

266
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,080
 the car is shutting down, we don't know any of that stuff.

267
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,080
 Aliens, when we look at stories of aliens, has there ever been a time where they've done anything like this before, either?

268
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,080
 That's something else we should look at.

269
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
 Basically harass an entire neighborhood.

270
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,080
 But there are times where ghosts have done this.

271
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,080
 Maybe not an entire neighborhood, but there are definitely times where ghosts have done knocking.

272
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,080
 That's very more, if you said you heard an unusual knocking in your house, would you,

273
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,080
 if you had never been abducted by an alien or never seen a ghost,

274
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,080
 but every night or once a week or whatever, you hear nine knocks.

275
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,080
 Would you, based on your mythology, would you base that on ghosts or base that on aliens?

276
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,080
 If Whitley Straber had never been abducted by an alien, he would have assumed that was a ghost in his attic.

277
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,080
 And he's the one, Whitley Straber's the one who really talks about this story in Glen Rock.

278
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,080
 So it has an alien haze to it.

279
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,080
 But it's possible that it's just ghosts, assuming that the story's true at all.

280
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:33,080
 It's possible that it's not aliens, but something more mundane in the sense that it's lost spirits from this train crash.

281
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,080
 It's some sort of passing of spirits.

282
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,080
 That's why there's so many of them, because so many people passed.

283
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:47,080
 It's funny to say that ghosts make more sense than aliens, but I think in this case it does.

284
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,080
 Obviously if you see like a metal disk flying through the sky and a bunch of aliens jump out of it with power rifles,

285
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,080
 you're not going to go, "Hmm, I wonder if anyone's died here. Is there an Indian barrel ground?"

286
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
 That would make you think they're aliens.

287
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,080
 But again, so that's the mundane answer, ghosts.

288
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,080
 Whitley Straber and others have the answer of aliens.

289
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,080
 But the answer may lie somewhere in between.

290
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
 No, not ghost aliens.

291
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:19,080
 So it's a gamble when you wake up later and you hear that first set of knocks.

292
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,080
 It's a gamble whether or not you open that door.

293
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,080
 If it's a ghost, what's the worst it's going to do?

294
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:36,080
 Knock your pots and pans around, make you lose a couple pennies, hide under your bed.

295
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,080
 If it's an alien, you may get abducted.

296
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:47,080
 You may get put back in your bed after a good night's sleep and a head full of false memories.

297
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,080
 But you don't know until you open that door.

298
00:27:51,080 --> 00:28:00,080
 Because it could be a ghost that wants vengeance, that doesn't want to stay invisible and hide,

299
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,080
 but wants a new body to commit evil acts.

300
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:13,080
 Or it could be an alien that has no intention of returning you to your bed or even to Earth,

301
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,080
 but turning you into some sort of experiment.

302
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,080
 No one will ever know what happened to you.

303
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:28,080
 But you won't know until you open that door.

304
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
