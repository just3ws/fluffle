1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 A ghost in Golden Gate Park that made front page news.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,000
 And then we take a look at the bizarre new conspiracy.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Is the band Jimmy Eat World connected to a death cult today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 [music]

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I'll keep it brief. I'm so hot in here.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 So we're gonna call this the 98 to 98 degrees special.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Okay, it's so hot. I actually just had to pour myself a...

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hear that? That's a nice cup of diet sprite.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with our first story here.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Now our first story is actually really interesting one,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 because when I started it, I found out about it because of Backpack Reverse.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Now I've talked about Backpack Reverse before.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Here's the thing, in the paranormal community, it's basically a big family.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 You have Art Bell, George Norrie, they're like the grandpas.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 They're the guys who are like the old timers.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And then you have those two dudes who do Mysterious Universe.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Those are your uncles that were kind of like college frat boys

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 and they finally got their stuff together and were able to find out a way to make money

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 off of all the hijinks they pulled in college.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 The last podcast on the left are the nephews you buy your weed from.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And if you ever ask them a question, it takes them a whole hour to answer it.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And then usually they say, "Come back next week and we'll finish telling you the answer."

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 But Backpacker Universe in this family of the paranormal community is your hot cousin

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 that you always sleep with during your family reunions.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Like you know you shouldn't be involved with Backpacker Reverse.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 You get it. She's hot, but she's so strong.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 She's really, you're related to her, so you shouldn't do anything with her.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 But she's so hot, she's so dazzling, you keep getting attracted to her.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 But at the same time, she is dumb as a rock.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 That is Backpacker Reverse in the family of the paranormal community.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And this is what I mean when I say she's dazzling and enchanting is all of their stuff on their website

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 is so overblown, blood on the walls, and then the guy walked out and then the ghost jumped

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 and it looked like Abraham Lincoln and the tourist face-off and it was really like Aaron Burr.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Who's the guy who shot Abraham Lincoln?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Anyways, anyways, the point being is that they just make stuff up.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 They make stuff up. But I keep coming back to them.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I just like that hot cousin at the family reunion. You can't stay away.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Whenever the family gets together, she's the first one you seek out.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 You could talk to Art Bell, but no, you see that blonde cousin in the corner

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 and you just have to go up to her first. It's a tragedy.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It's a tragedy and I just can't quit her.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 The point is, is that I found gold.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 So don't worry, it's just not going to be me ripping on Backpacker Reverse for the next 15 minutes.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Actually, because I read everything and then I have to research it,

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I found this beautiful chunk of gold inside my hot cousin.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Let's go ahead and get started here officially with this story.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 We're going back in time. So let's hop on board the Jason Jalopy.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 No, no, no, no, no, no. The Dead Rabbit Durgible.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 It's been a long time since we've used that guy.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 We're going to fly around. We're going to San Francisco.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Beautiful, beautiful San Francisco. It's beautiful, beautiful,

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 because we're going back in time before the earthquake.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 The jewel of California.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And in San Francisco, there's a park known as Golden Gate Park

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 and within Golden Gate Park, there is a beautiful,

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 placid little piece of water known as Stowe Lake.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 According to Backpacker Reverse, this is the story of the white woman of Stowe Lake.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Before the earthquake, before the earthquake of 1906,

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 a young mother was walking by the lake and she straight up butterfingers her baby,

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 just slips out of her arms.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 The baby goes flying into the lake and drowns.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And then the mom jumps into the lake as well to save her baby and drowns as well.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 So now, to this day, there is a statue by the lake.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 It's the statue of the pioneer women and children statue is what it's called.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And when you go to the statue, you say, "Don't do this."

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Don't say, "Don't do this." Don't do what I'm about to tell you.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Do not say this in public in San Francisco.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 You go out to the statue and you go, "White lady, white lady,

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I have your baby." You say, "White lady, white lady, I have your baby."

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Here, I'll do it one more time just for the sake of the podcast.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 "White lady, white lady, I have your baby."

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And at that point, the water starts to bubble in this image of a beautiful white lady.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 She's dressed in white. She's dressed in white.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I'm not trying to... Okay.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I'm assuming she's also Caucasian, but they call her white lady because she's in all white.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I should have said that earlier.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 She bubbles up out of the water, dressed in all white, and she pops out of the water

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 and she looks at you with wet eyes. I have no idea what that means.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I don't know what that would mean as opposed to dry eyes.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 She looks at you and she says, "Do you have my baby?"

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Again, backpacker verse states, "If you say that you have the child,

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 she'll haunt you until the day you die."

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 So you go, "Yeah, I have your baby. You're chuckling with your friends."

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 "Yeah, lady, I got your baby right here for the rest of your life."

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Every time you turn around, white lady stands behind you.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Go into the bathroom, white lady.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Jogging, white lady, she's losing a bunch of weight.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 She's jogging with you. You're doing a training montage.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 She's straight up lifting all these weights.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 No matter what you do, she'll haunt you for the rest of her life.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Now, my first question to this is how do you know backpacker verse?

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 The second question is if 10 people did this successfully,

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 is she haunting 10 different people at the same time?

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Is she a multitasker? Can she split her form up into seven,

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 possibly seven billion different hauntings?

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Everyone has a white lady working out.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Most important question of all, can you sleep with her?

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Because if she's following you everywhere,

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 she's going to see you like when your heart gets broken by a girl

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 and you're going to feel a little ghost hand on your shoulder

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 and you look over at her and she looks over at you.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Then she looks away because she's kind of shy.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And you know she's having a hard time falling in love

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 because she already lost her child, but you're able to hold her.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Kind of. You can pretend to hold her and then one night, passionate love.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Ghost babies eventually and all that stuff.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 But anyways, if you say, "Yes, I have your baby."

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 She will haunt you for the rest of your life.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Doesn't sound too fun, but it could be if you can sleep with her.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 So you would say, "No, I don't have your ghost baby."

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 "No, lady, I don't have your ghost baby right here."

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And if you say you don't have the ghost baby, she drags you into the lake.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 So basically, you're her new ghost baby.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And you're usually, again, how do they know?

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I mean, for any part of this legend to be true, there would have to be an observer

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 kind of sitting there watching eating popcorn on a bench

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 and he sees some guys out and they eat guys out and then a white woman hops out and a guy,

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 the bench is still just eating popcorn and then the guy gets dragged in the water

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 and he goes, "I wonder what that was about."

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I'm like, you would have to have an observer be able to escape these events.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 But anyways, Backpackerverse told that story and I go,

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 "That's hilarious, hot cousin, but it's 100% not true. You made it up."

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 But it gets more interesting because they didn't.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Now, like I said, Backpackerverse has a tendency to just make stuff up completely.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 But it turns out this is a real legend and then there's an actual truth behind the real legend.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So the real legend, the second part is the same.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The incantation, "White lady, white lady, I have your baby."

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 All that stuff is true. She haunts you until you die

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 or she makes you a ghost baby, pulls you in the water.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 But when you look at other sources, the beginning's a little more fleshed out

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 and this is how most sources report this.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 This is, let me back up here, not just most sources.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 This is from GoldenGatePark.com.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 This is from the park's official website, Run by the City.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 They tell this story of Stow Lake.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 There was a lady who had a baby stroller.

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 She's walking through the park.

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It's 1906. They didn't have music back then.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So this is like the first time anyone's ever heard a tune.

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Everyone's like, "Oh my God, what's that noise?"

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 She's walking through the park.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 They're like hugging each other.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 "Hey, I haven't seen you in forever."

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I don't know what women talk about.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Then they sit down on the bench.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 She puts her stroller next to her and she's talking to her friend.

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 She's so engrossed in talking to her friend.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 She doesn't realize that the baby stroller begins to roll down a hill.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Because, see, San Francisco is famous for a lot of things.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 But I think if you ask most people what San Francisco is famous for,

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 okay, you'd get them 100 different answers.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 But eventually you would get to the answer.

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 There's a lot of hills.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 The baby stroller down, she's talking to her friend.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And the stroller begins to silently roll down the hill.

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I won't make a sound effect because it's silently.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And then it splashes into the water silently as well.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 She doesn't hear the splash.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And after she's done talking to her friend, she's like, "Oh yeah, I forgot.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 I wasn't pregnant for a nine month and gave birth to a..."

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And the baby's gone now.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And she begins walking around the park asking people,

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 "Have you seen my baby? Have you seen my baby?"

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 "Have you seen my baby?"

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And people are like, "No, I haven't seen your baby. Is she cute?"

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 "I don't have time for that."

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 So she goes on next person, "Have you seen my baby?"

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And then she goes, "Oh, I haven't seen your baby."

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And she drowns. Now, unless her baby was Aquaman, after three minutes of quote-unquote "missing" underwater, the kid's dead.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I mean, it's dark, but anyway, she jumps into the water.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And then the official website from the city goes on to say,

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 "If you go out to the statue and say your name three times,

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 and then you do that to the statue and then the ghost will come out and all that stuff's going on."

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 So, obviously, backpacker version, make this up.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 This is a very well-known legend in this part of the city.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And due to the internet now all over the world.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 So where does this legend come from?

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 In 1906, there was the massive earthquake that basically shook San Francisco to its knees.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Does that make sense?

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 It was an earthquake. A bunch of buildings fell down, a bunch of buildings caught on fire.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And it was a horrible tragedy.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 But before 1906, San Francisco still was, like all major cities, had their dark side.

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And so, previous to the earthquake, and especially around the 1900s,

198
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 especially in like, in the year 1900, suicides were very, very common in the park.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Here's a quote from a newspaper that was printed back in 1900 that did as...

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It was actually the San Francisco call, did a newspaper article called "The Park Suicides."

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And they have this quote in their article,

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 "The park, with its luxury of trees, shrubbery, and green grass, seems to appeal strongly to the troubled philosopher

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 who seeks to rid himself of what he deems a burden."

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Very poetic.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 I wish journalists were at like that today.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And I gotta say this, you've probably noticed something different about today's episode,

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 both on YouTube and on the podcast.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I'm using different art for today's episode.

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 That image you're looking at was the image in that issue of the newspaper.

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 It was an illustration that was in the newspaper.

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And it looks like some gothic kit.

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It looks great. It looks like basically a metal album.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And I wish that newspapers did stuff like that today.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I guess when you couldn't put photos in your newspaper, you had to get real imaginative.

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 But maybe they had photos back then. I don't know.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 But the point is it's like, ooh, A+ for that.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 So you have that image and the article was called "The Park Suicides."

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I love that image.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 But the article goes on that at the time, one in every 12 suicides in the city of San Francisco happened in that park.

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And there was just a ton of them. People shooting themselves, drownings, hangings, things like that.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 It was a very, very peaceful place to die.

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 But you ask, did anyone drown? Did any woman purposely drown herself in the lake?

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Now, I was reading an article about this that really delved into the history of all this stuff.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And they said, there may have been, but when the earthquake hit in 1906, so many public records got destroyed.

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So if there were police cases about a girl fall, a little baby fallen in the lake,

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 or a woman jumping in the lake after her kid or anything like that, that police file would have been destroyed in the fires that ravaged the city.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 But that might not have been the origin.

228
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 The origin may have actually happened past the year 1900.

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 We may be more recent than we think.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 In 1906, July 10th, 1906, this is shortly after the earthquake.

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 There are two 12-year-old girls that are living in the park.

232
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 They're refugees from the earthquake. Everything was destroyed.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So these two girls are living by themselves in the park.

234
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 They run, they're running through the park.

235
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 They find a cop.

236
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 They're like, "Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer, come here. We found something in the lake."

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And the officer is like, "Okay, tell me what's going on, little ladies."

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And they go, "This is gross."

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 But they go, "We found a little naked baby floating in the lake. Sir, a little naked baby is floating down the lake."

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 They kind of trail off like that, and the cop's like, "Ah, that's disturbing."

241
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So he goes, blows his whistle to alert his fellow cops.

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 He's running through the park, and he goes, "No, baby. No, baby, in the water."

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And they actually, in the news article, because that was reported in the news,

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 there was a news article talking about that, and they said they had plans to dredge the lake.

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 The police took the sighting incredibly seriously, and they were going to just net,

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 put a net under the lake and lift it all up and try to find this baby,

247
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 and there was no follow-up report to this.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 So we don't know if they never found the baby.

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 So could that child have been related to the story?

250
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Like, could you have started to have the legend start because there was that sighting?

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 But that's not even enough to really start the story of Stolec.

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 1908, January 6th.

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 [car engine]

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 There's a car flying at top speed. It's 1908, so it would have been like 20 miles an hour,

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 driven by a man known as Arthur Pigeon.

256
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 [car engine]

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Going through the park. It's Arthur Pigeon driving, and the car is full of a bunch of chicks,

258
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 going like, "Ahhhhhh!" screaming, and a police officer on a horse sees this car.

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 [car engine]

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 He's trying to try, and he puts his siren on the horse.

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 [car engine]

262
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 It starts galloping after the car.

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Now, it's 1908. Like I said, the cars can't go that fast.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 The horse catches up to the car, [car engine]

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 blows his whistle, pulls the car over, and everyone is flipping out.

266
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And the cop is like, "What's going on, dude?"

267
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And Arthur Pigeon's like, "Okay, officer, we're not drinking nothing.

268
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Well, we did drink a little bit ago, but we're not drunk now.

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 We were driving through the park.

270
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 You know, I'm just hanging out with these hot chicks, you know, looking for a good time."

271
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 No suicides tonight, and the officer's like, "Good. We've already had enough of those."

272
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And Arthur Pigeon's like, "Yeah, we're driving through the park, and we see in the darkness,

273
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 the image of a woman dressed all in white just appear on the road."

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And she held her hands up in front of us as if to stop our car.

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I didn't. I floored it, dude. I wasn't going to mess with this thing.

276
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 [car engine]

277
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 And the next thing you know, we drive by you and you pull us over.

278
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Now, the cop thought this story was really funny.

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Well, the cop's like, "Hey, listen, let's go and check out the ghost."

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And Arthur's like, "There's no way we're going back there. The women were flipping out still."

281
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 The word hysteria was used several times in the article.

282
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And so the cop says, "Listen, man, you're speeding through the park.

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 You either go back with me to see if we can find this ghost or I'm going to--

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 you're going to get in trouble for speeding."

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So Arthur Pigeon goes back, leaves the girls there. No ghost at all.

286
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And the chief of police, though-- this was actually filed as a police report.

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Sorry, the captain of the police at the time, the captain of the park station, said

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 that he was informed of the affair and he gave orders that any ghost answering this description is to be arrested on site.

289
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Everyone's like, "Oh, those idiots."

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 That story involving Arthur Pigeon was front page of the San Francisco Chronicle in 1908.

291
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Slow news day indeed.

292
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 What's interesting about this story is that I think that there may--

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I think that there may be a bit of truth to it.

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I don't believe in the ritual part of it.

295
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I think that-- I don't believe if you go out there and say, "White lady, white lady, I have your baby."

296
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 I don't believe in any stuff like that.

297
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 What I think is fascinating is the story is interesting in and of itself,

298
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 where you have a park that was basically-- the soil is fertilized with the bodies of suicide victims.

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 You have people huddling in the darkness of this park after one of the biggest natural disasters in American history.

300
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 You have today rapes and murders and all sorts of horrible stuff going on in that park.

301
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 You have a confirmed ghost sighting with multiple witnesses.

302
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I think it's very, very likely that there's something there.

303
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 But to add the whole ritual story to it, to add that sight to it, almost makes it more childish.

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 But I would bet, I would bet if you journeyed into the darkness of Golden Gate Park,

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 you may stumble across something there.

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 No chance needed.

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 The place just seems to almost devour humans, devour hope.

308
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 A lot of people took their own lives in Golden Gate Park.

309
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And one of those spirits may try to take yours.

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 How do that backpacker verse?

311
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

312
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 So for our next story, it's actually a really short one.

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And it's something that nine times out of ten, I simply would have brushed off as creepypasta, as a troll, or as a lunatic,

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 or maybe all three combined.

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 On the paranormal board of 4chan, about a week or two ago,

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 somebody posted a little image from the music video "The Middle" from the band Jimmy Eat World.

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And it's gone now. The post is gone.

318
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I think someone who has more internet savvy skills than I do could probably pull it up, but I can't.

319
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 So the post is gone as far as I can tell. I looked all over for it.

320
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 But this is what it said.

321
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 "Everyone who was in this video is dead."

322
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Now, to clarify, it's everyone other than the band.

323
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 I can't verify the band members, but everyone who was in this video is dead.

324
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 They either died in a car accident, drug overdose, they were murdered, they've gone missing.

325
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And it alleged that this was some sort of cult or conspiracy surrounding the band Jimmy Eat World.

326
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Satanic sacrifice, something like that.

327
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Now, the video itself, this is for the song "The Middle."

328
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I don't know if I said that already.

329
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 The video itself is basically the band playing at a house party, and everyone in the house party is in their underwear.

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 It's a pretty good video. I gotta admit, it's a pretty good video.

331
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 But we can't verify that.

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 So I remember reading that post and I thought, "Well, you know, that's a pretty easy conspiracy theory."

333
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Just brout, because I can't track down 100 people. Most people can't track down 100 people.

334
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Again, remember the formula to a good conspiracy theory.

335
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I've talked about time, distance, and something we don't normally trust.

336
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 This definitely has time and distance.

337
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 The video was shot 18 years ago, came out in 2001.

338
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Distance, because I have no idea where the video was shot.

339
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 I have to know where the video was shot and when the video was shot and try to track down.

340
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And distance, because these 100 people have now scattered into the wind.

341
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 This guy makes a statement, and he can't back it up, obviously.

342
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 He kind of makes vague statements saying, "Well, who knows who did this?"

343
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 But all I know is that these people were all killed. None of them are alive anymore.

344
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 It was this horrible thing.

345
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Now, again, it has been 18 years since that video came out.

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And the video probably had about 100 people in it.

347
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 So I'm going to assume, sadly, that there are a handful of them that have passed away.

348
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 In 18 years, out of a group of 100 people, you're going to have a few people who have passed away.

349
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 It's even possible that because of some sort of statistical anomaly,

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 more than average out of a group of 100 people at random would pass away.

351
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 But the idea that they're all dead is most likely not true.

352
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Again, I don't have a way to verify it.

353
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 But people make insane statements all the time on the internet,

354
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 and if I spent my entire time trying to verify every insane statement,

355
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 then I wouldn't ever get anything done.

356
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 But what makes this throwaway conspiracy theory really weird are the responses to it.

357
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 So at first, you get a couple people.

358
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Now, the thread was only around for maybe a few days, and that may be overestimating it.

359
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 It was not around for long.

360
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 It wasn't super active.

361
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Because at 4chan, every time you post to it, it gets to the top of the board.

362
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 So if people stop posting, it gets farther down, so people stop reading it,

363
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 and it goes farther down, farther down, and then it disappears.

364
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 People first were like, "Yeah, whatever.

365
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 People were calling them on it and saying, "That's not true."

366
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And the original poster is kind of being like, "No, no, it's true. It's true. Did you know? Did you know that?"

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And this was going on for a while.

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And then someone jumps on and they go, "Hey, dude, I was in that video, man, so I'm still alive."

369
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And you think 4chan is a website, an international website.

370
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It's one of the biggest websites on the planet.

371
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 It is possible that somebody from the video was on this website at this time.

372
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It's out of 100 people who are in the music video, and let's say 150 just for argument's sake,

373
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 out of 150 people who are in this music video, somebody finding that post at that time to comment,

374
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 it's not impossible. It's not impossible at all.

375
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 I was in that video, bro. I'm still alive.

376
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Now we have two people making statements that can't be verified.

377
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 One that everyone's dead, and the other one that this person was in the music video.

378
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 So then people start asking the person who was in the video, "Show us proof. Show us a timestamp of where you're at."

379
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And that person was said, "No, that's stupid. I'm not going to show my face on this website."

380
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And then a bunch of people came from the music video and said, "Hey, I was in that music video too."

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 "Hey, yeah. You know, I was in that music video too."

382
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 "Yeah, I was in that music video too."

383
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And they start talking about stuff in the music video itself.

384
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Like, "Oh, yeah, I remember when we were shooting this, I met so-and-so and da-da-da-da."

385
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And he had a bunch of people talking.

386
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Now we're getting into really statistically improbable stuff, where you have a video of 150 people in it,

387
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 100, whatever it was, all finding this website at the same time commenting.

388
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Most likely answer is that everyone was making it up.

389
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 The person making up the conspiracy theory was lying.

390
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And then everyone else who's saying they were part of the video was lying as well.

391
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 But what was really odd, if memory serves me right, because I read through this thread,

392
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 and then moved on, was reading other stuff, and by the time I got back to it, the thread was no longer available.

393
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 What was interesting about it was, let's assume that everyone's making everything up.

394
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 The people who were saying they were in the video, as far as I can remember,

395
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 they weren't interacting with each other.

396
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Each person who was saying they were in the video almost seemed like they were in the video independently of the other people, if that makes sense.

397
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 So it wasn't like someone would say, "I was in the music video," and then someone else goes, "Oh, yeah, I was in the music video.

398
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Hey, let me test to make sure you were really in the music video."

399
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 What was the name of the guy who ran the snack table?

400
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And the other guy's like, "Yo, Tony dude, Tony dude!" You know what I mean?

401
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 They basically said, "No, I was in the music video too. I'm still alive."

402
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And then someone else would pop in and be like, "Hey, no, I was in the music video too. Me and my friends showed up. We made 100 bucks.

403
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 And I'm still alive, and so are all my friends."

404
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 We had all these independent people saying that they were in the music video themselves, but they weren't networking with each other.

405
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Which if it was a troll, I would think they would all be teaming up against this original poster, the guy who came up with the conspiracy theory.

406
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Because they're all now making fun of him.

407
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 What it seemed like to me, and a couple other people pointed out in the thread as well,

408
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 where are all these people coming from?

409
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And one guy goes, "Well, you know, my buddy was on this thread, and he hit me up because he knew I was in the music video,

410
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 so he sent me an email, and I'm here, and it's just crazy."

411
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 But it's weird that all these people from this video shot 18 years ago show back up into this thread.

412
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Again, most likely all of it is fake.

413
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 It could have been pre-planned from the beginning, but again, I think that they would have been interacting with each other if the trolls tend to do that.

414
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And the general sense of the thread started to become, "What's going on here? Why are all these people showing up?"

415
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And then the thread just disappears into the ether.

416
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 If one of you guys can find that, that'd be great. Hit me up.

417
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 You can hit me up at deadrabberadio@gmail.com, but if you can find this thread, let me know.

418
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 It's just bizarre.

419
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Now, let me step back for a second.

420
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Now, I'm not saying my conspiracy theory is not that Jimmy World is part of a death cult.

421
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I don't believe they are.

422
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 My conspiracy theory is this.

423
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 By making a statement like that, either caused a lot of trolls to come out of the woodwork and thought it'd be fun to make fun of this guy with this delusional belief, however,

424
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 there seems to be a concentrated effort to make people not think that at all.

425
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Does that make sense?

426
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Like, somebody makes a bizarre statement probably once every five seconds on the internet.

427
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 That's a fact. You can quote me on that statistic.

428
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 I researched that. Don't quote me on that. I don't know.

429
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 People make stupid statements all the time on the internet that never, ever, ever get disputed.

430
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But somebody makes a comment about a video, an 18-year-old video, that is just not even that intriguing.

431
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 It's just kind of a weird statement.

432
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And out of the woodwork, people say, "That's not true. That's not true. That's not true. That's not true."

433
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And in your little reptile brain in our head, in our basic little baby brain in our head, it triggers something and goes,

434
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "Hmm, if everyone's telling me it's not true, there must be something behind this."

435
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 I think that is the first, I think that's the thing that conspiracy theorists need to defeat in their head.

436
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 But there is like this instinctual thing when somebody makes a statement and then a bunch of people just appear out of nowhere and goes,

437
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 "You're wrong." I think there is a mechanism in our brain that makes a, we would have never thought about that statement in the first place.

438
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 But once it causes any sort of controversy, then we start looking at it a little closer to see,

439
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 "Well, if it's not true, why are you against it so vigorously?"

440
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Like, "Don't look up at the sky, but I'm telling you, it's not yellow."

441
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 It would be like, "That's going to make you look up at the sky."

442
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Now, if someone just walked up to you and said, "You know the sky's yellow, right?"

443
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 You'd be like, "You're an idiot."

444
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 But if then 10 people started yelling out the windows, "No, it's not, but don't look, but it's not yellow."

445
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 You're going to look. That's the Jimmy World Death Colt conspiracy.

446
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Are they connected to a death colt?

447
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Most, I would say no, they're not.

448
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Just based on logic and a fine working on how death colts work.

449
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 They tend not to make music videos and then show all their victims in the video and then kill them off one by one for 18 years.

450
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 There's no precedent for that, at least.

451
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Some conspiracy theories are too stupid to exist on their own.

452
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 They're simply stated by someone and then they just disappear.

453
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 But when people start arguing against them, it does make you give them a second look.

454
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 The Jimmy Eat World Death Colt conspiracy could be shallow and vague and a joke.

455
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Or it could be the deepest conspiracy theory we've ever covered.

456
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 So deep that it had to be argued with until the thread was deleted to disappear forever.

457
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Does that mean that Jimmy Eat World will now come after Dead Rabbit Radio?

458
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Does that mean that everyone involved in this episode will be dead in 18 years?

459
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Most likely not, but I'll tell you this.

460
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I'm not going to any house parties in my underwear anytime soon.

461
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 That's a lie. I'm coming to your house tonight.

462
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Okay, that was a weird ending.

463
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 DeadRabbitRadioGmail.com is going to be your email address.

464
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 That wasn't a threat, by the way. That was not a legal threat.
