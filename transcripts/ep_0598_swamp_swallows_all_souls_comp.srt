1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
 It's raining.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,640
 The spookiest of all weather phenomenon is rain.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,920
 So we're going to end this week with some spooky stories.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,800
 First off, I'm whispering for this intro.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,040
 First off, a man in Japan is just looking to make a few extra dollars.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,880
 Instead he turns himself into a suicide expert.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,520
 Then we travel to Indiana to meet a 4 year old boy who wakes up one night as a grey alien

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,560
 is standing in his room.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,640
 The alien's message to the boy, "We're going to take one of your siblings tonight."

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,360
 Then we travel to the Okifinoki Swamp in Georgia, where a woman tells a terrifying story of

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,600
 a boating incident with her family.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,320
 They just wanted to have a picnic on the edge of the swamp.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,800
 Instead they found themselves trapped in another reality.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,320
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:04,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
 I'm having a great day.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,120
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,600
 I hope you guys have an awesome weekend coming up.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,360
 I'm actually, this is my weekend.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,120
 I quit nicotine full stop.

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,640
 I was supposed to quit it.

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,840
 I wasn't supposed to quit it.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,360
 I was supposed to cut it down.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,240
 And then I slowly slot creeping up.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
 I'm done.

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,640
 So my weekend is going to suck.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,240
 My weekend is going to be a bunch of nicotine with girls.

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,240
 I'm actually going to record some episodes up so I can have a long weekend.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,480
 You guys won't miss any episodes, but I'll get to relax.

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,640
 Super spooky raining right now.

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,840
 And I'm going to warn you guys, this episode is spooky.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,480
 So I hope you guys brought your spooky pants.

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,360
 And one person who I know brought their spooky pants is one of our legacy Patreon supporters,

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,320
 Catherine Bellingham.

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,880
 I'm going to give a round of applause to Catherine Bellingham.

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,280
 She's showing off her spooky pants, spooky jacket, spooky monocles.

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,120
 She, there's only one monocle, she has a spooky monocle and then an extra one in her

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,200
 pocket.

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,240
 She is all decked out for the spookiness.

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,800
 Catherine, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,160
 You guys can't support the Patreon.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,440
 You know what I'm going to say?

44
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
 Just help spread the word about the show.

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
 That really, really helps out a lot.

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,360
 Catherine, I'm going to go ahead and give you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,080
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command and we are headed out to Japan.

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,600
 Durgibles flying nice and slow.

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,440
 I'm looking for something to put it in my mouth.

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,040
 I'm putting in sweets and candy and everything.

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,840
 Oh my God, this weekend's going to suck.

52
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,440
 What I've been doing is I've been balling up tissue paper and stuffing it in my gums.

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,040
 It's so funny when people see me do that, it really makes them mad.

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
 They go, "So?"

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,520
 They can't imagine, I'm doing it right now.

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,400
 They go, "I can't imagine what it's like to have a Starbucks."

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,320
 You know how Starbucks napkins are really coarse?

58
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,000
 I'm going to roll it up and fold it so it's like a pouch of tobacco.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I lick it with my tongue.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,880
 Stick it in my gums.

61
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,920
 People go, "It really irritates people when I do it."

62
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,520
 Because they just imagine how coarse that must be on the gums.

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
 But see, that's the point.

64
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
 Don't ever get addicted.

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,920
 Don't ever become an addict of anything.

66
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,720
 Definitely don't become an addict.

67
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,480
 Don't become something on top of a house.

68
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,640
 Don't become a drug addicted person like myself.

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,520
 Catherine, Catherine's just like, "Where am I supposed to drive this thing?"

70
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,400
 She sees me picking up more tissue paper.

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
 No, no, no.

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,080
 You're going to head out to the city of Zama.

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,160
 That's in the Kandawa prefecture in Japan.

74
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
 The year is 2017.

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,640
 And Japan, Japan's interesting because what's the first thing you think of when you think

76
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
 of Japan?

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,720
 Okay, not that.

78
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
 Not the anime.

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
 Okay, not that either.

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 Not the tentacle porn.

81
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
 No, not that.

82
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,440
 Not the vending machines full of the girls underwear.

83
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,760
 What are you thinking?

84
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
 Exactly.

85
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
 You know, keep thinking.

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
 Not the samurai.

87
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
 It's not the sumo guys.

88
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,440
 Keep going down suicide, suicide rates.

89
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,800
 You always think, Jason, that's so down the list.

90
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,040
 That's so, you're still thinking of giant robots.

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
 Suicide.

92
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,800
 And there's a thing, there's kind of a stereotype that Japan has a high suicide rate.

93
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,040
 Actually, the country that has the highest suicide rate is Greenland.

94
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,640
 I had a story I was going to do on it, but it was way too depressing.

95
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,680
 Greenland has the highest suicide rates in the world, really per capita, and they think

96
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,760
 it has to do with the sun not shining all the time, or indigenous people having to move

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,040
 off their lands and go into the city.

98
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,040
 And then after like two generations, they're like, "This sucks."

99
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,200
 And they're blowing their brains out.

100
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,520
 It's like an epidemic.

101
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,120
 Greenland actually has more suicides than Japan.

102
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,200
 But Japan's kind of known for the suicides.

103
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,800
 It comes up all the time in stories like, "The sun does something bad."

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,900
 Like it's a serial killer.

105
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,160
 He covered that a long time ago, the Otaku killer.

106
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,000
 The dad killed himself because he was ashamed of his son.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 That was in Japan.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,160
 And Japan knows that they have their reputation, so they're actually really trying to crack

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,240
 down on suicide.

110
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,000
 They're really trying to convince people, young and old, men and women alike, that that's

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 not the answer.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,080
 Because it's not.

113
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,880
 But in Japan, there was a Twitter user named @hangingpro, and he began trolling Twitter

114
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:14,220
 looking for women who were lonely and alone and sad and ready to make that final step

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,940
 towards suicide.

116
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,500
 And he would give them that extra little push.

117
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,900
 Now it's not like the Blue Whale game, which we covered in an episode a long time ago,

118
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
 where he would be like, "Oh yeah, do it, do it."

119
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,060
 He would actively invite them over to his house and say, "We can hang ourselves together."

120
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
 I'm the Hanging Pro.

121
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,180
 I've done this several times before, and they're like, "Wait, wait, wait, you're still alive.

122
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,880
 How can you be the Hanging Pro if you're still alive?"

123
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
 And he's like, "Oh, he's a go for sight of sight."

124
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,960
 He's like, "Eh, don't worry about that.

125
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,040
 Just come over to my place, we'll take a suicide pact, and we'll both kill each other at the

126
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,840
 same time, or kill ourselves at the same time."

127
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,400
 What happens is, this woman goes missing.

128
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,200
 This 23 year old woman goes missing.

129
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,720
 And the family calls the police.

130
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
 The police show up.

131
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,280
 They go to her computer, they're trying to figure it out, and they see that she has

132
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,320
 recently been talking to @hangingpro, also known as Takahiro Shirashii.

133
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,580
 He's a 30 year old man, crossed town in the town of Zama.

134
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,980
 So the police show up at this dude's house, and Takahiro is just kind of sitting there

135
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,580
 eating bugles or something like that.

136
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,620
 The cops walk in, and they're like, "Hey dude, what do you know about this missing woman?"

137
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,940
 And he's like, "I have no idea what you guys are talking about."

138
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,100
 There's like nooses everywhere.

139
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,020
 All of his stuff is decorated in nooses.

140
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,700
 He's wearing a tie in the shape of a noose.

141
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,260
 He's like, "Oh, I'm just hanging pro.

142
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,260
 Just hanging around.

143
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
 That's my hobby."

144
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,260
 The cops go, "It's a little suspicious."

145
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,320
 It's suspicious that you love nooses.

146
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,520
 You love hanging.

147
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,680
 And this woman who was depressed came to your house, and he's just sitting there eating

148
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
 bugles.

149
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,480
 To be fair, I don't know exactly what he was eating.

150
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,800
 I just like the visual of him eating bugles for some reason.

151
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
 Browdic placement.

152
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
 Give me money, bugles.

153
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,920
 As the cops are investigating him, they're like, "Can I use your restroom?"

154
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,800
 And he's like, "Yeah, sure, the guy has to walk through a beaded curtain made of nooses."

155
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,440
 He pushes him aside.

156
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,220
 They find nine decapitated bodies in his apartment.

157
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,420
 He's like, "I probably should have moved this apartment to get to eating those bugles.

158
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,820
 I shouldn't have got him and get a glass of orange juice.

159
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,340
 I probably should have moved those bodies."

160
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,100
 Nine decapitated bodies in this apartment.

161
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,100
 There's eight women and one man.

162
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,620
 So the cops arrest him.

163
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,020
 He's like, "No, my bugles as they're carrying him away."

164
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
 They throw him in jail.

165
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
 Now, here's his thing.

166
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,740
 He goes, "Listen, I didn't commit a crime.

167
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,060
 These people wanted to kill themselves.

168
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,240
 I'm the hanging pro.

169
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,560
 I have a reputation to uphold.

170
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,240
 I just helped them kill themselves."

171
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,160
 The police are like, "Well, okay, that's all fair, but we can tell, even from your own

172
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,200
 confession, you gave us that they fought back pretty vigorously."

173
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
 He goes, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,360
 They were like biting and scratching me and kicking me and like throwing lamps.

175
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,760
 I had to buy a bunch of lamps."

176
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,560
 But that's just what happens when you strangle someone with the news.

177
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
 "Don't you know that, police officer?

178
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
 Haven't you ever done that before?"

179
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,480
 They're looking at each other.

180
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,820
 He goes, "So, yeah, they fought back, but that's just like a natural response."

181
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
 The cops go, "Okay, fair.

182
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
 But then we checked out the women when we're doing an autopsy.

183
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,700
 You know we're going to do an autopsy, right?"

184
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,200
 And he gulps.

185
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,060
 The women were actually sexually assaulted as well.

186
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,780
 And Takahiro goes, "Yeah, I don't have a reasonable answer for that part."

187
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,740
 And then the guy.

188
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,940
 So there was the eight women and then one man.

189
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,620
 The guy showed up.

190
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,240
 And they go, "Well, he didn't talk to this dude on Twitter at all.

191
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
 He didn't want to kill himself.

192
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,880
 He seemed to be having a pretty cool life, apparently.

193
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
 Why'd you kill him?"

194
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
 And Takahiro goes, "Yeah, okay."

195
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,240
 So the man didn't want to commit suicide.

196
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,440
 He actually showed up at this apartment because his female friend went missing.

197
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,920
 So he went there to find out what happened to his friend and Takahiro murdered.

198
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,360
 He murdered all of them.

199
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,080
 Whether or not they wanted to commit suicide, he murdered all of them.

200
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,560
 But even his idea of being an angel of mercy, he raped the women in the middle of the night

201
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,020
 and the man didn't want anything to do with suicide.

202
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,540
 He was actually there to help his friend and he got killed anyways.

203
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,300
 This was a long running scam and this just kind of shows the sickness of crime.

204
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,820
 He started off just ripping off elderly women, which is a bad place to start, right?

205
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,940
 Crime you always start at a certain level and it's downhill from there.

206
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,060
 Usually you start off like stealing your dad's watch and then you start stealing bigger and

207
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,060
 better things.

208
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,280
 And you know you're driving a sports car with a safe strap to it through Brazil.

209
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,480
 That's the escalation.

210
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,520
 You start off scamming elderly depressed women and then he thinks, wait a second, suicidal

211
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:39,360
 women are even more likely to be manipulated and then he starts targeting suicidal women

212
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,960
 but he wasn't killing them at this point.

213
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,960
 He was just stealing their money and you're like, "What are you going to do?

214
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,880
 What are you going to do?

215
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,360
 You want to kill yourself anyways and now you're just broke.

216
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,980
 I'm not giving you advice on why this crime works but that was his idea.

217
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,180
 And then one of the women that he stole from, I guess, paid him a visit and he was afraid

218
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,580
 she was going to demand the money back so he killed her.

219
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,540
 And then after that he realized, "Oh, I can steal their money and then kill them and then

220
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,900
 I don't ever have to worry about them filing a charge of robbery."

221
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,420
 The nine murder charges might be a little worse but the robbery charges, I will get

222
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,380
 away scot-free.

223
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,400
 This month he received the death penalty so that piece of work is going to get his head

224
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
 chopped off.

225
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,560
 I don't know how do they kill people in Japan is it?

226
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
 Lethal injection?

227
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,640
 Firing squad?

228
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,800
 But anyways they're going to kill him.

229
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
 Catherine?

230
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,280
 Catherine's like, "Damn it, why did I wear my spooky pants for that depressing story?"

231
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,120
 Catherine, let's go ahead and hop in the dead rabbit dreadnought.

232
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,280
 We're going to do a little pallet cleanser as you have on an awesome spooky pirate outfit

233
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,240
 and we're taking our massive battleship, a Trimere style with all the people rowing

234
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,220
 the oars and everything.

235
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,980
 Back to the United States we're going to have a party because that story was super depressing

236
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,380
 so we're doing a little dance.

237
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,260
 We're doing a little dance for three months.

238
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,100
 That's all it takes for us to get back to America but we're finally back.

239
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,300
 We're headed to Kittly Woods, Indiana.

240
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:14,780
 It's 1983 and it's at night so that's an owl and then doves.

241
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,780
 They were up all night.

242
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,440
 They were up all night dancing with us and now they're back in Indiana and now they're

243
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,840
 going to sleep and they're still making some noise.

244
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,960
 We're walking up to a house and in this house we have a mother named Debbie and her four

245
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,060
 year old son who we will name Roger.

246
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,000
 So Debbie and Roger are sleeping.

247
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It's night time.

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,520
 They probably would have gone to sleep earlier if it wasn't for those doves dancing outside

249
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
 and making all that noise.

250
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,400
 But Debbie finally gets some sleep and then she hears her four year old son Roger go,

251
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,000
 "Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy."

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,900
 And then he's like, "I'm not this irritating kid again."

253
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,100
 She gets out of bed, she walks out of his room and he's freaking out and he goes, "Mom,

254
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,260
 mom, you won't believe what just happened."

255
00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:00,620
 I was laying in bed and right there, right there, he's pointing.

256
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,260
 You can see what I was doing.

257
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
 I was pointing on the podcast.

258
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,820
 I saw a man, a little man with a large head.

259
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,580
 He walked through the wall.

260
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,360
 And then he just stood in the darkness of my room, even though I'm four.

261
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,120
 Even though I'm four, my voice got all slow and spooky.

262
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,240
 He stood there in the darkness of my room and I got a telepathic message from him.

263
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,640
 He said, "I'm going to take one of the other children tonight."

264
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,240
 Roger then goes, I was a little puzzled.

265
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,120
 One because this man was able to walk through a wall.

266
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
 Can I do that, mommy?

267
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
 Can I do that?

268
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
 And she's like, "No, Roger."

269
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,940
 This man walked through a wall.

270
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,220
 Also he said he was going to take one of the other children, but I don't have any brothers

271
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
 or sisters, right?

272
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,660
 And the mom's like, "Mom, I was going from the side to side."

273
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,100
 She's like, "No, Roger, you're the only one."

274
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,900
 But he goes, "I don't have any brothers or sisters."

275
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
 She's like, "No, no."

276
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,540
 And he goes, "And then the weirdest thing happened."

277
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,820
 That wasn't the weirdest part.

278
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,020
 I was paralyzed.

279
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,820
 The dude was somehow able to paralyze me and then he walked into my closet.

280
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
 And I think he's still in there.

281
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,900
 I think he's still in my closet.

282
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,760
 So Roger, looking at my notes, Roger actually left his room and came to the mom's room after

283
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,800
 the paralyzation ended.

284
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,280
 Because what happens is, Debbie, the mom, she goes to figure out what's going on.

285
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,200
 Because as an adult, you're thinking, "My son's an idiot."

286
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,640
 Of course that's not possible, right?

287
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,560
 Little man, big head, asking for siblings and so like that, disappearing, paralyzation.

288
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,000
 As adults who are into this stuff, we're totally down with it.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,880
 If your friend goes, "Hey dude, you won't believe what happened last night."

290
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,500
 Little man, you'll see that story again.

291
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 You'll be like, "What?"

292
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 You'll be kind of jealous.

293
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,060
 But if your kid was saying it, your kid's also saying that his best friend is Princess

294
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,780
 Peach and something he's going to be a hang glider when he grows up.

295
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,220
 So you know your kid's an idiot.

296
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,700
 All kids are idiots.

297
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,060
 So when like a four year old's saying it, you're just kind of rolling your eyes, but

298
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,980
 she goes into the bedroom.

299
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,860
 She's getting ready to be like, "Roger, you dork.

300
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,580
 There's nothing in here."

301
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:08,660
 And when she opens the door to his room, she sees a bright flash and she sees a shadow

302
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,000
 fade out.

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,960
 So that's a weird combination of things.

304
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,480
 She walks in the room and whatever was there disappeared in a flash, but the shadow stayed

305
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,840
 for a few seconds after the object is gone and then that also disappears.

306
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,400
 An interesting story, but it's not the end.

307
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,920
 Because the alien made a promise it was going to take one of the other children tonight.

308
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,520
 That night Debbie said she went to bed and in the middle of the night she woke up and

309
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,680
 she was on some sort of operating table.

310
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:45,340
 And she says a gray skinned large eyed entity, i.e. a gray alien walks up to her and begins

311
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,860
 to pat her belly and it asks, "How do you feel?"

312
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,740
 I don't know if he said that.

313
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,240
 I don't know if it was Urkel.

314
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,500
 But he goes, "How do you feel as he's patting her stomach?"

315
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:06,540
 She feels bloated in her midsection and she notices that her nightgown is hiked up around

316
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,400
 her thighs.

317
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:18,840
 She wakes up the next morning suffering from ovarian pain, cramps, and what's listed as

318
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,240
 a quote, "unusual vaginal discharge."

319
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,120
 I got this story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

320
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,160
 It's really brief.

321
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,040
 I think it's super interesting.

322
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,440
 I do have to say in the story it does not say whether or not Roger has other brothers

323
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
 and sisters.

324
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,760
 But you could read it either way.

325
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,900
 Let's say that Roger did have a little brother.

326
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,220
 And the alien's like, "I'm going to take one of your siblings."

327
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,220
 And Roger's like, "Yeah, I hate that little dork.

328
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,220
 Take him.

329
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
 Take him."

330
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,100
 It's still interesting that he went for Debbie's uterus.

331
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,820
 But it doesn't say.

332
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,180
 If someone showed up in your house and says, "I'm going to take one of your kids tonight,"

333
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:58,180
 you'd call the cops and you'd be alarmed, obviously, unless you have a super dorky kid

334
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,260
 and you're like, "Oh, you think this one," you're pushing him out.

335
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,780
 But you want to think the guy would come in and start taking ovaries out of your wife.

336
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,480
 He's like, "Oh, no, I'm talking about theoretical children at this point."

337
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,360
 I thought it was interesting the alien showed up and told the kid dad in the first place

338
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,960
 and then the mom had that nightmare and then had the physical symptoms.

339
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,320
 And why was there that chain of events?

340
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,600
 Why did the alien show up and tell the boy in the beginning?

341
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,000
 Did he try warning him?

342
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,920
 Is it two separate factions of grays?

343
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,720
 I mean, it's not really a good warning.

344
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,480
 He could have warned the mom, "Hey, some guy's going to sneak in your room tonight.

345
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,040
 It abducts you."

346
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,680
 But yeah, just a weird story all around.

347
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,020
 Some weird phenomenon going on with that one.

348
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,900
 They did eventually really take one of his siblings.

349
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,100
 It was just a sibling who hadn't been born yet, which actually kind of makes it creepier.

350
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
 Catherine Bellingham.

351
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,300
 Catherine's like, "Damn, why am I in this episode?"

352
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,300
 Because you're awesome, Catherine.

353
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,540
 Catherine, I'm going to toss you the keys to the carboner copter and we are going to

354
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,780
 go swamping.

355
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:03,260
 So take us out and away from Indiana.

356
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,200
 We're going to the Okie Finokie Swamp in Georgia.

357
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,800
 It's April 3rd, 2000.

358
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,200
 Don't we have a hydrofoil?

359
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,880
 The carboner copter transforms into the...

360
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
 Don't we have a hydrofoil?

361
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
 What is it?

362
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 The hair hovercraft?

363
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
 And now, whoa, look at Catherine.

364
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
 You got four vehicles.

365
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,640
 That's because you're in such a disgusting and dark episode.

366
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:32,440
 You're driving the hair hovercraft as we're moving over the swamps of Georgia.

367
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,220
 This story was sent to the website Singular Forty-N.

368
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,500
 And this article that I'm getting all my information from was written by Tobias and Emily Wayland.

369
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,700
 Singular Forty-N, you'll see it in the show notes, it's a great website.

370
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,240
 There's a lot of really cool stories there.

371
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,540
 This was sent to them by a woman named Shirley Ivy.

372
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,100
 She tells the story of what happened to her and her family on April 3rd, 2000.

373
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,980
 At the time, Shirley was 41 years old and their family was just passing through the

374
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,980
 area.

375
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,040
 They're taking a little road trip.

376
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:12,760
 But they're familiar with swamps and the basic landscape of where we're at.

377
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,040
 So it's not like me who's a total city slicker.

378
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
 It'd be like, "What, swamp?

379
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
 Where are the crocodiles at?"

380
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,680
 It's like, "Nept even the swamp?"

381
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,720
 Crocodiles are like, "Look at all those logs with eyes.

382
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
 Those are pretty cool."

383
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,880
 Like, I don't know nothing about swamps at all.

384
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
 But she knows about swamps because that's going to play into this story.

385
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,580
 So Shirley's hanging out with her family and they go, "Hey, look at--"

386
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,660
 Cars are having another road.

387
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,260
 They see the Suwani Canal Recreation Area.

388
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,460
 None of those words sound attractive to me.

389
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
 Recreation, boo!

390
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,460
 Let's them sit down.

391
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,020
 I guess that is recreation.

392
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,820
 Anyways, area, boo!

393
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,740
 I love to be confined.

394
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,980
 Suwani Canal Recreation Area.

395
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,980
 If you're in this area, you can actually go here.

396
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
 Don't recommend it.

397
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:59,580
 But it's between mile marker 3 and 4 of the Suwani Canal Recreation Area.

398
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,160
 We rent a motor boat.

399
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,120
 Shirley and her family rent a motor boat.

400
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,000
 It's her, her husband, and two daughters, I believe.

401
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,120
 They're going down the canal.

402
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,040
 Now she said the canal was fairly wide.

403
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,040
 It's not like a cement canal.

404
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,880
 It's like--that's like the term used.

405
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,880
 You're like, "Jason, I know what a swamp canal is."

406
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
 But I didn't.

407
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
 It's basically, it's like the waterway.

408
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,440
 There's a big wide waterway.

409
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,440
 She says there's tributaries going off every so often.

410
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,740
 And for the tourists, you would just stay on this big waterway.

411
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,620
 As they're going to this area, they are told that there's a picnic area not too far down

412
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,820
 river or down swamp.

413
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,060
 So the motor boat's going.

414
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,940
 They hear a little bluegrass music playing down on swamp with me.

415
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,180
 Gonna have a good time.

416
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,180
 Boats going down.

417
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,820
 And they are boating for a while and they don't see the picnic area.

418
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
 And they're like, "What?

419
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,180
 I mean, sure, we haven't really been here before, but they said it wasn't that far."

420
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,840
 And as they're starting to think about it, they have all this picnic food.

421
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
 They really want to eat it.

422
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
 They need an area to eat it.

423
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,920
 Oh, there it is.

424
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,880
 They see the picnic area off the shore.

425
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,840
 So they pull up, eating their ham sandwiches and having a good time.

426
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,560
 Having a nice little picnic, family picnic next to the swamp.

427
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,680
 Now as they're packing up and getting ready to leave, another boat shows up.

428
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,440
 And there are these two young men in it.

429
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,080
 And she said they look distressed.

430
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,080
 They're all disheveled and stuff like that.

431
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,500
 They're like, "Ugh, they're all shaking.

432
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,300
 They're shaking super fast like how someone on a deal goes."

433
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,180
 She goes, "They didn't appear to be drunk, but they looked a little disheveled.

434
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,740
 They looked like they were not having a good time.

435
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,980
 They did not have picnic baskets with them."

436
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,780
 And they go, "Hey guys, guys, do you have a ham sandwich for me?"

437
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,180
 They're all addicted to picnics.

438
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,340
 No, they said, "Hey, can we follow you back?"

439
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,300
 Because we seem to be lost.

440
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,300
 She thought that was weird because it's just kind of like a straightaway.

441
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,440
 She's like, "Yeah, sure.

442
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,160
 You can follow us back.

443
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,200
 Take your boat, we'll take our boat, and we're going to go back upriver to where the recreation

444
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
 area is."

445
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
 And there you go.

446
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
 Kind of an odd request though.

447
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,980
 It would be like someone saying, "Hey, can I follow you back?"

448
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,960
 You look like both ways down the street and you're like, "It's just a one-way street."

449
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,520
 But what are you going to do?

450
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
 Tell them no.

451
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
 They follow you anyways, right?

452
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
 You're in a boat.

453
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,840
 How fast can you go?

454
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,160
 So her family gets in the boat.

455
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,680
 The two dudes are following them.

456
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,980
 And she says they don't go very far upriver and they hit a dead end.

457
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,860
 Both boats are just kind of sitting there in the water.

458
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:31,340
 She says when they went back the way they came, the waterway was blocked by land.

459
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,140
 There was like a strip of land across the shores of the canal.

460
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,060
 She said on the other side you could actually see the canal continue, but you had this block

461
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
 of land.

462
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,860
 And there it's important that she knows about this stuff.

463
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,540
 She goes, "Listen, I know that there are these things called tussocks, which are like a drifting

464
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,480
 mass of plants that will just appear in the swamp and kind of float down."

465
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,600
 She goes, "It wasn't that.

466
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
 I'm familiar with that terrain."

467
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,840
 She goes, "It wasn't a floating island either."

468
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,880
 She goes, "This land was dry and it had tall grass on it."

469
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,640
 Like it had been there for a while.

470
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,260
 Now a floating island can hold trees up to 50 pounds.

471
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,660
 She goes, "It wasn't that.

472
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,820
 It was part of the landscape and it was immobile and it was there."

473
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,500
 And it wasn't there when they came by.

474
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,220
 So they're looking at the guys and the other boat and she said the men in the other boat

475
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,060
 looked at them and they both kind of just shrugged their shoulders.

476
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,140
 Almost like that's what they expected.

477
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,940
 Almost like they had done this before.

478
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,560
 They're thinking we must have took a wrong turn somewhere, even though this is pretty

479
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,840
 much just a straightaway.

480
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,240
 Let's go back to the picnic area, regroup, come back.

481
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
 And that's exactly what they do.

482
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,840
 And she says when we go back to the picnic area, they see coming towards them, coming

483
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,160
 towards the two boats, a canoe.

484
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,440
 They're like, "Okay, that's weird.

485
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,960
 Everyone else here has motor boats, but it's not illegal to use a canoe.

486
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,880
 It's probably take a lot of body strength."

487
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,920
 And as the canoe is getting closer, both the people in it are elderly people.

488
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,620
 They're just rowing.

489
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,220
 And Shirley's looking at this and her and the other boat, because they're headed back

490
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,700
 towards the picnic area, the canoes headed towards where they were just at, and they

491
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,460
 start yelling, "Hey, there's a barrier there.

492
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,460
 You can't go.

493
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,460
 You're going to have to turn around."

494
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,180
 And she said they wouldn't even look at us.

495
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,380
 They just stared straight ahead as they're rowing this canoe in the direction that they

496
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,180
 were coming from.

497
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,320
 "Hey, no, there's nothing.

498
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,360
 You just turn around.

499
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
 Turn around."

500
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,860
 The canoe just kept going.

501
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,640
 They get back to the picnic area and sure enough, they were headed in the right direction.

502
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,240
 That's why they wanted to get back to the picnic area.

503
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,920
 They thought, "Well, maybe we just launched wrong."

504
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,560
 We hit the end.

505
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,840
 They realized they were headed in the right direction.

506
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,640
 They get back in their boats.

507
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:00,520
 They go back the way that they came and not only was there no land bridge, not only was

508
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:08,980
 there no canoe full of elderly people, they got back to the rest stop four quicker than

509
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,260
 they got to the picnic area.

510
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:16,300
 You go, "Jason, you know, with the stream, boats and the way water works, and oh, yeah,

511
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,540
 sure, I get that."

512
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,540
 But it was substantially quicker.

513
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,620
 The trip to the picnic area was unusually long and then showing back up, they're like,

514
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,620
 "Oh, we're here.

515
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,180
 No land bridge, no canoe, nothing."

516
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,840
 And when they get to the parking lot, they wanted to talk to the two guys in the other

517
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
 boat and go, "Hey, wasn't that weird?

518
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,600
 Like, what was going on there?"

519
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,280
 She says they dropped their boat off, got in their car and took off without saying a

520
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
 word.

521
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,080
 She goes, "We were never able to talk to them about this."

522
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,640
 So her family was left with a mystery.

523
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,000
 What really happened that day in the Okifunoki Swamp?

524
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,120
 It's funny because these type of stories I think are the scariest.

525
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,060
 I mean, getting my head chopped off by serial killer in Japan, that's pretty terrifying

526
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,540
 too, but the idea that you could just go out into nature and get lost, even though you

527
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,780
 know the train, and again, I'm not talking about getting lost in a physical sense.

528
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:14,300
 They went somewhere where land was able to create itself.

529
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,740
 I mean, let's put on our conspiracy caps here.

530
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,940
 And we'll end the episode off like this.

531
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:24,380
 They went to another place and possibly another time.

532
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,460
 The people in the motor boat, the two men in the motor boat, they had obviously been

533
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,500
 doing this journey for a while.

534
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,120
 They needed someone to guide them back.

535
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,200
 And I bet you in the back of their mind, when they see this family picnicking, they're

536
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,560
 probably thinking, "Oh no.

537
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,960
 Like are they going to be trapped too?

538
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,140
 We've been at this for hours.

539
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,140
 Hours we've been lost."

540
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,320
 And when they first hit that barrier and the family's like, "Huh?

541
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
 What's going on?

542
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
 The kids are looking at each other.

543
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
 They're like, "This sucks.

544
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
 I'm eating them.

545
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
 I'm eating them.

546
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,280
 We're just going to have to cannibalize them."

547
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,140
 And then they all get free.

548
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,740
 What about the people in the canoe who weren't at the launch when they got there?

549
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,760
 They didn't see an elderly couple jumping in their car.

550
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,900
 What happened to them?

551
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:12,420
 Did they go to yet another time and place in that same swamp?

552
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,900
 It was interesting because just tonight, maybe 10 minutes before I started recording

553
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,720
 this episode, I'm recording this episode real early, I'm on the export.

554
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,920
 This guy, he works in the Pacific Northwest.

555
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,600
 Him and his buddies are doing some work in the outdoors.

556
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,720
 He's not giving it obviously what he does for, you know, he doesn't want to get docks

557
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,600
 or anything like that, but they're on a path in the woods and they know they're supposed

558
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:43,080
 to be these subpaths breaking off of it and they're walking, they're walking for 15 minutes

559
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,960
 and they're lost.

560
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,660
 They don't see the subpaths, they know that are there.

561
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,460
 He goes, "We work this trail pretty often.

562
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,460
 We know this area."

563
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,620
 In this version, all three of these people, the OP and his two friends, both become physically

564
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:06,580
 ill and need to lay down to kind of regain their composure and then bam, they wake up,

565
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,580
 there's another guy there being like, "Dude, what are you doing?

566
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
 What are you doing on the job?

567
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
 What are you guys doing here?"

568
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,580
 And he's telling this story.

569
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,200
 He goes, "We were just out for this walk and we ended up a place that wasn't familiar

570
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,240
 to us even though we've been on this path several times."

571
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
 It wasn't right.

572
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,480
 He goes, "We walked.

573
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,380
 We walked for a half hour.

574
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,660
 We could not find our way out."

575
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:35,920
 And there was a fourth person there who was with them, but he apparently was just standing

576
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,720
 there or walking the other direction and when he sees the three other workers walk into a

577
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,940
 direction, the fourth guy says, "I felt a funny feeling.

578
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
 I turned around.

579
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,600
 You guys were just gone.

580
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,140
 You guys had disappeared into the forest."

581
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:57,860
 It's an interesting story because you can go, these people go missing and then we file

582
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,980
 these missing people reports and that's kind of unfortunately it a lot of times or you

583
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,220
 find the bodies later.

584
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,520
 And so you go, "Jason, can you look for missing people reports of elderly people who

585
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,620
 rented a canoe, rented a canoe that day or that week in oaky-fun oaky swamp?"

586
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,540
 But if you're having disturbances of time and space, would you think to look for missing

587
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,940
 people's reports from 1910?

588
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:29,900
 Would you think of looking for missing people reports that go back so far and they're just

589
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:37,360
 lost in this loop like a tape recorder that's constantly playing or even more terrifying

590
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,540
 that the people who got lost originally, it's not that an elderly couple went missing in

591
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:50,700
 1910, it's that a young, vibrant couple out on their honeymoon go missing and time warps

592
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:57,220
 in such a way that they can exist in that realm slowly aging.

593
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:03,700
 They'd been there for 60, 70 years rowing that boat looking for a way out.

594
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,520
 I know what you're thinking, "Well, how did they eat?"

595
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,440
 Well maybe they're on squirrels, I don't know man.

596
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,240
 You expecting to make everything up?

597
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,400
 Maybe they're like just like stabbing crocodiles or maybe because of the space time continuum

598
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,640
 is so messed up you don't have to eat nothing.

599
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,920
 You know that, didn't you know that?

600
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,480
 So I don't know, I don't have all the answers but it's spooky either way.

601
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,000
 There's a world where people disappear and they're missing until they're old or there's

602
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,880
 a world where old people go missing.

603
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,560
 You don't want to live in either of those, right?

604
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,940
 And you would just be in such a survival mode, you would just keep rowing, you would keep

605
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:44,420
 walking, you would keep hiking through that area desperate to find a way out.

606
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,780
 Those men could have still been lost there to this day, just two more missing people

607
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:56,540
 posters in a post office as they slowly fade and crumble and everyone but the family members

608
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,300
 forget about them.

609
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,900
 But in reality they're continuing to boat through the swamp.

610
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:09,480
 How many people who have gone missing haven't had a horrible fate like being kidnapped or

611
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,440
 dying but had a terrifying fate?

612
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:21,160
 One of living, one of existing but they exist in a world that they can never find their

613
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:27,000
 way out of.
