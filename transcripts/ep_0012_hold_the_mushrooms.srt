1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,220
 Ancient Aliens Debunked and Magic Mushrooms.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,420
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:24,100
 Okay, that was a little bit clickbaity.

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,700
 I'm not going to talk about magic mushrooms.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,740
 I hope I didn't get your hopes up.

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,460
 But I'm going to talk about some amazing mushrooms.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,040
 Now I do have to say I just recorded a 15 minute rant on PizzaGate and I was like, "This

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,620
 is not a fun topic.

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,860
 This is not a fun topic.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,220
 Maybe I'll have a special PizzaGate episode."

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,580
 But I just was like, "Oh, that's...

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,700
 I mean, it's just one of those things that it's something that I kind of do want to cover.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,300
 It's back on the news actually.

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,380
 The Health and Human Services employee called John Podesta a pedophile and said that liberals

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,180
 sacrifice babies in satanic rituals.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,460
 And it was completely ridiculous.

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,460
 Completely ridiculous.

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,140
 And she had to apologize and she got demoted and so on and so forth.

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,060
 What everything about PizzaGate is really not a lot of evidence about it.

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,060
 Circumstantial evidence.

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,060
 But here's my thing.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,020
 So I went on like a 16 minute rant about that and about conspiracy theories and blah,

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,020
 blah, blah.

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,140
 And it just wasn't very lively.

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,780
 So that's always the balance with a show like this.

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,280
 I kind of want to keep it informative, but at the same time I want it to be relatively

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
 entertaining.

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,140
 I did talk about fat bombs in that original draft too.

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,700
 So yesterday I was talking about being on the keto diet and part of that is you have

30
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,820
 to eat a lot of fat.

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,220
 And right now I'm actually on a fat fast.

32
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,300
 That's where you don't eat anything but fat and it helps kind of move the keto along.

33
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,300
 Now here's the thing.

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,940
 I think I'll bulletproof coffee.

35
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,740
 So you take black coffee, put some coconut oil in it and you put some butter in it and

36
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,740
 then you drink it.

37
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,140
 And it's like no calorie, well it's calories, but it's all fat and the coffee itself doesn't

38
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,500
 have any calories and it just like gives you energy and it gets your body going.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 Now here's the thing.

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,100
 I don't have any coffee and I don't have any butter.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,900
 So I've just been putting a two tablespoons of coconut oil and a glass and a tablespoon

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,580
 of margarine and a melt in it and I drink it.

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,580
 It actually works.

44
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,500
 It actually does give you a lot of energy.

45
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,940
 Yeah, it's going well.

46
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,940
 It's going well.

47
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,620
 It's funny once you start kind of changing up your diet just even a little bit you start

48
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,140
 to notice big changes with it.

49
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,180
 Not eating a lot of carbs.

50
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,300
 I have more energy.

51
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,180
 When I eat carbs, when I go off keto my kitchen is, I don't, I stopped doing dishes for some

52
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,180
 weird reason.

53
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,180
 I just let dishes pile up.

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,700
 That's probably like the biggest side effect of eating carbs for me for whatever reason.

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
 I just have a ton of dishes.

56
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,060
 Normally I just eat my food and wash my dish.

57
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,860
 Anyway, so that has nothing to do with anything we're going to talk about.

58
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,260
 So I watched this documentary the other day and it's three hours long.

59
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,540
 Okay, let me rephrase that.

60
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,220
 I watched parts of a documentary the other day.

61
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,500
 It's three hours long but it allows you to skip around in the documentary to the subjects

62
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,100
 you really want to hear about.

63
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,780
 The documentary is called Ancient Aliens Debunked.

64
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,980
 It's available on YouTube and it is amazing.

65
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,260
 It's an amazing piece of work.

66
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,620
 So what this gentleman did was he starts off by saying he was a fan of Ancient Aliens,

67
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
 the television show.

68
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,540
 He found it very intriguing.

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,940
 But over the years he looked into a lot of the claims and he found out that they weren't

70
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
 true.

71
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,100
 They would claim they say archeologists don't know how they did this and he would go, no,

72
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,460
 here's archeologists saying they know how they did this.

73
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,340
 They'd say this material could only be cut with a diamond.

74
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,140
 He goes, they're actually saying it's a different material.

75
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,740
 When you look at the archeological records, it's sandstone but Ancient Aliens is saying

76
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,140
 it's granite and diorite, which are two completely different on the hardness scale.

77
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,540
 I think it's the Mohs scale or whatever.

78
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,140
 They're completely, I didn't know that until I watched the documentary.

79
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
 I'm not going to act like I'm all smart.

80
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,220
 But so he, and he lays it out.

81
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,820
 He goes, I don't think Ancient Aliens made mistakes.

82
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,420
 I don't think this is a case of just a few mistakes here and now.

83
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:14,260
 He goes, this is an obfuscation.

84
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,740
 This is a purposeful muddiness of the facts.

85
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,220
 The most fascinating thing to me was the portion on the Nazca lines.

86
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,620
 Now Nazca lines is something that I was fascinated by as a kid.

87
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,300
 Those lines drawn on the desert, the concept was, was there alien landing pads?

88
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,420
 Why else would you be able, why would you draw stuff that could only be visible from

89
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,260
 the sky unless you were drawing them for aliens?

90
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,260
 What's the first part of it?

91
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,180
 The second one was how they did it in the first place.

92
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,580
 The only way you could ever do that was by being in the sky and telling you where to

93
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,580
 draw.

94
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,580
 Now here's the thing.

95
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,260
 If it was alien ships and it was runways, I don't think they would just drag their feet

96
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,260
 through the ground.

97
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,540
 They'd use lasers or they would, you know, use alien.

98
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,740
 They'd be like, oh here, here's this thing we invented.

99
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
 It's called concrete.

100
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
 Give it the times.

101
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,020
 They'd pour it and they'd have an alien runway.

102
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
 None of that stuff is there.

103
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,220
 He explains why the Nazca lines is on such level ground.

104
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,780
 He explains how they were made.

105
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,140
 He explains why they were made.

106
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,180
 They were made because the people who lived up there in Peru, it's a desert and they needed

107
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,380
 rain and these were symbols to let the gods know that they were there.

108
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
 And where to rain.

109
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:30,340
 He goes, the lines are always pointing towards where water would be or followed rivers.

110
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,700
 I mean, it was just the Nazca line thing.

111
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,980
 It was like a 20 minute segment.

112
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,660
 It just goes point by point by point by point.

113
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,100
 I cannot recommend this documentary enough.

114
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,060
 If you are a fan of ancient aliens and you want more information, you want to see the

115
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,620
 other side of that argument.

116
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,340
 If you're a skeptic and you want to be able to debate ancient aliens with people, I don't

117
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,980
 know if that's something that you do as a hobby.

118
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,580
 Or there's an even a better thing about the documentary.

119
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,820
 It's very comfy.

120
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,100
 The guy speaking just has a great tone to his voice.

121
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,220
 At a certain point I had to go read some other stuff.

122
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,420
 I just let the video play.

123
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,140
 It's just very, it's almost like white noise at a certain point, but it's white noise that

124
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
 you can learn from.

125
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,140
 So that's good.

126
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,380
 Now, before in the original version, this is where you could insert a 15 minute rant

127
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
 into PizzaGate.

128
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
 We're not going to do that.

129
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,380
 We're not going to do that.

130
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,820
 I come across a lot of stories that are a little too dark.

131
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,660
 And again, I'll have to figure out some way to put those in, but we're not going to worry

132
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,660
 about that today.

133
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,060
 This story though is fascinating.

134
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,260
 So I was reading online today, which you know every good story starts like that.

135
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:41,460
 And somebody mentioned that in Oregon, in the Oregon, which is where I'm at, is the

136
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,140
 world's biggest life form.

137
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,460
 The biggest life form on the planet is in Oregon.

138
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,580
 And what it is, it's a massive onion.

139
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,980
 I mean, it's a massive mushroom.

140
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,060
 It's a massive mushroom.

141
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,740
 And so of course I saw that and I was like, okay, I need to find out if this is real or

142
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
 not.

143
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,740
 So I typed in large mushroom, Oregon.

144
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,340
 I don't even know if I was that concise with it.

145
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,420
 But anyway, so I typed in giant mushroom, Oregon.

146
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,660
 I don't know why I had to tell you that part.

147
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,340
 But anyways, so it's true.

148
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,380
 The biggest life form on the planet is in Oregon and it's a giant mushroom.

149
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,980
 It's 2200 acres.

150
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,820
 Now of course I'm thinking, oh, that's awesome.

151
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,180
 That's like a mushroom you could cut a house in and live in.

152
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,780
 But no, it's not that cool.

153
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,020
 It's actually underground.

154
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,140
 It's like the mycelium.

155
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
 I don't know.

156
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,660
 I should probably get like a thing that, oh, whoa, never mind.

157
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,340
 I should probably get something that does, what are those things called?

158
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,140
 I can't even think of the word, pronunciations.

159
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,340
 I should get a program or something that pronunciates stuff.

160
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,820
 But anyways, so it basically, it's this mushroom that is under the ground.

161
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:05,420
 It's just like black shoestring filaments that go through the forest.

162
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,500
 It's 2400 years old and it kills trees.

163
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,820
 And that's how they figured out where it was because trees die because it basically

164
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,060
 sucks all the nutrients out of the trees.

165
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,980
 It's 3.5 miles across and extends an average of three feet into the ground.

166
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,500
 So it's basically just, when you're walking through that, you're walking on a giant life

167
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,340
 form, a single life form.

168
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,740
 And every so often you'll see golden mushrooms popping out and that's kind of an idea.

169
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,700
 Like the mushrooms itself are kind of like, they'll pop out of the ground and they'll

170
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,220
 release spores.

171
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:44,100
 But the life form, I guess the mushroom, I've heard that the mushroom that we see is actually

172
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,580
 just the spore releaser.

173
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:54,220
 The stuff under ground is the life form itself, the mycelium or something like that.

174
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,700
 So anyways, I think it's, so imagine that you have this giant life form just going through

175
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,140
 the forest and eating stuff.

176
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,660
 You cannot tell me that mushroom is not smart.

177
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,900
 Something that's 2400 years old, that is that big.

178
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,220
 You can't tell me it doesn't have some sort of intelligence.

179
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,700
 Some sort of, it's gained some sort of sentience.

180
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,660
 Maybe it's not as smart as the talking animals from episode one.

181
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
 Actually, you know what?

182
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,160
 It may actually be smarter.

183
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,540
 Something that's 2400 years old, I don't think it's, I don't think it biologically could

184
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
 be stupid.

185
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
 Right?

186
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,700
 I mean, like, I think at a certain point it would start to be like, oh, you know, my arm's

187
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,420
 like way over here and then here's this other arm.

188
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,140
 I better figure out a way to make these two arms talk to each other in case this arm has

189
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,660
 to like warn this arm that like, I don't know, a bunch of beavers are coming.

190
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,900
 So it starts to like build neural pathways.

191
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,700
 That's my hypothesis.

192
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:58,620
 What's interesting is that this actually is the largest life form, but about 10 years

193
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,460
 ago or something like that, I don't remember.

194
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,140
 I'll have to look through the article.

195
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,700
 But anyways, they found another one in Washington right across the river.

196
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,380
 They found another massive, yeah, it was 1500 acres.

197
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,260
 It was over by Mount Adams.

198
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,900
 And that was found in 1992.

199
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,140
 And scientists were said, well, we know the signs are of that one.

200
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,580
 There's a bunch of dead trees.

201
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,620
 Let's see if there's another area with a bunch of dead trees.

202
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,260
 So they came across the river here in Oregon and they found this guy.

203
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,820
 Now, you know what's weird?

204
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:34,860
 So they keep saying like it's scientific name, the armarillo, Osteuio, whatever.

205
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,180
 Anyways, it should have a name.

206
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,660
 They should have named it by now.

207
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,700
 If it's this big, it should have a mushroom name.

208
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,700
 It should be not Toad, not something stupid.

209
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,780
 I like Toad and Super Mario Brothers too, actually.

210
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,220
 He was probably my favorite character.

211
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,120
 But like at this point, we should name it.

212
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
 We should name it.

213
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,740
 I can't think of a mushroom name off the top of my head.

214
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
 I don't know.

215
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,860
 I don't know.

216
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,780
 But anyways, we should name it because it deserves it.

217
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,260
 It's 2,400 years old.

218
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:17,180
 That's older than a bunch of stuff.

219
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,500
 That's older than a bunch of stuff.

220
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,660
 Now, I was also reading online because again, I was looking into mushrooms and I haven't

221
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,220
 been able to find any verification of this fact.

222
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,700
 Okay, so you can say this isn't true.

223
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,580
 But let me read exactly what this person said.

224
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,680
 You know how beneath all the dirt and shit, there's eventually a sort of super dense shell

225
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,940
 of rock that keeps the inner core and whatnot at bay.

226
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,820
 So we're talking about like in the planet.

227
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,100
 The planet is a globe.

228
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,820
 That's supposedly covered by mycelium.

229
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,600
 Mushrooms and other fungus was the first life ever to appear on earth before the dinosaurs

230
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,060
 and everything else.

231
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,380
 That fungus has stayed here since then, disregarding all the matter getting added through asteroids

232
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,380
 and other space shit.

233
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
 Just constantly...

234
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,820
 Okay, I thought it was a little more concise when I originally read it.

235
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,340
 But anyways, this point is that...

236
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:16,660
 So underneath the dirt and everything, but before you get to the core, he says that it's

237
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,460
 like he heard at least that it's covered in mycelium.

238
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:27,940
 So basically there's a giant mushroom life form like in the middle of the planet.

239
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,740
 And now that I'm kind of saying that aloud, it sounds pretty stupid, but my point is,

240
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
 okay, let's just...

241
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,660
 This is true for a second.

242
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,860
 That underneath the dirt, there's a giant net...

243
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,860
 There's one of these guys.

244
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,860
 There's one of these...

245
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,300
 I still can't come up with a name.

246
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,100
 But anyways, there's one of these big mushroom things, but it's like under the whole planet.

247
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,300
 Like it's inside the planet, it's feeding off nutrients and stuff like that.

248
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,900
 How big that would be, how old that would be.

249
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,740
 And the thing in Oregon, the mushroom in Oregon, they say that it started from a single spore.

250
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,300
 It wasn't any sort of like weird fluke.

251
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
 It just landed...

252
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,300
 Well, I guess it is a fluke.

253
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,180
 It landed in the perfect environment, but just a single microscopic spore has now evolved

254
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,340
 into this giant mushroom thing.

255
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,340
 So who's not to say that there isn't even bigger ones out there?

256
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,700
 Who's not to say that there's one under the planet or like inside the planet?

257
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,340
 Like, we don't know.

258
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,380
 Maybe that is a valid conspiracy theory.

259
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,180
 I would say so.

260
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,100
 Even though I just heard about it today and I've done actually no sizable amount.

261
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,660
 See, this is, I think, part of the problem with conspiracy theories is that I've done...

262
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:45,820
 I've read two articles on this, and a post on 4chan.

263
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,300
 And my brain's already thinking, "Maybe it's possible.

264
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
 Maybe it's possible."

265
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:56,820
 I like to think that I am now not going to go out and write a book about how I have

266
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,580
 definite proof that there is a living, thinking mushroom entity at the core of the planet,

267
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,260
 and I'm not going to spend the rest of my life trying to prove it.

268
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,380
 I think it's a fascinating theory to talk about.

269
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,700
 This is a lot of times how conspiracies or misinformation can be out there, because

270
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:23,820
 someone who's just read an article will spout off everything about the subject.

271
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:32,620
 I'm calling the kettle black here, and I obviously have no authority on any sort of issue.

272
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,740
 But I find it fascinating.

273
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,700
 I'm kind of talking around in circles here, but I think you know what I mean.

274
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,260
 Like sometimes people, like let's...

275
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
 No, no, no, no.

276
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
 I think you know what I mean.

277
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,260
 I don't think I need to go any more into detail.

278
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,980
 I don't know what I'm talking about.

279
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,860
 I find it fascinating.

280
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,780
 And my enthusiasm may override any sort of logical thing.

281
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,820
 I don't think I'm again going to tell people that there's a giant mushroom at the planet

282
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,060
 in the middle of the earth.

283
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,340
 However, I will probably mention it and say, "Hey, you want to hear something interesting?

284
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,100
 I think there's a giant mushroom at the planet in the center of the earth."

285
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,260
 And then if other people want to take that as fact, then I guess that's on them, right?

286
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,300
 It's not the gun.

287
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,300
 Who kills people?

288
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
 It's the person who pulls the trigger.

289
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,460
 I'm just the gun.

290
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,620
 I'm just the knowledge spilling out into the universe.

291
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,780
 Someone else wants to believe it and write a book on it and dedicate their life to discovering

292
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,900
 the giant mushroom...

293
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,620
 What's a name, dude?

294
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,700
 I am literally looking around my house trying to figure out a name, and I am realizing that

295
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,540
 I have no brand name.

296
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,820
 We can call it Blade Trinity because I have the novelization for that, but I don't think

297
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,500
 that's going to stick.

298
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,700
 I don't know, man.

299
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
 I don't know.

300
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
 I don't know.

301
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
 We're going to table that issue, but it's going to bug me.

302
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,220
 I know in the middle of the night I'll record a short little podcast saying, "I have the

303
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,340
 mushroom man's name."

304
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:04,660
 That being said, I'm going to go back to my original thing that I find nature completely

305
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
 fascinating.

306
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,020
 A lot of times it can be...

307
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:15,100
 If it turned out that there was a giant mushroom in the middle of the planet, why am I still...

308
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,300
 If it turns out that there is a giant mushroom in the middle of the planet of the Earth,

309
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,540
 I would be like, "Oh, that is so fascinating that someone could be that old."

310
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:30,500
 If I found out that there wasn't one, I don't necessarily think I'd be disappointed, but

311
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,220
 I still think the concept that it could have been there or it could have happened is fascinating.

312
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
 I don't know.

313
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,660
 I don't know.

314
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,540
 So there is a chance that I just edited out another five minutes of me talking about

315
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,380
 mushrooms in the center of the Earth.

316
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,340
 I think the center of the Earth is probably the creepiest thing about the Earth.

317
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:54,020
 People talk a lot about how the ocean is totally unexplored and it's creepy, and I'm like, "Dude,

318
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
 screw that, man."

319
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,180
 Yeah, the ocean's creepy, but I don't ever have to worry about it because by the time

320
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,140
 I hit the bottom of the ocean I'll just be jelly anyways.

321
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,420
 Caves are creepy.

322
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:10,140
 They just go into the core of the Earth, not the core literally, but they just dark and

323
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,500
 sometimes they get really tight.

324
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 Oh, caves are terrible.

325
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,060
 I think caves are far more terrifying than the ocean.

326
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:20,780
 I'd much rather fall into an ocean and just be compressed eventually because you're going

327
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,660
 to die if you just fall into the ocean, but you could be stuck in a cave for years eating

328
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,740
 bats and stuff, never finding your way out, like beating up bears and stuff.

329
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,000
 At a certain point your survival mechanism would override and you would just be punching

330
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,580
 shit in the dark and then you'd punch a shadow so many times and then you'd be like, "Well,

331
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,020
 I guess I killed that raccoon and you could eat it."

332
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,100
 The ocean, you're dead.

333
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,620
 You sink and you get squished by the water pressure.

334
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,140
 It's always that thing, what do you want, a quick death or a slow death?

335
00:17:52,140 --> 00:18:00,700
 Do you want to be violently accosted in a cave system for the rest of your life or do you

336
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,820
 just want to like, I wonder how long it would take to sink to the bottom of the ocean?

337
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,580
 Like if someone tied weights to your feet and they dropped you off the marinara trench,

338
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,100
 I should look that up, but I'm not going to now.

339
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,020
 No, you know what?

340
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,180
 I'm going to look that up here.

341
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
 Let's see.

342
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:44,980
 Okay, so I'm back.

343
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:52,900
 So if you jumped, well I don't know if you jumped, but anyway, so it takes 90 minutes.

344
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,940
 So it takes 90 minutes to reach the bottom of the marinara trench apparently according

345
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,540
 to a National Geographic and honestly that's like in a submarine and stuff like that.

346
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,260
 But anyway, so if you had weights tied to your feet and you jumped out of a boat, it

347
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,780
 would take you about an hour and a half.

348
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,940
 It would take you the length of a movie, Blade Trinity, to sink to the bottom of the

349
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,020
 ocean, but you wouldn't actually, you'd be compressed by the time.

350
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:24,020
 So you see, well, I'm assuming you had a like a breathing apparatus on and you just sank

351
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,820
 down so you could breathe, but you would get squished and then freeze to death.

352
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,060
 In a cave system, you'd be down there until you were like 80.

353
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,860
 You'd be down there until you got some like disease from eating guano all day long.

354
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,820
 Like you're like, oh, I got, I got white lung from breathing and all this bat poop.

355
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,540
 So, so again, I'd much rather fall into the ocean than a cave system.

356
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,340
 So yeah, I think that, I think that was someone on topic with mushrooms.

357
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:59,060
 I'm not for sure, but I do have to say this, I find this doing this podcast absolutely fun

358
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,060
 and fascinating.

359
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,900
 I'm having a great time talking to all of you guys.

360
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,820
 I hope you guys are having fun too.

361
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,780
 So we are going to be back Monday and we are going to talk about Michigan Blue Hell.

362
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,020
 That's the topic I wanted to talk about for a while.

363
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,660
 I like doing the conspiracy theories that people don't know about and that's another

364
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,660
 thing with Pizza Gate.

365
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,180
 It's relatively popular and a lot of people have covered it, but things like Dublin, Wisconsin

366
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:29,380
 and Michigan Blue Hell and even the Lady Gaga one wasn't super popular.

367
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,300
 So I like doing stuff like that rather than the big ones because the big ones you can

368
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,220
 get more information on like even the Mandela Effect one.

369
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,260
 It was just kind of a brief overview, but I do implore all of you to go out and like

370
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,620
 they say in the flat earth research, go out and research it yourself just for the sake

371
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,620
 of entertainment.

372
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,480
 Honestly, like I said, I like reading about this stuff and I think it's just another

373
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,700
 fascinating view, a way to look at the world.

374
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,620
 But again, I hope you're having fun listening to the podcast.

375
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:05,060

 My website is DebRabbit.com.

377
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,980
 That's where you can find all of the episodes and also all the show notes are going to be

378
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,020

379
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,020

380
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,540
 If you have any personal things you want to send to me, any notes like the show, hate

381
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,340
 the show, what can be better, just go ahead and email me.

382
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,980
 And I will see you guys again on Monday.

383
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,540
 Take the next two days off and working on some other stuff, but I'm having a lot of

384
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
 fun with the show.

385
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,740
 We're on episode 12, so it's going great.

386
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,620
 I still don't have a sign off and I still don't have a name for the world's biggest

387
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,740
 mushroom, but we will answer both of those soon on the next episode of DebRabbit Radio.

388
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:54,740
 Bye.

389
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:01,740
 Bye.
