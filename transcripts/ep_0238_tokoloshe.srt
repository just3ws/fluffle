1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 A breaking news story that might be true crime or point towards a darker conspiracy.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,420
 And then we take a look at a little creature from South African folklore.

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:22,040
 What happens when a tiny mischievous little creature from South Africa gets involved in

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,600
 the world of true crime?

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
 That sounds actually a pretty good story.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,200
 I can't wait to get to that one.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,200
 Today on Dead Rava Radio.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rava Radio.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,720
 I should say welcome back remaining listeners.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,920
 After yesterday's episode, the fat witch episode, I still have no idea where that came from.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
 I have no idea where that came from.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
 I'll check.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,240
 Usually my screen is blanked out by text documents.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,720
 I can't really see how long certain segments are taking.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,040
 But at a certain point I was like, "Oh, I've just been talking about fat witches way too

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
 long.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,200
 I just had to go with it."

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
 And so thank you for coming back to the...

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
 I liked it.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
 I liked that segment.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,920
 Whoa, it wasn't a segment, it was a whole episode.

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,920
 But I got to stop talking about it yesterday because we actually have some breaking news.

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,160
 Now, things are developing very quickly with this one.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,720
 But I wanted to go ahead and get this out because this is weird.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,880
 And what's weird is nobody is covering it.

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
 Outside of local news, you'd think this would be big news.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,640
 There was a little blurb on Drudge, nothing on Fox, nothing on CNN.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,680
 I had to go and look at local news sites, what's going on.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,240
 June 4th, 2019, in the town of Pocahontas, Arkansas.

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,440
 Linda Collins Smith is found dead.

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,160
 She's shot, she's murdered, it's been ruled a homicide.

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,760
 Who's Linda Collins Smith, you ask?

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,800
 Former state senator for the state of Arkansas.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,320
 She was a Democrat.

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,520
 She switched party to become a Republican.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,680
 She's no longer a state wall.

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
 She's definitely not one now.

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,840
 But at the time of her murder, she was not a state senator.

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,160
 That happened on June 4th, 2019.

42
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,320
 They think that Linda may have died the night before because people are saying that they

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
 heard gunshots in the house.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,080
 But I don't know why nobody called the cops.

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,600
 Eventually they do find her.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,400
 Now the reports are weird because some people are saying they had gunshots in the area like

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
 the day before.

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,720
 But other reports are saying the body was very, very badly decomposed in the house.

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,920
 June 6th, 2019, six hours away in the state of Oklahoma, in the city of Normans.

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,080
 So Norm in Oklahoma, six hours away.

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,160
 Former Oklahoma state senator, Republican, Jonathan Nichols, shot dead.

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,320
 With Jonathan, they have not, he was shot.

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,640
 But they have not said whether or not it is a homicide or a suicide.

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,040
 But you have within a week two former Republican state senators separated by six hours shot

55
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,480
 in their own home.

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,000
 No news on it.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
 One.

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,320
 One little blurb, halfway through drudge.

59
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,520
 No one else is covering it.

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,120
 Two scenarios, one's very likely.

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
 Murder/suicide.

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,320
 Affair, something like that.

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
 Who knows.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,960
 I don't have enough to really say that's the case, but that, it's possible.

65
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,520
 But then the conspiracy side starts to think, what could the, it's weird because the media

66
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,040
 is like, oh no, these are totally unrelated.

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,680
 Even though all these data points match.

68
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,560
 State senators, Republicans, she actually served from like 2011 to 2014, I believe,

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,720
 and he served from 2000 to 2012.

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
 But they're state senators.

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,000
 They weren't like in the national Senate or the real, the Senate, the real Senate, the

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 varsity Senate.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 They were JV.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
 They were farm league senators.

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,840
 But anyways, I'm sure they had to have met each other.

76
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,120
 Being that close to each other, both having the same profession, the same political party,

77
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,620
 all of that stuff.

78
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,080
 How did they know each other?

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,120
 She has been ruled a homicide.

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,040
 It may be a suicide, murder/suicide, he may have killed himself, but who knows.

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,080
 Could also be, it's possible they were involved in some shady business, and someone was cleaning

82
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,160
 up the messes.

83
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
 It's possible that some government wetworks team, which is actually the, like, Wetworks

84
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
 is one of the coolest names.

85
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,960
 I love that name.

86
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,840
 Wetwork, if you don't know, is up and close assassination, mercenary work.

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,620
 I actually found out about it because there was an old image comic called Wetwork.

88
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,140
 That is such a, I remember thinking, that's the name of a superhero team that I want to

89
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,140
 join, Wetwork.

90
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,860
 But anyways, it could be some Black Ops Wetwork thing, cleaning up.

91
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,180
 Could be some Alien Disclosure project, and they were about to, who knows, it could go

92
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
 up.

93
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,420
 Unfortunately, it's, it's, two people have died.

94
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,580
 That's the unfortunate part.

95
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,900
 And normally I would just think, you know, murder/suicide.

96
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,180
 I just think it's weird that no one's covering, no one's covering this.

97
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
 No one's covering this.

98
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,560
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story here, though.

99
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
 First story was actually a recommendation.

100
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
 This is a recommendation.

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,880
 This was the one I called out the other day.

102
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
 I couldn't find out who did this.

103
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,840
 On YouTube, there's a guy named Shinigami Dan.

104
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,160
 I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

105
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,040
 Like, I always pronounce stuff right.

106
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,760
 Shinigami Dan, I appreciate this recommendation.

107
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,520
 Quite fascinating story.

108
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,720
 Let's go ahead and hop in the Dead Rabbit Durageable because we're going to have to, because we're

109
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,680
 going to have to travel to South Africa.

110
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,800
 And we're actually going to go back in time a bit because this creature we're going to

111
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,520
 talk about is quite, has quite an odd story behind it.

112
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,960
 So in Africa, they built these little hut things.

113
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,600
 They're known as rondollos.

114
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,800
 Am I pronouncing any of this stuff right?

115
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,040
 Basically huts type things and everyone would sleep in together.

116
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,460
 And you would have the family in there sleeping in these huts.

117
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,380
 And on cold nights, you would light a fire in the hut to stay warm.

118
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,760
 Now I know a lot of you guys are going, well, yeah, and you know where this part's going.

119
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,560
 But sometimes someone in the hut would wake up and everyone else in the hut was dead.

120
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,640
 Fires out, three dead family members surrounding you.

121
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,600
 You go out, tell the chieftain they come in.

122
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
 Chieftain comes in, puts on his sunglasses.

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,000
 Looks like it's a case of togalashi.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 That was okay.

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,160
 Sorry, that's an old joke.

126
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,960
 Anyways, and they go, what's a togalashi?

127
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,100
 And the chieftain realizes he has to make something up on the spot.

128
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,860
 So I'm kind of getting ahead of myself.

129
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,500
 I got stuck on that stupid joke.

130
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 Here's what happened.

131
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,620
 So you started having these families that were dying.

132
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,580
 And they couldn't figure out what it was.

133
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,100
 So of course, like all folklorists, you're going to go to some sort of supernatural reason

134
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,300
 behind it.

135
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,420
 Because it wasn't just that everyone in the hut was dead.

136
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,860
 It was that you weren't.

137
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,520
 So the question is, why weren't you killed?

138
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,320
 Putting on my sunglasses, you're very suspicious that everyone died.

139
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,680
 But you, it's like, sorry, sorry, sorry, chieftain.

140
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,240
 Anyways, so ZSI, it's Zulu scene investigation.

141
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,920
 So anyway, ZSI comes into the village and they go, what is going on here?

142
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,320
 And what they realized was that, because it was happening.

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,720
 It wasn't super common, but it would happen.

144
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,240
 And they started to put together connections that people were laying on the ground.

145
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,360
 The chances of them dying and their sleep was much higher than people who were propped up.

146
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,540
 Like had their head against the back of the wall or were in a bed.

147
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,760
 People laying on the ground would die.

148
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,520
 Now we understand what was going on now.

149
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,080
 That basically by lighting the fire indoors, they were creating carbon dioxide poisoning

150
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,880
 or carbon monoxide, one of the two.

151
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,940
 You don't want to breathe in too much of one or the other.

152
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,840
 But what would happen was the fire would start eating up all the oxygen.

153
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
 Oh, no, no, no.

154
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,260
 I have my grasp on science is limited.

155
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,700
 It's basically Zulu level.

156
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,820
 It's basically like 1400 Zulu warrior level science.

157
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,460
 But anyways, fire god eats oxygen.

158
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,420
 And replaces it all with carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide's heavier.

159
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,660
 So it comes down.

160
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,260
 So if you're laying on the ground, you're just breathing in carbon dioxide.

161
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,980
 You die and your sleep.

162
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,820
 People who were propped up were still getting some of that sweet, sweet oxygen while people

163
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,420
 laying on the ground didn't.

164
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,860
 But what the legend was was that there must be some sort of demon killing these people

165
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,860
 in their sleep.

166
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,420
 And basically the idea came of this thing called a toko loch or tick loch.

167
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,180
 Toko loch though is how I saw it mostly pronounced.

168
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,180
 Not pronounced.

169
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
 That's how I mostly read it.

170
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,980
 And so they said this little creature will basically sneak in your hut and draw the breath

171
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,620
 out of you and kill you unless you put bricks under each leg of your bed.

172
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,140
 Basically you want to lift your head up or lift your whole body up so the toko loch can't

173
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,140
 get you.

174
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,940
 It's this little tiny guy, little tiny person that follows you around.

175
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,740
 So that's it, right?

176
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,940
 Shin Gami Dan sent us this story about this little tiny guy that breathes your air and

177
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,140
 it's a normal folklore.

178
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,300
 Oh, he also rapes women.

179
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
 I forgot that point.

180
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,420
 But there's not a lot of details on that.

181
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,820
 It's just like, and what I'm thinking that part of that comes from is from women who

182
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,500
 were dying from the carbon dioxide thing and then waking up almost like a night terror

183
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,420
 because they're basically suffocating and they wake up before they actually die and

184
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,580
 they like are just physically shaking.

185
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,580
 They're like freaking out.

186
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,220
 It's the same thing as like a sleep paralysis type of thing where as they're coming out

187
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,540
 of this dream as they're lifting up out of the carbon dioxide, they may be hallucinating

188
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,060
 themselves being violated.

189
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,580
 I think that's where that part of the myth came from.

190
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,780
 But we've covered cryptids like that before.

191
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,500
 But what's interesting is that this cryptid or this creature, this demon, whatever you

192
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:04,140
 want to say, we can trace it to that root, but his madness goes far beyond a fire inside

193
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,700
 of a hut.

194
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,980
 The toko loch is not just this little creature that the people believe walks around your

195
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
 hut.

196
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,720
 It wasn't just a little dude who hung out on your hut.

197
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,740
 They hung out everywhere.

198
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,300
 There was a lot of them.

199
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,100
 And you could not refuse any of their commands.

200
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,180
 Case in point.

201
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,140
 There was this young guy named Eli Fosse.

202
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,180
 That actually was his full first name.

203
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,180
 Sorry.

204
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,980
 His name was Eli Fosse Masome.

205
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,100
 That's what it is.

206
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,580
 This story is in 1953.

207
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
 We're still in South Africa.

208
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,180
 So much, much more recent than these old folklore tales.

209
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,620
 Eli Fosse really wanted to be a shaman, but he wasn't a good shaman.

210
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,040
 He quite sucked at the black arts.

211
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,880
 I would assume he wasn't fat enough to do the magic, but for whatever reason, he couldn't

212
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,480
 make it as a shaman.

213
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
 So he goes to another shaman.

214
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,040
 This story is creepy, too.

215
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,280
 This story is really creepy.

216
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,440
 He goes to this other shaman to get some advice.

217
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,040
 He goes, "I really need your help.

218
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,840
 I really want to be a good shaman."

219
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,640
 This is what the shaman says.

220
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,680
 You will go with this son of mine.

221
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,360
 Little boy walks out or walks in, I guess grammatically is right.

222
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,100
 That's into the room.

223
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,560
 This is the exact quote from the shaman, master shaman.

224
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,660
 He says, "You will go with this son of mine and get me the blood of 15 people to help

225
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,260
 my chemist shop.

226
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,140
 First, I want the blood of a girl."

227
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,500
 Now Eli Fosse, this is all what he said happened.

228
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,940
 And he said that the son was actually a tokolosh in disguise.

229
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,840
 And he knew it was a tokolosh because it basically shrunk down to little three apple-high Smurf

230
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
 height.

231
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,440
 Tokoloshes are quite small.

232
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,200
 Sometimes they're described as being up to your hip, but this one crawled onto his shoulder.

233
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,040
 So he had this little demon person sitting on his shoulder who was basically helping

234
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,520
 him get these 15 vials of blood.

235
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,000
 He couldn't refuse the orders of the tokolosh.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,120
 And it would constantly be saying, "Go here.

237
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,840
 Yes, go up here.

238
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
 Yes.

239
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,620
 There's your victim.

240
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,620
 Nice and ripe.

241
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,620
 Killer.

242
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,740
 Killer."

243
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,460
 And Eli Fosse ended up like doing basically what the tokolosh said.

244
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:29,220
 His first victim, he raped and murdered a woman in front of his girlfriend.

245
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,380
 And the girlfriend is like, "Uh, this is not a good third date.

246
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,660
 I was expecting something totally different."

247
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,920
 The girlfriend runs to the cops and he gets arrested.

248
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,160
 And he's sitting there with this tokolosh on his shoulder and the tokolosh is like,

249
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,240
 "You want to escape, don't you?

250
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,960
 I will help you escape, but we have 14 more vials of blood to get."

251
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,440
 Now he's in police custody, but he escapes.

252
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
 Gets out.

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
 Gets out of jail.

254
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
 Goes away.

255
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
 People start looking for him.

256
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
 Kills five children.

257
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,740
 Filling their vials with blood.

258
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
 Gets arrested.

259
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,660
 "You want out, don't you?

260
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,620
 I can help you out.

261
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,940
 And then we get more blood."

262
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,100
 Escapes police custody.

263
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,620
 They can't keep him in jail.

264
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,100
 This is 100% documented.

265
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,180
 Other than the little dude on his shoulder.

266
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,420
 He actually got arrested multiple times and escaped each time.

267
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,320
 Little murderer at this point.

268
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,040
 And he fully believes that the tokoloshi is helping him escape custody.

269
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,200
 Not only just escaping from jail, but escaping capture as he continues to kill.

270
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,560
 Now he's known in South Africa as the axe killer, but he also used knives and clubs.

271
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,840
 And it's funny because a club is the only weapon really out of those that has one purpose

272
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
 to kill.

273
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,460
 A club was created to kill.

274
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,020
 Knives you can use for cutting fish and stuff like that.

275
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,020
 Axes for chopping down trees.

276
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:15,340
 But a club serves no purpose other than to bash in another human's brains or an animal's

277
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
 brains.

278
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,900
 It was only designed for one thing.

279
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,620
 To kill.

280
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,740
 So he's walking around South Africa.

281
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,000
 This whole thing lasted of course 18 months.

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,220
 He ended up getting the 15th vial of blood.

283
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,260
 It's like a horribly dark side quest of an MMO.

284
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,300
 He gets his 15th vial of blood and the tokolosh says, this is an exact quote, this is what

285
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,540
 he said the tokolosh said after the 15th vial of blood.

286
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,940
 You have rendered good service.

287
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,540
 Now we will wash in the river and part.

288
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:55,220
 Now I should have mentioned this earlier, but the tokolosh is a river, is a water spirit.

289
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,900
 That's basically where they come from, that's where they get their power.

290
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,580
 They're formed when a tokolosh is first born, a red hot poker is stabbed into its brain

291
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
 which gives it all these mystical powers.

292
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,060
 Don't try that at home.

293
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,140
 Don't try that at home.

294
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:15,340
 But it also uses water, it can turn invisible when it gets wet and it probably uses it as

295
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,980
 some sort of information highway.

296
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,500
 Like jumps in, finds out what all the other tokoloshes are doing.

297
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,580
 It's how they get their internet porn, they just splash around in the river, they're like

298
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,580
 oh yes.

299
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,340
 That's how they get all their information in the water.

300
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,180
 Anyways so he does go into the river, him and the tokolosh part ways.

301
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,700
 I don't know if the original dude gets the vials of blood, they're kind of don't really

302
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,420
 tell us that because all these sources are really old.

303
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,580
 This was reported in Time Magazine when it happened.

304
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,460
 It was kind of a big story back then.

305
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,100
 But after him and the tokolosh part, he's arrested.

306
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,500
 He's arrested.

307
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,340
 And while he's in jail, getting ready for execution, they have a trial and his defense

308
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,140
 was I didn't do it your honor.

309
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,460
 Little man sitting here, I exhibit A and he just points at his shoulder.

310
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
 They're like what is it?

311
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,020
 He's like there's a tokolosh sitting here.

312
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,500
 Exhibit A. They're like do you have any other evidence?

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 And he's like no.

314
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
 No your honor.

315
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,380
 Anyways, they do go to trial.

316
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,380
 He says that he shouldn't be found guilty because the tokolosh made him do everything.

317
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,220
 And the judge says, that's stupid, that's totally stupid.

318
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,060
 But at the same time, the region, they still believe in this thing.

319
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,740
 So people are like maybe a tokolosh shouldn't make him do this.

320
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:33,540
 A bunch of like Zulu, Shaman and Chieftains, nine of them actually petitioned the court

321
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,700
 saying we want to be there when he's hung.

322
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,820
 Oh, spoiler alert.

323
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,220
 He's found guilty from the trial.

324
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,140
 And these Zulu, Chieftains and Shaman say we want to be there when he's hung because

325
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,140
 we want to be sure that a tokolosh does not save him from the news.

326
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,980
 But while he's in jail, Eli Fasi, when he goes to bed, he makes a little tiny bed next

327
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,980
 to his.

328
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,180
 And the guard goes, what are you doing?

329
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,380
 He goes, oh, I'm just making this in case my friend wants to show up, make him a little

330
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,700
 bit.

331
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,420
 So insane, maybe, really seeing this thing, who knows.

332
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,580
 But eventually, he does go to the gallows and everyone's watching and the Shaman are

333
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,340
 standing there watching.

334
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,300
 The trap door springs and he hangs and he dies.

335
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,020
 And one of the Shaman turns to the camera and goes, good.

336
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,940
 I was afraid the tokolosh was going to try saving him, but it didn't happen.

337
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,900
 And everyone starts kind of filtering out of the execution room.

338
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,300
 Or this is not a room, it's a hanging execution area.

339
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,460
 But one of the Shaman said, you know, there's a little epilogue.

340
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,260
 One of the Shaman turns to the camera as well and goes, yes, it was good that Eli Fasi died

341
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,260
 today.

342
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,460
 He was an evil man tormented by a tokolosh, but evil nonetheless.

343
00:17:52,460 --> 00:18:03,700
 However, there was a chance that Eli Fasi himself may now become a tokolosh to curse others.

344
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,220
 Shaman starts walking out, credits start rolling.

345
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,460
 So that was all reported in Time Magazine and it was a real trial.

346
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,660
 There was really 15 murders.

347
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
 What's creepy about it?

348
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:19,340
 Well, other than the multiple murders, the talking demon and the insane man.

349
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,260
 As I was reading and I thought, you know what it seems like to me?

350
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,620
 That the master Shaman was being controlled by the tokolosh.

351
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,380
 It's almost like an it follows slash the ring type of thing.

352
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,940
 Where he's being tormented by this little demon who's taken on the body of a son.

353
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,460
 He may not even have a son.

354
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,260
 He may have just assumed the form of a son to trick other people.

355
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,700
 But you have this master Shaman.

356
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,980
 I imagine him sitting in a shop and the creature going, get me blood.

357
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,980
 Get me blood.

358
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
 I need blood.

359
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
 Get me blood.

360
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,820
 And the Shaman's like, oh my God, please stop.

361
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
 Stop.

362
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,620
 And he's just being tormented and he can't fight it.

363
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,300
 And then this young man walks into his shop and says, I need some help.

364
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:11,620
 And he passes that evil curse onto this young man who couldn't resist the power of the tokolosh.

365
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,260
 And then you imagine that the sh, it's like, again, the Shaman is finally like, oh thank

366
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,220
 God, I can finally not hear that horrible little creature screaming in my ear all the

367
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
 time.

368
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,100
 Finally get some peace and quiet.

369
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,100
 But his peace and quiet would have only lasted 18 months.

370
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,940
 Because after they washed in the river and parted ways, one day the Shaman sitting there,

371
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,940
 he's making tea.

372
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,020
 Here's the door open.

373
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,620
 He turns around and he sees a small figure walking through the front door carrying 15

374
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:51,580
 little jars saying, I'm back daddy.

375
00:19:51,580 --> 00:20:00,620
 To be tormented by spirits is one of those weird things that modern day people say they

376
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,180
 are just insane.

377
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,060
 Demonic possessions, things like that, it is one of those things that is really hard

378
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,300
 on the border of mysticism and science.

379
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,020
 Because we don't know enough about how the human brain works.

380
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:21,660
 And we really know nothing about how the mystic arts work.

381
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,540
 We have a, we can like do a roadmap of the brain, but then you go, well, are some people

382
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,980
 born bad or is it nature versus nurture and people go, I don't know.

383
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,260
 Like we have a limited knowledge of the brain and we have a made up or intuitive knowledge

384
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,820
 about the supernatural, but it can never really ever be proven.

385
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,900
 And demonic possession slides right between those two.

386
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,060
 When a person's having an epileptic fit back in the 1800s, it would look like they were

387
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
 possessed.

388
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,900
 Like here, go in this room, you can see this person having an epileptic fit.

389
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,020
 If it was the 1800s, you would think this guy was possessed by the demon.

390
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,060
 You'd be like, yeah.

391
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:08,220
 But then you have stories of people who are mentally insane, who you would go, this guy

392
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,420
 is, he was considered a sadistic sex killer.

393
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,180
 Experts were saying he's not insane.

394
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,780
 It actually looks like he enjoys killing people.

395
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,940
 Because what's weird is after he was caught, he took them and showed them locations of

396
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,260
 all the people he killed.

397
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,260
 He knew exactly where he buried them.

398
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,500
 And they go, scientists go, or psychologists said, well, they're scientists too, but they

399
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,820
 said he seemed to relish going back to these areas.

400
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:37,220
 He seemed to be a sexual, sadistic pervert who enjoyed going back to where the bodies

401
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
 were.

402
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,220
 So he simply seemed insane.

403
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,340
 But then you go, if that's true, if we totally accept the scientific rationale, how did he

404
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,980
 keep escaping from jail?

405
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,420
 And scientists just have to go, I don't know.

406
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,380
 And that's where it's in the middle of the two.

407
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:02,140
 There's just enough stuff that we can point to actual science and say, this is how a sexual,

408
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,820
 sadistic pervert's brain works.

409
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,300
 To how does a jail door get unlocked?

410
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,260
 How does a man twice slip out of police custody?

411
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,780
 It's easy to always accept the scientific answer.

412
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,100
 It's easy to always accept the paranormal answer.

413
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,500
 But the answer may actually be closer to the middle.

414
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:34,300
 Because a sadistic sexual pervert is probably more easily influenced by a demonic creature.

415
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,740
 And if you had someone who really wanted to go around bashing people's heads in with

416
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:47,780
 a club, and they find a little sprite, a little evil creature that says, you and me, buddy,

417
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:59,340
 you do the killings, I'll help you get away, and together we'll wash this country in blood.

418
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:06,500
 Even an insane man wouldn't turn down a deal like that.
