00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
 When a massive tornado hits the city of Joplin, Missouri, people run for their lives and cling to their loved ones.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,440
 It looks like nothing can save them.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,200
 But then...

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,080
 they showed up.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,080
 And then we take a look at a story about a young couple.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,440
 Everything seems to be going fine in their relationship, until she notices that her boyfriend all of a sudden

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,960
 loves to cook her food.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:43,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,480
 I hope you guys are having a lot of fun out there doing whatever you're doing.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,600
 First off, writing in the Dead Rabbit command right now on his own personal pet Velossa Raptor. It's Kyler Wartman.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
 *mimics*

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,000
 That's not him. That's the Velossa Raptor. *mimics*

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,880
 Sounds like a cross between a motorcycle and a man who's 44 years old doing sound effects on his closet.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,200
 It's somewhere in between there. Kyler, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot of this episode.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,360
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you're not cool enough to have a pet Velossa Raptor,

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,960
 that's fine, too. Just help spread the word about the show.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,840
 Really, really helps out a lot. Kyler, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you safely. I'm staying away from Velossa Raptor.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,320
 I'm gonna toss you the oars for the Dead Rabbit robo. We're gonna go ahead and leave behind Dead Rabbit command.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
 We are... *laughs*

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,040
 Okay, technically we're going to Missouri, so we could have taken any vehicle, but it's been a long time since we've taken the robo.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,440
 So we're gonna take a nice leisurely trip down the streams and rivers of the United States.

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,560
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit command. We are headed out to Joplin, Missouri.

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,200
 Splish Splash.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,560
 Splish Splash. The oars. That's the sound oars make. You didn't know.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,640
 You're not a nautical man like myself. We are in Joplin, Missouri. It's May 22nd,

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,600
 2011. Now, if you know any- if you're from Joplin, or if you live anywhere in Missouri,

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,880
 you know that is probably the one day in the entire history of the city of Joplin. You don't want to be there.

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,240
 May 22nd,

31
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,520
 2011.

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,960
 That's the day the tornado hit. Now, not a tornado.

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,920
 The tornado. To be fair, before this there had only been two tornadoes since

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,480
 1971 that hit the city of Joplin, and really it was just kind of the area of Joplin.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,280
 So at 5/10 p.m.

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,720
 When they start sending off tornado sirens in the city of Joplin, people are like, "Ah, you know, it's been

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,040
 almost 40 years." Since a tornado has actually hit Joplin, maybe you'll see a little like

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,480
 cow flying up in the air in a little barn.

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,280
 That'll be it. And hopefully it's not your cow and your barn. You can go back to work.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,160
 So when the tornado sirens start going off in the city, some people paid attention to them, but other people just figured out,

41
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,960
 you know, those meteorologists, they just like their loud sounds.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,680
 But here we are at 5/10 p.m.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,280
 It's just a normal afternoon.

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,600
 This tornado hits Joplin.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,120
 It's rolling down the street.

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,240
 *Mimics tornado sirens*

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,960
 So I've never been in a tornado, but I'm vaguely aware. I saw this documentary called Wizard of Oz once.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,720
 I'm vaguely aware of what they do. I mean, obviously, you're super destructive. They'll destroy houses.

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,040
 They'll knock stuff over.

50
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,960
 But I guess I didn't really understand the

51
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,920
 extent of it. This tornado was actually considered one of the deadliest tornadoes in human history, this tornado that hit Joplin.

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,400
 You had cars thrown into houses. Steel was rolled like paper.

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
 Manhole covers flying through the air.

54
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,080
 I mean, just not like you could pick any two of those. You're still having a bad day, right?

55
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,520
 The manhole covers are terrifying. This tornado got into excess of 200 miles per hour.

56
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,520
 It hit a hospital? This is the thing. People were expecting it to hit the area, maybe.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,920
 But this thing rolled through downtown. It hit a hospital, shut off the power, backup generators didn't work, people on ventilators died.

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,720
 This tornado did such damage to the hospital. It deformed the foundation.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,000
 It warped the earth under it. They had to end up tearing the hospital down. It hit a nursing home.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,760
 It's like this thing was looking for the weakest people to pick on. It's like, "Oh, where's the daycare center?"

61
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,920
 It hit a nursing home. Nursing home collapsed, killing a bunch of elderly residents.

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,240
 It flattened both a Walmart and a Home Depot. You kind of need those to rebuild.

63
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,600
 That was the one thing that everyone was thinking like, "Oh, you know, this sucks. You're watching your house float away. You're in the basement.

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,240
 You get house." But they're like, "I'll go to Walmart later. I'll go to Walmart. Grab some wood. Build a new house."

65
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,800
 The Walmart was destroyed. The Home Depot was destroyed. We're talking big buildings.

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,520
 Again, these aren't little anti-M houses. These are actual buildings. At one point, a Pepsi distribution plant.

67
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,520
 Nothing but concrete and steel gets completely leveled.

68
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,280
 This tornado just tears through the city.

69
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:18,960
 And people weren't expecting that. Again, with the tornado sirens, they're not thinking it's going to take a leisurely stroll through the center of town.

70
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
 There's one terrifying story I'm going to tell you.

71
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,720
 There was a Pizza Hut manager named Christopher Lucas.

72
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,240
 They're in their Pizza Hut and you hear the sirens. You don't really think anything of it.

73
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,880
 And then you see this tornado that got to be a mile wide.

74
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,200
 It led a path of destruction 22 miles long, but the tornado itself was a mile wide.

75
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,920
 People were trying to out-drive it. They couldn't.

76
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,160
 Nothing that big. You're pretty much screwed at that point.

77
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,240
 Christopher sees this tornado coming down the street. He orders all of his employees into the walk-in freezer.

78
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
 Because I mean any port in a storm.

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,960
 And they go to close it. Now a lot of walk-in freezers, I used to work at Godfather's Pizza, they're usually kind of jury-rigged a bit.

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,720
 So they're not the most sanitary.

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,400
 So you're not constantly unlocking it. There's usually some kind of thing you can do to make it easier to open and close basically.

82
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
 And it seems like in this case they had a bungee cord.

83
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,960
 They have it rigged up that way. They run into the walk-in freezer.

84
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,560
 And he goes to shut the door, but at this point the wind pressure is so much that he can't even get the door shut.

85
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
 So now he's trying to hold

86
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,720
 the door shut of the

87
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,840
 walk-in freezer. And there's a bungee cord that is used in the operation. That's not that's not how walk-in freezer is supposed to be used.

88
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,760
 There's a bungee cord that this place used for, you know, whatever way to kind of rig it to make it easier to use.

89
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,080
 He has the bungee cord wrapped around his arm. He's holding the door shut. He has 15

90
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,560
 employees behind him huddled in the walk-in freezer and he's holding it. He's holding it.

91
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,400
 And the tornado reaches the pizza hut and the force of the wind opens the

92
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,120
 walk-in freezer door. And because his arm is strapped to the door,

93
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,680
 he flies out with it. The bungee cord snaps and this pizza hut manager gets sucked up into the tornado.

94
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,440
 Now I gotta say this. I was thinking when I thought of that, I go, that's actually a pretty awesome way to go. Like

95
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,200
 no, I'm not I'm not being joking either. I mean like Christopher

96
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
 Christopher

97
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,680
 quick thinking saved 15 people, but

98
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,000
 like if I had to choose between falling off of a mile high building or getting sucked into a mile

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,240
 wide tornado tornado any day, dude, that'd be way cooler than like drowning.

100
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
 I mean you figure you're gonna spin around a lot and you're gonna like yell

101
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,320
 and I'm sorry if someone from his family listening to this. I'm not again making light of this, but

102
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,680
 if I'm just I think that's dope. Like I think that he probably went out like having a good time.

103
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,080
 Having a good time, right?

104
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,400
 Because it's a once in a lifetime literally a once in a lifetime experience and again

105
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,600
 like not many people can say they died in a tornado. Like when he's walking around in heaven and he's like, hey, dude,

106
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,080
 how'd you die? That's what they do in heaven. That's how they greet each other.

107
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,880
 Hey, how'd you die? And some guys like, oh heart attack talking all these people.

108
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,160
 How many people can say they died in a tornado, dude? And you're like

109
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
 and you're like flying around. It's probably super loud.

110
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
 I don't think it's probably super loud. It is super loud.

111
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,240
 But then like as you're flying around you're I'm assuming what kills you is you bumping into other things

112
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,840
 like cows and like couches and other things that start with co cobwebs.

113
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,600
 You're bumping and all this stuff and that probably kills you like an SUV is flying around. You hit it.

114
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,480
 The SUV and you're like, whoo. And you like lean back in the seat and the SUV's flying around

115
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,600
 or you just get thrown out of the tornado to a certain point

116
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,000
 or just spins you around so much that you just kind of you just kind of give up. You're like, I'm dead.

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,400
 I'm not joking. Like I've thought about that. I would much I would rather die jumping into a volcano

118
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,160
 and I didn't think about how cool it would be to die in a tornado until I read that story. But jumping in a volcano would be dope.

119
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,840
 Dying in a

120
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,200
 tornado would be pretty cool. Hurricane would be kind of lame because that's just like you standing on one location

121
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,840
 and then you're somewhere else and dead because you know, like the wind blows you super hard

122
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,920
 or like it blows a tree down falls on you lame. That gets a zero on the Jason Detometer.

123
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
 But tornado would be dope because you just kind of spin around falling would suck

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,920
 drowning would suck burning would suck but see the volcano.

125
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,000
 You just like are kind of dope. How many people get to say they died in a volcano?

126
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,600
 There'd be a bunch of virgins down there and be like, hey girls, what's going on?

127
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,080
 Where?

128
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,640
 So this is my Jason's death death o meter podcast. I got I got a little distracted there.

129
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,280
 Um, anyway, so this tornado hits and totally levels the town.

130
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,160
 6900 houses were destroyed.

131
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,960
 2000 buildings were destroyed. It really really demolished

132
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,360
 Joplin and some estimates say 25 of the city was destroyed during this.

133
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,000
 161 people were killed. 1150 people were injured.

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,240
 Here's two weird tidbits before we get into the weirdest part of the story.

135
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,040
 The Piccadilly Circus was traveling through town and they were doing a vote count.

136
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
 They're going to recount the votes of the past election.

137
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
 And the Piccadilly Circus showed up.

138
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,560
 And while the Piccadilly Circus was in Joplin, this tornado hit so they can't perform obviously.

139
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,520
 They were like, look at our death defying stunts and everyone's like boring boring.

140
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,080
 We just survived one of the worst tornadoes in human history.

141
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,920
 But because the Piccadilly Circus was there, they actually had elephants

142
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,640
 that they used to help move debris so first responders could get through.

143
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,240
 So basically that would be I would be out there like just clapping

144
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
 and saluting an elephant as they're like pushing trees around the guys.

145
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
 Like get out of the way. I'm trying to clear the road.

146
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,480
 I'm just standing in the middle of the road saluting them.

147
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,080
 Throwing peanuts to them. They're like, quit distracting the elephants.

148
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,040
 Ambulances are waiting. I'm like, make them dance. Make them dance.

149
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,440
 This is probably the most lighthearted podcast you'll ever hear about the Joplin tornado.

150
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,040
 Here's another odd one. The day after the tornado.

151
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,320
 So the elephants have moved all the debris around.

152
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,840
 There's a police officer helping with the recovery efforts.

153
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,680
 He gets struck by lightning and killed.

154
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,200
 Could you imagine that? That would suck.

155
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,600
 On the death on the death o meter lightning would be kind of cool.

156
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,920
 But imagine you're like working with your buddy.

157
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,080
 You're working with your partner and you're trying to like move debris around to save someone and you hear a

158
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,760
 and you look over and your coworker is smoldering.

159
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,440
 Not like he is smoldering gonna look not like he's sexy,

160
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
 but he's dead and smoky and stuff.

161
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,680
 That would be oh my and you'd be like, what next?

162
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,760
 What could possibly go wrong?

163
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,800
 Well, that's a good segue for where we're headed.

164
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,200
 Kyler, let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy.

165
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,320
 We're going to take a little tour through the town of Joplin.

166
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,360
 You're like, Jason, are you going to keep tracking jokes and raiding their deaths?

167
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,600
 No, I'm not going to do that.

168
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
 Kyler, what would you think?

169
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,920
 Why would you think such a thing?

170
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
 The velocity wrapped in the back seats shaking its head.

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,440
 It's like, I got a lot of this information we're going to talk about from an article in the

172
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,160
 this journal.

173
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,640
 Please don't reference me.

174
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,240
 There's an article written by Todd C. Frankel for the St. Louis Dispatch.

175
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,480
 So 25% of the city was destroyed by some estimates.

176
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,040
 You had entire families wiped out.

177
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,000
 Devastating natural disaster.

178
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,640
 But then you started hearing the stories of survival.

179
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,640
 People who were huddled in a bathtub.

180
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,120
 The house gripped apart all around them.

181
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,720
 One family they got underneath a mattress and the mom held onto it as tightly as she could.

182
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,840
 And the house was just being torn to shreds all around them.

183
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,400
 You have a story of a three-year-old girl and her mom.

184
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,440
 They're trying to outrun the tornado in their car.

185
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,000
 They can't.

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,520
 It's just too massive.

187
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,320
 There's a house and they figure, let's jump out of the car.

188
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
 Let's try to get into that house.

189
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
 Hopefully someone will open the door.

190
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,840
 We're out of options.

191
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,480
 And so the mom and her daughter jump out of the car and they're running.

192
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,040
 And the tornado is right on top of them.

193
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,600
 The mother throws the daughter into a ditch and jumps on top of her daughter.

194
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,520
 And that tornado passes over them.

195
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,640
 It picks up their car and the car begins to roll towards the ditch.

196
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,760
 And the mom is just holding onto her daughter, praying for a miracle.

197
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,640
 And the car doesn't crush them.

198
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,040
 The tornado doesn't whip them out of the hole.

199
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,880
 It simply passes them over.

200
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,040
 After the danger has passed, the little girl turns to her mom and says,

201
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,520
 "Did you see them, mommy?

202
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,840
 Did you see them?"

203
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,960
 The mom's like, "What?"

204
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,840
 And she's wiping splinters out of her eye.

205
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,520
 She's like, "I can't see anything."

206
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,040
 "Did you see them, mommy?

207
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,560
 They saved us."

208
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,640
 The mom's like, "Who?

209
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,680
 Who saved us?"

210
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,480
 The little girl goes, "The butterfly people.

211
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,080
 They use their wings to make the debris."

212
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,680
 She knows the word debris.

213
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
 She's three years old.

214
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,080
 "The debris, all of the stuff in the tornado.

215
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,400
 They protected us."

216
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,520
 As people are digging out of the rubble,

217
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,080
 as people are kind of walking around this destroyed landscape,

218
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,760
 they start hearing the same story over and over again.

219
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,160
 Children were saying that they had seen the butterfly people.

220
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,360
 Now, all the stories had a few things in common.

221
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,600
 One, these things could only be seen by kids.

222
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,440
 Two, they showed up in a way to protect people.

223
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,200
 A lot of times they used their wings.

224
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,560
 And three, I shouldn't say all the stories shared this,

225
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,840
 but you saw this a lot.

226
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,640
 A lot of the stories weren't firsthand.

227
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,160
 People were saying, "I heard that Molly down the street

228
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,920
 was protected by a butterfly person."

229
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,720
 Or, "Did you hear the story about..."

230
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,600
 The story that I told you is a popular one.

231
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,640
 This happened a little,

232
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,440
 but no one can say that they were the girl in the ditch.

233
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,560
 They were the mom on top of the girl, anything like that.

234
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,000
 It was always a third-hand story.

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,280
 Some kids, though, said, "Oh, no, no, no, I saw them."

236
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,360
 I did see the butterfly people,

237
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,600
 and they used their wings to protect us from debris.

238
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,760
 And some of the kids said,

239
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,040
 "Not only did they see the butterfly people protect them,

240
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,080
 they saw the butterfly people flying around in the tornado

241
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,960
 and grabbing people who had been trapped in the tornado

242
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,360
 and flying them off into the sky."

243
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,880
 It's an interesting observation,

244
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,480
 because we have a town here that was hit by this tornado

245
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,400
 22 miles of destruction.

246
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,960
 I think I said 20 earlier, 22 miles of destruction.

247
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,960
 161 people killed, 1,150 people injured.

248
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,200
 The population of the town was over 50,000 people.

249
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,760
 2,000 buildings leveled, 6,900 homes destroyed.

250
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,440
 50,000 people, you only had a casualty count of 161 people.

251
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,640
 This town is also located squarely in the...

252
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,560
 what's known as the Bible Belt.

253
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,800
 So it's a fairly religious area.

254
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,160
 The idea of these children seeing angel-like figures.

255
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,880
 Part of it could be their religious upbringing.

256
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
 Part of it could be people overall trying to make sense

257
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,160
 over how could you lose so little lives?

258
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,080
 In a town with 50,000 people with such massive destruction,

259
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
 like there must have been somebody looking out for us.

260
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,920
 Now obviously the other counterpoint is,

261
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,680
 why don't these angelic beings...

262
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,040
 why didn't they save everybody?

263
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,600
 And that's always a question when we look at natural disasters.

264
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,480
 It's that's a philosophical question.

265
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,480
 But it is interesting to note that in this story

266
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,520
 only the children could see the butterfly people

267
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,640
 as how they described them.

268
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,840
 I did a story a while back about a guy who walked into a school with his wife.

269
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,280
 They took the school hostage and he had built this bomb

270
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,080
 and he was going to blow up the kids if he didn't get his money.

271
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,120
 It's actually a really good episode.

272
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
 I'll put it in the show notes.

273
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,600
 It's one of my favorites.

274
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,440
 And in that story, angels showed up in the classroom,

275
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,960
 but only the kids could see them.

276
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,480
 You guys remember that?

277
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,840
 The angels showed up in the classroom

278
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,440
 and they were calming the children down

279
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,880
 and telling them what to do.

280
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,120
 And before the events were playing out,

281
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,760
 the angels were kind of like giving them advice.

282
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,520
 And it was something only the children could see

283
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
 and it wasn't until afterwards

284
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,960
 when the children were being interviewed,

285
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,080
 they talked about the angels.

286
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,040
 So it's an interesting connection to that.

287
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,720
 These children who are in danger.

288
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,000
 And even we did the story about the blue lady in Miami.

289
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,240
 That's another great episode, "Myths Over Miami."

290
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,360
 I'll put that in the show notes.

291
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,640
 Where it's only the children who are seeing these angelic figures

292
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,960
 that are interacting in their daily lives.

293
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,600
 Was there actually any butterfly people there?

294
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,920
 Were they figments of the imagination?

295
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,120
 Were they actually angels?

296
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
 Were they something else?

297
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,680
 Who knows, right?

298
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,080
 It's an interesting story nonetheless.

299
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,360
 It's either mass hysteria to explain

300
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,960
 why so few people died in such a massive event,

301
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,120
 or it's an actual phenomenon

302
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,840
 that there is some external force trying to save people.

303
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,200
 Or it's somewhere in between.

304
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,480
 Maybe it's tulpas.

305
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,640
 Maybe it's people, children creating these images

306
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,560
 that become real because they want so badly

307
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,880
 to be saved from the evils of the world around them.

308
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,320
 But whatever the reason,

309
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,040
 it truly is a miracle that more people didn't die

310
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,960
 during such a massive disaster.

311
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
 Kyler, I'm going to go and entosh you

312
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
 the keys of the carbonar copter.

313
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,600
 We have helped them rebuild.

314
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,960
 I now have a pet elephant.

315
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
 I'm feeding it all the peanuts at once.

316
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,080
 We're going to put the elephant onto the carbonar copter.

317
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,160
 Let's leave behind Joplin, Missouri.

318
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,440
 We are headed out to small town USA.

319
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,760
 [Demonic voice]

320
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,800
 In small town USA, there's a 22 year old woman.

321
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,320
 We don't know her name.

322
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,440
 We're going to call her Becca.

323
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,000
 And her 24 year old boyfriend will call him Robert.

324
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,640
 They've been dating for four years.

325
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
 Everything has been going great.

326
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,800
 But in the past six weeks,

327
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,280
 Becca's noticed that Robert's been acting a little weird.

328
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,720
 Just something seems off.

329
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,840
 Bye honey, I have to go to work.

330
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
 Becca says as she opens the front door,

331
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,240
 she looks out and in her garden,

332
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
 she sees a fresh piece of fruit.

333
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
 Now that's normally not,

334
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,480
 this normally means you have a successful garden.

335
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,600
 But this was a fresh piece of fruit that was chopped up.

336
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
 Just laying there, store bought fruit.

337
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
 And so she asked Robert,

338
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,640
 hey, do you know why there's some fruit in the garden?

339
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,960
 And Robert goes, oh yeah, I'm sorry.

340
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,080
 Becca, I don't know how to say this,

341
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
 but there's a little family of mice in the shed.

342
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,240
 And I don't know, I just,

343
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,520
 they look so cute, you know,

344
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,280
 like the mama and the daddy and all the 300 babies.

345
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,720
 I wanted to feed them.

346
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
 So I was chopping up little pieces of fruit

347
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,760
 and leaving out in the garden.

348
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,440
 And then at night, the little mice come out, eat it.

349
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,360
 And Becca goes, that's kind of sweet, actually.

350
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,400
 That's kind of cute.

351
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,320
 Becca herself is into exotic.

352
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,800
 I don't know if a mouse cance is an exotic pet,

353
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,880
 a wild mouse in your shed is exotic.

354
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,520
 But Becca herself has exotic pets.

355
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,720
 She actually has giant African land snails

356
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,880
 that walk around this terrarium,

357
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,080
 doing snail stuff.

358
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
 So she's like, oh, that's really cute, right?

359
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,880
 A couple of weeks later,

360
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,320
 Robert starts this new hobby.

361
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
 He begins to cook for her.

362
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,880
 I just love, I'm struck with a passion for cooking.

363
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,240
 I was out late at one night.

364
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,520
 A chef bit me.

365
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,840
 Now every full moon I am forced to cook.

366
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,360
 He's cooking all the time.

367
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
 It's just this weird sudden change for him.

368
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,720
 He's making these meals.

369
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,440
 He's baking cakes, making pies, all this stuff.

370
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,800
 And she loves it.

371
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,440
 What woman doesn't want her man to be a great cook?

372
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
 So she's totally down with it.

373
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,440
 But after a while, she starts to realize that maybe,

374
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
 maybe not all men are meant to be cooked.

375
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,400
 Sometimes when she eats the food, she gets sick afterwards.

376
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,520
 But she doesn't make the connections.

377
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,760
 She just goes, maybe I'm just tired.

378
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,400
 Right?

379
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,280
 She's throwing up.

380
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,120
 She's like, you know what they say?

381
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
 If you throw up twice, time for a nap.

382
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,040
 So she figures maybe it's just like hormones

383
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,320
 or that she's tired or something like,

384
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,600
 she doesn't not really think about it.

385
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,560
 But one day she's at work.

386
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,680
 She works at a coffee shop.

387
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,880
 And her boyfriend's friend, we'll call him Jerry,

388
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,800
 walks into the coffee shop and goes, hey, Becca,

389
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,520
 can I talk to you?

390
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,360
 And she's like, yeah, my break's coming up right now.

391
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
 Let's, let's go ahead.

392
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
 And Jerry goes, listen, Becca,

393
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,760
 I don't really know how to tell you this.

394
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,320
 So I'm just going to come out and say it.

395
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,320
 He starts laughing.

396
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,120
 He starts laughing like me, like I would.

397
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,560
 He goes, you know how Robert's been making you

398
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,760
 a lot of food lately?

399
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
 And she's like, yeah, yeah, he's been making me

400
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,720
 tons of stuff.

401
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,480
 Cakes and pies and pasta and Jerry's like, please stop.

402
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,040
 Please stop.

403
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,880
 Don't don't go on any further.

404
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,640
 Jerry goes, listen, Robert thinks this is hilarious,

405
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,520
 but I don't.

406
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,800
 That's why I'm telling you this.

407
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,680
 He's been taking fresh pieces of fruit and leaving it out

408
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,400
 in the garden to attract slugs.

409
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,320
 And then he takes the slugs and he chops them up

410
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,880
 and he puts them in your food.

411
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,360
 She goes, what are you talking about?

412
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,320
 And he goes, because I don't want to repeat it, right?

413
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,280
 I don't want to repeat it.

414
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
 Because now when I think of apple pie,

415
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
 I just think of slugs with cinnamon on them.

416
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
 Because that's what apple pie looks like anyways,

417
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,800
 because I don't want to repeat it.

418
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,200
 She doesn't believe him and he goes, I figured you wouldn't.

419
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,120
 He shows her photos of a jar of slugs and then slugs

420
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,840
 in a blender.

421
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,720
 We're halfway through this.

422
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,560
 Slugs in a blender is the halfway point.

423
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,160
 So she's obviously disgusted.

424
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,840
 She's also deeply in love with this man.

425
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,000
 She's 22 year old woman.

426
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,960
 She's in love with this man.

427
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,920
 She's not really thinking.

428
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,840
 So this post first showed up on an advice board

429
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,000
 or something like that where she's asking this question.

430
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,120
 She goes, I don't know what to do.

431
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,240
 I confronted my boyfriend about feeding me slugs.

432
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,720
 She didn't rat out that the friend told her.

433
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,520
 So he said, because she said I saw photos of it

434
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,280
 and he goes, have you been sneaking around?

435
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
 My messages are you in my face?

436
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,160
 Which is kind of bearing the lead.

437
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,400
 If you're feeding somebody slugs

438
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,800
 and even if they did hack your account,

439
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,160
 you can't get all indignant about it

440
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,200
 and be like, what?

441
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,640
 You violated my privacy.

442
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,200
 And you'd be like, yeah, you're poisoning me with slugs.

443
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,880
 Anyway, she ends up with going, he's mad at me

444
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,800
 because I'm mad at him for feeding me slugs

445
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,240
 and I don't know how to deal with this.

446
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,840
 Please give me advice.

447
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,120
 People were like, there is no advice.

448
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,920
 Just leave him.

449
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,240
 Just absolutely leave him.

450
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
 She does post an update later

451
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,240
 where she had to go to urgent care

452
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,520
 because she had gotten really sick.

453
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,000
 It turns out she had a high level of metal dehyde

454
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,040
 in her system, which is a pesticide

455
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,240
 that is often used to kill slugs and snails.

456
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,200
 So the slugs and snails that she was eating

457
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,040
 were already poisoned themselves.

458
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,560
 She goes to urgent care.

459
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,440
 She's feeling sick.

460
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
 She has ulcers.

461
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
 They test her for that.

462
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 The police are called by the medical authorities.

463
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,600
 She doesn't call the police apparently.

464
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,480
 The urgent care people do because they will do that.

465
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
 And Robert refuses to talk to the cops.

466
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,320
 She doesn't seem to press charges

467
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,920
 as far as we can tell in this narrative,

468
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,600
 but he refuses to talk to the cops.

469
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,840
 He's basically like, I don't know what you're talking about.

470
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
 I'm not feeding anyone slugs.

471
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,680
 The cops are looking at each other like, seriously?

472
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,360
 We're on the slug beat now.

473
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,840
 We're investigating slug crimes

474
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,440
 because she doesn't really press charges

475
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,720
 and he doesn't fess up to anything.

476
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,680
 They can't do much.

477
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,600
 But so Robert says, okay, listen,

478
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,000
 we'll forget the whole law enforcement thing, Becca.

479
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,480
 Let's sit down and we will talk this through.

480
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,720
 I'll bring the snacks.

481
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,960
 I will bring delicious, delicious snacks.

482
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
 They have this meeting.

483
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,760
 So it's him and Becca and then Robert's friend

484
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
 who I don't know if it's the same guy ratting them out.

485
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,640
 It just says Robert's friend.

486
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,160
 And then Becca brings a friend as well.

487
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,600
 So they have this little pal well.

488
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,080
 And Robert confesses everything.

489
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,800
 He goes, listen, I want to be honest with you.

490
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
 I don't know why I'm doing this stuff.

491
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,240
 I have a compulsion to do it.

492
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,560
 It's kind of like an OCD type of thing.

493
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,760
 I just have to do it.

494
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,320
 And Becca's like, I can understand that.

495
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
 She actually does say that.

496
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,840
 I can understand that because she also has some issues emotionally.

497
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,400
 She understands the need to do things.

498
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,360
 He goes, I don't know why I do this.

499
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,080
 I love you, baby.

500
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,280
 I love you so much.

501
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,080
 And she goes, no, I understand.

502
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,400
 Like maybe I know people have a compulsion to feed other people slugs.

503
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
 I'm sure that somebody's fetish.

504
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,800
 And he goes, well, I've done more than that.

505
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,040
 It started off before the slugs when she wasn't looking.

506
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,920
 He's like, look over there, a bird.

507
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,320
 And she turns, he would spit on her toast.

508
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,200
 That was the first thing he started doing.

509
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,840
 When she wasn't around and she made toast, he would spit on it.

510
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,080
 Now that's gross, but that's not like too bad, right?

511
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,560
 I mean, I think at this point, all of us have eaten food with someone spitting it,

512
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,400
 either intentionally or unintentionally.

513
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,840
 You're rude to a waiter.

514
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,800
 They're spitting in your food.

515
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,640
 Or they're just talking a lot.

516
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,600
 They're spitting in your food.

517
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,880
 That's, it's gross, but it's not into the world gross.

518
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,320
 He also then admits to replacing her beta blockers,

519
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,920
 which is medication to regulate the beat of your heart with salt.

520
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,600
 With salt, the one thing, the one thing that if you get too much of actually affects

521
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,960
 the rhythm of your heart, well, it's not the one thing, but it's one of the things

522
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,240
 you got to be careful of.

523
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,320
 So he was replacing her beta blockers, her heart medication with salt.

524
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,760
 You just wanted to see what would happen.

525
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,520
 We then moved to this level.

526
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,840
 She's a vegetarian and he begins to replace her vegetarian products with meat products.

527
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,000
 She's like, oh my God, this is so delicious.

528
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,640
 This is the best vegetarian meal I've ever eaten.

529
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,280
 He goes, you mean you've ever meaten.

530
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,040
 She's like, what?

531
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,000
 That's not even a word.

532
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,400
 She had vegetarian sausage.

533
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,320
 He replaced that with real sausage.

534
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,440
 Same with chicken nuggets.

535
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,600
 She's like, oh my God, these are so good.

536
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,360
 These are the most delicious vegetarian foods on the planet.

537
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
 Then he made her curry.

538
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,800
 Makes her delicious curry.

539
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,600
 And this is when she said that he started to get weird.

540
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
 This is one of the warning signs.

541
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,360
 He made curry and she's eating it and whenever she would go to take a bite of it,

542
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,640
 he would start laughing.

543
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,800
 She's like, what?

544
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
 She'd go to take a bite of it.

545
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,000
 She puts the spoon down.

546
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,040
 He's like, hee hee hee.

547
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,440
 Ghosts eat it again.

548
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,560
 It's the grip keeper all of a sudden.

549
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,160
 And it starts to make her paranoid.

550
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,080
 She can't figure out why he starts to laugh every time she goes to eat curry.

551
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,440
 So she's like, I don't want to eat curry.

552
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,200
 And she leaves the kitchen.

553
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,680
 She goes into the bedroom and they have this fight and he goes, come on,

554
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,560
 just try the curry.

555
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,680
 And she takes a bite and is super spicy.

556
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,480
 And he starts laughing.

557
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,680
 He goes, yeah, I put so much chili powder in there.

558
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,520
 Oh, I'm so sorry, but I thought it'd be a funny joke to make it super spicy.

559
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,080
 That's why he was laughing every time she went to take a bite.

560
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,880
 You think, you know what?

561
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,280
 That's just a prank.

562
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,440
 That's not even close to spitting on someone's toast or feeding them delicious meat.

563
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,360
 Well, that's what he told her back then.

564
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,800
 Now he's given her the whole story.

565
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,000
 Remember her giant African land snails?

566
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,840
 One of them had run away.

567
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,760
 We've gone hard for a giant snail.

568
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,280
 One of them though had gotten out of the box and she can never find it.

569
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,080
 Well, it turns out that he said he came home one day and it was dead.

570
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,160
 So he took it out of the terrarium, chopped it up and put it in the curry.

571
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,680
 That was the very first time he fed her.

572
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,640
 Molesk was her own pet.

573
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,040
 And let's be honest, he probably didn't come home and it was dead.

574
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,120
 He probably killed it.

575
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:56,320
 So he tried feeding her her own pet and couldn't contain his laughter as she was about to eat it.

576
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,720
 And she goes, I think he put on so much chili to kind of get rid of the taste.

577
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,400
 She's like, I know my Molesk.

578
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,160
 I could taste the snail from a mile away.

579
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,840
 She thinks he put the chili on to disguise the taste of the snail.

580
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,480
 He said at one point he took her tooth.

581
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,000
 We were like, Jason, please stop.

582
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 He stopped at one point.

583
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,880
 He took her toothbrush and rubbed it on the toilet.

584
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,760
 But he said he felt bad about that and washed it off,

585
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,720
 which I call shenanigans on that one because one

586
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,600
 just by a toothbrush, right?

587
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,360
 Like if someone took your toothbrush and you saw them rubbing it on the toilet and they go,

588
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,760
 sorry, and they just ran it underneath the water for a bit, it's not clean.

589
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,040
 Right.

590
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,480
 You got to get rid of the toothbrush.

591
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,760
 There's no amount of cleaning you can do to get rid of that.

592
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
 And I probably, he probably didn't do that.

593
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,280
 I'm imagining he read the room on that one.

594
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,160
 I'm imagining he said that in the look of horror in the other three people's faces.

595
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,720
 He goes, oh, no, no, no, no, but I washed that one off.

596
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,120
 But you would have to boil it.

597
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,120
 To get rid of all of that.

598
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,200
 He says he doesn't know why he does it.

599
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,960
 It's a compulsion.

600
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,840
 He loves her.

601
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,000
 He hopes that they can work it out.

602
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,080
 He'll make a delicious meal for everyone at the party.

603
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,160
 He goes, guys, let's have a, let's have lasagna or beef stroganoff or anything else.

604
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,480
 I can hide disgusting things and everyone's like, no.

605
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,600
 Later on in another post, she does reveal that she left him.

606
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,840
 But now she has a intense fear of slugs.

607
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000
 She's afraid of leaving food out.

608
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
 She has to eat the food that's in front of her.

609
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,160
 She can't get up and get a phone call or start making a meal and leave.

610
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,920
 Not like that happens all the time, but think about it.

611
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,440
 Like how many times do you have the day like, I make my meal in stages?

612
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,960
 Like I'll be cooking it.

613
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,760
 It's not really stages.

614
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,800
 I'll be cooking it and then I'll go and I'll lift weights and then I'll go and I'll.

615
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,360
 But imagine while I'm lifting those weights, a slug crawls across my food.

616
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,320
 That's what she's afraid of.

617
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,040
 She's afraid of slugs crawling across her food.

618
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,640
 Crawling across her food.

619
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,760
 She says that slug, this is the weird part.

620
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
 This is the weird part.

621
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,520
 She goes, she has a problem with slugs invading her house.

622
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,840
 She goes, I find them everywhere.

623
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
 She goes, I see them coming into the house all the time.

624
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,680
 She goes, I've had to seal all the gaps.

625
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,880
 She has an intense fear of it.

626
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,840
 Now some of it may be just every so often a snail comes through or a slug comes through

627
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,720
 and she's blowing it up in her mind or she thinks that nature itself is coming

628
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,280
 after her.

629
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,720
 That slugs are being drawn to her presence.

630
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,600
 That's a little creepy.

631
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,240
 That's little tails from the dark side ending for you, right?

632
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,160
 She ate so many slugs that now they're always inching towards her.

633
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:41,360
 It's like it follows but it's called it swallows and it ends with her swallowing slugs.

634
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,800
 She's laying in bed one night and it's just 1,300 slugs crawling into her gullet.

635
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,960
 She can't even chew them up.

636
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,640
 They're so in her mouth she can't even close her jaws.

637
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,480
 But that's an imaginary scenario.

638
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
 Super disgusting imaginary scenario.

639
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,840
 She's suffocated by all the slugs.

640
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,400
 But this is where it gets even creepier than my imaginary.

641
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,520
 Every slug in the world will eventually crawl in her body.

642
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,760
 After she breaks up with her boyfriend it had been a while.

643
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,120
 She broke up with her boyfriend.

644
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,160
 He moved out of the house.

645
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,040
 She's living alone.

646
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,560
 She's afraid of these slugs coming in.

647
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,520
 One day she's doing some cleaning in the kitchen.

648
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,760
 She finds a jar.

649
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,440
 She's posted a photograph of this.

650
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,800
 It's a jar of four dead slugs.

651
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,920
 And she goes, "He must have left these here.

652
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,080
 He must have caught these and these were slugs he never fed me.

653
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,000
 They look old.

654
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,800
 They look dead.

655
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,200
 He must have left them here."

656
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,920
 And it's interesting because it's almost like she's trying to convince herself

657
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,920
 that somehow her boyfriend didn't recently sneak into her house while she was gone.

658
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:58,560
 And leave four dead slugs hidden in her kitchen.

659
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:05,120
 Who's to say that when she's not at home he's somehow getting into the house

660
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,520
 and planting slugs all over the place?

661
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,200
 Now this story could obviously be made up.

662
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,640
 It could be some sort of internet myth.

663
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,360
 The username on these posts are blanked out for the woman's privacy.

664
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,440
 But even if they weren't it could be a lark.

665
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,160
 It could be made up.

666
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,400
 But we know well enough that there's a bunch of sickos out there.

667
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,960
 So this story doesn't break the bounds of the imagination.

668
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,280
 So if it is true, this guy is still out there.

669
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,400
 This guy is somebody's boyfriend.

670
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,360
 This guy is somebody's coworker.

671
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,040
 This guy is somebody you may know.

672
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:56,160
 Someone who gets off on chopping up slugs and putting them in food.

673
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,840
 Possibly your food, right?

674
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,960
 You may know this guy or someone like him.

675
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:12,640
 Someone who seems totally normal but just wants to run a few tests, pull a few pranks,

676
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,360
 have a secret laugh at your expense.

677
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,520
 They could be your neighbor.

678
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,920
 They could be your minister.

679
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,000
 They could be the cook at your favorite restaurant.

680
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,640
 So somewhere out there is a man with a gleam in his eye, smile on his face,

681
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,560
 a pocket full of slugs, and a chef's hat.

682
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,880
 You may think you're about to sit down and enjoy a delicious meal.

683
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,760
 And maybe you will.

684
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,960
 Maybe you'll find out that for you, the most delicious food on the planet

685
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,400
 is slugs in a blender.

686
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,760
 You freak.

687
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,280
 You mutant.

688
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,440

689
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,440
 I've known this episode other than you, eating a bunch of slugs.

690
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,120
 And then you wake up and there's 1,300 slugs in your chest trying to get into your mouth.

691
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,760

 You don't have to listen to it every day.

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,640
 And I'm glad you're like, "I wish I didn't listen to it today."

697
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,720
 I'm glad you don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

698
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,920
 Have a great one, guys.
