1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
 A horrific murder has people asking, not me, I don't agree with this, but does have people

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,760
 asking, is it okay to murder some children?

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,440
 Again, I'm saying the answer is no.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,840
 Fascinating article, we'll take a look at it.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,200
 And then we end the week by taking a look at the story of a young boy who begins to see

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,480
 the future in his dreams.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,560
 When the real world begins to perfectly match his dreams, can he fight the future?

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,200
 Can he prevent his own death?

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,680
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:53,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
 day too.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,280
 We have some awesome plans for the weekend.

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,360
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,640
 of our Thanksgiving livestream contributors.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,680
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for Corbin's Channel.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,040
 Woohoo, yeah, come on in Corbin's Channel, walk all the way in, VHF, UHF, we don't know

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,160
 what channel you are, but you are welcome at Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,720
 Long time supporter of the show, Corbin's Channel.

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,320
 We're going to be our captain or pilot this episode, if you guys can't support the show

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,600
 financially, I totally understand that I really really really do.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,000
 Just help spread the word about the show, that helps out so much, that's another way

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,040
 you can help the show grow.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,640
 Corbin's, let's go ahead and tassue the hair hang glider, we're going to jump off the highest

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,600
 point at Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,320
 Glide us all the way out to Illinois.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:02:00,680
 Specifically, we're headed to River Grove, Illinois.

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,440
 It's June 2013.

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:11,000
 And in River Grove there's an apartment complex, and how this apartment complex lives the Sportalacus

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
 family.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,620
 The Sportalacus family, as it's probably correctly pronounced, the Sportalacus family, is currently

32
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:25,760
 undergoing some life stressors, to put it mildly.

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,200
 Dorothy, the mother, is trying to take care of her 14 year old son, Alex.

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,160
 But Alex has been diagnosed with severe autism.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,880
 He requires around the clock care.

36
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,240
 And things have gotten so bad, that the police have been called to the residence several

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,100
 times.

38
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:56,140
 He's combative, plus he's a 14 year old boy, he's physically strong.

39
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,000
 And sometimes they just can't handle him.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,620
 Even though you have Dorothy living there, you have his godmother, who also helps take

41
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,100
 care of him, Agatha.

42
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,780
 And then the father and Alex's brother all live there as well.

43
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:17,960
 Alex requires around the clock care, and the family's just having a hard time dealing

44
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,240
 with him.

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,960
 They love him, but they're at their breaking point.

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,280
 Now like I said several times, the police have been called out.

47
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,280
 Alex has been hospitalized, there's photographs of this.

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,440
 When he's hospitalized, he's taken down and he's strapped to the bed.

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,680
 He's restrained to the bed, and of course that's making him panic even more.

50
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,440
 No one would want to be restrained.

51
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:48,900
 You lose all sense of control, because you literally have no control, you're tied down.

52
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,540
 And his mother's watching her son in agony.

53
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,860
 He's being treated like he's a wild beast by this uncaring medical center.

54
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,260
 Well that's how she sees it.

55
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,460
 That's not my personal opinion.

56
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,260
 That's how she sees it.

57
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,840
 And she's starting to see a future with no hope.

58
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,000
 Not just no hope for her, not just that she's going to have to spend the rest of her life

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,080
 taking care of her 14 year old son.

60
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,600
 No hope for Alex either.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:31,200
 What chance does he have at being happy, having a long fulfilling life that any parent would

62
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,960
 wish for their children?

63
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
 This having a hard time with Alex.

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,200
 The mother is distraught.

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,920
 Now the Chicago Department of Children and Family Services have reached out to the Sportalockeys

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,540
 family.

67
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,840
 You know they've offered their services, there are things we can do to help.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,180
 This isn't, you're not alone.

69
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,180
 You're not alone.

70
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,920
 There are a lot of children like this across the state.

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,360
 There are a lot of children like this across the planet.

72
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
 So we will help you.

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
 What do you need?

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
 What do you need?

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,640
 We'll see what we can get you.

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:19,640
 Well in June 2013, Dorothy decided enough was enough.

77
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,320
 And that doesn't mean that she picked up the phone and called the Department of Children

78
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,680
 and Family Services and said, "Okay let's have this meeting.

79
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
 Let's do this."

80
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,480
 It doesn't mean that she called the police and says, "I need my son to be hospitalized

81
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,960
 for however long."

82
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,760
 I'm not able to take care of him anymore.

83
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,520
 We're not able to take care of him anymore.

84
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,840
 He can't take care of himself.

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,280
 This is just too much.

86
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,280
 She doesn't do that.

87
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,280
 Dorothy and Agatha poison Alex.

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,880
 They give him a massive dose of sleeping pills.

89
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,840
 But it doesn't work.

90
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,920
 It actually very rarely works.

91
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
 We see that in movies.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,040
 It's really hard to poison somebody.

93
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,840
 Unless it's a fast acting drug like penicillin.

94
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:12,880
 Unless it's a fast acting drug like cyanide or VX nerve agent like we covered on a previous

95
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
 episode.

96
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,160
 They rubbed VX nerve agent all over this dude's face.

97
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,960
 You try to overdose on a lot of things.

98
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,640
 You will vomit them up before they can kill you.

99
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
 Not everything though.

100
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,560
 Don't put that to a test.

101
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,360
 Use police outside.

102
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,080
 Oh, it's the Christmas parade.

103
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,680
 They do this in town.

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,680
 You hear that?

105
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:57,320
 Okay, it's going to be a couple of minutes.

106
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,440
 So I'm going to have to take a break here.

107
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
 I'll come back.

108
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,920
 Okay, I'm back.

109
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,600
 What was just the second to you was a day for me.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,960
 I ended up going to bed.

111
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,080
 So sorry if the sound changes a little bit.

112
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,240
 We were talking about this horrific crime and I'm like, "Oh, I'm going to go to sleep."

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,040
 I guess we haven't gotten to the crime part yet.

114
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,120
 Oh, yeah, we did.

115
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,560
 They poisoned this poor kid with sleeping pills and that didn't work.

116
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,880
 Alex survived that.

117
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
 So what happened next?

118
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
 It's so horrible.

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,800
 This is such a horrible thing.

120
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,640
 Not a time to take a nap.

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:41,840
 What happens is later, Alex's father and Alex's uncle come home and they find Dorothy and

122
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,200
 Agatha under the influence of sleeping pills.

123
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,520
 They've actually tried overdosing on sleeping pills themselves.

124
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,840
 Even though it didn't kill Alex, that's the way they chose to go out.

125
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:02,080
 Father and the uncle come home to two barely aware adults and Alex has been stabbed to

126
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,080
 death.

127
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,760
 He was stabbed multiple times in the chest and then his wrists were slid.

128
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,120
 He was murdered by his mother and his godmother, the people who needed to protect him.

129
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,880
 And this is where we get to this...

130
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,200
 I mean, it's a tragic true crime story.

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,600
 Undeniably tragic true crime story.

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,520
 The way I found out about this though, so fascinating, I was reading an article in Forbes

133
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,480
 written by Emily Willingham.

134
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,760
 She wrote this piece for Forbes and what she says is there are people out there, numerous

135
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:50,560
 people out there, who believe that when a parent or a guardian murders an autistic child,

136
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
 it's okay.

137
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,240
 Now, they're not rooting for it.

138
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:02,880
 They're not necessarily advocating it, but when it does happen, there are groups out

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,920
 there that give these parents a pass.

140
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,240
 Now, Emily's not one of them.

141
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,140
 Emily's article is against this.

142
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,240
 She highlights the case of Alex and she goes, "There are groups out there that say the

143
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,360
 system is so cumbersome, the medical establishment and law enforcement, they're just this mind

144
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:29,880
less bureaucracy and sometimes parents cannot deal with it."

145
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,280
 And so they kill their children.

146
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,680
 They kill their autistic children and there are groups that are like the poor mother who

147
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,120
 have been put in that situation in the first place.

148
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
 That's the tragedy.

149
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
 It's fascinating.

150
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,560
 I never thought about this before.

151
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,840
 And again, that's why it's important to know that there were social services trying to

152
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,720
 reach out to this family.

153
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,920
 And yet this was still the path that they took.

154
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,000
 This is a super interesting quote in this article here.

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,840
 I want to read this section of Emily's article because basically what she's saying is, "You

156
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,040
 do have these support groups that when an autistic child is murdered, they side with

157
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
 the parents."

158
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,360
 They side with the parents in these cases.

159
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,520
 And she says, "No other condition draws this kind of judgment or leads people to blame

160
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:31,640
 the condition, the murdered, and everyone except the murderer for killing her own child."

161
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:42,040
 If Alex had had Down syndrome, cancer, schizophrenia, ADHD, or a traumatic brain injury, no one would

162
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,680
 be giving his mother a pity pass for having brutally taken his life overwhelmed by his

163
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,760
 needs.

164
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,000
 Now, see, I thought nobody did this.

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I thought there was no condition where if you murdered your kid, you got a quote unquote

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,520
 pity pass.

167
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:09,000
 But Emily does a pretty good job laying out the argument that there are people who go,

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,920
 "Well, you know, the mother, she tried her best and when the best wasn't good enough,

169
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,400
 what else could she do but murder her child?"

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,960
 Apparently, part of this, not everyone who agrees with it's okay.

171
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,960
 And again, it's not that it's okay to murder an autistic child in their view, but when

172
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,280
 it does happen, they go, "Well, she was just so put upon this poor mother.

173
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,800
 What else could she do?

174
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,920
 She tried everything."

175
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,200
 Part of the people who argue that are the people who believe that vaccines cause autism.

176
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,480
 Not all of them, but some of them.

177
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,080
 So they blame that.

178
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,600
 See, they have that viewpoint.

179
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,240
 This child would have been perfectly fine had he not gotten vaccinated.

180
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,760
 Interesting, right?

181
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,440
 We're rolling back into that.

182
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,080
 We're rolling back into that conspiracy theory.

183
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:12,600
 And those people are like, "Well, what do you expect when you have this profit driven

184
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,920
 medical industry, this soulless corporate run healthcare?"

185
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,800
 They vaccinated him in the first place.

186
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,520
 He got autism and then the mother couldn't deal with him and the mother killed him.

187
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,640
 It's not her fault.

188
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
 It's fascinating.

189
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,120
 I actually thought there would be no cases where anyone would argue on behalf of the

190
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
 murderer.

191
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,880
 I mean, there are times, like you read the article about the elderly couple where the

192
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,280
 woman has cancer and the husband kills her and then kills himself.

193
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,840
 I mean, again, I'm not advocating that.

194
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,080
 We see those as tragic.

195
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,720
 It's always tragic.

196
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:55,800
 There is a CBS News report that called Dorothy a "desperate mother."

197
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,760
 So again, it's kind of reframing that.

198
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,080
 It's framing that passage.

199
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,040
 Now, Emily does say, "Listen, because I think some readers reached out to her and she said,

200
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:12,440
 'You do also see this for parents of children with advanced cerebral palsy, but would they

201
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,160
 get the pity pass?

202
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,840
 Would they get the desperate mother coinage by the CBS News?'"

203
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,680
 Now I read Emily's article, I found it super fascinating.

204
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,960
 Then I went back because this story is a couple of years old.

205
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,600
 I go, "Well, let's see.

206
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,520
 Let's see what the penalty was for Dorothy and Agatha."

207
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,280
 Remember, this is premeditated all the way.

208
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,480
 They tried to poison them with sleeping pills.

209
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,080
 When that didn't work, they stabbed them four times in the chest and then slit his wrists.

210
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,680
 Premeditated murder was dropped down to involuntary manslaughter.

211
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,280
 Both these adults got time served.

212
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
 That was it.

213
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,840
 Three years, they were in jail during the court process.

214
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,960
 They got involuntary manslaughter time served, both set free.

215
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,920
 It's a tragic story.

216
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
 It's a horrifying story.

217
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,040
 Do I think these two people are going to go out and murder again?

218
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
 No.

219
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,360
 Do I think they're a danger to the community?

220
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
 No.

221
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,800
 Well, maybe that's the second part.

222
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
 Who knows?

223
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:30,640
 The concern is that people see this now as an out.

224
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,960
 People who see this case may think, "Well, I can do that."

225
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:41,840
 And it goes from being a story of Dorothy and Agatha to a Casey Anphony type person who

226
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,200
 has a child who's mildly autistic and she has other reasons for wanting to get rid of

227
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,520
 her kid.

228
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
 I don't know.

229
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,080
 I mean, you can slippery slope anything.

230
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,080
 It's a tragic story and it's so interesting to find there are support groups out there.

231
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:10,280
 Again, it's not like there's not a support group is kill your kid incorporated, but when

232
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:19,920
 this happens, they back the parents and it's more about the condition and the murder victim

233
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,480
 and their behavior than the murderer and their behavior.

234
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,560
 It's absolutely fascinating.

235
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,400
 It's subculture within a subculture.

236
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,440
 And who knows where this will end?

237
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,400
 Who knows how far this will spread out?

238
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,480
 I remember there was that case.

239
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,960
 There was that famous true crime case.

240
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:44,520
 I'll put it in the show notes of a guy who killed his wife sleepwalking and he had been

241
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:51,400
 having trouble sleepwalking his entire life and he was acting out in his dreams.

242
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,720
 He accidentally killed his wife.

243
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,200
 He was sleepwalking.

244
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:04,080
 And there is the theory that you started after that became a known event, you started having

245
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,000
 more people claiming to kill people in their sleep.

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,720
 I mean, it's not a super common defense, but since then there have been other people who've

247
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,600
 been like, oh, I didn't mean to kill my wife.

248
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,480
 I was simply sleepwalking because you can look at that now and you just want to get rid

249
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
 of your wife.

250
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,640
 You might have a mild sleep disorder, but you just want to get rid of your wife.

251
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,320
 And what's interesting is that it worked the first time because there was like years of

252
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,520
 documented treatment, but the subsequent ones, it didn't.

253
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,960
 They were found guilty for murder.

254
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,560
 The one guy murdered his wife in his sleep and then washed his hands.

255
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,520
 And they got, I think he got rid of his bloody clothing.

256
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,720
 The cops were like, okay, you might have murdered your wife in your sleep.

257
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,920
 That's tragic.

258
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,640
 But the hiding the evidence part, you're probably awake for that.

259
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,960
 Corbin's channel, Corbin's channel, I have to be on that episode.

260
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,360
 That was super depressing.

261
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,680
 Corbin's channel, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter we are

262
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,120
 leaving behind Illinois.

263
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:12,000
 Fly us all the way out to a middle school.

264
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,240
 We're going to this middle school.

265
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,640
 We don't have an exact location.

266
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:22,440
 The story was posted online by someone who goes by the name Lazar Yeat Mehta.

267
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,520
 We're going to go ahead and call him Jim.

268
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,080
 Jimmy's in the seventh grade.

269
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:34,840
 He just transferred schools and things are not going well at all.

270
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,960
 Yo, Jimmy, that's a lame name.

271
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
 What?

272
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
 Oh man, I tried.

273
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
 That's the principle.

274
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,520
 That's what the principle yelled at him when he was starting his first day of school.

275
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
 Jimmy sucks.

276
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
 Jimmy sucks.

277
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:54,280
 Jimmy is walking around the school and he is instantly targeted as this is the guy to

278
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
 bully.

279
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:03,120
 I'm going to beat you up.

280
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,520
 I hope school never ends and the teacher is like extra school because that's what Jimmy

281
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
 wants.

282
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,080
 Now we're going to beat him up twice after school.

283
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,040
 The bullying had become not physical just yet but people were threatening to beat him

284
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,400
 up and he's like, I don't want to go to school anymore.

285
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,840
 Man, this totally sucks.

286
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,560
 I transferred schools and it's like a war zone.

287
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,400
 I have no idea where he went.

288
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,440
 I don't know if he went to the school from dangerous mines or the substitute or something

289
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
 like that.

290
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,520
 Well, one night Jimmy is deep asleep and he has a dream that he's in school.

291
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,120
 He's like, oh man, I cannot have been in the unicorn glen again.

292
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,960
 He has a dream that he's in school and he's sitting in his math class and he has a substitute

293
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,840
 for math and he's kind of sitting there.

294
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 This sucks.

295
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,760
 This is the worst dream he has dream homework now.

296
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
 He's like, oh man.

297
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,640
 Then he goes to PE and when he's in the PE class, the other students are cussing at him.

298
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,800
 Things are really getting out of hand and then eventually a student throws a punch because

299
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,800
 he's never been physically hit at this new school.

300
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,240
 In the dream he gets punched and then pummeled.

301
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,280
 Jimmy in the middle of PE gets beat up.

302
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,120
 So he's a little apprehensive about going to school the next day and he has to, right?

303
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
 That's part of life.

304
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
 You got to go to school.

305
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,080
 He goes to school and just get, he's happy that he just gets threatened.

306
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,160
 He doesn't get beat up.

307
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,760
 But then he goes to bed that night.

308
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,080
 He has a dream.

309
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,840
 He's at school.

310
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,000
 He's sitting in his math class and there's a substitute.

311
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,840
 Then he goes to PE.

312
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,120
 The other students are cussing him out and then whap.

313
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,640
 He gets punched and then beat up.

314
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,480
 He has this dream in total four times in a row.

315
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,800
 Four nights in a row he has this dream and on the fifth day he goes to school, walks

316
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,640
 into his math class and there's a substitute teacher there.

317
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,440
 Now he doesn't specifically say it's the exact same person he saw in his dream, but it was

318
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,940
 a substitute.

319
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,680
 His regular math teacher wasn't there.

320
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
 He goes into the math class.

321
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,320
 There's a substitute there.

322
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,840
 Next he goes to PE.

323
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,360
 People start cussing at him.

324
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,400
 He's like, "Uh oh, I know where this is going to go."

325
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,960
 Bap!

326
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,840
 He gets punched.

327
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,200
 Then he gets beat up.

328
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,520
 The first punch in a way he knew was coming, right?

329
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,680
 He'd been through this four times before.

330
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,920
 He gets punched.

331
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,400
 He begins to get beat up and at that point he realizes, like you could chalk it up to

332
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,040
 maybe just a coincidence that you had a substitute in math class.

333
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,520
 Him getting cussed to PE was nothing new, but now that he's getting beat up he's laying

334
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,000
 on the ground in the fetal position.

335
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,680
 He's going, "Hmm, this is quite familiar.

336
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,480
 Maybe I saw the future in my dreams."

337
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,160
 They're like, "Quit pontificating."

338
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
 They're punching him even harder.

339
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,800
 He's like, "Ah!"

340
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:27,240
 He said this happened in total during his time at middle school six or seven times.

341
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,360
 Not six or seven more dreams.

342
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:36,560
 Six or seven more times did he have the same dream over and over and over again.

343
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:44,440
 And then he would eventually go to school and the day at school would perfectly mimic

344
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,800
 his dream.

345
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:54,640
 He knew exactly what was coming and each time it was him getting beat up.

346
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,360
 The dream ended with him getting beat up and that day where he goes to school and every

347
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,160
 detail is exactly the same, he gets beat up and he says, "Here's the thing.

348
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,760
 I tried my best.

349
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,400
 I know that I had a clear idea that I was, for whatever reason."

350
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,680
 He says, "I don't know how this happened.

351
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,480
 I was able to predict the future.

352
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,000
 I was able to have a dream and then the day would start off.

353
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,120
 I'd have this dream multiple times in a row.

354
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,600
 And then the day would come that when I got to school, I knew this was the real life version

355
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,400
 of the dream."

356
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,600
 And so he'd get beat up and then some time would pass and then he would have a dream

357
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,440
 where he'd get beat up at school and then he'd have the dream the next night and he's

358
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
 like, "Oh no, this is going to happen again."

359
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:52,000
 And so he started to try to change events because he saw the future so clearly, he goes,

360
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,280
 "I don't want to get beat up.

361
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,840
 So how do I prevent that?

362
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,880
 Now I remember in the dream this happened, this happened, this happened.

363
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,920
 I will do something different."

364
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:13,320
 And no matter what he changed, he would still be forced into the position where he would

365
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,960
 get beat up.

366
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,280
 There was no way out.

367
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,400
 So he might be able to change key details.

368
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,120
 Let's say that he was having the dream, he didn't use this example, but let's say he's

369
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,160
 having the dream and in the dream he gets up to use the bathroom in the middle of social

370
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
 studies.

371
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,520
 And then he comes back to class and when he walks right through the door, the bully who's

372
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,080
 going to beat him up later starts yelling at him and that's what sparks everything.

373
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,840
 So after school as he's getting his backpack, the bully beats him up.

374
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,680
 Jimmy would go, "Well, I just won't go to the bathroom.

375
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,920
 I will sit in my social studies class.

376
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,480
 I'm going to hold it in.

377
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,400
 So I will prevent me from coming in through the door so the bully won't yell at me at

378
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
 the first place.

379
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,600
 I will be sitting here in the classroom."

380
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,480
 Now again, he doesn't give that specific example, but that's kind of what he's saying, but this

381
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
 is what would happen.

382
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,080
 He would be sitting in the classroom.

383
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,560
 He would say, "I'm not going to go to the bathroom."

384
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,520
 He's like, "I probably shouldn't have been in that Taco Bell before school."

385
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,760
 That's complicated, this whole thing.

386
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
 "I'm not going to go to the bathroom.

387
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,400
 I'm going to hold it in as much as I can."

388
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,400
 But for whatever reason, even if he didn't come in the door and draw the bully's attention

389
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,280
 to him and start yelling at him, he'd be sitting there in the classroom.

390
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,960
 He would try to have changed the events and the bully would find something else to yell

391
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
 at him about.

392
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,960
 Hey, who's pooping over there?

393
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
 Who's pooping?

394
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
 Who's pooping in that seat?

395
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,760
 It was me.

396
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,000
 He couldn't change the events.

397
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,800
 Of course, he kept pleading, "I don't want to go to school today.

398
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,240
 I don't want to go to school today because this is the day I'm probably going to get

399
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
 beat up.

400
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,120
 I've had this show you multiple times in a row."

401
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,400
 But that's not going to work either, right?

402
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,240
 Unless your parents are firm believer in the paranormal and/or you've helped them win several

403
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,680
 lottery drawings, go to school, Jimmy.

404
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
 Go to school.

405
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,280
 Oh, you and your fear of getting beaten up at school.

406
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
 You got to go there.

407
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,080
 I have one of the lottery money we can pay for your medical bills.

408
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,240
 Go to school.

409
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,080
 And he said this happened overall six to seven times throughout his middle school life and

410
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,400
 could never change it.

411
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,600
 He could never change it.

412
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,480
 He'd go to school to get beat up.

413
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,840
 The idea of premonition in dreams is a fascinating one.

414
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,960
 A lot of people make those connections.

415
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,640
 And if that was the end of the story, it's still a fascinating look at the idea of are

416
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:47,120
 our dreams more than just neurons firing and us making sense of the images.

417
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,760
 But in high school, Jimmy had a different dream, a more alarming dream.

418
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
 You get beat up at school.

419
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,880
 Listen, I got beat up and I beat people up.

420
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,160
 That's just the way of the world.

421
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,960
 That's just the way the school system works.

422
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,360
 America at least, during the 80s it did.

423
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,600
 I don't know about nowadays, but it was whatever.

424
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,640
 You come home with a black eye, your parents get mad, call the other parent, and that was

425
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
 it.

426
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,000
 No big deal.

427
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,960
 But this next dream is a bit of a big deal.

428
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,720
 Next year I mean definitely it's a little more than just wearing sunglasses the next

429
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
 day of school.

430
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,600
 Jimmy, who has had multiple dreams that have foretold the future now, he's in high school.

431
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:39,600
 He has this dream that he's in his favorite teacher's class.

432
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,080
 He's sitting there, everything's totally normal.

433
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:49,480
 Until a man wearing a ski mask walks into the class, pulls out a gun, and points it at

434
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,720
 the teacher.

435
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,800
 Jesse jumps up, and this is his favorite teacher, right?

436
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,000
 Had this been the witch-hop teacher he probably would have been a little slower, but this

437
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,720
 was his favorite teacher.

438
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,080
 Jimmy jumps up and knocks the gun out of the dude's hand.

439
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,600
 But this guy in the ski mask has a backup plan, like most maniacs do.

440
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,880
 He pulls out a knife and begins stabbing Jimmy to death.

441
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,640
 And as Jimmy gets stabbed multiple times and he falls to the ground and starts bleeding

442
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:27,440
 out as his vision becomes blurry, as his life is leading his body, he sees the man on the

443
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:36,840
 ski mask pick the gun back up and shoot the teacher multiple times.

444
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,360
 If I had that dream that would upset me.

445
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,200
 I think if most people had that dream it would be really upsetting.

446
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,840
 But our dreams don't normally tell the future.

447
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:57,080
 So to Jimmy that really set off alarm bells, he had the dream again and he smuggled a knife

448
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,640
 onto campus that day.

449
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,160
 Like he was preparing for it because of his past experiences with his dreams telling the

450
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
 future.

451
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:19,200
 He brought a knife to school, which is in most if not all school districts instant expulsion.

452
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
 He brought a knife to school.

453
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,000
 He was afraid that the dream was going to become real.

454
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,440
 Can you imagine going to school that day?

455
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,960
 I mean it was bad enough for him to go to school and get beat up, but to think that he may be

456
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,440
 murdered by some stranger.

457
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,720
 And then his favorite teacher gunned down.

458
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,760
 He brought a knife to school.

459
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:48,800
 And what's interesting is he said that it wasn't the last time he had the dream.

460
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,280
 He brought the knife to school the second time he had the dream.

461
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:58,160
 But he said in total he had the dream four times, which kind of fits the pattern.

462
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,080
 He had the dream four times.

463
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,840
 The fourth time he had that dream he said he was there in class.

464
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,200
 See I don't think the dream version knows about the, I don't think the, you know what

465
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
 I mean?

466
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,000
 Like I don't think when he's sitting there in the dream goes, oh this is just a dream.

467
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,200
 And I've had this dream a couple of times before.

468
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,480
 I know what's coming.

469
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,280
 Like each time dream Jimmy has the dream it's new to that Jimmy.

470
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,000
 But the white awake Jimmy who's sweating profusely when he wakes up, he realizes he's

471
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,920
 had this dream multiple times and he knows what that means.

472
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:42,800
 But anyways in this last dream, the fourth time he had this dream, he's in the classroom.

473
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,720
 The man in the ski mask bursts through the door, points the gun at his teacher.

474
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:54,680
 Jimmy jumps up, knocks the gun out of his hand and the man then pulls out a knife and stabs

475
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,880
 Jimmy.

476
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:04,040
 Plunges the knife right into his chest.

477
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:11,040
 The man then picks up the gun, points it at the teacher and shoots her.

478
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:21,560
 But this time Jimmy is somehow able to get to his feet, pull the knife out of his own

479
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:32,160
 chest and slit the man's throat.

480
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,040
 That dream never became a reality.

481
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:49,560
 And he never had a dream of the future after that.

482
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,960
 What a fascinating story.

483
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,360
 I found this online, of course it could totally be fake.

484
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,360
 It could have been a made up account.

485
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,280
 It didn't seem like it to me.

486
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,000
 Like I said, a lot of times I go through these people's past posting history to see if they

487
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,400
 are constantly talking about one of a kind paranormal events and that's like, "Oh, on

488
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,400
 Tuesday, then this happened."

489
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,760
 Obviously I've been fooled.

490
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,360
 We've talked about that on the podcast before.

491
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,200
 I've been fooled by stuff.

492
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,040
 But to me it's always interesting when they post something like this on a paranormal board

493
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,160
 and then everything else they're just talking about like video games or memes and things

494
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
 like that.

495
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,760
 And I think that's why they always add some sort of legitimacy to it.

496
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,320
 And I'm wondering, I mean there's so many ways we can look at this.

497
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:44,000
 I think kind of my takeaway from the whole thing is that this dream was going to happen.

498
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,040
 The teacher and him were going to get killed in real life.

499
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:56,120
 And I think it's interesting that the man was wearing a ski mask because it renders

500
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,120
 the viewer of the future more powerless.

501
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,720
 Like obviously if he had a dream and he saw a guy walk in and he could totally recognize

502
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,720
 his face and this was his favorite teacher, maybe he could trust the teacher and say,

503
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:21,840
 "Hey, do you know anybody who has like a black buzz cut and like a cartoonishly large mustache?"

504
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,440
 She goes, "Oh yeah, my ex.

505
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,440
 I used to date this guy.

506
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
 He's a total lunatic."

507
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,920
 "How'd you know what my ex looked like?"

508
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,080
 "Have you been stalking my Facebook, Jimmy?"

509
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,000
 If he could tell what the person looked like, it would be easier to at least kind of prepare

510
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,920
 for in the sense that if it was Ronald Schwarzenegger coming through, you're like, "Oh no, he's

511
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
 going to go commando style.

512
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,000
 He's going to bring in a bunch of machine guns."

513
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,560
 I think that if he could describe the person, it would be much more, you could convince

514
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,320
 people because then people go, "Yeah, we had an ex employee.

515
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
 He looked like that.

516
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,280
 Yeah, that was my ex-husband."

517
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,520
 So on and so forth.

518
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:14,240
 You could also figure that the man in the ski mask wasn't necessarily a person but an idea.

519
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,440
 In the sense that it wasn't that an idea was going to come in and shoot her.

520
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,880
 It was just going to be some sort of random act of violence.

521
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:28,200
 The person may have actually come in wearing a ski mask and it could have just been a maniac.

522
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,040
 It could have been nothing metaphorical about it.

523
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,160
 It could have just been a lunatic and a ski mask.

524
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,160
 And I'm wondering if the reason why the future was different, they were able to change it

525
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,680
 because the first time they could get everything down to the exact detail, they would remember

526
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,800
 standing in line to go into school and they knew who was going to be in line before them

527
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,000
 and after them.

528
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,240
 They had already seen it four or five times in a row at night and then when they're standing

529
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,920
 in line to go into class, they're like, "Great, I know how this is going to end because I

530
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,000
 know exactly how this line is made up."

531
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,200
 When you get it down to the exact detail, the dreams are that vivid and then this dream

532
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,680
 somehow they're able to change the ending in the dream.

533
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,800
 And that might have been the issue that Jimmy was having all along.

534
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,680
 He was constantly trying to change the reality to be different than the dream.

535
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:28,400
 The key was to change the dream to change reality.

536
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,200
 And you could look at it as him predicting the future.

537
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:38,600
 You could also look at it as him manifesting the reality where he is bullied and beat up.

538
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:45,440
 A big part of manifestation, a big part of law of attraction is the subconscious, is

539
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,640
 the moments before we fall asleep and the dreaming itself.

540
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:55,200
 If you want to look at it, you can't say there's really any proof for the law of attraction,

541
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,960
 but I always think it's so fascinating when you hear about Marshall Mathers sitting in

542
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,520
 his trailer and he has covers of the source magazine all around his walls and his ceilings

543
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,200
 and every night before he went to bed, young Marshall Mathers would sit there and think

544
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,000
 about hip-hop stardom.

545
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,800
 A while back I got in touch with this true crime podcaster who hit the big time.

546
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:25,760
 He's making a lot of money in the true crime field and I asked him.

547
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,280
 I practiced the law of attraction myself and one of the things about the law of attraction

548
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,680
 is to not dwell on dark things.

549
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
 That's a big part of it.

550
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,920
 And I go, "But yet I'm a true crime podcaster myself and I talk about paranormal ghosts

551
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
 and everything like that."

552
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
 I go, "How do you balance the two?"

553
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,760
 First off, I go, "Do you believe in law of attraction?"

554
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,520
 I go, "How do you balance the two?"

555
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,120
 He was super interesting when he said, he goes, "I do believe in the law of attraction."

556
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,920
 He goes, "What I would do honestly is I would lay in bed and every night before I go to

557
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,200
 sleep all I would think about."

558
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,160
 And he goes, "I was living in a basement.

559
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
 I was living in a basement.

560
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,640
 I was sitting on the ground basically in a gunny sack.

561
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,280
 He's far worse off than I am and I'm not that bad off.

562
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,080
 I have a great place."

563
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,640
 But he goes, "You know, I would lay there on the hard ground and as the cockroaches

564
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,440
 scrambled all over me."

565
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,400
 He goes, "I would sit and imagine what life would be like if I was a professional podcaster.

566
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,360
 First thing I would buy would be a bed."

567
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,760
 So that time is super important.

568
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,880
 That time before sleep leads into what we dream of.

569
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,640
 You may not think so, but your subconscious is constantly firing off in the background.

570
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,680
 Even though your dream may be about you swimming in a can of spaghetti-os with Christina Ricci,

571
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,680
 your subconscious is constantly-

572
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
 What do you mean?

573
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
 Maybe that is your subconscious.

574
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,200
 Maybe you're like, "How did he know my fetish?"

575
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,400
 No!

576
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,920
 Your subconscious is constantly going in the background and I'm wondering if that he may

577
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,760
 have been manifesting the bullying.

578
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,480
 And he may have been very close to manifesting his own murder and the murder of his favorite

579
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,400
 teacher.

580
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
 But he was able to stop that at the last minute, right?

581
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,600
 The dreams normally went.

582
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,320
 For a couple of days, this was on the fourth night he was able to stop it.

583
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,920
 It's a fascinating story and it asks a lot more questions than it answers.

584
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,640
 What are dreams?

585
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
 Can they tell the future?

586
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,560
 Like that's a whole paranormal belief in and of itself.

587
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,160
 Are dreams symbolic or do they mean more than that?

588
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,800
 Is there actually a structure behind the dreams?

589
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,880
 Are there warnings?

590
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,840
 Can you use dreams to achieve your dreams in the real world?

591
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,280
 And if that's true, can nightmares also become reality?

592
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:56,920
 It's all fascinating questions, but to Jimmy, it's a little more than just a theory.

593
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:05,720
 He knows for a fact that sometimes dreams do come true.

594
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:14,320
 He was so certain of that fact that when he began dreaming of his own murder, he knew

595
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:23,040
 he had to change the future or he wouldn't have one.

596
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,040
 It's almost like all of those beatings paid off.

597
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,480
 Had he not had any dreams that told the future before, would he have paid attention to this

598
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,680
 one?

599
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:46,040
 All of those nightmares that turned his days into dread actually ended up saving Jimmy's

600
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,920
 life.
