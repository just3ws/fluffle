1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 Is there a word I can say on this podcast that will get it deleted forever?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,700
 And then we take a look at a particularly odd and current conspiracy.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,000
 Is it possible that the video game Apex Legends is enchanted or cursed?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,100
 And if that is true, what does that say about all other successful media in the world today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,100
 I don't know, I'm a walkie-talkie. Actually, I'm a walkie-talkie.

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:39,100
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,100
 I'm having a great day. I hope you are having a great day too. Season 5, ladies and gentlemen.

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,100
 Yes, and if you listen to the preview, if you listened to my previously on Dead Rabbit episode,

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,100
 yes, the Carpenter copter and the Jason Jalopy have been destroyed.

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,100
 Temporarily, we will be fixing them, but we just need to find some parts.

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,100
 So, in the meantime, we're stuck with the Dead Rabbit Terrible, and it just reminds me of that terrible joke I told,

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,100
 and then the rabbit robot will get us around, and we'll do a lot of hiking, I think.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,100
 But we needed to shake things up. The system didn't want us to be telling the truth.

14
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,100
 And, you know, that's funny. That's actually a perfect segue for our first story.

15
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,100
 Now, our first story, we're going to take a little trip down a rabbit hole, no pun intended.

16
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,100
 And it's funny because when I first read it, really, I had the same opinion the last time I read it.

17
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,100
 I read the story over and over and over again, and looked into it a bit more,

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,100
 and I haven't really budged on how I feel about it.

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,100
 But we're going to go ahead and discuss it, and I will just go from there.

20
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,100
 Okay, let's get into it. Now, this story, and I know I always say this, this story's from the conspiracy iceberg,

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,100
 and it is one of the most requested stories that I've gotten, and I always say that.

22
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:02,100
 But it's always true. That's why I say that. This one, this one, okay, these are all the people who requested this story.

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,100
 And if I didn't add your name in here, I'm sorry because there's multiple spellings of this.

24
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,100
 People are like, "Just get to the word, Jason. Say the word."

25
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,100
 So your podcast, well, shut off. These are the people who requested it.

26
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,100
 We have Dave. Most of these guys are on YouTube. Dave Humbug, actually, that was an email.

27
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,100
 This is off to a great start.

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:30,100
 Fev-ki? Astoria, Morty Weirdland, Doomlord, Gabriel, depressive suicidal black metal, Marceline,

29
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:36,100
 and oddly enough, through Gmail, Bob Ross and Louise.

30
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,100
 Louise? And neither of them mentioned the word in their email.

31
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,100
 But when I did the search for the black-ass-adid, go make sure I added everybody for this.

32
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:55,100
 They showed up as well. So is that possibly a red flag? Is that a little bit of truth in the story of Erratus?

33
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,100
 Erratus? Errat-erratus. E-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er

34
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:05,100
 Erratus? Erratus. Erratus. So now I'm realizing I can't say the word. I have to say all of the rest of the episode.

35
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,100
 Erratus are basically the definition of it's like a correction. It's like an error correction.

36
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:20,100
 Erratus, they would have pages. If you had an issue in a book where it was wrong, instead of republishing the whole book,

37
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,100
 they'd put pages in the back called Erratus which would correct information. They didn't really do that nowadays,

38
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,100
 but that was an old-timey thing they did. And generally it means the correction of an error.

39
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,100
 It's a very common word, but there's different spellings of it in this conspiracy theory.

40
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:41,100
 So let's go ahead now with that totally long wind-up. Let's go ahead and get into what actually is the Erratus conspiracy.

41
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,100
 Again, I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right. Welcome back to Dead Ravver Radio, baby. Erratus.

42
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:55,100
 So on November 21st, 2015, we're hopping into just the rabbit warp. We're going just, we're swimming through the internet.

43
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:01,100
 Or would you be crawling on the webs? No, we're surfing through the internet, dude. Totally too hilarious.

44
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,100
 That term has totally gone out of vogue, but I still love it. Let's surf the web. I wonder who came up with that.

45
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,100
 No one's ever like, "Let's crawl through the web. Let's get stuck in the net."

46
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,100
 Surf the web. I wonder if somebody came up with that. That's not an organic phrase. Some marketing executive.

47
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,100
 In 1992, got paid a million dollars to come up with surf the web.

48
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:30,100
 Anyways, we're surfing the web. It's 2015. The date is November 21st. And a video goes up on YouTube by...

49
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,100
 So, and actually before I will get into the details, let me actually explain what the conspiracy theory is.

50
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:46,100
 The conspiracy theory is this. It's grown to become this. If you use the word "Erratus" in any form online, it'll be taken off the web.

51
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:55,100
 All mention of it is gone. If you post it on 4chan, the thread will be deleted. If you keep posting it on 4chan, you may be banned.

52
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:02,100
 And oddly enough, sometimes you're banned for copyright violation. If you post articles about Erratus, if you make videos about Erratus,

53
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:10,100
 if you do a podcast about Erratus, it triggers an algorithm that is in the system, in the internet, surfing the web,

54
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,100
 and it shuts down your channel, or shuts down your website, or bans you from a particular forum.

55
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:23,100
 So that's really what the conspiracy is. I should have gotten into that five minutes ago, but that's what the conspiracy is.

56
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,100
 That's why so many people are interested in this. That might be true. That might be true.

57
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,100
 But I don't think it's true in the sense that the conspiracy theory says it is. But let's go ahead and get into this.

58
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:45,100
 The way that Erratus was discovered was on November 21st, 2015, there is a music video or an EP released on YouTube by a band called the KFC Murder Chicks,

59
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:51,100
 which is a band made up of homeless girls. Their music's okay. I had to listen to some of it. They're okay.

60
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:58,100
 It was uploaded by a guy named Todd Ellsworth. Remember that name, but I'll repeat it later. She didn't really have to remember it.

61
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:06,100
 And in this description for the video, it says, "A really good coma records release that seems to have disappeared from the internet.

62
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:13,100
 Remember to support the artist Erratus or busts." Like bust, you know, like Erratus or bust.

63
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,100
 Like, I do this, or do this other thing. Here, my mouth is super dry. I need to take a drink.

64
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:26,100
 So that was really the first mention of Erratus that is recognized in this conspiracy outside of the definition of what an Erratus is.

65
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:35,100
 But nobody noticed it when it went up on November 21st, 2015. No, it was just a video among a slew of videos that are released every hour on YouTube.

66
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:45,100
 On November 25th, 2015, there was a thread on the export of 4chan about what are some spooky stories that happen to you at work.

67
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:52,100
 And one guy says, "Well, this didn't happen to me, but it happened to this girl that I knew. She was working at a company.

68
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,100
 She was working for a temp agency, and it was a really weird workplace."

69
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:03,100
 He said, "The company's going out of business, and they're having everyone move stuff around to get ready to go out of business.

70
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,100
 And every day people would show up and get fired and be replaced by temp workers."

71
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,100
 And he was saying, "This girl he knew was a temporary worker at this unnamed company."

72
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,100
 And at one point she was sent down into the basement to work with this dude packing boxes.

73
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,100
 And they were both giving a tape gun, and they had to use a tape gun on the appropriate boxes.

74
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:26,100
 And the girl's tape gun said, "Erratus on it."

75
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,100
 And she goes, "What does this mean?" And the dude she was with said, "Here, give me that."

76
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,100
 And he threw it away and says, "Don't tell anyone that you had that. Don't tell anyone that you saw that. Don't repeat that word."

77
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:43,100
 And she's like, "Why?" And he goes, "Because I wrote a program that creeps through the company internet that anyone who uses that word gets fired."

78
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
 He goes, "I don't know why they wanted that program, but I created it."

79
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,100
 So that was a weird story that happened at work.

80
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,100
 Now, is any of that true? We don't know.

81
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,100
 About a month later, December 19th, there was another thread on 4chan,

82
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,100
 where someone was asking about the Erratus program because they were curious because they had this story.

83
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,100
 It got a lot of attention on that thread. It's such a bizarre story. What does this word mean?

84
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:13,100
 And again, at this point, nobody's seen the Kentucky Fried Chicken Murder Chicks.

85
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,100
 No one's seen that video, or it's been small. Small audience. No one's made the connection yet.

86
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,100
 But people are now talking about what is this possible thing called Erratus that gets people fired from companies?

87
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:29,100
 And someone responds, "I've heard of that program as well. They name three companies. They name UPS, Unilever, and EcoLab.

88
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,100
 And they elaborated and said what it is, it was developed by a third party

89
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,100
 that if someone has this program that utilizes the Erratus algorithm,

90
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,100
 they have unlimited access to any private database.

91
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,100
 So if you have, let's say, your UPS and you have all your employee files,

92
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,100
 Erratus is a third-party program that will allow someone else to go in and have access to those files

93
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,100
 as if they were a human resource director at UPS.

94
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,100
 Which would most likely make it to be some sort of governmental thing.

95
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,100
 And so by discussing it or exposing it would basically get all mentioned of it wiped from the web.

96
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,100
 Now I think right now you're starting to see a bit of an issue with this story.

97
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:19,100
 And really, most of the, I would say the majority of this research was done actually by an author named Arcebio.

98
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,100
 And I'm gonna have the links below. He did two long write-ups on this on a website called Steemit.

99
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,100
 And it's basically the majority of the information that people have about the Erratus system,

100
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,100
 the Erratus mystery or conspiracy or whatever you want to call it.

101
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,100
 I don't know why my voice did that, but so thank you Arcebio.

102
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,100
 He's definitely done all of the groundwork for this, definitely.

103
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,100
 Has all the links, all the 4chan stuff and things like that.

104
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,100
 But again, I think at this point you're starting to think, wait a second, wait a second,

105
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,100
 something doesn't add up and let's just keep going here.

106
00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:00,100
 So at this point people start to make these connections between Erratus and the Kentucky Fried Murder Chicken,

107
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
 Kentucky Fried Chicken Murder Chicks.

108
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,100
 So at this point people have found, because they're looking for Erratus or any mention of Erratus,

109
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,100
 they have found the Kentucky Fried Chicken Murder Girls YouTube video.

110
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,100
 And that's when they find out that the Kentucky Fried Murder Chicken, KFC, whatever, the KFC Murder Girls,

111
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,100
 were a band made up of homeless girls and in the original 4chan post where they were talking about Erratus,

112
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,100
 the girl that who worked at the company, I left this as a little mystery part, so I'll reveal it now,

113
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,100
 the girl who worked at the company was previously homeless and played in a band.

114
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,100
 So people were now seeing a direct connection between the 4chan post and the video uploaded by Todd Ellsworth,

115
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
 featuring the KFC Murder Girls.

116
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
 So, mysteries afoot.

117
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,100
 What is Erratus? We have all this stuff going on, we have this YouTube video, we have this supposed algorithm

118
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,100
 that walks the internet looking for mentions of it and the very least firing people who work at a company

119
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
 if they mention it at that company.

120
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,100
 Then another lead started, and again there's just a bunch of weird stuff in this,

121
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,100
 but I think there's one kind of clear line going throughout it.

122
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:14,100
 The other main discovery in this was that there is a form of music called deep internet music

123
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:20,100
 where they try to find super, super rare samples from totally undiscovered videos and turn it into music.

124
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,100
 This is something they also do on the 4chan music board.

125
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,100
 There's a thing called petite tube, which is actually pretty cool, you go to it and it finds you YouTube videos

126
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,100
 that have under 10 plays or 0 plays or 1 play or something like that.

127
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,100
 I've done it a couple of times, it will take you to a totally random thing.

128
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,100
 They were using that to create their music, at one point someone used that and they found a video by a guy named Kronos4Life

129
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:50,100
 and he posted his mom made Jurassic Park videos, just still pictures with really hard to read writing on it.

130
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,100
 Then I guess the mom passed away so Kronos4Life started a new YouTube channel to re-upload all of his mom's stuff

131
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,100
 and the video started getting really weird because he would talk about how awesome Jurassic Park was

132
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,100
 but then he would talk about how YouTube's ruining his life and he's being hunted.

133
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,100
 It's really, really hard to read what is on the screen, so it's really hard to make sense of it.

134
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,100
 There's really kind of distorted pop songs or rap songs in the background that I don't know if it's like that

135
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,100
 because he doesn't know how to do it or if it's like that stylistically or if it's to beat the copyright protection

136
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
 but they're just very, very odd videos.

137
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
 But he's discovered because of this petite tube thing.

138
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:31,100
 Now at that point people are like, "What is this weird stuff? Like it's just this weird odd YouTube channel."

139
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
 And they were trying to understand what was going on in the video.

140
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,100
 They turned on the auto-captions for one of his YouTube videos.

141
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,100
 In the auto-captioning, so not on the captioning that he set up in the auto-captioning for one of the videos,

142
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,100
 it showed the auto-captioning is created by YouTube.

143
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,100
 A little like is trying to decipher what's going on and say what this is.

144
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,100
 It showed the address for the record label for KFC murder chicks.

145
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,100
 So we have a guy who releases a YouTube video, say in a Raddiser bust.

146
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,100
 A couple days later we have the first mention of Raddiser bust.

147
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,100
 About a month later we have a reference to more, another reference to Raddiser bust.

148
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,100
 After that pretty much any time you mention Raddiser bust supposedly you got banned from 4chan

149
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
 so you don't see it pop up as much now.

150
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,100
 And in between all that time and a couple months afterwards,

151
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,100
 Chronos for a Life was releasing these videos where he was mentioning Raddiser bust

152
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:32,100
 and his video had that subtitle for the KFC murder chicks record label

153
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,100
 even though the AI was just figuring out garbage.

154
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,100
 Like he didn't say it, it was an auto-caption that he said it was this weird musical track

155
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,100
 and it picked up the information and had that there.

156
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:51,100
 And at one point to top this all off, at one point Chronos for a Life said his favorite

157
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,100
 Jurassic Park movie was the second one and at that point the people who were really

158
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:04,100
 digging into the erratus mystery at the time realized that Todd Ellsworth is an anagram

159
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:10,100
 for the Lost World. Yes, that was the title of Jurassic Park 2.

160
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:17,100
 This mystery is convoluted as it seems, has spanned at this point now maybe 3-4 years.

161
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,100
 It pops up from time to time, you'll hear mentions of it.

162
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,100
 I read the list of everyone who was recommending it.

163
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,100
 Here's the thing, there is a clear flaw in the conspiracy.

164
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:33,100
 And I realized it when I first read about it and then I did some more digging and I went back, read it again, went back.

165
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,100
 And here's the thing, the fact that the website that tells me all this information is up

166
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:47,100
 shows that there is no algorithm that shuts down websites or YouTube channels or podcasts and things like that.

167
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,100
 I have been YouTube channels that have reported on erratus and then mysteriously stopped being uploaded.

168
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:59,100
 Now that's very very easy to fake and people stop uploading anyways.

169
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,100
 But if it goes after every mention of itself, then how do I know about it?

170
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,100
 How was I able to read all that information and go into the 4chan archives and look at all those links and everything like that?

171
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,100
 If erratus is anything, if it's anything at all, now again I think there's basically two versions of this myth.

172
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:23,100
 All the information I read you doesn't ever really say that if you mention it you get deleted from YouTube and things like that.

173
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
 That's almost all been added afterwards.

174
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,100
 If you look at the original mention of erratus, it's located in this single company.

175
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,100
 And then the secondary mention is it's spread across a couple different companies.

176
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
 But that's it.

177
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:41,100
 The legend has grown to say if you even mention it you'll get banned from 4chan and it's this algorithm and you can't fight it.

178
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,100
 And just by saying it can get your entire channel shut down yet there's multiple multiple resources about it.

179
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,100
 However, this is, we'll just put on our conspiracy cap here.

180
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:59,100
 I don't think it's a rogue AI or even a purposefully built AI crawling the web, surfing the web, looking for mentions of itself and deleting it.

181
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:10,100
 I think what if it is anything, if it is anything, I think it is an incredibly advanced troll group all built out of the Steemit article.

182
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,100
 I think the pieces were, this would be my conspiracy theory.

183
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
 Not saying it's true, this would be my conspiracy theory.

184
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,100
 A couple dudes got together and said let's create basically an ARG that's a trap.

185
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,100
 Where we're going to put this YouTube video up.

186
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:32,100
 We're going to write a couple days later about it on 4chan to get the people looking for the YouTube video.

187
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:39,100
 I think it's a little suspicious that of all the videos you can find on PetitTube 4chan happens to find one that is kind of linked to a rap.

188
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,100
 Within that same general time period, that's very suspicious.

189
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,100
 Anyone could just say, hey look it, I found this weird video on PetitTube.

190
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,100
 Or know where that video would be at or fake that or whatever.

191
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,100
 So I think if it's anything, again if it's anything, it would be engineered.

192
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,100
 So you have a group of trolls and they say let's do, let's have some fun.

193
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,100
 Let's start basically an ARG that's harmful.

194
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,100
 So we're going to set all this stuff up and then you're a mod, you're a mod for the export, right?

195
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
 And he's like, yeah I'm a mod.

196
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,100
 Whenever someone posts a ratus, ban them.

197
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,100
 And that'll help spread the legend.

198
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:23,100
 And then they get someone else to say hey tell you what, you set up a YouTube channel, do a couple videos, talk about a ratus and then stop doing the YouTube channel.

199
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:30,100
 And then we'll have one person write this article on Steam it that basically details the whole myth we've created this myth.

200
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:42,100
 And to make it extra fun for the trolls, they can then whenever someone does mention in real life, electronically harass them, shut down their podcast, shut down their YouTube channel to help spread that myth.

201
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:54,100
 It's basically an ARG only they can play and when you mention the word a ratus or put it in a title or anything like that, you have actually made yourself a target of this organization.

202
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,100
 If it's anything, that's what I think it is.

203
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,100
 I don't think it's some super advanced AI, I don't think it's some sort of creepy conspiracy.

204
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
 I think really all the detail information is made up.

205
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,100
 There is a real band called the Kentucky Fried, the KFC Murder Chicks, they exist.

206
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,100
 Gronis for Life really has videos but I think they're probably all in on it.

207
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
 Maybe not the KFC Murder Chicks but I don't know.

208
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
 They're all in on it, it's all a fun game to them.

209
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:28,100
 And basically it's TAG where they are all it and if you mention or use that word, you are the person they're coming after.

210
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
 I think that's it.

211
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,100
 If it exists at all, which I'm pretty likely it doesn't.

212
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,100
 But I think it's still an interesting conspiracy.

213
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:43,100
 It's funny because as I, again, as I was researching it the whole time I'm thinking, I again put myself in the mindset like maybe this is true.

214
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,100
 But the fact that I kept was able to keep going back to an article referencing it, I go, it's obviously not true.

215
00:18:48,100 --> 00:19:04,100
 Like if the idea is that everything is scrubbed from the internet and people are unpersoned and they disappear, but I can keep going to this article that was written two years ago, then obviously the 4chan archives are up, all this stuff, if all this information is available, that part of the myth isn't true.

216
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:14,100
 What may be true is everyone else who mentioned it who's outside of that group, they could be long gone from the internet, completely scrubbed.

217
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
 We wouldn't know it.

218
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,100
 You might wonder, hey, wonder what happened on my favorite YouTuber?

219
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
 I wonder what happened to that weird guy who had that podcast.

220
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,100
 I wonder what happened to that girl at work posting on 4chan on her breaks.

221
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,100
 She probably got arrested by the police, but you know what I mean?

222
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:39,100
 Like if you're not a player in the game, you're a target and you wouldn't know they were targets because they would simply make the reference and then they would be deleted from the internet.

223
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,100
 Like the lawnmower man being like, no, digitized out.

224
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,100
 But no, like your website would get shut down, you'd get banned from your form, things like that.

225
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,100
 It's one of three things, really.

226
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,100
 It's not true at all, which is the most likely thing.

227
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:02,100
 It's true, but the algorithm is so poorly designed that an article can stay for two years directing you how to find more information about it.

228
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:15,100
 Or it's real, but the algorithm isn't and it's a group of people who either still are, or at least at some time were shutting down anyone who mentioned this word just for a troll.

229
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:23,100
 We will find out if this show gets deleted, but the fact that I'm reporting on it pretty much shows that I'm the camp that I'm in.

230
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,100
 I don't think that it's real.

231
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
 Still a fascinating story, though.

232
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:35,100
 A modern day myth. I think we'll see more of these things, stories that grow out of technology, like more myths and hauntings that grow out of technology.

233
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:43,100
 Now, I loathe going over my time limit, and right now, honestly, I- that erratus mystery went quite long.

234
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,100
 So, I think I want to save the other story for tomorrow.

235
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,100
 I want to keep the shows tight. I want to keep them lean.

236
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,100
 So, how's that? Ooh, a two-parter for- yeah, yeah, we'll just do a two-parter for season five.

237
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,100
 The first episode of season five. A two-parter, it's mystery.

238
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,100
 Now, I will give you a hint. I will give you a hint. We'll end it like this.

239
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,100
 We're doing things- we're going to do things a bit differently this season.

240
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,100
 We're sticking with- there's two core components to the show.

241
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
 Paranormal conspiracy and true crime? Daily show.

242
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,100
 I don't ever want to change those things. I think that will ruin the vibe of the show.

243
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:26,100
 But there's been something that I've always wanted to do, and I would always kind of not do it.

244
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,100
 So, there are conspiracy theories or weird things that I personally believe in,

245
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:37,100
 but I've always wanted to do stories that had links so you could go and research more on your own.

246
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,100
 And there's been some things that I've come up with, and I was like, "Oh, but I can't find any proof or links," and stuff like that.

247
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,100
 What I've realized after 200 episodes is most of you guys don't actually click on the show notes.

248
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,100
 A lot of people will comment, "Hey, did you know this?" and I was like, "Yeah, this is for show note."

249
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:59,100
 So, I think I'm going to try it this season. I think we're going to talk about some of not necessarily conspiracies I believe in,

250
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,100
 but conspiracies that I've thought of.

251
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,100
 Not like made up, like I'm some science fiction writer, but things that I've thought are possible.

252
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,100
 Again, not saying that they're true, but things that are possible.

253
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,100
 Well, it might not work. It might make the show more crazy.

254
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,100
 It might make the show a little more like, "This guy's a lunatic" type of thing.

255
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:33,100
 But what I wanted to talk about, and I'll give you the hint for tomorrow's episode, is we know houses, if you believe in this stuff, if you believe in this stuff,

256
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:47,100
 houses can be haunted, objects can be cursed, but can the same thing be done for music, visual images, video games, and websites?

257
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:55,100
 Is it possible? And now that's not a conspiracy theory that I can't find any resources on, but I personally believe.

258
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:09,100
 I believe that a website is in the modern day just as stable as a location or a place, as a house, or a thicket in the middle of the woods, or a well where a little girl gets drowned.

259
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:17,100
 I think that you could have a website that has the same energy as a sacred place.

260
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:24,100
 It's simply not in our physical realm, but it still has that space in our consciousness.

261
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,100
 People go to Facebook more often than they go to the mall.

262
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,100
 And if a mall can be haunted, which actually would be a pretty dope place, you have a different ghost in each store.

263
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,100
 Some guy is like the pretzel court, he's like, "He choked."

264
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,100
 Then you have a guy who had a hunting accident in one of those malls where they sell guns, one of those cool malls.

265
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:49,100
 You have a flat guy who got caught in the escalator, but haunted mall, aside my script, trademark,

266
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:57,100
 if a mall can be haunted or a house can be haunted, and you visit Instagram more often than you visit your mom's house,

267
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,100
 your consciousness will read that website as an actual place.

268
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,100
 And can a website be haunted?

269
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
 Can a website be enchanted?

270
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,100
 And more importantly, well no, not more importantly, but the same thing.

271
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,100
 We talk about these symbols in music and movies, and it's like, "Oh, it's so the Illuminati can do this."

272
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,100
 And they're trying to like, predict a programming and prepare us for the reptile invasion, blah blah blah blah.

273
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,100
 What if it's magical spells?

274
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,100
 Like the reason why movies are hit movies.

275
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
 "Oh, I'm just doing the segment, I'll just keep going."

276
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,100
 Maybe the reason why the movies are like successful movies.

277
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,100
 Like movies beyond just being successful.

278
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
 What if they're enchanted?

279
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,100
 And funny, even more funny than that.

280
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,100
 What if like movies that flop that are supposed to do really really good,

281
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,100
 like John Carter, where they dump millions of dollars into it, or King Arthur, or whatever it is,

282
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:58,100
 that someone else put a curse on that movie so one peep, and I'm not saying that you go see it and like your jaw falls off,

283
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:04,100
 and you melt as an audience member, I'm saying that the movie is just plagued, and not like the set or anything,

284
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,100
 the film itself, like the images itself, can't, see this is why I usually don't talk about this stuff,

285
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,100
 because it really just sounds like super crazy, and I can't blame it on anyone else, I can't be like,

286
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,100
 "I don't believe it, here's some links."

287
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,100
 Like can a film, the images itself, be enchanted or cursed?

288
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:29,100
 And the reason why I'm bringing this up is because I'm pretty sure that Apex Legends is enchanted.

289
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
 Not just an enchanting romp.

290
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
 Oh, and I guess I should say this too.

291
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:39,100
 Dead Rabbit Radio is my origin name, so if y'all want to play, I usually play on Friday nights,

292
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,100
 if you want to play some Apex Legends with me, Dead Rabbit Radio, all one word, but here's the weird thing.

293
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,100
 I've watched, I've watched, I've watched some of my entire life watching Star Trek,

294
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,100
 reading Spider-Man comic books, all sorts of stuff.

295
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,100
 I've never had a dream where I've met Spider-Man, ever.

296
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:01,100
 I've maybe had in 42 years, watching hundreds, probably close to thousands of hours of Star Trek,

297
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,100
 and reading Star Trek novels and things like that, playing Star Trek video games.

298
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,100
 I've had maybe two or three dreams about Star Trek, and I remember I always was like a little depressed.

299
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,100
 I was like, "Oh man, I wish I dreamt about Star Trek more. I wish I could dream about Star Trek more."

300
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:20,100
 I've been playing Apex Legends for maybe three weeks, and I dream about Apex Legends every single night.

301
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,100
 Sometimes I'm in King's Canyon, running around with a gun, blowing people up.

302
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,100
 Sometimes I'm having a normal Jason dream, and I'll pick up a newspaper in the dream,

303
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,100
 and it'll be an article about Apex Legends.

304
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,100
 Or there'll be a billboard for Apex Legends in my dream.

305
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,100
 I'll see a news report about a new character that's being unlocked this weekend.

306
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
 Super creepy.

307
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,100
 And I saw my friend there, and he goes, "Well, you know, it might be different,

308
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,100
 because it's like a competitive-based game."

309
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,100
 I said, "Listen, man, according to Steam, I've put in 700 hours of Team Fortress 2.

310
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,100
 I've probably put in at least that in Battlefield 2.

311
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,100
 I almost went pro with that game, semi-pro, but I mean like,

312
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,100
 I steadied Battlefield 2.

313
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,100
 I've put in hundreds of hours with Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, Resident Evil 4.

314
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,100
 Never dreamt about those. Never dreamt I was hanging out with CJ, getting high.

315
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
 Two, three weeks of...

316
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
 And really not that much either.

317
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,100
 I would probably, during my break, I played about two, three hours a night.

318
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
 Two, three hours a day when I was taking break off.

319
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,100
 Before that, the first two weeks, though, when I started having the dreams,

320
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
 I'd play for maybe two, three hours on a Friday night,

321
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,100
 and then the next week I would play for another Friday night.

322
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
 And at that point, the dreams had already started,

323
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,100
 and when I'm playing the game, I have flashbacks.

324
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,100
 I'll be in an area where I died previously,

325
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,100
 and I'll be like, thinking, "Don't go to that roof. Something bad happened to you up there."

326
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
 It's super bizarre.

327
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,100
 I've never encountered anything like this in a video game before,

328
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
 and I used to be a hardcore gamer.

329
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,100
 Like I said, hours... I'd play video games six, seven hours a day.

330
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,100
 I'd get off work and play video games until like 3 or 4 in the morning.

331
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,100
 Never had this type of experience with it.

332
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,100
 The people who'd made Apex Legends, they released...

333
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,100
 They did Call of Duty, like Modern Warfare 3 or something like that.

334
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
 They ended up getting laid off from that company.

335
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
 They started their own company.

336
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
 First game came out, did okay.

337
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,100
 Second game came out, huge bomb.

338
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,100
 This was basically their final swing at bat.

339
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,100
 They had a mediocre game that millions of dollars was pumped into.

340
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,100
 They had a sequel that millions of dollars was pumped into, and it bombed.

341
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,100
 They were getting ready to get back on the chopping block,

342
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
 because they didn't have any huge hits.

343
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:34,100
 And then they released Apex Legends, which ended up having, I think, within the first week, 50 million players.

344
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,100
 First day, I think, it was within the first 24 hours,

345
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,100
 14 million people downloaded that game and were playing.

346
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
 Super successful game.

347
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,100
 People talk a lot about things like deals with the devil.

348
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,100
 And I think a lot of times it's used metaphorically.

349
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:56,100
 But to create a perfect game with absolutely no marketing or build-up,

350
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,100
 it just was released with some streamers streaming it the first day.

351
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,100
 It was simply released, it wasn't announced, there was no these big meetings.

352
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,100
 It was simply released and becomes the second biggest game out right now.

353
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
 Huge game.

354
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:18,100
 By a company that really was, had too mediocre success and a failure on its belt.

355
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:24,100
 To create a perfect game and a genre they never ever worked on before.

356
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,100
 Respawn never did a Battle Royale game before.

357
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,100
 And for it to have that type of effect on someone who plays it casually.

358
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,100
 Just last night I dreamt about it.

359
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
 I don't know, I just think it's weird.

360
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,100
 And I've always had that idea that a website or any piece of electronic media could be as haunted

361
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,100
 or cursed or enchanted just as much as any other object.

362
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,100
 But then we have this combination of a game that is wildly successful

363
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,100
 developed by a team who had never made a Battle Royale game before

364
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
 and they just hit everything exactly right.

365
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,100
 The effect it has on even casual players.

366
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,100
 If you did make a deal with the devil, literally,

367
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
 you think what would he want out of the bargain?

368
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,100
 What would be a better trade off for him?

369
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,100
 The two souls of the developers or the developing team?

370
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,100
 Or, "I'll help you make a perfect game, but I want to be in it.

371
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
 I want people to become obsessed with me."

372
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,100
 Not in it like he the devil is a playable character.

373
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,100
 He's running around, he's carrying like rifles.

374
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
 He's like, "Come on, go, go, go!"

375
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,100
 But you know what I mean?

376
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,100
 This mystical force, this dark energy into this game

377
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,100
 that when you play it, every time you play it,

378
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,100
 you think you're shooting and chipping away at someone's shield,

379
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
 but it's actually chipping away at you.

380
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:54,100
 Getting into your subconscious is a hard thing to do, really.

381
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,100
 You may have a bad day at work and then go home and dream about work.

382
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
 Maybe.

383
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,100
 But when's the last time that you watched a television show?

384
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,100
 You watched the Big Bang Theory, God save you,

385
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
 but you watched the Big Bang Theory five days a week

386
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,100
 and you just dreamt that you were trapped in that apartment.

387
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
 Oh my God, that's hell.

388
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
 That would be a nightmare for me.

389
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:21,100
 But that's about the honestly the amount of time that I've put into this game.

390
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,100
 I've probably put in altogether maybe like 20, 30 hours into it

391
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,100
 and I'm having dreams about it every night.

392
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,100
 And sometimes the images and the dreams are so subtle I miss them.

393
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
 So bizarre.

394
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
 So bizarre.

395
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,100
 If you made a deal with a devil instead of just taking your souls,

396
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
 go into the product they're making.

397
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:50,100
 Make it the number one game, movie, song, book in the world for a brief time.

398
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
 Don't want them to get cocky.

399
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,100
 You want them, the developers, to have to come back to you and make another deal.

400
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,100
 But for that time, while they are ingesting that media,

401
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,100
 you think you're reading a good book or hearing a good song

402
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,100
 or playing an amazingly created video game.

403
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:12,100
 But what's really happening is your entertainment value is your part of the bargain.

404
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,100
 You're getting a little mindless fun for a few hours

405
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:23,100
 and the dark energy behind it is getting your soul for as long as it wants.

406
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,100
