1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Is the movie The Conjuring 2 haunted? Yes, we're finally getting to that story.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,040
 And a conspiracy involving J.K. Rowling? The Harry Potter books? And the oddest

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,000
 thing is, the conspiracy might actually be true today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,960
 host Jason Karpner. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,840
 I'm having a great day despite the fact that my apartment, as much as I love my

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,480
 apartment complex, the hallway lighting is not turned on. This place is known for

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,560
 being haunted, my apartment included. We'll do stories on that later. And I'm

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,480
 doing laundry. And I've been trading ghost stories with Lana all day long. Oh

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,680
 morning long. Well, I know I pretty much all day long. Anyways, I was talking to

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,760
 Lana all day. We were trading ghost stories on Facebook and my clothes. I got

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,360
 to get them out of the dryer and it's a dark hallway and it's spooky and it's

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,560
 raining up here. So I've been drinking that Rose energy serum. I don't know how to

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,840
 classify it. I got it at the Free Food Bank, the corner food bank in town. I took

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,840
 that and some applesauce. I ate the applesauce a long time ago. Man, it really

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,960
 does work. It gives you a lot of energy. I feel myself talking very quickly. So it's

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,560
 like, I almost have to like slow down and restrain myself. But I think we got a

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,520
 good episode today. I'm very excited about that. So, the Conjuring 2. Now, the

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,120
 Conjuring 2 was the sequel to the Conjuring 1. It was obviously, but what it

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,120
 was really setting up was building the Conjuring universe. The Conjuring

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,720
 Cinematic Universe actually may be the closest competitor to the Marvel universe

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,680
 that we have. Because you have like Annabelle, you have the Conjuring movies,

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,040
 you have Annabelle, you have the Nun. Now, they're doing quite well. And James

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,600
 Wan is a completely underrated director. He came off of Saw movies. He's done

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,160
 these Conjuring movies. He's done Fast and Furious. He's doing Aquaman. Very

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,200
 underrated director overall. I really like his style. However, I didn't like the

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,080
 Conjuring. And I wrote a full review of it on my movie review website, Video

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,720
 Vandals, which I'll put in the link below. I wasn't a fan of it. So, when I started

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,360
 doing this research, I started reading stuff that the movie The Conjuring 2 was

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,240
 actually haunted by demons. There were rituals in the movie of The Conjuring 2

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,480
 that made people get possessed and brought demons into your house and movie

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,520
 theater and things like that. And I was like, okay, you know, again, take off my

33
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,720
 skeptic hat because that sounds completely foolish that a movie in such

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,320
 wide release could have something like that in it. Take off my skeptic hat. And

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,520
 I'm doing my research and they're like, a woman was possessed watching this movie.

36
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,720
 And I was like, okay, you know, looking at it, the woman's like in the audience

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,720
 going, "Raaah, raaah." And then it was debunked. The video of her free-- she

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 related freak out during a movie. It was probably some sort of epileptic fit, but

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,520
 it wasn't The Conjuring 2. It actually happened years before The Conjuring 2

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,240
 came out. So that story got debunked, but people still passed it around and said

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,640
 there are real rituals used in this movie to bring demons out. Now, I will say

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,800
 this at this point. Before I prepped this story, I was like, well, I should watch

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,360
 The Conjuring 2. And it was-- okay, there is a-- and I talked about this when I

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,520
 talked about the boo pill, how I think that a lot of girls are more into horror

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,600
 and paranormal than people think. The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 and the

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,400
 Annabelle movies are what I call date. They're basically date movies. They're

47
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,840
 either movies that girls go in groups together to watch, or you bring a girl

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,560
 to see it. Guys don't-- you don't get, "Hey, bro, what's happened this week?" And

49
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,280
 "Oh, yeah, dude, the nun's coming out. Hell, yeah, let's go see." That's not who

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,840
 those movies are made for. The audience of that are women. Conjuring movies and

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,360
 Annabelle, they're all set up for that. They're perfect date movies, honestly,

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,880
 because you know it's not gonna be super gory like Saw, and it's gonna scare her,

53
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,320
 which is gonna turn her on. Perfect date movies. But I'm watching it alone in my

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,440
 apartment, and I was like, "This movie is boring." It wasn't-- I didn't have a date

55
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,960
 with me. The storyline was, "Oh, there's a haunted house, and there's like an old

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,400
 man walking around the house. Had a lot of jump scares in it, which I'm not a huge

57
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,520
 fan of. I enjoyed tension more." You can have both? So I didn't finish it. To be

58
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,240
 honest, I watched it, and then I was like-- I watched probably about half of it, and I

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,480
 just wasn't feeling it. So even though I'm supposed to do the research for the

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,760
 show, I clicked it off, and instead I watched the row about a group of sorority

61
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,280
 girls being stalked by a serial killer who is chopping their body parts off and

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,880
 turning them into dolls. Starring the girl from Vander Plump Rules. I guess

63
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,800
 that's a reality show. And Randy Couture, the fighter. I think he's a-- I think he's

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,640
 a UFC guy. I don't think he's a wrestler, but anyways, I watched that instead. It

65
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,160
 wasn't good either. The girls are hot. It was terrible though. Anyways, so I stopped

66
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,040
 watching The Conjuring 2 to watch the row, and I ended up being disappointed on

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,600
 both counts. So story's over, right? You're like, "Jason, you watched The

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,000
 Conjuring 2 or half of it. Half a demon didn't show up." The video of the woman

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,160
 being possessed in the movie theater was not true. It had really happened, but it

70
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,560
 had nothing to do with that movie, and it was most likely like an epileptic fit.

71
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,160
 So the movie's not cursed, right? This is where it gets weird. And I tried so hard,

72
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:29,240
 so hard to debunk this. And I'll tell you why, how these things work. Because this

73
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,080
 is an interesting little view on fake news, and because this is also kind of an

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,200
 interesting view on how fake news spreads. I'm not saying this is fake news, but

75
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,120
 you'll see the difference. So The Conjuring 2 comes out. In India, there is a man named

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,200
 G. Ram Mohan. During the climax of the film, he's watching The Conjuring 2, he

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:58,200
 has heart attack and dies. His buddy, H. Prasad, who said, "Hey, let's go see it, you

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,000
 know, together." They're like, "Hey, let's go see The Conjuring 2." That's actually

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,080
 weird, because it was two dudes seeing The Conjuring together, and I was just

80
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,080
 talking trash. I said, "Dudes, do not go see these movies together." So I could be

81
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,080
 wrong on that. I want to go see the movie with bunch of dudes, and I don't know

82
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,080
 anyone, any other guy who would go see it with me. We'd go see, you know, Saw or

83
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,080
 something like that. But anyways, are they still making those? I think they're

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,000
 none. So H. Prasad and G. Ram Mohan go to The Conjuring 2 to see it in this

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 province in India. G. Ram Mohan has a heart attack and dies, and they take him

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 to the hospital, and they're like, you know, he's dead. And again, this could be a

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 cultural thing, but the hospital staff said to his friend, H. Prasad, "Can you take

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 him to The Coroners?" And H. Prasad goes, "Yeah, sure." He loads him up in what's

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 known as an auto rickshaw, and they leave from the hospital to go to The

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Coroners. Neither of them are ever seen again. Completely gone. Now, of course, it

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 creates this vision of driving. Your friend's dead body is in the back of

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 your auto rickshaw, which I imagine is kind of like a rickshaw with a motorcycle

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 or a motorbike attached to it. I guess I should have researched that before I

94
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 started this, but you have your friend's dead body in the back of your rickshaw.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 You're driving through India at night. The body reanimates, glowing eyes, attacks

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 him. Auto rickshaw goes off the side of the road. I mean, that's obviously a

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 fantastical interpretation of the events, but what we know is people were never

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 seen again. The friend or the guy or the auto rickshaw. Now, I read that story and

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I immediately go, I put back on my skeptic hat and I was like, okay, that's

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 foolish. And I started to see there was a ton of articles about this. They were

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 all referring to each other, which you kind of see, and they were all clustered

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 within a group of days. So you would have like all of this stuff happened back in

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 June 2016. So they'd all be days apart. It was an international story because it

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 involved a hit movie, but you'd see the Daily Mail report it. You would see the

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 New York Post in an article on it. You saw the Kaleach Times, which is an Indian

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 newspaper, do a story on it. And they're all grouped in this time period. So I go,

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 okay, this happened back in June of 2016. Obviously, we have learned more

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 information. No. To this day, there is not an article explaining where those

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 people are. I go to Snopes. I'm like, obviously Snopes must have debunked

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 this. Nothing. Nothing at all. I typed in conjuring to missing person debunked

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 nothing. No one's debunked this story, though this happened. And I want to say

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 this too. A lot of times when I'm reading stuff, generally it's on like the

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Daily Star, but here's a little hint as far as like fake news goes, especially

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 involving paranormal events. They will not use names of people. They'll say an

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 unidentified woman complained that aliens are sneaking into her house late at

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 night. That's nine times out of ten, totally false. Sometimes a person may

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 want to, you know, be anonymous, but for the most part, that is a fake story. They

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 don't use exact locations. Sometimes they'll say things like in Northwest

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 England, you know, in Southern France. So this article, like the College Times

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 says, gives his name, gives where he was born, names the hospital that he was

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 brought to. I can't pronounce it, but they named the hospital of where he was

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 brought to. They talk about how the police are trying to locate the corner

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 office in the place where he grew up. It's very, very detailed. And as I was

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 looking through the articles that were coming from other countries, it left out

125
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 a lot of those details, and that's why I was super skeptical about it in the

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 beginning. But when you look at the articles from that province, they're

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 like, here's his name, here's where he was born, here's the exact hospital that

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 this guy was brought to. So that allows people to then track that story back.

129
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 They can call up the hospital and say, hey, I just want some clarification.

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Did this event happen? Did a guy have a heart attack and go to your hospital

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 and then you tell them to leave? If it's real, the hospital can say yes.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 If it's fake, the hospital can say no. But most stories involving paranormal

133
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 that are fake will just say a man in India died of a heart attack and his body

134
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 went missing according to authorities. He was taken to a hospital and then his

135
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 friend loaded him up in his car and drove away. Neither have been seen since.

136
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And for a lot of people who do paranormal stuff, read this stuff, that's enough.

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But when you again, you put that, you put a little bit of weight on that story,

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 it falls apart. This one has enough detail that I honestly think, I at least

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 think the first part is true. A guy had a heart attack during the conjuring,

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 his friend took him to the hospital. I think honestly, the second part is true.

141
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Now, whether they were beset by raiders or pirates, I don't know what area of

142
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 India this looks like. I don't think there's like pirates roaming the jungles,

143
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 or even if there's jungles. But it's very likely that these people did go missing

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 because this story has not been debunked and it was a very high profile story.

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 It was covered in newspapers around the world. What happened to this body and the driver?

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Was the man killed by the conjuring too? Was it a normal heart attack and

147
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 something normal happened to take them both off the roads and to disappear from

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 the face of the earth? Was the man possessed by the rituals in the movie

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 that I failed to finish? Who knows? It's a weird story. I think this one

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 is true. I don't know if he was possessed by a demon or if him and his

151
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 buddies possessed corpses are roaming the wilderness of India looking for more

152
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 people for their undead army. That's unlikely. Very unlikely. But yeah,

153
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 what happened to these two guys? Weird. Weird stuff. The world is full of

154
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 weird stuff. And again, the story just disappeared. You see all these articles

155
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 within the course of the month of June and then you see some later ones happen

156
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 around Halloween and then gone. But it is still, the story is less than

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 two years old, so we may get more information coming up. There may be a

158
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 500,000 man army of the dead roving India when they start to cross into another

159
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 country. Yeah, creepy. There's a billion people over there, so I mean, you can

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 miss two. Probably pretty easy, but yeah, creepy. But anyways, let's go ahead

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 and move on to the next story. Yeah, let's go ahead and move on to the next

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 story. Okay, so we talked about this a couple episodes ago, how my birthday

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 was kind of a bit of a bummer. But it got better. I went out with a couple

164
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 friends that night and then about two nights later, my friends Hank, Dors,

165
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 and Wayne took me to the Trillium. If you're ever in Hood River, Trillium

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 has great burgers. Stop by there. I prefer the Wrangler. I actually prefer them all.

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 The Uranium is very good as well. Anyway, so we're out and there's one thing

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 that I've noticed that when I'm talking to anyone considerably younger than

169
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 myself, for whatever reason, two subjects always come up. Harry Potter and

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Firefly. I dislike them both. I think Firefly is completely overrated and I

171
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 think Harry Potter is lame. I've never read the book, never seen a movie. I will

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 go over now very quickly everything I know about Harry Potter. Harry Potter

173
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 gets touched by a dude on the forehead and gets a lightning bolt. His parents

174
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 get killed. He ends up living in the closet with his uncle. Now he shows up,

175
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 invites him to go to a school. He goes to the school. There he meets a dwarf

176
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 named Dobby and a gay wizard named Dumbledore. Then I know nothing about

177
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 him. I know nothing that happens at all until Edward from Twilight gets killed

178
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 during some sort of tournament and Dumbledore falls off a building and

179
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 then a guy named Voldemort, aka Tom Riddle, I know that for some reason,

180
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 decides to fight Harry Potter and they shoot magic at each other and then

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Hermione turns black. That's really all I know. I know stuff like I know the

182
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 names of the four schools, unfortunately. I know the names of the characters.

183
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 I know... I mean really that's it. I know there's something called a

184
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 time-turner and there's stuff you can drink that turns you into the opposite

185
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 gender. Very, very basic knowledge of Harry Potter. Now you think, oh, that

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Hermione turns black thing, that was just some sort of flippin' thing, but

187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 it's important to this conspiracy theory. This conspiracy theory started in

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 2005 by a Norwegian director named Nina Grunfeld. She was doing an interview

189
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 for a Norwegian newspaper and she claimed that J.K. Rowling did not write the

190
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Harry Potter books. She didn't write them. They wore a manufactured series of

191
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 books. This was her quote. "But can a person be so productive and commercially

192
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 successful in a media industry where nothing is left to coincidence? Is it

193
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 possible that a person can write six thick books that are translated into

194
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 55 languages and sell more than 250 million copies in less than 10 years?

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Is it probable that the stories then get filmed and commercially exploited to

196
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 a degree scene here without any well-thought-out strategy or highly

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 professional players behind them? Is it possible that J.K. Rowling exists?

198
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Well, who do they think they're kidding? Not me." She thinks that J.K. Rowling

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 is an actress that basically a group of marketing executives hired a bunch of

200
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 writers to crank these books out. They hired a face with a story. She's a

201
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 young woman. She's a single mother. She's dirt poor. And she's sitting at the

202
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 train station one day. The train is late. She comes up with the idea for Harry

203
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Potter. She ends up writing notes on little pieces of paper while she's

204
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 sitting at cafes. She creates the first three chapters of the book, goes to

205
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 the publisher, they buy it, it becomes the biggest book series of all time.

206
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 That's the official story. Nina's pushback on that is, and this was

207
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 interesting, so the first part of that you're like, "Well, you know, I guess it's

208
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 possible to write seven books in 10 years and it's just like every book's

209
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 phenomenal, has this great marketing rollout and so on and so forth." And the

210
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 movies are super successful as well. Her pushback is Nancy Drew, the author of

211
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Nancy Drew never existed. That was also a huge series. Each book was written by

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 a group of writers. So they wrote the books, they just had one name. That was

213
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 the series. So she goes, "There is precedent for this as well." The defense,

214
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 they, you know, obviously when Nina said this stuff, people started going,

215
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 "What? That's ridiculous." They talked to this Norwegian translator. He worked

216
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 on translating Harry Potter books. He says that, "No, the books, this was

217
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 their defense. The books were definitely written by one author because if you

218
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 look at the books, he sees a consistent weakness in Rowling's work." And he goes,

219
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 "A group of writers could not have the same weaknesses when they write." So

220
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 basically, the defense is, she sucks and take a group of people can't suck in

221
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 the same way as just Rowling sucks. Now again, I haven't read the books. They

222
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 don't really appeal to me. I'm not a fan of fantasy magic. But anyways, the

223
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 defense basically. And then the other defense is that's Ludacris. No, she did

224
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 write those books. But is there proof that she wrote those books? Well, I mean,

225
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 you know, unless we go through and find the notes and all that stuff. And the

226
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 story makes sense on one level that you could see a marketing team say, "Hey, we

227
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 have this cool idea. We're just going to pay these young people to write these

228
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 books." And J.K. Rowling will be this fictional character we created. However,

229
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 the conspiracy theory didn't catch on. And Nina admits it's a conspiracy

230
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 theory. She gave the interview in 2005. And that was it. It was just a little

231
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 article in the back of a Norwegian newspaper that a couple other newspapers

232
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 addressed as, "Look at how crazy this is." And that was it until 2011. Now,

233
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 in 2011, The Simpsons did an episode called The Book Job. Now, I am still a huge

234
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 fan of The Simpsons. And anyone who says the show ended in season seven or season

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 nine or whatever, you're not watching the new stuff. And it is still really good.

236
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 The Book Job is one of my favorite episodes. This is season 23. It's a good

237
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 episode for two reasons. One, because it talks about the conspiracy theory that J.K.

238
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Rowling did not write the Harry Potter books. It's obviously referencing her.

239
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So, in The Book Job, Homer, Principal Skinner, Bart, Moe, and one of the sisters,

240
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 one of Marge's sisters, gets together and they decide to crank out fantasy novels

241
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 because now they know that the whole thing is fake. It's just a group of writers

242
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 writing one series of books and they have a face for the novel. And so, it takes

243
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 this conspiracy theory and turns it into the plot. And the whole thing is set up.

244
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It's called The Book Job because it's set up like a heist. It's set up like a heist

245
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 movie. They show them assembling the team and pulling off the con. It's actually

246
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 kind of like an Ocean's Eleven parody. It's a very, very funny episode. It's a very

247
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 clever episode. And it talks about a conspiracy theory that up until that point

248
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 was relegated to the back page of newspapers in Norway. It's one of those

249
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 conspiracies that actually rings a little true. I first heard about the conspiracy

250
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 theory. I worked backwards on this. I saw the Simpsons episode first and thought

251
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 it was funny. And when you're watching it, you're thinking, "That actually sounds

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 fairly accurate." The whole episode is about the marketing teams that create

253
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 these young adult novels. And they keep referencing this idea. And it almost feels

254
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 when you're watching it, you're like, "That sounds so true." And James Fry,

255
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 who wrote A Million Little Fibers, he was the guy who wrote that book that ended

256
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 up being not true. He said it was a biography, not true. He started a company

257
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 that would hire young writers who just are out of college, graduate school, to

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 crank out novels. And I Am Number Four came from that workshop. It's not even a

259
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 workshop. It's a job. You show up there, you write for eight hours a day. You go

260
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 home and it was just full of people. I Am Number Four. So we have proof that young

261
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 adult novels are cranked out by teams of people. Twilight was four books. They're

262
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 fairly... I read more of the Twilight... I read three of the Twilight books and I'm

263
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 the Harry Potter. But if somebody told me no, that was actually also a team of

264
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 writers or 50 Shades of Grey after the first one, it was a team of writers.

265
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 It wouldn't shock me because at a certain point, the publishing company has

266
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 invested money into you. So they may not just have an editor work on your stuff.

267
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 They may have another writer come in and spruce it up. Harry Potter is a phenomenon.

268
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 No other young adult novel has its own version of a theme park. None of them have

269
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 the level of video games. It would not shock me if the allegations are true.

270
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 J.K. Rowling has not responded to these things. And you could say, well, yeah,

271
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 who's going to respond to every conspiracy theory? Obama released his birth certificate.

272
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 J.K. Rowling hasn't responded to this stuff. Not after the initial allegation,

273
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 not after the Simpsons episode that I've seen, that I've been able to see at least.

274
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Here's the thing, this is one of those conspiracy theories where if it's not

275
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 true, it's definitely possible. It's definitely possible. Now, let me go back

276
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 and this is where I think kind of the proof comes in. When I was saying about

277
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 what I know about Harry Potter, I said at the end, Hermione, whatever,

278
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 becomes black. And I think this ties into the conspiracy theory.

279
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So when they moved it to the play, they did a Broadway theater,

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Hermione was portrayed as a black actress. And J.K. Rowling was like,

281
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 "Yes, I'm totally fine with this decision. It's 2016. Everything's great."

282
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 But let's look at some other stuff that happened. In the Harry Potter movies,

283
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I found all this stuff when I was researching it, there were two young black kids

284
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 who later in the movies when they got speaking lines were replaced by white people.

285
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 There was a young actress named, not actress, there's a young character named

286
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Pansy Pinkerton or Pansy Parkinson's or whatever. She was played by a cute little young girl

287
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 and the rumor is, and there's a little bit of truth to this, J.K. Rowling hates that character

288
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 so much, it reminded her of all the girls that picked on her in school, that she asked

289
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 them to replace her with an ugly actress. Because she didn't want to see a cute girl

290
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 being someone who reminded her of a bully. And they did. I don't think the girl

291
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 that they replaced her with is ugly, but definitely not this cute little girl.

292
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 You have Dumbledore being gay, which J.K. Rowling was like Dumbledore's gay.

293
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And now that they're doing the prequel movies, the director's like,

294
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 "Ehh, we're not really going to show that." And the fans are all upset and J.K. Rowling's like,

295
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 "Ugh, you have Johnny Depp, accused wife beater, being in the prequel movies of Harry Potter,

296
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 the Fantastic Beasts movies. And J.K. Rowling is a very big, like, proponent of women's rights.

297
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 She's been brought to task for that." So from those little stories, I think you could say,

298
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 and I think through J.K. Rowling's tweets and all that stuff, she's very social justice conscience.

299
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 You know, racism and all that stuff, sexism is very in her consciousness.

300
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And yet she's supposed to also have tons of control over this franchise.

301
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And black people are being replaced by white people when they get speaking lines.

302
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 That's ridiculous. Accused wife beaters are in movies that are based on her work,

303
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 but then she has to defend. She outs a character as being gay,

304
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 but when someone else has control of it, they change that, or they're not revealing that.

305
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 If she has all this power over this franchise, why can't she just say, "No, I don't want these actors,

306
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I don't want these black kids to turn into white kids." That's racist. That's totally racist.

307
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 You give the kids lines and they become white.

308
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 So either she's this literary mastermind who's written the best-selling book series of the past 100 years,

309
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 or she's an actress who has no control and no say over what goes on in the stories.

310
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And you may go, "Well, Jason Warner Brothers bought the movies, they can do whatever."

311
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And fair. That's fair. But it still doesn't jive with the idea or the image that she has control over this franchise,

312
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 over the books, or over the movies, or some sort of input.

313
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 E. L. James, who did 50 Shades of Grey, she was allowed on the set of at least the first movie.

314
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 She went in with almost total control, creative control, and she butted head with the directors and all that stuff.

315
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And that was the first time they didn't even know if that movie was going to succeed.

316
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 J.K. Rowling apparently has all of this, she's this mega star, she has more money than the Queen of England personally.

317
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 She has like $900 million, she has all these homes.

318
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 She's constantly talking about the social justice causes, but when the rubber meets the road, they're gone.

319
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 So it could be one of two things. She's a hypocrite, only in it for the money.

320
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Or she is an actress who can say whatever she wants, but the real power, the marketing team, the writers behind the scenes,

321
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 they're the ones who are like, "Oh, J.K. Rowling's talking about refugees again, but we're not changing the script."

322
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 These black kids become white.

323
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 You go, "Jason, if that's true, why did Hermione become a black person in the play?"

324
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I don't know, throw her a bone.

325
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 But Hermione being portrayed by a black actress in the play was like, "Oh my God, look at how progressive we are."

326
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 But then there were two black kids who didn't have any lines, and then they became white and they had lines.

327
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 You can turn Hermione into a thousand people.

328
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 That's totally racist.

329
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 That is so racist.

330
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I just found out about that tonight.

331
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Okay, anyways, I'm getting off topic.

332
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Let's wrap this up.

333
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 I personally think it's very plausible that she didn't write those books.

334
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 I'm not saying it's true, but I'm saying it's very plausible.

335
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I'm saying it's a conspiracy theory that -- what's the pushback on that?

336
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Oh, yes, she did.

337
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It's a conspiracy theory that makes sense.

338
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 There's precedent for it before and other forms of the same genre.

339
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Recent precedents, we can never really prove that she wrote those books unless she like hands-over handwritten notes and things like that.

340
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I think -- if somebody came to me tomorrow and said, "We have proved JK Rowley didn't write these books," then it wouldn't shock me.

341
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I think it would shock a lot of people.

342
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 To go back to her, Nina said, "The only way this thing will ever be exposed is if JK Rowley admits she didn't do it because she's tired of living her life," or the writers who wrote the book come out.

343
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And again, the defense is, "Well, if she's an actress, why does she have all this money?"

344
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Well, she doesn't.

345
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 It's all an act.

346
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Just like when you see rappers walk around with $500,000 of gold chains on their necks in front of the Lamborghini, it's rented.

347
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 So those houses exist, and she has a pretty big bank account, but everything else is fake.

348
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 You know, it's not like she owns five houses.

349
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 The company owns five houses, and she's allowed to live in one and travel to the other and things like that to keep the story going.

350
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 So that's it.

351
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 You can research this one.

352
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 You're not going to find a lot, unfortunately.

353
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 But maybe some people will be able to provide us evidence one way or the other.

354
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 You could all -- I keep saying if someone told me that she wrote these, then it had proof that she wrote these, I'd believe that, too.

355
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 But as it stands right now, if someone asked me to bet $100 that JK Rowley wrote the Harry Potter books, I'd hesitate to take that bet.

356
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000

 I'm going to go and get my laundry in my dark hallway now.

360
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 If I get attacked by a ghost, this episode won't get uploaded.

361
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 If it's uploaded, I was not attacked.

362
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Maybe possessed, but not attacked.
