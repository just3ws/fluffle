1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 when you're riding in a car with your family down the road,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,400
 and you're the only one to see a massive UFO.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,800
 No one believes you.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,800
 But will they believe you when a gray breaks into your house?

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,800
 And then we take a look at a winding convoluted theory.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,200
 We may not even have time to get to the gray break-in, honestly.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,200
 The Dogon tribe in Africa has long been connected to extraterrestrial contact.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,800
 A lot of debate about it, and we're going to go through the nitty-gritty.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,600
 But not only that, this conspiracy also says that when the aliens visited the Dogon tribe,

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
 they brought with them marijuana.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:48,100
 [music]

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 I'm having a great day.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,300
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,200
 We're going to start off with the Dogon story,

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,700
 because I don't know if we'll have time for the story about the gray break-in into the house.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,800
 If we don't, we'll save it to tomorrow, because this first story is quite complicated,

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,000
 and I haven't been able to figure out how long it's going to take for me to talk about it.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,600
 I find it very, very interesting, and just when you think,

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,700
 "Oh, Jason's going in this direction,"

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,000
 the story starts to turn.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I've been researching this for the past two days, maybe.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,700
 And it was quite the feat.

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,500
 It was quite the feat.

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,000
 I normally get all of my information quite easily,

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,900
 but this one, I had to go all over the place,

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,900
 and now I present to you,

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,200
 not only the story of the Dogon mystery,

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,800
 but did the aliens introduce marijuana to the planet Earth?

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,700
 Let's go ahead and start.

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,700
 Now, this came about because I got a YouTube comment from James on YouTube.

34
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,500
 So I'm going to read you part of his comment,

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,400
 because I think he did a good job kind of breaking it down,

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,200
 and then we're going to go through it and see what's true, what's not.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,300
 We're going to analyze it, come up with our own theory.

38
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,500
 It's a weird one.

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,700
 This is a weird one, guys.

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,000
 So James, and thanks James for the recommendation.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,200
 So here is his statement, here's his comment, regarding the Dogons.

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,700
 "Ellegedly, when Westerners made contact with them,

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,800
 they had extensive knowledge of the Sirius star system

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,000
 that scientists at the time didn't even know.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,700
 Like, they knew it was a binary system, etc.

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,600
 Anyway, they asked these people how they knew this,

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
 and the Dogons told them that fish-like humanoids with gills

48
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,400
 had come from the Sirius system

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,800
 and gave them a bunch of knowledge about Sirius A and Sirius B,

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,500
 which are the two stars, and such, and get this.

51
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,500
 They claimed that these people brought marijuana to Earth,

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,300
 and now the Dogons have a big festival every year

53
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,900
 where they get highest balls to celebrate the coming of the fish people.

54
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,200
 If that wasn't weird enough, cannabis translated from Greek is two dogs,

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,400
 and Sirius A and B are known as the Dog Star.

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,000
 Might be a good story to cover.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
 I read about it in some weed book back in high school.

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
 Now, when I saw that comment, I'm really familiar with the Dogon tribe.

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 I've been researching this stuff since I was about 10,

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
 so I've been looking into paranormal and conspiracy stuff

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,100
 and aliens and ghosts for about 30 years now.

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,700
 And the Dogon tribe is something I was quite familiar with.

63
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,300
 It's something that you stumble across generally really early on

64
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,600
 when you're researching stuff.

65
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,200
 It's in the top tier of the iceberg as well.

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,500
 So, I read it, and I know the story, the answer to the Dogon mystery.

67
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,300
 I know the answer to the Dogon mystery for the most part.

68
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,800
 I know the official explanation for how they know that stuff.

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,700
 But James, that was a great overview for it,

70
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,600
 but let's go ahead and start going through it here

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
 and finding out which stuff we know is fact, which stuff we know is fiction.

72
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,900
 And the more important part is that where weed is from.

73
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,400
 Touched on a couple interesting things throughout that thing.

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
 Let's talk about the story of the Dogons first.

75
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,500
 In 1931, in West Africa, in Mali.

76
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,400
 So, West Africa, the region of Africa,

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,500
 and then in the country of Mali, in 1931,

78
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,100
 these two French anthropologists named Marcel Garelli,

79
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,400
 I don't know, and Germain Dieterlin,

80
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,200
 these two French dudes start walking through Africa, right?

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
 And they're kind of bummed out. There's no bad gets.

82
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,000
 But they're on a mission to find the Dogon tribe.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
 They want to go talk to these dudes.

84
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,000
 Now, this area, before it became rife with warfare

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,900
 and all sorts of horrible things,

86
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,600
 Mali was known as a center of knowledge and art.

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
 So, it was kind of like a cultural center for West Africa.

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,500
 But nowadays, and especially when the two French dudes showed up,

89
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,000
 it wasn't doing too good.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
 And in this area, you had the Dogon tribe.

91
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,700
 Now, the anthropologists just go there to kind of say how you guys live in.

92
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,300
 Hey, guys, what's up? How you doing?

93
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,200
 Tell us a little bit about your life.

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,500
 The tribe's like, "Well, just hang out with us for a bit.

95
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,100
 We will reveal the information as time goes on."

96
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,100
 So, they did hang out.

97
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,900
 The two French dudes are hanging out with the Dogons for a while.

98
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,400
 And this is what they piece together.

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,700
 Well, they didn't just piece together.

100
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,600
 The people were willing to give this information.

101
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,300
 The Dogons were saying, "Our religion, we believe in Nomo."

102
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,000
 French dudes are like, "Oh, is that God?"

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
 And they're like, "It's a little more complicated than that."

104
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,100
 Because we have a creation God.

105
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,900
 We have a God who creates stuff.

106
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,500
 And one of the things that God created was Nomo.

107
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,700
 Well, there's eight of them.

108
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
 And then they're like, "So, there's eight Nomos?"

109
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,300
 They're like, "No, no, no. Nomo."

110
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,200
 Don't get ahead of yourself, French guys.

111
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,600
 Nomo is both the singular and the plural.

112
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,400
 French dudes are like, "Oh, damn it. This is going to be a brain teaser."

113
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
 They're trying to figure out how to write it down.

114
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,100
 How to write the story down.

115
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,800
 They say, "This is what happened. Nomo was created.

116
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,900
 And it's a hermaphroditic creature."

117
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,500
 It's like both sexes mixed together.

118
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
 It's also amphibious.

119
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
 And it's...

120
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,400
 Well, amphibious in the sense that it can swim the water and be on land.

121
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,100
 You guys know what amphibian is.

122
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,800
 But they're generally described as having the upper body of a human and a fish tail body.

123
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,500
 So, a mermaid, basically.

124
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,100
 And Nomo is then turned into four pairs of twins.

125
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,500
 No one has Nomo.

126
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,800
 Not the Nomo. Not Nomo is just Nomo.

127
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,600
 Just Nomo all around.

128
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,900
 So, Nomo is now not just the one dude.

129
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,000
 It's four sets of twins.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,600
 And one set of the Nomo went evil and declared war on Nomo.

131
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,100
 So, it's Nomo on Nomo action across the universe.

132
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,900
 And Nomo, the evil Nomos, get ripped to pieces

133
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,400
 and their body parts are spread throughout existence.

134
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,800
 In the religion of the Dogon people,

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,600
 they believe that wherever a limb of Nomo landed,

136
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,100
 you have to build a shrine.

137
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,900
 You build these shrines called Bainu shrines.

138
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,400
 So, you have these Bainu shrines

139
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,600
 and that is where a body part landed.

140
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,900
 And that is where you can go to contact Nomo.

141
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,200
 You pray at these shrines.

142
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,900
 And what's interesting about these shrines,

143
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,500
 you go to these shrines and you pray.

144
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 Now, each family in the Dogon tribe

145
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,100
 has a spirit animal that was chosen for them

146
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,500
 by going to these shrines hundreds or thousands of years ago.

147
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,100
 You go to the shrine, a spirit animal is chosen for you.

148
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,900
 And then when you go to this shrine and you pray,

149
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,300
 your family spirit animal will appear to give you advice

150
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,200
 or to help you through life struggles or just to kind of pet.

151
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,700
 Just because you're not feeling like having a bad day,

152
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,700
 you want to go pet a ghost panther.

153
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,400
 You can do that.

154
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,600
 So, you go to the Bainu shrines to seek the advice

155
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
 of your spirit animal.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 The Nomo had other names.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,500
 Well, they were just the Nomo or just Nomo,

158
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,800
 but they were also known as Masters of the Water,

159
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
 which makes sense because they have fish.

160
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,200
 The monitors or the teachers.

161
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,600
 That story is completely verifiable.

162
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,400
 That story there is if you went to the Dogon tribe today,

163
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,600
 they would tell you that story.

164
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,000
 That is the story that you get from any reading on the Dogon people.

165
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
 Dogon people are a real tribe.

166
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,700
 They're really visited.

167
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,000
 You can go visit them today.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,300
 So, the idea of them being called monitors or teachers

169
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,500
 does make, because we're looking at it with an alien viewpoint,

170
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
 does give it a little air of an alien.

171
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,300
 Masters of the Water find there's gods all over the world

172
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,100
 that are half human, half fish.

173
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,100
 Iconography and religions that are that as well.

174
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,200
 So, that doesn't stick out.

175
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,200
 But the fact that God himself isn't technically known as a teacher

176
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,700
 or I guess maybe a monitor,

177
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,100
 but he's more known as like just this all powerful dude

178
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,100
 who kind of just rampages and/or is absent from the universe.

179
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,200
 He either is responsible for the bad stuff

180
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,700
 or he just lets the dice go far where they may.

181
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,100
 And then some people believe that he intercedes and helps people as well.

182
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,200
 But his angels are sometimes known as monitors or teachers

183
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,400
 or demons are known as that.

184
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,800
 But God is very rarely known as a teacher.

185
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
 I could be wrong on that, but...

186
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,200
 So, when they're God and their creation God just kind of,

187
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,500
 again, kind of left.

188
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,100
 The Nomo is what they actually contacted.

189
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,800
 So, their God is also quite absent.

190
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,900
 So, we have that.

191
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,000
 Now, that's all there of high above.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,700
 What... Where we start to get with dicey stuff is in the late 1940s.

193
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,000
 Those two French dudes were hanging out there the whole time.

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,300
 I'm sure they went back to France every once in a while

195
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,900
 to, you know, like, bang someone at the Moulin Rouge.

196
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,400
 But they definitely kept coming back here.

197
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,200
 Maybe they were here for 14 years, I don't know,

198
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
 or 15 years or whatever it was.

199
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,000
 But anyways, it's the late 1940s.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,900
 And this is where we start to get iffy.

201
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,800
 And so the doggons are like, "Shh, come here.

202
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,100
 Hey, come here.

203
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
 Hey, so, you want to hear the real story of French guys?

204
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,800
 You guys have been here long enough.

205
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
 You've earned our trust.

206
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,800
 We're going to tell you the straight dope.

207
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,500
 We're going to tell you the real stuff.

208
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,000
 See, the story of the Nomo is more literal than you think.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,300
 Nomo came down and visited us.

210
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,500
 They're from outer space.

211
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,100
 The two French guys are like, "Wooah."

212
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,200
 Now, this is in the late 1940s.

213
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,000
 So again, we're starting to hear about Roswell and things like that.

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,300
 The doggons are like, "Yes, yes.

215
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,000
 Just like your Roswell events,

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
 just like your ancient aliens show that will premiere 50 years from now,

217
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,800
 Nomo actually visited us."

218
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,300
 And this is what they looked like.

219
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,900
 They had gills.

220
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,400
 They had fish legs.

221
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,100
 So just like our God imagery of them,

222
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,100
 they could also tear parts of their body off.

223
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,400
 It wouldn't kill them.

224
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,500
 And it nourished us.

225
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,300
 It gave us life.

226
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,400
 So the aliens came down and they were ripping parts of their body off.

227
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,700
 And we were eating them.

228
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,400
 Then the word "Nomo" in the doggon language actually means like,

229
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,400
 "Forces to drink" or "Makes one drink" is what it means.

230
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,600
 And they're saying they were ripping parts of their body off.

231
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
 And I get maybe we were forced to eat them.

232
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,900
 Maybe we were like, "No, this is disgusting.

233
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,800
 Dude, stop it. Stop it."

234
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,500
 But we felt compelled to eat them.

235
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,800
 That's why their name Nomo.

236
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,500
 Or maybe they're just named Nomo for other reasons.

237
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,300
 But they come down in their spaceship.

238
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,200
 And the first thing they did was they all jumped into a reservoir

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
 because they enjoy being in the water more.

240
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
 They can be on land because they're amphibious,

241
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,900
 but they enjoy being in the water more.

242
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
 They say, "Let's teach you some stuff."

243
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,100
 The Nomo goes, "We are going to teach you doggon people some stuff."

244
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,000
 We are from a star called Sirius Star System.

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,200
 And it is a binary star system.

246
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,500
 There's a big star and then a little star orbiting around it.

247
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,400
 And the little star takes about 50 to 60 years roughly for it to orbit the big star.

248
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,500
 We'll tell you a little bit about that.

249
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:06,200
 We'll also tell you that Saturn has rings and Jupiter has four major moons to it.

250
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
 And the doggons are like, "What's Jupiter? What's Saturn? What's a ring?

251
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,100
 We don't know any of this."

252
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,400
 And the Nomo goes, "Silence. You'll learn all of this stuff later."

253
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,400
 It'll shock French people thousands of years from now.

254
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,100
 Because this story supposedly took place thousands, thousands of years ago.

255
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,700
 So they teach them all this stuff.

256
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,600
 Now, in the doggon language, they do talk about the Sirius Star System.

257
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,500
 That's the dog star, which is...

258
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,900
 It's been known as the dog star all over the world.

259
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,400
 Because it looks like a dog in the shape of a dog.

260
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,900
 Not the star itself, but part of a constellation of a dog.

261
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,800
 Ancient Mesopotamians called it the dog star.

262
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,300
 So they were like, "Oh, that's cool, dude."

263
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,100
 Now, so you got a big star and you got a little star and the Nomo starts rolling something.

264
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,600
 He's like, "Yeah, man. We got all sorts of stars up there.

265
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
 He's rolling something. He's looking at it."

266
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,500
 Dogons are like, "What's that?"

267
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,200
 And Nomo's like, "Don't get ahead of yourself, bro. Don't get ahead of yourself."

268
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,400
 So in the doggon language, the name of the small star that orbits...

269
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,100
 They're Sirius A and Sirius B, like James would say.

270
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,100
 They call Sirius B Po-Tolo.

271
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,400
 Po-Tolo, tolo means star, and Po is the smallest seed known to them.

272
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,000
 So in their language, they have a name for a tiny, tiny star.

273
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,200
 Nomo's rolling a joint. He's like, "It's pretty trippy, huh?"

274
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,600
 They're like, "Oh, yeah, man. What is that? Can I take a hit?"

275
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,300
 And Nomo's like, "Hold on. Hold on."

276
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,500
 Yeah, dude. We're from like...

277
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,900
 The stars. We're from the tallows.

278
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,100
 Dogons like, "Dude, you gotta hit us up with that. What is that beautiful smelling stuff?"

279
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,400
 Nomo looks at it, passes it around and goes, "That, my friends, is 100% pure alien kush.

280
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,800
 That is marijuana. Cannabis.

281
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,300
 Freaky leaf. Just keep hitting it. We'll keep talking. Let's have a good time."

282
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,100
 Now, the two dudes...

283
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,000
 Now, okay, now, first off, I have to separate.

284
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,100
 The marijuana story is an addition that's gonna be added on later.

285
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,200
 But other than the point of Nomo rolling the joint,

286
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,100
 everything else is what they told the French guys.

287
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,200
 They said, "Listen, the aliens came down and they're half-fish and they jumped in the reservoir.

288
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,400
 They told us all this stuff. They told us that Sirius is a binary star system and that's where they're from."

289
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,700
 There's a third star also orbiting the main Sirius star.

290
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,600
 We call the little star Po Tolo, because Po is the tiny...

291
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,100
 And the French guys are like, "Yeah, yeah, I get it. You don't have to go over everything."

292
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,800
 They're like, "Okay."

293
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,600
 They also told us Saturn has rings and that...

294
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,800
 He paused for a second. He's like, "Are you stoned right now?"

295
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,700
 He's like, "No, no, sorry. I forgot what he's going on."

296
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,100
 Saturn has rings and Jupiter has four moons.

297
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:47,300
 Now, remember, this is taking place in the 1940s is when they're telling the French anthropologist this.

298
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,600
 And the French dudes are like, "There is no way they could have known this information."

299
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,800
 Because in fact, in 1610, it was found out that Jupiter has four major moons.

300
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,900
 There's actually 79 moons.

301
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,900
 And again, this is where the alien story starts the fracture of it.

302
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
 The alien should have been, "Dude, you want to blow someone's...

303
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,300
 You want to blow some white dude's mind a thousand years from now?

304
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,800
 Tell them there's 79 moons.

305
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,000
 The Jupiter, we counted them. We counted them all."

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,400
 But anyways, they said there was four...

307
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,400
 They knew there was four major moons around Jupiter.

308
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,100
 They knew that Saturn had rings.

309
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,600
 Both of those things were not discovered until the year 1610,

310
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,000
 which is obviously way before 1940.

311
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,200
 But these two French dudes are like, "How did this tribe in the middle of Africa

312
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
 or in the western side of Africa know any of this?"

313
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,100
 And we knew about...

314
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,500
 Serious. We knew about the dog star, but the thought that they had an other star rotating it

315
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,900
 wasn't theorized until 1844, and it wasn't verified by telescope until 1862.

316
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,900
 So, the French dudes are going, "They must have gotten this information from somewhere."

317
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,000
 And they ended up writing a paper about it, and they basically said,

318
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,800
 "They must have gotten this information from somewhere."

319
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,600
 In 1976, a book came out called "The Serious Mystery."

320
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 And that book says they did get that information from somewhere, and it was aliens.

321
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,100
 This is where the story really started to become popular.

322
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,400
 This book was published in 1976, and in 1977, a television episode of the show

323
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,100
 in search of hosted by Leonard Nimoy talked about the Dogon tribe.

324
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,400
 How could they have known about the binary star?

325
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,000
 How could they have known about the rings of Saturn?

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,800
 How could they have known about Jupiter's moons?

327
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,200
 And they said they described the small star as super, super dense.

328
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,000
 It was made of this magical metal, which isn't true.

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,200
 Again, the aliens are giving them inaccurate information.

330
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
 Maybe they're just doing it to...

331
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,500
 They're like, "Dude, stars are made of metal, man.

332
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,800
 That's so funny, dude.

333
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,000
 These French dudes are going to blow their minds."

334
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,700
 They're giving them inaccurate information,

335
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,200
 but they did describe the smaller star as more dense than the bigger star.

336
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
 So...

337
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,600
 And that's a fact.

338
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,600
 Serious B, it's a white dwarf, so it is more dense than Serious A.

339
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,300
 So, the idea was that aliens must have come down to give them this information.

340
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:06,100
 That Nomo is an actual alien race that came down and delivered this astrological information to...

341
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,900
 The Dogon tribe, the book came out, it was a hit, the television episode came out,

342
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
 it was a hit, people started talking about this.

343
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,300
 And so, scientists go, "There has to be a rational explanation behind this."

344
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,300
 To the point where Carl Sagan came out and said, "This is most likely what happened."

345
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,700
 This was the general scientific consensus.

346
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,100
 Nobody's saying that these French guys completely made it up.

347
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,900
 That's not a theory.

348
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
 The theory is this.

349
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,400
 At some point, someone must have traveled from Europe to that tribe and told them this information.

350
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,300
 That is far more logical than aliens coming down and telling them this information.

351
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:50,500
 Because the information for the most part matched what the Western world knew at latest the year 1862.

352
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,300
 So, they're saying at some point, and other anthropologists must have come to this tribe and told them this stuff.

353
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,300
 Because this tribe, according to the French dudes, worshiped the serious star.

354
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,700
 They were so into it that if a traveler from another country came there,

355
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,500
 and everyone's looking up at the star and they're like, "Oh yeah, the stars are so awesome."

356
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,100
 Someone could have said, "You know what? That's funny. I know a bunch about that star."

357
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:17,900
 And then that dude left, and then 50, 70, 100 years later, two French dudes show up,

358
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,100
 and the Dogons are like, "Yes, we know about binary star systems and stuff like that."

359
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:29,500
 Now, they also said there was a third star, and for the longest time, people who believe in this story

360
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
 have been trying to find proof that there is a third star.

361
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,700
 Because as of now, there is no proof that there is a third star also orbiting Sirius A.

362
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,700
 If it turned out that we discovered a third star orbiting Sirius,

363
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,100
 that would be far more proof that the Dogons had information that we don't have.

364
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
 100 times more proof.

365
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,100
 But we can't find any gravitational wobbles or anything like that.

366
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,500
 So the question is this. There's a lot of questions, but we're going to keep moving on here.

367
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,300
 The question is this. What are the explanations? How could they get this information?

368
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,000
 One of them, fish aliens, came down and told them this information.

369
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,800
 That is obviously a possibility. It's a very unlikely possibility, but it's one of them.

370
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,300
 Two, that some sort of Western element came in and did some cultural contamination

371
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,700
 and told them information about this star.

372
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,900
 Or three, this was a weird one.

373
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,100
 Because when we're talking about Africa, you get a lot of people who are...

374
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,700
 I'm trying to think of a word other than black supremacists,

375
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,000
 but that's really the only word that can come to mind.

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,300
 You have a group of people who believe that the black race is better than all other races.

377
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,800
 And this is a theory that's been put out there.

378
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,900
 That the Dogon tribes, because of the melanin in their system and in their eyes,

379
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,000
 they can actually see a white dwarf orbiting Syria.

380
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,500
 They basically can see like a telescope out in the space.

381
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,300
 So that's far less likely than fish aliens coming down.

382
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,000
 But you'll find websites, if you look into this, like I did.

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,300
 There are some people who believe that the Dogons, and I don't know,

384
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,500
 maybe everyone in Africa has a superpower, but the Dogon tribe,

385
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,700
 that they weren't told this by white people, that they weren't told this by fish aliens.

386
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,100
 They can actually look up into the night sky and see a white dwarf orbit.

387
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:27,100
 Another star that wasn't visible by telescope until late 1800s.

388
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,500
 They also believe that they can look at Jupiter and see four moons,

389
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 and they can see Saturn's rings with the naked eye.

390
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,000
 So take from that what you will.

391
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,500
 That is just a hilarious footnote.

392
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,700
 Because if that was the true, every world's armed forces would just be made up of Dogons.

393
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,100
 Anyways, but that's not so that is completely unfeasible.

394
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,900
 I think out of the three Western contaminations most likely,

395
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,200
 then fish aliens, I didn't think that would come in second,

396
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:00,100
 and then the Dogon tribe has the ability to perceive across the galaxy.

397
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,300
 They can see a tiny white dwarf.

398
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,000
 So that has been debunked over and over again.

399
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 It's one of those things that when you first hear about it,

400
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,500
 they talk about on ancient aliens.

401
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,800
 It's a really popular theory.

402
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,300
 It's super intriguing.

403
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,600
 I remember reading about it when I was like 12 and thought,

404
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
 "Oh, this is so awesome."

405
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,900
 And then I revisited it a few years later.

406
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,300
 And then I looked at it skeptically and they're like,

407
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,500
 "This is most likely what happened."

408
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,600
 And another little footnote to all of that.

409
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,800
 When another investigator went back,

410
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,700
 he goes, "They didn't care anything about the Sirius star system.

411
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,300
 This other anthropologist went back in between the Sirius mystery book coming out

412
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,000
 and the original paper coming out from the French dude."

413
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
 He goes, "Nobody cared.

414
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,200
 I went down there and everyone was just kind of like,

415
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
 'What? What? It's just a star. It's no big deal.'"

416
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,100
 And apparently when the two French dudes were told the story,

417
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,600
 the only two people who told them this story

418
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,100
 was the guy they were working closest with and the translator.

419
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,700
 Those are the old...

420
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,700
 Everyone else in the village didn't really mention the story

421
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,900
 or have anything to do with it or anything like that.

422
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,500
 So this guy, this Dogon dude, could have been a budding science fiction writer.

423
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,000
 He could have made it all up.

424
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,200
 Could be true.

425
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,000
 We don't know.

426
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,900
 But in the society itself, it's not as white.

427
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,100
 It may be now because now it would become a tourist attraction.

428
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,000
 But when it was revisited back before the mystery really took off,

429
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,100
 the other anthropologists couldn't find any proof that this was a cultural belief

430
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,200
 that other people believe in this thing.

431
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,800
 But let's go ahead here and let's move on to the next subject

432
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,300
 because this is where we start to get back into unsproven conspiracy theory stuff.

433
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,900
 Cannabis.

434
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:42,800
 This is where... So the theory has become that NOMO brought down weed to these people.

435
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
 And cannabis means...

436
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,100
 Canna is dog, like canine, and bi is two.

437
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,500
 So cannabis actually means two dog,

438
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,900
 and it is in reference to the two stars, the two dog stars.

439
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,000
 There is a rotational of the little star around the big star.

440
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,100
 Maybe the big star around the little star.

441
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,100
 It doesn't really matter, but of every 50 to 60 years is the rotation.

442
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,400
 And supposedly in the Doughan tribe every 50 years, they have a year-long party.

443
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,700
 James said it was every year, but that was that part incorrect.

444
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,700
 It was a year-long party every 50 years to celebrate a full rotation of the stars

445
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,700
 where they get stoned out of their mind.

446
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,300
 Let's start looking into this stuff.

447
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,200
 First off, right off the bat, cannabis does not mean two dogs.

448
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,600
 Doesn't mean that at all.

449
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
 Can... I...

450
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,800
 Even if it did...

451
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 The Doughan tribe would not call...

452
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 would not use a Greek word, because if they were using Greek,

453
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,100
 then there's so much cultural contamination in that area

454
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,300
 that you have to start writing off all of their legends whatsoever.

455
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,300
 So they weren't...

456
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,300
 Even if cannabis did mean two dog, it wouldn't...

457
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,800
 They wouldn't use the Greek word for it.

458
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 They would use their own word for it.

459
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
 Can... The word cannabis comes...

460
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,800
 It's a Skythian word, and maybe even a Semitic word.

461
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 From "canbos", because people were smoking dank weed

462
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
 as far back as people have been around.

463
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
 It's actually one of the oldest crops.

464
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 We can source it back to about 12,000 years ago.

465
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
 It came out of Central Asia.

466
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
 So you're like, "Well, there's the myth that's blowing.

467
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
 It didn't show up in Africa.

468
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
 You're going to talk about the gray breaking into the house."

469
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
 Well, it gets a little...

470
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 This is where it starts to get really weird again.

471
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
 So canbos.

472
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 It's a Skythian, maybe even a Semitic word.

473
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 In the old days, the old days,

474
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
 they would say, "I live in a Semitic word."

475
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,800
 In the Old Testament, there's a word known as "kyniboisin".

476
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,800
 So it kind of sounds like cannabis, and that means hemp blossom.

477
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,800
 So way preceding Greek, way preceding,

478
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 doggons even being established.

479
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 People were using the word canbos.

480
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
 So it's not... Cannabis does not...

481
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 If you broke it down and you bastardized Greek,

482
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
 yes, you can make it mean two dog,

483
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 but that's not where the word comes from.

484
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,800
 They're not 100% sure, but they're most likely it comes from canbos or canniboisin.

485
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
 So that doesn't...

486
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
 We're going to throw that out.

487
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,800
 So weed was being cultivated 12,000 years ago

488
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 in Central Asia, in the Mongolian territory.

489
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 The Dogon tribe was established in 3,500 BC.

490
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 So not even...

491
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 People had strains of Intica and Sativa

492
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,800
 long before the Dogons ever settled down in their area.

493
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 Again, this is where it's going to get weird.

494
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
 Apparently.

495
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 And what's funny is I've done a ton of research on this,

496
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 and a lot of people saying I've read this in a book.

497
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 And I'm wondering if they're getting the same information from...

498
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,800
 I'm wondering if they're getting the same information from the quote-unquote "weed" book

499
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 that James said that he read.

500
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,800
 I think it was in high school. It's been a while since that introduction, but...

501
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
 I wonder if they're all referring to this book.

502
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 But apparently...

503
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
 So Herodotus. We talked about him before.

504
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
 People say his name is pronounced Herodotus.

505
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 I don't believe that. I think it's Herodotus.

506
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 Herodotus...

507
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 loved smoking weed. Apparently...

508
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,800
 I couldn't find any sources for this, so again, I think it's this...

509
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 book that people are reading in high school.

510
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 Anyways, okay, fine. Herodotus...

511
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,800
 We'll call him that, but I don't think that's his real name.

512
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,800
 He'll always be Herodotus to me.

513
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
 Herodotus...

514
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
 went and he did, at one point, smoke weed

515
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,800
 or hang around with a bunch of Scythians smoking weed,

516
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 Scythians smoking weed.

517
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 He tells a story where they're just throwing it into a bonfire

518
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
 and like flipping out, dancing around.

519
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
 And Herodotus is like, "Oh, this is dope!

520
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,800
 I'm gonna be traveling all over the world smoking the dankest of the dank!"

521
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 So there's a story that Herodotus went to go...

522
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 Herodotus was a world traveler, and he's actually the first Westerner

523
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
 to write down a reference to marijuana.

524
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
 So he ends up...

525
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
 There's a story that he went to the Dogon tribe

526
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 and he actually showed up on the 50th year of this celebr...

527
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
 like, on the celebration year

528
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
 and got ribbon-stoned with this tribe in Africa.

529
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
 And they just smoked a ton of weed

530
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 and then he slowly stumbled his way back to Greece.

531
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 He's like, "Oh man, it was awesome.

532
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
 The jungle started talking to me. It was dope!"

533
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 I rode a gorilla across the savannah.

534
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
 Weed's the best.

535
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 And they're like, "Herodotus, just write stuff.

536
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
 Just be a historian. Write stuff down.

537
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
 Quit smoking all the time. Such a slacker."

538
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 And he's like, "Oh, I'll write it later.

539
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
 First I gotta play this Stone Age Nintendo.

540
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 It's just... it's pong. It's just literally like

541
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
 rocks bouncing around in a box."

542
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
 So Herodotus, supposedly...

543
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 I could not find any verification that Herodotus...

544
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 He did go to Africa, but I couldn't find any verification

545
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 that he visited the Dogon tribe or got high with them.

546
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 Now, that's because I've only been researching it

547
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
 for about two days.

548
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 That source may be out there, but I couldn't find

549
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
 any reference to him actually meeting the Dogon tribe.

550
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,800
 So I think that part may have been added in later.

551
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,800
 But could he have smoked weed with the Dogon tribe?

552
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,800
 This is, again, where we start getting interesting again.

553
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
 I think the whole thing is interesting, but I was looking at a map

554
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 of how marijuana, how cannabis moved out of Central Asia

555
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
 across the world.

556
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 And according to this flow chart, according to this map,

557
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 it should not have reached Western Africa until the year 800 AD.

558
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,800
 But Herodotus was born in 484 BC.

559
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 So if that is true, there is no way he could have smoked weed

560
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
 with the Dogon tribe.

561
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,800
 So either the information is fake that he didn't smoke weed

562
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,800
 with the Dogon tribe, or weed was in that area

563
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,800
 long before we thought it could get there.

564
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,800
 And I'm going to make the claim that it was.

565
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
 This is where we get into conspiracy, but hear me out.

566
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,800
 I'm going to make the claim that it was, and it may actually tie back

567
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
 to some alien encounters.

568
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,800
 Cannabis, like I said, known to come from Central Asia.

569
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,800
 It was growing on, how do you pronounce it, the steps?

570
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 I know it looks like it's the steppes, but the steps of Mongolia.

571
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
 Okay?

572
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
 So I started looking, again, I'm still going, I believe this stuff

573
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
 when I'm researching it, and then I'll present it as a skeptic

574
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
 or if I found anything.

575
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 This is, so I was researching this.

576
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
 I began looking through Mongolian religions,

577
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,800
 Mongolian gods to see if anything matched Nomo.

578
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,800
 There is a mermaid goddess, but I disregarded that

579
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
 because there's mermaid goddesses everywhere

580
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,800
 and she just kind of swam in the water and stuff like that.

581
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,800
 But there was a god of the steppes.

582
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
 A god of the steppes.

583
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
 No one has Ba's Tengri.

584
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 No information on him at all.

585
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,800
 They have a whole list on Wikipedia of all of these Mongolian gods.

586
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
 A lot of them have their own pages.

587
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 Nothing on Ba's Tengri, the god of the steppes.

588
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 Where cannabis originated from.

589
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
 Nothing.

590
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,800
 Tengri was their main god in the Mongolian religion.

591
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,800
 And then everyone else had these signifiers.

592
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
 So he was Ba's Tengri and someone else was Fon's Tengri or whatever.

593
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
 But Tengri was their main god.

594
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 I thought this was such a beautiful image.

595
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
 Tengri is seen as a pure white goose

596
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 flying over an endless expanse of water.

597
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,800
 That is just a shockingly beautiful imagery.

598
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,800
 And in their religion, Tengri was lonely,

599
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,800
 so Tengri created another god.

600
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,800
 And that god became evil and that god's purpose became to lead men down dark paths.

601
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 Pretty typical stuff for religion.

602
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
 Tengri ended up saying, "You know what?

603
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 I'm going to retreat from the universe.

604
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 I'm going to leave the universe up to how it goes.

605
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
 But I'm going to give people a helping hand.

606
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,800
 I am going to let people contact me.

607
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,800
 I'm going to send people sacred animals to watch over them

608
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
 and they can converse with when they're having a bad day

609
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,800
 or when they're seeking advice or they just want something to pet."

610
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,800
 That was a super weird connection between Central Asia and the Dagon tribe

611
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,800
 where you have the god pretty much hands off,

612
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,800
 but a spirit animal is your connection to that god.

613
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
 That is something that may play...

614
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
 I know other religions have spirit animals,

615
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,800
 but I think the two similarities are odd.

616
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:14,800
 The kind of hands-off god that will allow you to interact with a shard of that god

617
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,800
 in the form of a spirit animal.

618
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,800
 Very, very odd connection between those two.

619
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
 The Dagon tribe, nobody knows where they came from.

620
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
 They're actually not indigenous to Mali.

621
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
 They've been there for so long, they're considered indigenous.

622
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,800
 Just like someone who's Native American, you can say,

623
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,800
 "Oh yeah, but they came from Asia, but they came from somewhere."

624
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
 The Native Americans have been here for so long,

625
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
 they're considered indigenous people.

626
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
 Same thing with the Dogons.

627
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
 But the Dogons call themselves the Dogons.

628
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,800
 When they first arrived in Africa,

629
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,800
 it was so recent that the other tribes named them "Hab."

630
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,800
 And "Hab" means "stranger" or "pagan."

631
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,800
 So this tribe shows up in Africa, around 3500 BC,

632
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,800
 and the other tribes basically call them "butchwaredos,"

633
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
 a bunch of strangers, a bunch of pagans.

634
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 They are out of place of all the other tribes.

635
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,800
 I'm going to suggest that the Dogon tribe migrated from Central Asia.

636
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,800
 And that is why we have that connection of that belief.

637
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,800
 And if they migrated from Central Asia,

638
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,800
 they may have brought cannabis with them in that geographical area.

639
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,800
 So when Herodotus was able to go there,

640
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
 they were cultivating weed in their area.

641
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
 The religions have a couple similarities.

642
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,800
 The cannabis story with Herodotus does not make sense

643
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,800
 if we look at the normal migration of cannabis.

644
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
 That story doesn't wash.

645
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,800
 And the fact that they were so recent that other tribes,

646
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,800
 other established tribes, recognized them as being out of towners,

647
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,800
 recognized them as being pagans, with most likely pagan beliefs.

648
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,800
 So it would make sense that their religion would be based,

649
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,800
 have a loose tie to a Central Asian religion.

650
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,800
 And now we go back to wrap it all up.

651
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
 You go, "Okay, so let's say that you did figure out

652
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,800
 that the Dogons migrated from Central Asia."

653
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,800
 I might have called them "Dagons" a couple of times because of that horror movie,

654
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
 but not saying they're...

655
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
 Oh, I just remembered.

656
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,800
 "Dagon" was a horror movie, and the people were turning into fish.

657
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
 HP Lovecraft.

658
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
 Anyways, that's not proof.

659
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 That's not proof.

660
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 So you're like, "Jason, you're skeptical about it.

661
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
 You don't think aliens brought weed down to the planet?"

662
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,800
 I haven't completely put on my skeptic cap because let me reveal these two last pieces of information.

663
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:37,800
 First off, the reason why James sent me this story was because it was in reference...

664
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,800
 And I cut this out of his comment when I was reading it to you.

665
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,800
 It was in reference to the story of the Johnny Sands encounter.

666
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
 It happened in 1976.

667
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,800
 There was a country musician, quick overview if you didn't hear the episode,

668
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:56,800
 in 1976 there was a country musician who says he was visited by pale aliens with gills.

669
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,800
 And through the course of the investigation, he found out, and a man in black told him this,

670
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,800
 that the pale aliens with gills came from the Sirius Star System.

671
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
 They were amphibious, and they didn't have fish tails.

672
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,800
 They didn't have fish tails in his version, but he said they came from the Sirius Star System,

673
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,800
 which that planet orbiting it is like half water, half land,

674
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
 and sometimes land gets too hot so they go in the water.

675
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,800
 So they can breathe in the air, but they also have gills.

676
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,800
 Johnny Sands experienced that event in January of 1976.

677
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,800
 He was telling people that story for the course of the year 1976.

678
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:40,800
 The book The Sirius Mystery, which talks about the gill aliens from Sirius, came out in 1976.

679
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 Now his encounter was in January of 1976.

680
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
 It's possible that that book came out right before it.

681
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,800
 He read it and he goes, "Aw shucks, I'm going to make up a story about this."

682
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,800
 That's possible, but his encounter took place on January 29th.

683
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,800
 So unless that book came out those first 28 days, it's unlikely.

684
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,800
 The thing that really set it off, the book was popular,

685
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,800
 but so was that television show in search of, like I said, that show didn't broadcast.

686
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,800
 Start broadcasting until 1977, so even that is after Johnny Sands' story takes place.

687
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:18,800
 So unless Johnny Sands read a French anthropologist guidebook on the Dogon tribe, it was a bizarre coincidence.

688
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
 Absolutely bizarre coincidence.

689
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:28,800
 It could be he's retroactively changed his story, because I haven't read the actual, the original news articles when he was doing press on this.

690
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:37,800
 That's possible to be part of the hype, but it's also possible that he met an alien with gills from the Sirius Star System.

691
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
 Odd coincidence.

692
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,800
 Now if his encounter was in the 80s, I would completely write it off to the fact that he would read this book and was making it up.

693
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:54,800
 But the fact that his encounter took place, at the very least, he may have added the part about the MIB, the men in black agent telling them from Sirius.

694
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:04,800
 He may have added that over the years, but his initial encounter of the pale-faced aliens with the gills was 100% being reported January 30th, 1976.

695
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:11,800
 So again, unless that book came out the first part of January, he's telling the truth.

696
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,800
 I mean, again, I don't know if aliens actually visited him, but he's not adding that to the mythos.

697
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,800
 So that's an interesting connection between this stuff.

698
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,800
 And to wrap it all up, let's look back at Boss Tengri.

699
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:33,800
 Tengri is basically the God, the main God name, and then all the other gods have Tengri and then a qualifier in front of it.

700
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,800
 So you have like Water Tengri, Fire Tengri, Electric Tengri, whatever. They're Pokemon.

701
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,800
 But Boss Tengri, very, very little information. A lot of them have, like I said, very detailed descriptions of what they look like.

702
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,800
 Could not find anything. I finally had to find the definition of the word "Boss" in Mongolian.

703
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:02,800
 "Boss" means, according to Google, so some bunch of Mongolians will come over here and like raid my house on horseback.

704
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,800
 "Boss" means "Grey" or the "Grey God".

705
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:23,800
 It might be a coincidence that the one color we almost always connect with alien life is the God of the area where cannabis first appeared on the planet.

706
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:32,800
 You have the Grey God who was worshiped over the steppes of Mongolia where cannabis was first discovered.

707
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:41,800
 Not just cultivated, but first sprouted up out of the ground. The Grey God ruled that area.

708
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:50,800
 I used to smoke. I used to smoke a lot. And I get the connection between people thinking that it is some sort of supernatural herb, or that it is from another planet.

709
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,800
 Because the effects are so intense. There's also been conspiracies that magic mushrooms are alien.

710
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,800
 There's been conspiracies that, for whatever reason, cilantro is from another planet.

711
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:12,800
 But I don't get that one either. I don't get that one either. But I get why people who smoke weed, or have interacted with weed, can easily believe that it's not of this earth.

712
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,800
 Because the effects it has on the human brain are not of this earth.

713
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:26,800
 Cannabis may be from another planet. Cannabis may just be a plant that creates a special connection between the user and nature.

714
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:35,800
 It is like being an adult and viewing the world with the eyes of an infant. Everything seems new and special and bright and shiny.

715
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:45,800
 Everything seems important and funny and good. It may not be from another planet, but it makes you feel like an alien on your own planet.

716
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,800
 And because of that, I get why people respond to this conspiracy.

717
00:37:49,800 --> 00:38:00,800
 There definitely seems like there's something unique about marijuana. Something special, something alien.

718
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:14,800
 There may be no proof that it is from another star system, but that's not going to stop people from lighting up and imagining that it is.
