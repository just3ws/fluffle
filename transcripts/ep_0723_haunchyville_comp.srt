1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Today we ask the question if the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the people who are investigating Project Blue Book, who is investigating the FBI.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we finish the week out by going to Muskego, Wisconsin and taking a quick detour.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, hold on to your legs. We're headed to Haunchyville today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I'm a freak down. Actually, I'm a walk freak down.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys have some fun.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Plans for the weekend. We got a ton of stuff to cover so we got to slide right into this coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now to the sound of Triumph the Trumpets.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 It's Ding a nugget. Everyone give a round of applause to Ding. He's walking in doing low bow.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 He's showing off. He's doing acrobatics. Ding, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just helps read the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And also coming into Dead Rabbit Command, sneaking in through the back door is today's creator of Fan Art Friday.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Take a look at this awesome drawing. It's a little Dead Rabbit official Dead Rabbit headphones.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Wouldn't it be awesome to get these made with a little third eye on the top there?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 This was created by Just A Simp. Everyone give a round of applause to Just A Simp.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Really, really appreciate this Fan Art Friday. Do we normally applaud the Fan Art?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Everyone else did Fan Art. They're like, "I didn't get an applause." I don't know. I'm in a good mood.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 So you get applause too, Just A Simp. Ding, nugget. I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out to Tuskegee, Alabama.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 [imitates drumming] Ding, nugget is driving us down there. Just a simp is hiding in the trunk.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 He's going to be with us the whole way. As we're driving down to Alabama, I want to save this real quick.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I'm not a conspiracy theorist or anything, but I'm watching everything that's going on in Afghanistan.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 The Taliban has taken over the country at this point. I find it oddly convenient that we are now suing

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 the companies, and we're winning these lawsuits against companies, who made opioids for the past, I don't know, 20 years.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And we're peddling opioids and having doctors overprescribe opioids for, I don't know, maybe the past 20 years.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And it's just super convenient that now that they're not allowed to do that anymore and these companies are being sued and they're being held liable,

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 we no longer need the country that provided the most opium in the world.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Like Afghanistan exported something like two-thirds of the opium.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And the Taliban, I am, don't get me wrong, I'm not pro-Taliban, but one of the things they did previous to 2001 is they began burning all of the poppy fields.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 They said, "You're not growing this drug anymore." And then, you know, 9/11 happened, we went in, just happened to be the same country where we had all these poppy fields,

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 and we've had a boom of opioid production, just say for the past 20 years, and we've had a boom of opioid prescriptions in the United States.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And now these companies are being held liable and some of them may be facing financial charges, some of them may be facing criminal charges.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And it's just so interesting that now we don't need them anymore. We don't need them anymore so much that we've abandoned a bunch of people over there.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It just gets the old noggin joggin, doesn't it? I mean, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but the timing is really weird, and I always like to quote my good friend, Garrick,

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 "I believe in coincidences. Coincidences happen all the time. I don't trust coincidences."

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 There's little food for thought for the weekend, just an interesting thing going on, and I wish the people of Afghanistan the best,

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 and I hope the ones that need to get out of there get out of there and get safely out of there.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 It's horrible images coming out of Afghanistan. But let's go ahead and continue on our journey. Again, we wish you guys all the best over there.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Be safe, be safe. Ding nugget, go ahead and keep driving this Jason Jalopy. We're headed out to Tuskegee, Alabama.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Now that first one is a conspiracy theory of mine. This one is also a personal conspiracy theory of mine.

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 One that I've held for a long time. This is one of the ones I've never really talked about on this show, but I came across some information recently that made me go,

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 "Hmm, got my noggin joggin. That's my new catchphrase, right? I gotta get that t-shirt made."

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Okay, so let's hit this one running, this Alabama story running, because I recorded a version of it and it went on for like 26 minutes.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So again, this is a weird personal conspiracy theory of mine, and these can tend to sprawl out like this intro is as well.

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 One, there's a website called the Black Vault, and it's a really cool website.

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 They file Freedom of Information Act requests with government entities like the FBI, and get these documents and publish them on the internet.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 They have an entire section for paranormal stories, which is really cool. They're not like spooky creepypasta, but they're just FBI documents related to UFOs and the paranormal, psychic events and things like that.

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 On this website, the Black Vault, they have an entry for Lieutenant Colonel Robert Friend.

48
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 He led Project Blue Book, the government's official investigation into UFO phenomenon, from 1958 to 1963.

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And he was an African-American man.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 So you have a black guy running this top secret group that's looking into, at the very least, technology from foreign adversaries that is far more advanced than ours, into the very most, technology from out of this world, during a time of civil rights upheaval.

51
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 He was also a decorated combat veteran of the Red Tails, aka the Tuskegee Airmen. It was a segregated group of fighter pilots during World War II.

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 There's 922 fighter pilots that fought over Europe, very, very decorated combat group, shot down 112 enemy aircraft, and 950 rail cars, trucks and other motor vehicles, which sounds so fun, right?

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Like shooting another airplane would be super stressful, but you just see a train going by, "chucka, chucka, chucka, chucka, chucka, chucka, chucka!"

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And you're like just dropping bombs on it. That's the little engine that can't.

55
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 [imitates engine sound]

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 They have to come up with a good catchphrase every single time they blow something up.

57
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 But you have that. You have the Tuskegee Airmen here in World War II.

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Lieutenant Colonel Robert Friend was a part of that, and then he went on to lead Project Blue Book from 1958 to 1963.

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And he really wanted to open it up. He wanted to investigate these things.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 The person before him was more about debunking them, but he wanted to see what these things really could be. He didn't know.

61
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 He said personally, "I don't think it's possible for aliens to visit us. I think the distances are too vast. I really do."

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But let's figure out what these things are.

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 But after five years, he couldn't get anything done.

64
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 He was getting stymied. The bureaucracy above him was really pushing against them just to bunk it, get these files off the plate.

65
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 The press is asking about these UFOs. These flying saucers, they don't exist. They don't exist. They don't exist.

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 When he got transferred at the end of five years, he goes, "You just should just disband Project Blue Book. It's useless. We're not allowed to do anything."

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 The person who came in after him is the person we all know, maybe not by name, but by reputation, Major Hector Quintanilla.

68
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 He was the guy. It was his Project Blue Book that started the meme of "It's Venus."

69
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 That UFO you saw flying around. Nah, it's just Venus. He was the one the fighter pilots were chasing after this UFO for a while.

70
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 His report, it was Venus. Swamp gas. When you have people see these, "Oh, just swamp gas. It's just Venus."

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 These people are confused. These highly trained fighter pilots chasing these lights in the sky. Just planets. They're getting...

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 That's the guy who they got to replace Lieutenant Colonel Robert Friend. Hardcore debunking.

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 What's interesting is when you file a Freedom of Information Act for Robert, there's not a single FBI document on this guy.

74
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 A guy who ran one of the most top secret government groups at the time, and was a black man during the Civil Rights era.

75
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And you have to imagine the FBI's thinking, "We need to know... Is this guy sending out like pulse rifles to Malcolm X?"

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Every single piece of paper the FBI obtained about Lieutenant Colonel Robert Friend has either been lost or destroyed.

77
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 His FBI file is four pages long. It is explaining that there is no FBI file remaining on Lieutenant Colonel Robert Friend.

78
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Not that it didn't exist. Every document has been lost or destroyed.

79
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 It's not the crime, it's the cover-up. That makes me more suspicious. If they released 30 pages on Robert Friend, I would have read three and gotten bored.

80
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Maybe on page four it's like... And then we knew he was sending pulse rifles to Malcolm X. But the fact that there's none is ridiculous.

81
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Lost or destroyed. Now again, government is very inefficient. So it's possible that they lost a bunch.

82
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 It's possible that some are destroyed, but all of them.

83
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Ding Nugget, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are headed out to a much more light-hearted story.

84
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Take us out of here. We are headed out to Muskego, Wisconsin.

85
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 [Muskego-Wis-Conson-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T

86
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Ding Nugget is perfectly piloting this carbonar copter over to Muskego, Wisconsin. And I want you to land right there. We're 24 minutes outside of Milwaukee. And I want you to land the carbonar copter right there.

87
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 We're near Mystic Drive. It seems to be in the middle of nowhere. It's just like this old road and there's trees to one side and trees to the next. And just like overgrown grass.

88
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 We're kind of tromping through this unused gravel road. And we begin to see houses. Civilization at last, I say. But then as we get closer to the houses, we notice something.

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 The houses are tiny. Not like hipster tiny houses. You're like, "Oh, perfect. I'm gonna move in. I'm gonna pay $2,000 a month for 300 square feet." No, not one of those.

90
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Tiny houses for tiny people. Like three feet tall people.

91
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Long ago, long, long ago in the same location. This legend's at least 60 years old. It goes pretty far back.

92
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 We do a little fade away. And everything is all sepia-toned and moves really quickly. Like an old-timey movie.

93
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 60 years ago, it would actually be like the 1950s. It wouldn't be that old. It would be like on the waterfront style. But anyways, it's black and white.

94
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And there's a circus in town. There's a guy juggling. There's a little dude standing there. He's not a really good entertainer.

95
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And then there's a lot of like little circus people. Elephants dancing.

96
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 But the thing is, is like everything wasn't perfect at this circus. Unlike every other circus where no animals are treated badly and everything is drug-free.

97
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 At this particular circus, the ringmaster was exceptionally cruel.

98
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 He's whipping the little people they're running around. They're like, "Ah, I need to find a new job somewhere."

99
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And he's like, "Never. No one will hire tiny people." And he's like, he's wearing them shoes. He's putting his feet in their shirts and he's walking on them like slippers.

100
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 He's like, "Squeak, slippers, squeak." He's an exceptionally cruel ringmaster.

101
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 So one day the little people get together and they go, "You know what? We need to do... We need to murder him."

102
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And the other guys go, "You're going to say unionize or move or just find another job."

103
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 No. We need to murder the ringmaster and then maybe unionize.

104
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So they grab the ringmaster one night while he's sleeping in bed. And it's exceptionally cruel bed.

105
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It's made out of little people. His mattress is made out of their babies.

106
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 They grab the ringmaster and they yank him out of bed. He's like, "What? How dare you little people finally rise up against the ultimate evil that I've wrought upon you?"

107
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And they hold him down and they chop off his legs. And then they chop off his arms.

108
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 He's like, "Okay, that's a little overdoing it. The leg thing was already brutal enough, but..."

109
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And after his arms and his legs are chopped off, they go, "Now you're little like us."

110
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And he's like, "Kind of. Kind of. I'm also bleeding profusely from four limbs and that's something that you're not doing."

111
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And then before he can keep explaining why he's still different, they hang him.

112
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 After that they realize, wait a second, we just brutally murdered someone, our boss.

113
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 People are going to come to the circus tomorrow and wonder, "Hey, how come there's no ringmaster? How come there's just a bunch of blood everywhere in the circus?"

114
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 So all the little people from the circus run into the nearby woods and they go, "Okay, step one, we murdered this man.

115
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Step two, we ran away. Step three, build a civilization."

116
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 People don't know that's how Egypt started as well. So they begin building these little houses and this town is known as Hanchiville.

117
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And so for the longest time, off of Mystic Drive, you could see these little houses.

118
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And this was the story. If you went to Hanchiville, the little people wouldn't like it.

119
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 They would look at you and go, "Ah, it's another one of those biggins, eh?"

120
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Sally, grab the knife.

121
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And then they would tackle you and chop your legs off.

122
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And then go, "Now you're just like us, young man. Now you're just like us."

123
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And you're like, "No, I'm not. I'm bleeding out. I'm clearly dying."

124
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 But then they would bandage your legs and they would make you live in the city with them.

125
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 City might be a big word. It's just a bunch of huts.

126
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But you would then have to learn to walk on your lumps.

127
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 You luscious lady lumps. You'd have to learn how to be one of the Hanchi citizens.

128
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And that is how they repopulate this society. Also, they're probably pinging each other, right?

129
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 They're having little tiny babies.

130
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So people would not want to go to Hanchiville.

131
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 But at the same time, you're like, "What is this? Is this on a map? I can find..."

132
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 There seem to be talking about this story as if it's incredibly authentic.

133
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Like, should I just avoid Wisconsin altogether? Well, probably.

134
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 But is any of this real, dude? Let me finish. And then we'll decide.

135
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 It'll be like an episode of Beyond Belief.

136
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Later, one day this little albino boy walked into Hanchiville.

137
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 He goes, "They treat me like a freak. Just because my pigmentation is all messed up

138
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 and the citizens of Hanchiville are looking at this kid and they're sharpening their knives."

139
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 "Sling, sling, sling." And then someone goes, "No, wait."

140
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 "Yes, he is one of the biggans. However, he is a freak, like us."

141
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 "Albino boy's like, "What? I didn't think I was a freak!"

142
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 "Oh, I'm so sad. I thought they didn't want to be my friend because I wasn't good at t-ball."

143
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 "No, you're a freak."

144
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 The little people in Hanchiville go, "Tell you what, we will take you in. We will take you into Hanchiville."

145
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 He's like, "I was just going for a walk. I didn't know I was joining a town."

146
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 "Well, you did. We'll make you a citizen of Hanchiville and you'll be one of the good biggans."

147
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So over time, the word spread that Hanchiville became protected by a man known as the Protector.

148
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Kind of a lame name, but he did have a shotgun, so I don't really think you could argue about his lame name.

149
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 So the story was is that if you visited Hanchiville, they chopped off your legs and you had to stay there

150
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 and become a resident of Hanchiville.

151
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Then eventually, they got overpopulation, they needed some border control.

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 They got this albino kid named the Protector and he would stand near Hanchiville with a shotgun to scare off anyone who came by.

153
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Interesting urban legend.

154
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 So don't worry about it. Don't worry about it if you're driving through Wisconsin right now as you're listening to this podcast.

155
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 You're like, "Oh my God, you see a sign that says Mystic Drive?"

156
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 You're like, "Uh."

157
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It also was one of the few urban legends that has a song, has a song attached to it.

158
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 We need more of these.

159
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 We need a lot more of these.

160
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 "Bigfoot's walking through the woods. He's eight feet tall and up to no good."

161
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Stuff like that.

162
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But better, better than that.

163
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Dude, check this out.

164
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 They should be one of these for everything.

165
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Vampires going to suck your blood.

166
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 You know, stuff like that.

167
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 He's so awesome.

168
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 "Bury your body in the mud."

169
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Here's this rhyme.

170
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 "Disrupt our peace."

171
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Well, cut off.

172
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 It's so funny.

173
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 This one cuts to the chase, right?

174
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 This one really just gets going.

175
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 This one gets going because mine took a while.

176
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 You're like, "What's Bigfoot going to do?

177
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 He's mad and he's eight feet tall."

178
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 "Disrupt our peace. We'll cut off your feet."

179
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 It lets you know straight up.

180
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Do not come to their neighborhood.

181
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 I don't even think most rap songs start off that aggressive.

182
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 "Disrupt our peace. We'll cut off your feet to teach you a lesson and remain discreet."

183
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 "Count your blessings should you dodge a kill, but never come back to Haunchyville."

184
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Dude, come on. That's dope.

185
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 That is awesome.

186
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 I love it how they'll cut off your feet to remain discreet.

187
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 They're like, "Why do all these people keep missing whenever they go down Mystic Drive?"

188
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 It's really not discretion when you're constantly mutilating people.

189
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 But is there any truth behind the story of Haunchyville?

190
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 On Reddit I found this guy named W. Jescots.

191
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 He lives in Wisconsin.

192
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 He started going through the book. I think it was Weird Wisconsin or something like that.

193
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 He was going through it entry by entry.

194
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 We always love people like this.

195
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 We were just really exploring the paranormal.

196
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I know a lot of you guys do it as well.

197
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 You get into your car and drive out there.

198
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 He starts going through all the stuff.

199
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I think it was in Weird Wisconsin or Haunted Wisconsin.

200
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 He began asking people in Muskego, "Hey, do you guys know about Haunchyville?"

201
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 They said, "Yeah, we know about Haunchyville. You can see we're scared."

202
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 They go, "No, no, no. It's a Milwaukee thing actually.

203
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 It does take place in this town."

204
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 But in Milwaukee they say that we're so dumb, we're a bunch of bumpkins out here.

205
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 23 minutes away we're the country folk that we probably have a bunch of little people

206
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 running around chopping people's legs off.

207
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 So don't listen to it. It's big city talk.

208
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 But it doesn't stop it from becoming, we talk about this all the time on the show,

209
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 becoming a place to prove your bravery.

210
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 To take your girl and being like, "Hey, Betty, you know what this weekend we're going to do?"

211
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 We're going to get our legs chopped off by a bunch of tiny people.

212
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 "Oh, Billy, you're so brave. You go out there and be like,

213
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 "Dude, I'm not scared of those little dudes. I'm going to go out there.

214
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I'm going to dropkick them. Oh, come on, Tyler."

215
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 You hang out on Mystic Drive. You're looking through the dark and then you go home.

216
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 We all did that in high school and college and stuff like that.

217
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Just a kind of a test of courage.

218
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 So you have a lot of that.

219
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 You actually have so much of that that the police have had to go on the record multiple times.

220
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Say, "Don't." There's nothing out there.

221
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And not only is there nothing out there, we're going to trespass you.

222
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 It's like a $300 ticket.

223
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Because while this used to be an abandoned area,

224
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 they started to have that urban sprawl.

225
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Like we talked about on yesterday's episode,

226
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 they're starting to build a lot of houses out there.

227
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 And we're seeing the entire area where Huntshireville supposedly disappeared.

228
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Matt Wilde of a website called The Milwaukee Record,

229
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 visited the site twice and he gives us a really good idea of the sprawl that's going on.

230
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 When he visited in 2010, because he was exploring this mystery,

231
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 he found the gravel road and sure enough,

232
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 these photos are all over the internet,

233
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 there are photos of tiny houses, tiny little huts out in the forest.

234
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I don't believe these photos are faked by Matt Wilde.

235
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I think they're authentic.

236
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 What the house is though?

237
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Who knows? Was it part of a circus side show?

238
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Was it an old experiment building?

239
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Some construction guy was building a house and he goes,

240
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 "How about I take these leftover materials and make a tiny house?"

241
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 It's just like this old, tiny hut and he goes,

242
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 "They are out there."

243
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 So whether it's like from an abandoned fairground or it used to be a children's playground,

244
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 or a children's fort, who knows?

245
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 But there definitely were tiny houses out there.

246
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Huts out there, probably a better word, a series of huts.

247
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 But in 2010, they were starting to crumble away.

248
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 In 2015, the entire area had been developed.

249
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Houses, normal size houses had been built in the area.

250
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Honsheyville is dead.

251
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 But I'm sure people still go out there.

252
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 They're probably sneaking around people's backyards,

253
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 crawling over fences, trying to find the little people.

254
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And they're just trespassers, just burglars at this point.

255
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Breaking into people's houses.

256
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 They're like, "Maybe they're in the safe.

257
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Maybe the little people are hiding in the safe with all the money and jewels.

258
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 What's the combination?"

259
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 But what I find fascinating about this story,

260
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 other than the fact that it rhymes,

261
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 and we need more paranormal stories that rhyme,

262
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I love the fact that this story connects so...

263
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And I actually don't like these characters in Paranormal Lord,

264
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 but I gotta give credit where credit's due.

265
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 This story connects so closely to the legend of the Fae.

266
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 So, fairies, gnomes, dwarves, stuff like that.

267
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 In the sense that it's an insular community in the wildlands,

268
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 in the forest, that they're tiny, they're tiny people.

269
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And if you interfere with them, you become one of them.

270
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Which is very, very common in Fae folk lore.

271
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 If you go to the middle of the forest and you see a fairy circle, or fairy ring,

272
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 and you go into it, there's a pretty high likelihood you're going to become a fairy,

273
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 or get trapped in the fairy realm.

274
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 So it's just interesting to me how the fables coincide.

275
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 It is quite possible that it is a Milwaukee thing.

276
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 They made up to make fun of the people in this small town.

277
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I know when I moved up to this town, I found out that the town next to me,

278
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 there was an urban legend that they smoked duct tape to get high.

279
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 They're so dumb, they smoked duct tape to get high,

280
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 and you had to be 18 years old to buy duct tape.

281
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And then when I went to that city, I asked, "Hey, is it true you guys smoked duct tape?"

282
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Because I will ask that question.

283
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 And they said, "No! That's doofur."

284
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Doofur is the city farther east than them.

285
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Doofur does it. We don't smoke duct tape. Doofur.

286
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 So that urban legend does continue, it's just a dumber town next to you.

287
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 So it probably is a Milwaukee thing.

288
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I just also find it fascinating that it's so closely related to the Fae folk.

289
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 So it's almost like a grain of truth in it.

290
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And their houses were there. They were these tiny little huts.

291
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 But no one can say when they were built or who built them.

292
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 I think it's possible that at some point there were some people living out there.

293
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It could have been a child's playground or a child's fort and things like that,

294
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 but it's possible that maybe a long time ago there were some people hanging out there.

295
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 By 2010, they were in pretty bad shape. They were crumbling down,

296
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 and now they've been torn down as far as we can tell.

297
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 So there could be a little bit of truth to this legend.

298
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 You don't think they were chopping off people's legs and making them be little people.

299
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 That's a little insane, no pun intended.

300
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 But still be a little cautious when you're driving through Wisconsin.

301
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 You never know what you're going to see.

302
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 You could just be on a trip to Milwaukee.

303
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I don't know why you would ever go to Milwaukee.

304
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Maybe you owe someone money and they're making you pay it in the city that no one wants to go to.

305
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 But you're headed out to Milwaukee and then you see like a little gravel path off the road.

306
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And you go, "Okay, I know this drug dealer. That's my family hostage.

307
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 But let's see what's down this gravel road. It's not going to hurt them to wait another half hour."

308
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 So you turn the car and you're driving down this gravel road.

309
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 You're like, "I really don't want to go to Milwaukee."

310
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 So you're driving down this gravel road and you see an albino with a shotgun.

311
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 You're like, "That's weird."

312
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And you see a little series of houses in the woods.

313
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Would you get out of my car?

314
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Like Jason, just stop. No, I would not get out of my car.

315
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 But would you?

316
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Like would you really? Would you be like, "Hmm, this is interesting.

317
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 A tiny house, a series of tiny houses in the middle of nowhere.

318
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 What's the harm?"

319
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Jason, there's got a shotgun.

320
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 There was an albino with a shotgun.

321
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I just passed him. What do you mean?

322
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 He's standing out there for some certain of the fairies reason.

323
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 And you get out of your car and you see a bunch of little people walking around in the dark.

324
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And I think your first inclination would be like, "These guys are harmless, right?

325
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 They're walking around in three of them."

326
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 They're brandishing knives.

327
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 But look at their clothes. They're wearing homemade clothes.

328
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 They look like tiny Amish people because they can't go to the store

329
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 because there's a bunch of wanted posters for them.

330
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 So you're walking around and you're like, "Hey, dudes, what's up?

331
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 High five!" And they can't jump up.

332
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And then they chop your legs off.

333
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Ah!

334
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 But see, here's my thing. This is where I'm going with this.

335
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I'm dragging out this ending. This is what I would do if I got my legs chopped off in Hunchyville.

336
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I would just become mayor.

337
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 I would be like, "Okay, guys, and one of you now, I have my legs been chopped off.

338
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I'm wearing these shoes on my knees.

339
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And a couple months have gone by, so it doesn't hurt so much to walk around on my bloody stumps.

340
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 But I still got these giant long arms, right?

341
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 They're tiny people. They don't have long arms.

342
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 So I would just take over by a show of force.

343
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And I would be like, "Get out of the way. I'm pushing over the mayor."

344
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And I'm like, "I'm the mayor now. And if you have anything to say about it, let's arm wrestle."

345
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And they're like, "Oh, man, we shouldn't have chopped off these people's legs."

346
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And then I would go, "You know what the problem is with Hunchyville?

347
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 We're not chopping off enough legs."

348
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And they're like, "What? They're having a little meaning in their...

349
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 ...a little voices in that thing."

350
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I go, "We need to expand Hunchyville."

351
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Because look at those houses. They built up over a mystic drive.

352
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 They pushed us out into the woods.

353
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Now, I may not have been born Hunchyville, but I've become Hunchyville.

354
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Hunchyville. Hunchyville. And we're chanting Hunchyville.

355
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Hunchyville. And then we begin to march on the city of Milwaukee.

356
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I don't know why we're zombies all of a sudden.

357
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 That's our battle cry.

358
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I'm leading a charge of little people on the city of Milwaukee.

359
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And we'll just go into the bottom floor of an apartment complex.

360
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 We chop everyone's legs off, and then we ding, take the elevator up.

361
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And then we chop their legs off. And let's say it's like a 10-floor apartment complex.

362
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 By the time we get to the top, we go back down.

363
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 The people at the bottom, we already put shoes on their stumps.

364
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 They're residents of Hunchyville now.

365
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 We've already read them the town charter and be like, "Guys, you're Hunchyville now."

366
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 So let's just continue to move through the city and just make more of us.

367
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 So I would say it would probably take us maybe a couple days to convert Milwaukee into Hunchyville, too.

368
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You're like, "Jason, I don't think you can walk across Milwaukee in that period of time."

369
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Let alone with shoes on your knees.

370
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 But we do it through grit and strength.

371
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And eventually we hoist the Hunchyville flag over Milwaukee.

372
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And we proudly sing our Hunchyville anthem.

373
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And it echoes through the city and everyone's Hunchyville now.

374
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And then as mayor of two towns, really a state at this point.

375
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 I'm standing in front of the Hunchyville flag.

376
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 It's just the symbol of a giant butcher knife.

377
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And I'm standing there very, very proud and I look out onto the landscape of the United States and I go,

378
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 "You're next."

379
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I just realized I hope the FBI is not listening to this episode.

380
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 They're like, "Wait a second. Did you just, in the same episode, did you just say that the Taliban was basically against the pharmaceutical industry?

381
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 The FBI is purposely destroying documents and you want to conquer the United States."

382
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Hypothetically speaking, law enforcement.

383
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I'm standing on the top of the tallest building in Milwaukee.

384
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And I'm standing and I'm looking across the American plains and I go, "You're next. You're next.

385
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 We're going to bring Hunchyvilleism to the rest of the country and then the world."

386
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 They say you don't understand a man until you walk a mile in his shoes.

387
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 But what about walking a mile in his shoes when the shoes are on you?

388
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 When the shoes are on your knees.
