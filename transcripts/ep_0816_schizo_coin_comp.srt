1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 When an obese convict is afraid of catching COVID while he's in prison, is it unfair to

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,600
 keep him in such unsanitary conditions?

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,760
 If you think that's a boring topic, wait till the twist.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,520
 Then we travel to Fleming County, Kentucky to meet a man who lived such a disgusting

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,720
 life he had a disgusting afterlife.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,560
 And finally we take a look at the bizarre conspiracy theory.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:34,200
 I don't even know how to define this, the bizarre notion that schizophrenics have origin

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,080
 stories today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:48,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
 I'm your host Jason Garminer.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,680
 I'm having an okay day, but I hope you're having a good day.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,520
 I'm having a bit of back spasms, but you know what are you gonna do, right?

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,640
 I got some western medicine, muscle relaxers, and a podcast to do, so I'm gonna sit in this

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,960
 totally uncomfortable chair for an hour telling my best friends about ghosts.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,160
 Cause that is the fun part.

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,560
 The pain is not, but someone who never gives me pain walking into Dead Rabbit Command right

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,840
 now gives it up for one of our livestream supporters.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,840
 It's Creole Cosmopolitan.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,560
 Everyone give Creole a big round of applause.

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,480
 Creole, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,120
 And if you guys can't support the Patreon or support the livestreams or anything like

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,600
 that, I totally get it.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,040
 Just helps rid the word about the show.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,400
 That really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,800
 Creole, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,600
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,720
 We are headed all the way out to Virginia.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,920
 We're driving and seeing like ducks flying by and there's trees, there's boats.

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,040
 Some of this has been a horrible hurricane.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,600
 All of this is landlocked.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,120
 We're seeing, we're traveling through the beautiful countryside of Virginia.

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,920
 We're like waving hello to like George Washington's ghost.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,760
 And as we're doing all that stuff, you're like, oh, what, what story is gonna take place

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
 here?

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
 Look at these lush places.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
 Is this a haunted forest?

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
 I'm like, no, keep driving.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,840
 And then we drive past this spooky swamp and you're like, oh, is this gonna be about some

39
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
 swamp which?

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,480
 No, keep driving.

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,520
 Eventually, as we continue through Virginia, you realize we're headed to a federal penitentiary.

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,880
 So we pull up to this bleak penitentiary.

43
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,960
 We're missing all the swamps and George Washington ghost is super sad.

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,120
 But we're walking in and we're getting like, dooo, like metal detectors on us.

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
 They're not supposed to make that noise.

46
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,520
 If they're making that noise, you're hiding metal.

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,480
 But eventually we are ushered in and we meet this man named Jeffrey Portway.

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,880
 He's a 47 year old man.

49
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,160
 He is very obese.

50
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 Now I'm overweight.

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,400
 I'm technically, legally medically I'm obese.

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,920
 But he is one of those guys that when you, when they have the mug shot, you like the

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,600
 mug shot for the, you know, so the cops, if they ever catch him again, they go, aha,

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,120
 this is what that guy looks like.

55
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,040
 His head is like bigger than the picture.

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
 Like his cheeks go out to the side of the photo.

57
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,440
 I'll put a photo in the show notes.

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,520
 You can, Jason, this is very uncharacteristic of you.

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,680
 You never make fun of people's physical appearances.

60
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,120
 I did say that once a school shooter looked like the music next to him come to life.

61
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
 I did say that.

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,200
 But you're like, Jason, man, you're really like going to the paint on this dude.

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,360
 Like that's weird.

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
 You normally don't comment on people's looks.

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,480
 Well, let's get, let's get to know Jeffrey a little bit more because maybe, maybe you're

66
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
 right.

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,680
 So Jeffrey Portway, Jeffrey Portway, the man who's bigger than the police mug shot, he's

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,160
 in prison and he's actually trying to get out right now cause he's afraid of catching

69
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,240
 COVID and that would suck.

70
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,840
 I remember in the early days of the pandemic, I was thinking like your brains run through

71
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
 all these simulations.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,960
 Could you imagine being stuck in a prison when this disease is flowing around?

73
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,280
 No one knew anything about it.

74
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,520
 No one knew how you got it.

75
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
 It was awful.

76
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,760
 Well, he's stuck in prison and he does have these risk factors, right?

77
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,200
 Being a man is a risk factor, being obese is a risk factor, being bigger than a camera

78
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,520
 can take your picture is definitely a risk factor.

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,000
 I'm pretty sure Fauci's mentioned that specifically once or twice.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,200
 So, and so I'm, you know, obviously I'm careful about it because I do have my co-morbidities

81
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
 as well.

82
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,080
 And so this guy, he's stuck in prison.

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
 So he's afraid of getting COVID in prison.

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,160
 So he actually is asking the judge to let him out.

85
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,560
 And this is something that happens.

86
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,960
 It's called compassionate release.

87
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,360
 And one might have been record turnaround time.

88
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,160
 I'm sure that this guy walked into the, they probably actually were still doing it.

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,400
 They were still doing everything video conferencing at this point.

90
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:29,520
 The judge, I'm sure just opened his file, glanced down at it, closed it and said, "No.

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,120
 I don't care how fat you are.

92
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
 I don't care how deadly COVID is.

93
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,080
 There's no way we're letting you out."

94
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
 I find this story so interesting.

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,560
 It's fairly short.

96
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,160
 But the fact that this guy thought for one second that his fear of COVID would allow

97
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,440
 him to walk the streets again.

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
 This is how he, this is what he's in prison for.

99
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,920
 In Warchester, Massachusetts in 2012, Jeffrey is sitting at home and the cops kick in his

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,800
 door and they tackle him.

101
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 I don't know if they tackled him.

102
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
 I hope they did.

103
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 Even if he surrendered.

104
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,520
 I hope they kicked him in the ribs a couple of times because what they found in his house

105
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
 was a basement.

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
 I'm chasing up a basement.

107
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,440
 I don't want the cops kicking in my ribs.

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
 Hold on.

109
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,120
 In his basement was a series of locked doors.

110
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,400
 So there's a bunch of locked doors leading to this hidden room and inside this hidden

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,840
 room they found, actually I'm saying a hidden room.

112
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,160
 That is the truth.

113
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,840
 I'm leaving out three other adjectives.

114
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,280
 The news article described, I would be a great defense lawyer.

115
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,120
 I'm saying it's a hidden room.

116
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,520
 It was described in the newspaper article and in police documents as a soundproofed dungeon.

117
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,320
 I'll tell you this right now.

118
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,280
 He was not able to carry out any of his plans as far as we know.

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,680
 But in the soundproofed dungeon was a chair, a television.

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
 You're like that.

121
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
 It's just this gaming room.

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,920
 And he wants to be able to play Halo super loud.

123
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:06,880
 A chair, a television, castration tools.

124
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,920
 I paused there for all of my listeners.

125
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,080
 You're like, nope.

126
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
 Not this again.

127
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,640
 I'm giving you enough time now to shut off the podcast.

128
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:23,840
 Castration tools and a child-sized homemade coffin.

129
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,880
 He did not do anything to any kid.

130
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,920
 I will let you guys know that now.

131
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,560
 Everything else we're going to talk about will be briefly over in about 45 seconds.

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,040
 He went by the online alias Fat Long Pig.

133
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,800
 Long Pig is a cannibal term.

134
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
 Long Pig means human.

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,000
 When you have to describe yourself, you use the word fat and pig at the same time.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,200
 I'm allowed to say your face won't fit in a photo.

137
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,120
 He would talk online about wanting to kidnap children and eat them.

138
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,160
 And he had all of these plans to do it.

139
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,040
 And he was talking to all these other sickos that wanted to eat kids.

140
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,480
 See, this shocks me.

141
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,280
 I get that people do this.

142
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,040
 But the fact that there's thriving online communities.

143
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,040
 Like if someone goes, how many people out there do you think want to eat kids?

144
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,680
 And I'm like, well, excluding witches from Hansel and Gretel and excluding like Albert

145
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,200
 Fish the occasional serial killer at any given time.

146
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,720
 I don't know, maybe worldwide.

147
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,200
 Like I can't say worldwide.

148
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,520
 I'd say in America at any given time, there's probably five to 10 people who want to eat

149
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
 kids.

150
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,160
 But apparently that's really low balling it because they have these internet communities.

151
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,200
 They caught him with all sorts of horrible graphic images.

152
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:40,840
 A whole collection of them and most alarming photos of children who are still alive.

153
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,520
 Their names and these are like photos he took apparently.

154
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,480
 These were photos of kids he knew in the area.

155
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,960
 And he would talk to people online about eating those kids.

156
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,680
 So I actually have a really good idea.

157
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,400
 We should just pump COVID into this dude's cell.

158
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,120
 And you know what's shocking too?

159
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,360
 So he didn't really commit any crimes against kids.

160
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,320
 He had all these graphic images, horrible, horrible graphic images.

161
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,720
 I don't even want to describe them.

162
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,040
 And all of this planning and preparation, he only got 27 years.

163
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,440
 I'm not a big thing about convicting people for thought crime.

164
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,520
 That's not a thought crime though.

165
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,040
 I mean, there's one person, one thing for someone to go, I really hate the government.

166
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,280
 I want to blow it up and start reading books about that.

167
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,680
 I don't think that should be an arrestable offense.

168
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,400
 They started building coffins for world leaders at that point.

169
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,800
 And if he happened to live in Washington, DC, if there was a basement in the Capitol building

170
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,280
 that he had built, at a certain point it stops becoming like a thought crime and it starts

171
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,000
 to become a real crime.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,840
 Plus he had all the horrible images, those are real crime, only 27 years.

173
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,440
 So that means if you're born today, when you're 27 years old, this guy will be out.

174
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,560
 I'm sure there's a better way to tell time.

175
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,840
 I'm sure there's a better way.

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
 They're like, "Hey, when's lunch?"

177
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,800
 And I go, "Well, if you were born today, you'd be 10 hours old by the time lunch is ready."

178
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,960
 But yeah, that doesn't seem like a lot at all.

179
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,240
 You have these other people that are getting these huge, for dealing drugs, right?

180
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,800
 For dealing weed and stuff like that.

181
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,960
 And then this sicko who had a child-sized coffin in castration tools.

182
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
 This is one of the things I'm going to say.

183
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,920
 I got all the links to the show notes, like the articles.

184
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,160
 Just trust me.

185
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
 Just trust me why I'm leaving stuff out.

186
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,320
 Because even like the mainstream article I was looking at, they went into some dark

187
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,800
 details about it.

188
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
 So boo you.

189
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,720
 I think the worst you get from me, Jeffrey, and I think we should just pump straight up

190
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,200
 COVID into his cell.

191
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
 That's gross.

192
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,080
 Put him in a child-sized coffin.

193
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,880
 Okay, so Creole Cosmopolitan.

194
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,520
 We've become blood-soaked vigilantes.

195
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,040
 Creole Cosmopolitan, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

196
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,760
 We are leaving behind this prison in Virginia.

197
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,600
 We're headed all the way out to Fleming County, Kentucky.

198
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,280
 This story was sent to me by Bigfoot expert Bennett.

199
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,880
 He's actually a longtime supporter of the show, a longtime listener of the show.

200
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,200
 And a long time ago he took it upon himself to send me a listing of every-- actually,

201
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
 no, no, I don't want to give it away.

202
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,120
 I don't want to give it away.

203
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,760
 But Bennett, you do get credit for this story.

204
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,800
 He'll be like, "What are you talking about?"

205
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,440
 He already shut it off after I mentioned castration tools.

206
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,840
 He's like, "Nope.

207
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,600
 There's this town of Muse Mills, and that's in Fleming County, Kentucky.

208
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,480
 We're specifically in Muse Mills.

209
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
 This was a long time ago.

210
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,320
 We're back in the year 1894.

211
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,200
 So put on your old-timey clothes.

212
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,840
 Walk with me through the town of Muse Mills.

213
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,560
 Back in 1894, there was a local doctor named Dr. Dyer.

214
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,840
 And he-- well, let's put doctor in air quotes, because he was what we called a root and herb

215
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
 doctor.

216
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,880
 I don't know if he actually had a doctorate in anything, but he definitely like-- people

217
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,680
 would come in and be like, "Oh, I have the gout."

218
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,120
 And he's like, "Chew this herb."

219
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
 And someone else was like, "Ugh.

220
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
 I have a stomach ache.

221
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
 I visited you last week.

222
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
 He gave me a bunch of roots."

223
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,640
 He's like, "Oh, I have the perfect cure for you.

224
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
 More roots.

225
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
 Arrgh."

226
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
 He was one of those guys, right?

227
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,520
 Now we call him homeopathic.

228
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,360
 But back then, Dr. C.H. Dyer was his name.

229
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,960
 He was pretty well known in town.

230
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,520
 He was a root and herb doctor.

231
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,800
 He's passing all that stuff out.

232
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,560
 But eventually, like all men do, he dies, right?

233
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,520
 He was trying to eat as many roots as he could before he died.

234
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,880
 He's like, "Maybe one of these will make me immortal."

235
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,400
 He choked to death on herbs.

236
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,400
 He dies and they bury him, as is the custom, since pretty much the beginning of time.

237
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,640
 A couple weeks go by.

238
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,760
 People would hear dogs off in the distance running around town.

239
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,040
 They're like, "What is it?"

240
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,720
 Now back in 1894, dogs showing up in your town, that was a bad thing.

241
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 Right?

242
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,480
 A bunch of wild dogs could really destroy the local economy.

243
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,880
 They could probably just destroy the locals.

244
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,560
 But these dogs, this pack of wild dogs wasn't running into town.

245
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,520
 It was running into the graveyard and kept trying to dig up Dr. Dyer's body.

246
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
 "Get out of here!

247
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
 Shoo, shoo!

248
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
 Go away, dogs!

249
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,800
 Go find some other city to ruin."

250
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
 [Dogs barking]

251
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,120
 Dogs were right on.

252
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,440
 But then they'd come back and they'd be digging out his grave and they'd be howling.

253
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
 "Hoo!

254
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
 Hoo!

255
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 Hoo!

256
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
 Hoo!"

257
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
 And they'd get out of here, get out of here, chasing him away with a broom.

258
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,680
 They'd get him away with a shotgun, full of buckshot.

259
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,640
 But anyways, these dogs keep running away.

260
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,880
 This happens over and over and over again.

261
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,440
 Now, townspeople are starting to get curious.

262
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,280
 Why are they so attracted to the grave of Dr. Dyer?

263
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,400
 So there's not much to do in 1894, right?

264
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,780
 So they're gonna have a good old body-exhuming party.

265
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,680
 So they dig the body up, they exhume the body, and when they open the coffin up, they're

266
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,040
 expecting to see the body of Dr. Dyer.

267
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:49,640
 Instead, they are greeted with the body, the corpse, of a 200-pound dead hog in his coffin.

268
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
 Now they're like, "What is he saying?

269
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,140
 Is he underneath the hog?"

270
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,680
 Dr. Dyer is not in the coffin.

271
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,240
 He didn't shrink down.

272
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,200
 He didn't crawl out, presumably, because there's been no zombie attacks.

273
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,120
 All they know is that when they dug up the body of Dr. Dyer, in its place was a 200-pound

274
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,680
 dead hog.

275
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:14,080
 Now this was reported in a newspaper, but to be fair, this also is a newspaper from 1894.

276
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,840
 And older newspapers did have a habit of making stuff up, like stuff out of whole cloth.

277
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,280
 Stories about giants, stories about corpses turning into pigs.

278
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,480
 But what's interesting about this is the friends and the townspeople came to the conclusion

279
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,880
 that Dr. Dyer was not a good person in life.

280
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,600
 Sure, he was pretty good doling out the roots and the herbs, but morally, he could have been

281
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
 better.

282
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:48,280
 What their hypothesis is, is that when he died, God turned him into what his soul actually

283
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,960
 was reflective of.

284
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,040
 God turned him into a big, stinky, bloated pig.

285
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,800
 And I find this very fascinating.

286
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,560
 Of course, it is most likely not true.

287
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
 An urban legend.

288
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,040
 Or, actually, let me back up.

289
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,840
 The event itself could have happened.

290
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,840
 Someone could have stolen his body and put a pig in there for some reason.

291
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,160
 It's possible that the event never happened, that he faked his death.

292
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,840
 There's all sorts of stuff, but the people in town didn't think of any of that stuff.

293
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,320
 They came to the conclusion that he was a pig in life and God turned him to a pig in

294
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
 death.

295
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,840
 And I read that and I go, "Well, there's a lot of people who could probably be turned

296
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,160
 into disgusting creatures after they died."

297
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,200
 And everyone stumbles, right?

298
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,080
 Everyone stumbles and slips and sins in different ways.

299
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,440
 But then there are certain people, Jeff Portway, who are just overly disgusting and really

300
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
 shouldn't be part of the human race.

301
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,200
 And you think, "Well," and I read the story and I go, "Well, I mean, there's a lot of

302
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,280
 people you could probably turn into pigs after they died because there's a lot of people

303
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,760
 who are morally disgusting."

304
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,040
 And then I thought, "What if this is true?"

305
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,440
 Let's put our conspiracy caps on here for a second because what we have here is we had

306
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,920
 a man who was buried and turned into a pig.

307
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,200
 And, oh, and Bennett's been sending me stories about pig people from every state in the United

308
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
 States.

309
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
 That's how I came across this one.

310
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,760
 Imagine if, the only reason we found out about this, right, was because the guy was

311
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,400
 buried and then the dogs were trying to dig the body up.

312
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,280
 If the dogs weren't trying to dig the body up, let's say the body was buried deeper,

313
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,960
 the body was buried in a place not around roving packs of wild animals, they never

314
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,320
 would have known there was a pig in there.

315
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,480
 How many bodies get exhumed annually in the United States?

316
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,000
 I'm not going to finish this podcast until you send me the answer.

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,160
 I'm just going to be completely silent.

318
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,520
 How many people are exhumed in the United States at any given time?

319
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,920
 I doubt it's a lot.

320
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,040
 So maybe, conspiracy cap fully on.

321
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,920
 What if, if you did a mass up digging of all the people?

322
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,120
 This is, this is, this is our homework project.

323
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,320
 What if you found out that one to two percent of all bodies in coffins were pigs?

324
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,320
 You know, Jason, please don't, please don't take muscle relaxers.

325
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,080
 Please don't take muscle relaxers before you record a podcast again, dude.

326
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,480
 I'm sorry that your back hurts, but that might be the dumbest thing.

327
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,000
 I'm saying like, what if the sample group was this dude and you would go, oh no, it's

328
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,960
 probably just, it's probably just this guy who was gross enough to become a pig, but

329
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,600
 what if we did start digging up graves?

330
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,800
 We could start with graves of gross people, right?

331
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,880
 We could go find people who actually did horrible things.

332
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,360
 We wouldn't be digging up like people's grandmothers and stuff.

333
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,840
 We're like, it's for science.

334
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,400
 You're like crying, no grandma, no.

335
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,320
 We go and we find people who are really disgusting people and dig them up.

336
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,200
 Maybe go to like a prison, a prison graveyard and just start digging up all the bodies and

337
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,800
 then we have a bunch of zombie prisoners running around.

338
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,560
 Oh no, the prophecy came true.

339
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,800
 No, imagine you went to a prison graveyard and you dug up a hundred bodies and two of

340
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,360
 them were pigs.

341
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,920
 This is an interesting thing for a skeptic, right?

342
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,720
 Because a skeptic would go, well, I don't know, maybe people just buried pigs there

343
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
 too.

344
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,880
 You'd have digging up bodies all over the United States and you found out that one

345
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,800
 to two percent of all the corpses in the United States were pigs.

346
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,560
 Like what would that do to society?

347
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,920
 Would people start acting better?

348
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,080
 Or would people stop eating pigs?

349
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,720
 Would people stop eating pork?

350
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,360
 Because you want to know, what if a guy almost dies and he turns into a pig and then he comes

351
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
 out of his coma?

352
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
 He's like, oh no.

353
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,400
 And then he runs and he's like having a bunch of pig babies and stuff like that.

354
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
 Who knows?

355
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,680
 The story's most likely favorite.

356
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,600
 It's most likely completely made up.

357
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,000
 I'd be shocked if Dr. Dyer even existed.

358
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,440
 But there's a chance that it did happen and it's a chance that someone stole his body

359
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,720
 for medical purposes.

360
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,440
 Back in 1894, there were body robbers and they threw a pig in there and then they almost

361
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,680
 got found out.

362
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,840
 But it's also possible that because he was such a horrible person in life, God turned

363
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,440
 his body into a pig.

364
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,240
 And again, Jason would say that.

365
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,280
 That's the most insane thing you've ever said.

366
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,360
 So anyways, I think we should start to go fund me.

367
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,400
 We should start to go fund me.

368
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,820
 Exhum America's corpses.

369
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,560
 Some of them may be pigs.

370
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,240
 And it would prove religion overnight, right?

371
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,520
 Maybe that's the big conspiracy.

372
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,000
 Maybe that's why they want to stop.

373
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,560
 If this go fund me does not raise $10,000, the powers that be are trying to silence us.

374
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,080
 And I don't want you guys to donate to it.

375
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,640
 Don't waste your money on it.

376
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,960
 And some other people to waste their money on it.

377
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,280
 Creole Cosmopolitan, let's leave behind this freshly exhumed graveyard.

378
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:51,920
 We are headed all the way out to Louisiana.

379
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,360
 How would you like to be featured on an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio?

380
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,560
 Here's how.

381
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,400
 All you need to do is record yourself chanting "Earth First, Earth First" and send it to

382
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,120
 me at DeadRabbitRadio.com.

383
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,880
 We're doing a remix of the Dead Rabbit Radio classic episode, Earth First.

384
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,280
 And I want all of the voices of the fluffle to be a part of it.

385
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,960
 So please record yourself chanting "Earth First" and email it to DeadRabbitRadio.com.

386
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,600
 The deadline is February 14th, 2022.

387
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,080
 In your email, tell me that I have the permission to use your voice.

388
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,120
 And together we will rise up and fight the Martian menace.

389
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,520
 Earth First!

390
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,640
 We're in Louisiana and there's this little gas station on the side of the road.

391
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,320
 We're just kind of sitting there eating some Wetchamacallit.

392
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:42,000
 And I found this story online and it opened up a really weird can of worms.

393
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,480
 It was originally posted by this guy called Gormless Schnitzel.

394
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,720
 So thanks for posting this.

395
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,520
 And Gormless is telling us about his uncle.

396
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,360
 His uncle has schizophrenia and it sucks.

397
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,160
 You know, it's one of those things like he has it and then the rest of the family has

398
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,120
 to navigate this pathway and you're just constantly worried and you know sometimes they're not

399
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,120
 taking their medication and things get worse and then they take their medication and they

400
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,920
 feel better so they stop taking their medication.

401
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,160
 It's this whole really brutal struggle when you're dealing with a mental illness that

402
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,440
 strong.

403
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,640
 So Gormless's uncle, we're going to call Uncle Joe.

404
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,760
 Uncle Joe deals with schizophrenia.

405
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,160
 He knows he has schizophrenia but one day he's sitting there and he tells a little gourmet,

406
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,360
 have I ever told you my schizophrenia origin story?

407
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,680
 Have I ever told you how I got schizophrenia?

408
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,520
 And the nephew, the nephew's like what?

409
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,760
 I didn't know that this, I thought it was just something that you had.

410
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,160
 Isn't schizophrenia something you're born with that develops over time?

411
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,840
 Oh no, no, young and that's what they want you to think.

412
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:53,280
 But really, my schizophrenia, I remember I caught it on a warm summer day and the nephew's

413
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,600
 like what are you talking about?

414
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,800
 Are you actually doing a flashback right now?

415
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,360
 Uncle Joe, before he was Uncle Joe, he was just Joe and he was hitchhiking through Louisiana.

416
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,440
 This is what he did for fun.

417
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,280
 This was back in like the 70s, the 80s when you could stick your thumb out and not worry

418
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,520
 about getting picked up by a serial killer and he would hitchhike through whole states,

419
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
 right?

420
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
 He's not even from Louisiana.

421
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,400
 He's just making his way around the east coast and the south and all this stuff.

422
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,160
 He's walking down the street, he's getting ready to hitchhike, but he sees a gas station

423
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,080
 off in the distance and he goes oh, maybe I'll get a couple of snacks as I go on my

424
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,480
 journey hopping into strangers' cars.

425
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,640
 So he walks in, he goes in the gas station to get a drink and as he's walking in there's

426
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,880
 a man outside and he stops Joe.

427
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,960
 And Joe gets a sense that this guy seems a little shady.

428
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
 Is he a drug dealer?

429
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
 Is he just some bum?

430
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,680
 I don't know, but Joe gets a weird feeling from this guy and Joe goes I'm looking at

431
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,960
 this man and he literally, when I say he's shady, that's almost literally because he

432
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,080
 was, had this dark hue to him.

433
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,560
 It just seemed like he was half shadow.

434
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,400
 Something wasn't right about this person.

435
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,320
 The sun is out, it's bright, but this guy is enveloped in shadows and he looks to Joe

436
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,840
 and he hands Joe this really old weird looking coin and he puts it in Joe's hands and he

437
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,200
 says quote.

438
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,520
 As long as you hold onto this coin, good luck will always be yours.

439
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:29,720
 But if you lose it or throw it away, terrible things will happen to you and your life will

440
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,720
 fall apart.

441
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,560
 Joe, has this been handed this coin that may be a blessing, may be a curse or both?

442
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,920
 Joe doesn't really think much of it, he thinks.

443
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,800
 And he said he walked into the gas station, he bought a soda and a dollar scratch off

444
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
 ticket.

445
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,000
 That's weird.

446
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,080
 He actually won $250 on this lotto ticket that he just bought.

447
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,160
 He totally freaks out in a good way and in a bad way.

448
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,760
 He is a very religious dude, he's a very devout born again Christian so when he's looking

449
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,040
 at this coin and he realizes what just happened, he thinks that the devil is who stopped him

450
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,720
 outside of the gas station.

451
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,080
 So he runs out of the gas station and the man is gone.

452
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,400
 He's all looking wherever there's shadows, he's gone.

453
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,760
 Because he wanted to give the coin back to this man.

454
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
 He didn't want this power.

455
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
 Because this has to be demonic.

456
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,320
 Looking at this coin and it looks ancient, it doesn't look right.

457
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,740
 So his rationale after using this coin and winning this $250 lottery ticket and being

458
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,640
 warned if you lose it or throw it away terrible things will happen.

459
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,320
 He takes that coin and he throws it into a swamp which was right next to the gas station

460
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,920
 because we're in Louisiana.

461
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:56,400
 And the coin sinks into the murky water below and he hitchhikes his way back home and tries

462
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,280
 to put the encounter behind him.

463
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,360
 But that was the day his schizophrenia began.

464
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,780
 Super interesting story and it's bizarre on so many levels and we're not even done yet.

465
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,500
 This story is not alone.

466
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,660
 It's an interesting story on so many levels.

467
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,380
 On one schizophrenia you may have events that spark it.

468
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,260
 I know sometimes like marijuana if you're predisposed to schizophrenia.

469
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,460
 I'm sure the science is mixed on this but I've seen this in quite a few articles.

470
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:33,100
 If you're predisposed to schizophrenia, smoking weed can actually trigger it.

471
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,360
 You can have that instant thing.

472
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,040
 I don't know about schizophrenia all over.

473
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,440
 I assumed that it was a slow buildup.

474
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,160
 You have it and then you start to have symptoms maybe in your early 20s or early 30s.

475
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,200
 But I don't think the doctor can be like February 2nd.

476
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,600
 That was the day you got schizophrenia.

477
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,200
 If you had come in a couple days earlier we might have been able to get you treated.

478
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,280
 But I think it's an ongoing thing.

479
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,800
 I don't think it's the same thing.

480
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,780
 I don't know actually if you could specify a day.

481
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,620
 But Gorn List puts in their post.

482
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,740
 They said he's schizophrenical schizophrenic.

483
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,740
 We know he's schizophrenic.

484
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,340
 He's been diagnosed as schizophrenic.

485
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,740
 So did this event even happen?

486
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,620
 Any of this happen?

487
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,340
 Is he making it completely up or was it kind of true?

488
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,540
 Someone gave him a quarter and he walked in and maybe won $250 on a lottery ticket that

489
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:33,960
 day and he backtracked and kind of remembered the story wrong through a schizophrenia filter.

490
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,760
 Is that possible?

491
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,480
 Or in the world of the paranormal, right?

492
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
 In the world of the paranormal we talk about this.

493
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
 Was this a trigger?

494
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,800
 Now it seems very insensitive to say that.

495
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,800
 I know schizophrenia is a disease and I'm not trying to say that anyone has schizophrenia

496
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,200
 is cursed by an evil hobo wizard from a gas station.

497
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
 But it's interesting.

498
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,580
 In his mind that's what happened.

499
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,940
 He was totally normal until he threw that coin into the swamp.

500
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,660
 And if that story was in and of itself presented to me, I would still find it completely fascinating

501
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,260
 the way the human brain works.

502
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,020
 So would have covered it on Dead Rabbit Radio.

503
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:18,620
 But as I was looking through the replies to this post, Uncle Joe is not alone.

504
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,420
 There were so many examples of this I can only pick out.

505
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,340
 I hate to say the best ones because this is about human suffering.

506
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,460
 But you had other people.

507
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,120
 This one guy says, "Hey, my cousin has schizophrenia."

508
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,880
 And before he really started exhibiting symptoms.

509
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,860
 But again, because you have that long build up, you may not know it.

510
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,200
 He was super into demons.

511
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,600
 He was super into black magic.

512
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,960
 He was really about exploring this world.

513
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,440
 Now a lot of us, right, we're paranormal researchers.

514
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,760
 We do discuss demonology and we do explore that stuff.

515
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,460
 But then there are people who are like, "Get out of the way, ghosts.

516
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,460
 Get out of the way, UFOs.

517
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,100
 I just want the demons because I want to have their power."

518
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,420
 They're basically the demonic power versus the us being curious, trying to figure out

519
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,780
 how all this stuff works.

520
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,980
 And that was this dude's cousin.

521
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,060
 He was into demons and black magic.

522
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,260
 And there was a graveyard next to this guy's house.

523
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,140
 And one day he's like, "I'm going to go out and I'm going to lay on the grave, a freshly

524
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
 dug grave."

525
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
 There's a pig.

526
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,140
 There's a pig in there.

527
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,140
 Hee hee hee.

528
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,900
 I'm going to go lay on a freshly dug grave.

529
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,860
 I'm going to sleep on that grave overnight and I'm going to get the souls and get the

530
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,360
 knowledge and the demonic power.

531
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,560
 I probably just pervert want to lay naked in the graveyard.

532
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:33,260
 Anyways, the next morning he woke up and that is his schizophrenia origin story.

533
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,040
 He told his cousin, "Yeah, I did that.

534
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,320
 I laid naked on the grave and that's how I got schizophrenia."

535
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,440
 The cousin was like, "That's not how it works.

536
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,760
 That's not how it works."

537
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,520
 Here's this other story about a young woman who her best friend was a witch, a witch in

538
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,640
 high school.

539
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,640
 And the witch cut this young woman's hair and dyed it and they hung out.

540
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,040
 But after a year, the witch stopped hanging out with this young woman.

541
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:05,200
 But the young woman over time began to hear the witch's voice in her head.

542
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,860
 And that's how she got schizophrenia.

543
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,800
 She believes by being in such close contact with this magic user, gave her schizophrenia.

544
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,680
 And what gave her schizophrenia and the voices in her head are of this witch.

545
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,560
 Again, that's an interesting, is that story real?

546
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,400
 Like did she actually go over to this girl's house every day for a year after school and

547
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,720
 she got her hair cut and her hair dyed?

548
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,680
 Like what part, that to me sounds even more fake because who wants to go hang out with

549
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,120
 the witch every single day?

550
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:38,040
 And the fact that the witch's voice was the voice in her head, I find so weird.

551
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,520
 But to her, that's when it started.

552
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,640
 She was completely normal, had a perfectly normal life until she visited that person.

553
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,640
 You had one where a guy just ate some bubble gum.

554
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,400
 That was offered to him.

555
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,880
 It wasn't just, it wasn't just his friend at work.

556
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,520
 This was like a really rural area.

557
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,120
 They said, yeah, there was this witch doctor farmer.

558
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,960
 There a witch doctor and a farmer.

559
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,640
 And one day they offered this guy some gum.

560
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
 Hey, you want some gum?

561
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
 Yeah, sure.

562
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,160
 Gave him schizophrenia.

563
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,200
 And again, this was like maybe two days of posts.

564
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,960
 If you could get, whenever you look at something that has this many diverse responses in such

565
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,960
 a short amount of time, it really makes you think this must be so common.

566
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,760
 I'm wondering if this is the norm.

567
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:30,440
 I'm wondering if most people who have schizophrenia, if you sat down and asked them, how did you

568
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
 get it?

569
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,440
 I mean, that might be seen for insensitive.

570
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,080
 But I bet you they do have origin stories.

571
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,000
 And it's weird because the mind is going haywire.

572
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,520
 And the mind has to figure out why is the brain working like this all of a sudden.

573
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,920
 So you have to think, are these stories completely made up?

574
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,920
 Did this person never walk into the gas station, never given a coin?

575
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,240
 And none of it happened.

576
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,360
 Or is it taking elements of something that really happened on a monumental day for his

577
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,000
 mental health, but it wasn't magic based?

578
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,160
 And then you have to look at the paranormal answer that maybe it was magic based.

579
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,280
 And then you look at the answer that this might have been the first one that it was

580
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,440
 all made up in the first place.

581
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,520
 So this never happened at all.

582
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
 Fascinating story.

583
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,000
 And it's creepy because all of these scenarios we could find ourselves in.

584
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,160
 Maybe not sleeping naked in the graveyard, but being into a paranormal stuff, being into

585
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,840
 demonology and things like that.

586
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,520
 My dad used to be a Southern Baptist minister and he would tell us, you know, because you

587
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,000
 have to study demonology, you had to study all this stuff to be a minister, to be ordained

588
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,520
 a Southern Baptist minister.

589
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
 That's actually not true.

590
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,400
 You can be ordained as a Southern Baptist minister by your local church, but he was going

591
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,000
 for like his master's or his doctorate or something like that.

592
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,200
 So he was going to seminary and all this stuff.

593
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,960
 And they did study demonology at the seminary.

594
00:30:49,960 --> 00:31:01,000
 And he said, maybe once, twice a year, you'd have this young minister get to into the demonology.

595
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,120
 And saying beware how long you stare into the abyss because eventually the abyss stares

596
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,480
 back or beware those who hunt monsters do not become monsters themselves.

597
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,840
 That's basically the college's motto.

598
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,400
 That was a thing that they would have to look out for.

599
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,240
 Every year you'd get one or two of these young men who got a little too into the demonology

600
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,080
 part of the religious thing.

601
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,720
 I mean, it is more exciting than reading the book of Job for the 15th time.

602
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,320
 But yeah, and they had a system set up for that.

603
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,260
 Like you would have to be like, okay, you know, Johnny's been reading those demonology

604
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,260
 books a little too much.

605
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,400
 Let's have a counseling session for him.

606
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
 Fascinating.

607
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,840
 So you do have to wonder like people who do get too far into the demonology stuff, can

608
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:53,720
 it trigger a mental illness, preexisting conditions coming forward because you're basically on

609
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,240
 the verge of breaking your brain with all of this infernal knowledge.

610
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,600
 I mean, really this stuff could happen to any of us.

611
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,680
 Someone offering you a, I would totally take a coin.

612
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,480
 If someone had started holding a coinette to me before they even talked about blessings

613
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,720
 and curses, I'm like, cool, a coin?

614
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,280
 Like all of this stuff, letting some chick cut my hair and dye it.

615
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
 Yeah, totally dude.

616
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,400
 Again, I wouldn't sleep naked on a graveyard, but I do spend a lot of my time researching

617
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,680
 very, very dark topics and I've spent a countless hours investigating demonology.

618
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,740
 So yeah, it's spooky.

619
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,520
 This is the type of stuff that can happen to any of us.

620
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,800
 Now, do I honestly think that schizophrenia can, well, let me back up here.

621
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,320
 I mean, schizophrenia is a real disease and I think that people who suffer from it need

622
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,280
 to be treated and I'm not trying to make light of it or just go to your health counselor

623
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,600
 or stuff like that or just burn some sage, eat some roots and herbs and it'll go away.

624
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,920
 I definitely think it's something you have to be taken care of, but from a paranormal

625
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:53,360
 angle, it would be very, very, very disturbing to think that at any point you could be cursed

626
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,920
 with schizophrenia.

627
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,460
 You could be walking down the street and you see a coin on the ground and you like picking

628
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,260
 coins up on the ground and you bend over and you pick it up.

629
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,860
 You didn't know that was a cursed coin.

630
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,580
 You didn't know that the previous person just threw it out of their car.

631
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,460
 Now you have this coin, you know none of the powers of it, but you notice you have a luckier

632
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,460
 day than normal.

633
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,100
 You don't connect it to the coin and then eventually the coin's just floating around

634
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,580
 in your pocket and it's floating around in orbs and you're all around it, but you can't

635
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
 see it, it's in your pocket.

636
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,980
 It's like shooting out electrical beams and you end up throwing that coin into a vending

637
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
 machine to bind yourself with soda.

638
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,280
 What a great way to end the day.

639
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,600
 You had a very, very lucky day and now you get your favorite soda.

640
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,840
 It was actually just the right temperature, but later that night you have a hard time

641
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,040
 falling asleep.

642
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,000
 Start to see flashes behind closed eyelids.

643
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,640
 Memories resurfacing that you don't remember this stuff, but they're memories.

644
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,600
 They're tucked in a way with all your other precious moments in your life.

645
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,800
 You're reminiscing about these dark moments that you...

646
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
 What?

647
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,340
 You know, this didn't happen.

648
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,580
 You finally fall asleep after a few hours of rolling around in bed as your brain is

649
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,540
 being rewired.

650
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:10,660
 Chemicals becoming imbalanced, synapses ceasing to fire the way they were designed to.

651
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,400
 When you wake up, you wake up with a different world view.

652
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,380
 You wake up in a different world.

653
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:23,340
 You can't put your finger on it, but something's not right.

654
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:30,680
 And you start that long and arduous journey navigating through your own reality while

655
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:36,140
 your friends and your family sit on the sidelines wondering what is going on with you.

656
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,320
 So finally it culminates with you having to get a medical diagnosis and you have a very,

657
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,080
 very serious mental disease.

658
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,180
 Since the years wind by and you struggle with this, you'll always wonder, you will always

659
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:56,620
 wonder, was this something that was medically present in me this entire time, a ticking

660
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:02,140
 bomb waiting to go off, and it eventually did?

661
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,420
 Or did this happen because you picked up that coin on the street?

662
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,380
 Your life was going great until the luckiest day of your life.

663
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:17,760
 And then everything that was normal disappeared.

664
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,240
 Was it because of an underlying medical illness?

665
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,640
 Or was it because of a cursed coin?

666
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,200
 When you deal with the world of the paranormal, you have to understand reality is malleable.

667
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,560
 Nothing is set in stone.

668
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,320
 You take a risk every time you step out your front door.

669
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,080
 You take a risk every time you wake up in the morning.

670
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:48,260
 The world of the paranormal is chaos unfolding every single second.

671
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,320
 It is a world of UFOs and galactic civilizations.

672
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,040
 It is a world of demonic empires and haunting spirits.

673
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:07,560
 But it is also the world where the smallest item can carry a curse, a curse that can destroy

674
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:30,040
 your mind.

675
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,620
 (upbeat music)

676
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,200
 (upbeat music)

677
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,780
 (upbeat music)

678
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,360
 (upbeat music)

679
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,940
 (upbeat music)

680
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,520
 (upbeat music)

681
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,100
 (upbeat music)

682
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,680
 (upbeat music)

683
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,260
 (upbeat music)

684
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,840
 (upbeat music)

685
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,420
 (upbeat music)

686
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,000
 (upbeat music)

687
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,580
 (upbeat music)
