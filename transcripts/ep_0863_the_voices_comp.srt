1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
 A young mother is awoken from her deep sleep when she hears a strange voice coming from

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,720
 her child's room.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:20,000
 Then we meet a woman whose mind is being infested with voices that aren't hers.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,280
 Most people would call her insane, but she believes the voices are turning her into a

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:33,280
 better human being today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,280
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,760
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so first off let's get in one of our supporters of the

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,640
 show walking into Dead Rabbit Command, a long time listener, a long time supporter and give

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,120
 it up for Fabio.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,200
 Fabio recently bought me a book from my Amazon wishlist that's in the show notes.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,800
 The book is 100 Deadly Skills.

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,440
 The Seal Operatives Guide to Eluding Pursuers Evading Capture and Surviving Any Dangerous

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
 Situation.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
 What an amazing book.

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,080
 You know, I'm looking through it and I thought this was going to be a book like "If a Muggers

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,960
 Following You, This Is What You're Supposed To Do."

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,000
 This book is way more advanced than that.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,760
 This book is like if you're trapped in Tehran and your cover's been blown that you're a

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,040
 CIA operative, here's how to escape from your captor.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,720
 This book is dope.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,880
 This is a really cool book.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,760
 Fabio, thank you so much for sending it over.

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,400
 I've just been browsing through it and I already know how to turn a tampon applicator into

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
 an icepick.

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
 It's amazing.

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
 I love it so much.

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,640
 So Fabio, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,800
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand it.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,720
 Which helps spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

33
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,720
 Fabio, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,320
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:12,680
 We're flying all the way out to a suburban neighborhood somewhere in America.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,920
 The story was recently posted online by someone going with the handle of something joker.

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
 We're going to call you Jake.

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,560
 We're going to call you Jake.

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,200
 That's your real name is just a guess.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,920
 I'm not a psychic.

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,480
 Now Jake is an adult and recently he was talking to his mom.

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,560
 They're sitting in the kitchen and he's like eating donuts.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,640
 He didn't actually say what his diet was at this time.

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
 He's like, you're lying.

45
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,880
 I'm keto right now.

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,240
 Jake is sitting in the kitchen.

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,480
 He's eating raw steak and he's talking to his mom and then having through the conversation

48
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,000
 and he notices mom kind of stopped and was just staring at him.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,840
 It wasn't because he was eating raw steak.

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,680
 It wasn't because blood was dripping from his hands onto the kitchen floor.

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,080
 His mom just kind of stopped and was staring at him and he's like, Hey, what is everything?

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,400
 Okay, mom, like what's going on?

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:08,060
 And she goes, I never told you this story, but I guess I need to tell you this now.

54
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,080
 When Jake was five years old, his mom puts him to bed.

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,120
 Mommy, tell me a story.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
 No, not tonight.

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
 You didn't earn any stories.

58
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
 You didn't eat all your raw meat.

59
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,240
 But mommy, it makes me sick.

60
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,600
 Well, you're not getting a story tonight.

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,080
 And the mom puts the five year old to bed and she crawls into bed with her husband.

62
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,880
 The parents room is next door to Jake's.

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,160
 She crawls into bed with her husband and they are all soon asleep.

64
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,480
 But in the middle of the night, Jake's mom wakes up and she hears a voice.

65
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,200
 Well, you know, what you need to do is that when your taxes are due, you should probably

66
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,520
 do them and then you fill up.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,520
 She hears this voice and she's talking about random stuff and she's slowly waking up.

68
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,160
 She can't really make sense of what's going on.

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:04,720
 She goes, the only thing I can really describe it as is it sounded like somebody giving advice,

70
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,800
 talking about like taxes, talking about like college stuff and I'm laying there in bed

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,440
 and I'm hearing this voice, this adult male voice talking about this stuff.

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,600
 And I assume it's my husband talking in the sleep.

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,160
 But I look and he's not.

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
 He's just asleep.

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,480
 It's just the boring kind of sleep.

76
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,720
 He's not talking during it.

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,120
 And I'm sitting there.

78
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,240
 And then I realize the voice is not coming from our room.

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,400
 It's coming from your room, Jake.

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,640
 I heard a strange adult voice coming from your room.

81
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,400
 And I freaked out.

82
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,760
 I jumped up, ran out of the room.

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:52,240
 I ran to your door and swung it open and there Jake standing over you while you were sleeping

84
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,760
 was a man.

85
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,520
 Now this is a terrifying story, right?

86
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,400
 If your parent told you one night I walked into your bedroom and there was a stranger

87
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,240
 talking to you while you were sleeping.

88
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
 That would be weird enough.

89
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,960
 I'm sure Jake, I'm sure Jake couldn't wait for the story to be finished.

90
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,200
 I don't think his mom, I think his mom went on to a short segue after she started it.

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,760
 She's like, "Oh, but you know what?

92
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
 Let's make toast."

93
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,480
 And she's like, "Mom, finish the story.

94
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,360
 Finish the story."

95
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,240
 She says, "I swung the door open and there was a stranger standing in your bedroom and

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:42,360
 when the door opened up he said to you, 'Oops, guess I gotta go now kid.'

97
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,800
 And then he vanished.

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,680
 Not vanished as in, he jumped out the bedroom window.

99
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,440
 Not vanished as in, he ran past me and vanished into the night.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,760
 No, Jake, he disappeared in front of me.

101
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,160
 Jake had never heard this story before.

102
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
 He's gobsmacked.

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
 He has no idea.

104
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,800
 He goes, "Mom, well what was the guy saying?

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,120
 You said that you could hear him talking."

106
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,840
 She goes, "Just random stuff."

107
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,320
 He was talking about random stuff.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,040
 He was talking about college and taxes.

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,640
 It sounded like he was giving advice.

110
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,200
 But I never told you that story.

111
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,960
 I didn't know even how to process it myself until this moment when I'm talking to you

112
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
 in the kitchen.

113
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,840
 I didn't get a clear look at the guy.

114
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:36,000
 But if I had to guess, he kinda looked like you do now.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,920
 And he sounded like you do as well.

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,520
 An interesting story of time travel.

117
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,040
 That's really what's going on here.

118
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,320
 We covered a story like this pretty recently along the same lines.

119
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,600
 It was a car accident where a stranger showed up to console one of the victims of the car

120
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,040
 accident and then the stranger just kinda disappeared.

121
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,040
 It was, he didn't do it as much as this.

122
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
 It wasn't as magical.

123
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,400
 I think he just kinda walked away.

124
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,920
 Or you know when the EMTs got there, this guy just, he just kinda got lost in the crowd.

125
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,400
 And then I think it was like 10, 20 years later, the victim of the car accident was looking

126
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,000
 in the mirror and he realized he was the guy that he saw along the car accident.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,520
 A fascinating story.

128
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,960
 Here we have something that is the same but far less dramatic.

129
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,080
 I just give him advice.

130
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,880
 Somebody came back to give him advice about life.

131
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
 Just basic stuff.

132
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,120
 Do your taxes, go to college.

133
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,480
 It didn't seem to be any world shaking stuff.

134
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
 Fascinating story.

135
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,320
 And again, there's a thing in the paranormal world and I think you can kind of extrapolate

136
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,800
 it to everywhere.

137
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,560
 Once is an anomaly.

138
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,640
 Twice is a coincidence but a third time, now it's a phenomenon.

139
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,840
 Now it's something that has to be cataloged in the world of high strangeness.

140
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,560
 So now we have two times of two people coming back from the future to visit younger versions

141
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,720
 of themselves which in the world of high strangeness, time slips we believe in this stuff, what's

142
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,120
 interesting about this though is that these stories are happening now.

143
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,960
 If this was a time traveler using some sort of time travel device and came back and was

144
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,280
 like "Dude, wake up, wake up five year old me, I gotta tell you all about our fourth

145
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
 year of college.

146
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,800
 It's gonna be insane."

147
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,920
 That'd be one thing but the time travel devices don't exist now and both of these stories

148
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,000
 have taken place where they're already in the future.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Our future is our present.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Does that make sense?

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,520
 Like if it happened today, if you saw a version of you 50 years in the future, we could say

152
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,720
 "Well maybe time travel is accessible 50 years in the future, maybe it's common or maybe

153
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,840
 you're a thief and you broke into a time travel facility specifically to go back in time and

154
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
 visit you."

155
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,520
 But because these stories are taking place now, we know time travel doesn't exist as

156
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,800
 a function, that must mean, and we'll see if we find any other stories like this, that

157
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,960
 time travel is possible now because we've come across two stories in only the past couple

158
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:19,040
 months that talk about people going back in time and visiting younger versions of themselves,

159
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,600
 which means time travel is possible now.

160
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,780
 It may not need a device.

161
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,840
 It may be a mental thing, but it's possible now.

162
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,360
 First times an anomaly, second times a coincidence, maybe these are the only two events but if

163
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,920
 we continue to find stories where people are visiting younger versions of themselves and

164
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,360
 the adult, like you have a kid who remember seeing an adult version of themselves and

165
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,640
 now they go and I woke up and it's 2022 and I realize I was the man, that means time travel

166
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,580
 is possible now.

167
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,120
 We are in the era of time travel because now we've found two stories where an adult from

168
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,240
 today has gone back to talk to a younger version of themselves.

169
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,840
 If these stories are true, this is earth shattering stuff.

170
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,000
 We are in the age of time travel now.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,760
 Is it a technological time travel or has something happened where we can reach back in time with

172
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,760
 our psyche?

173
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,120
 We don't know.

174
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,280
 First times an anomaly, second times a coincidence, and these may be the only two stories that

175
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,920
 exist but if we find more of these, this is a phenomenon we now have the ability to time

176
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,600
 travel.

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,280
 Fascinating story.

178
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,760
 Also I would say if you do figure out how to time travel, give yourself advice.

179
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,720
 I mean this guy might have bombed out on college and the IRS coming after him and he's like

180
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,240
 running down a hallway and he sees like a time warp and he's like who goes through it

181
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,160
 and that was the only thing you can think of.

182
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,320
 He's like listen, finish college and pay your taxes but it just seemed like pretty much

183
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
 adult advice.

184
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
 If you're going to go back in time, do something more spectacular.

185
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,480
 Listen to me, listen to the guy recording a podcast in his on-it closet.

186
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,000
 If you figure out how to go back in time, do something more with it than just talking

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,480
 about taxes.

188
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,200
 But fascinating story, if there are more of these where the adult versions are from today

189
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,160
 and not from 20 or 30 or 40 years in the future, time travel is possible now.

190
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,040
 That very well may be the case.

191
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,480
 Fabio, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonar copter.

192
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,080
 We are leaving behind this house.

193
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,200
 We are headed all the way out to a mental hospital.

194
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,160
 We're going to buzz the building.

195
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,840
 People are like, "Oh, I see a helicopter out there with thousands of people who listen

196
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,920
 to this podcast.

197
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
 How does this even work?

198
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,680
 We're going around in circles wearing spooky masks.

199
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,880
 Just to rile them up a bit.

200
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,560
 Just to rile them up a bit."

201
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,360
 And then we're going to land on the roof and we're going to walk through this mental hospital.

202
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,240
 I mean, we're really, really bringing the heat today.

203
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,000
 We're walking through this mental hospital and we're pretending we're doctors and we

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,120
 have all of these files and stuff like that.

205
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
 We're rifling through.

206
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
 We're mixing them up.

207
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,280
 We're mixing them up.

208
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,720
 Some guy's about to get released and he's like, "All right, I'm going to go home and

209
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
 see my family."

210
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
 He's like, "What?

211
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
 I have phantom pregnancy.

212
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
 What?

213
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,120
 I don't have phantom pregnancy."

214
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,160
 He looks down and he goes, "Oh wait, yeah I do."

215
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,240
 He has a big giant ghost baby in his belly.

216
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,600
 We're mixing up all the files.

217
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
 Just general chaos.

218
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,200
 But the real reason we're here, rather than hilarious practical jokes, is we are looking

219
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,360
 for a particular file for this young woman.

220
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,480
 This is a really interesting story and it's one of those stories that got deleted.

221
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,840
 Like I was able to save it.

222
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,800
 We do have it on the way back machine.

223
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
 It was something that I had set aside.

224
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
 I wanted to look into and then it got deleted.

225
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,800
 The user deleted it.

226
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,160
 We don't even have a username for them.

227
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,920
 We'll call them Samantha.

228
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,720
 If that is your real name, it is just a guess.

229
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,000
 It's a fascinating story that Samantha has to tell us.

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,880
 Ten years ago is when this story starts.

231
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,640
 Samantha is a young married woman just living life the best that she can.

232
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,960
 Like all of us are doing, right?

233
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:16,040
 When one day her brain just seems to break.

234
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,880
 For lack of a better term, it just breaks.

235
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,760
 She thinks she's going crazy.

236
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,680
 By her own admission, she goes, "When this started, I thought I was going crazy.

237
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,560
 I went to go speak to a doctor.

238
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,480
 I got put on medication.

239
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,240
 I knew something was wrong.

240
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,520
 It's not one of those people who go crazy and they just assume that they're not crazy."

241
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,920
 She knew something was wrong.

242
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,160
 What she was seeing is she was experiencing these visions.

243
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,200
 She keeps using the word vision, but she does clarify.

244
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,720
 She goes, "What it is, it's not necessarily a visual hallucination.

245
00:13:51,720 --> 00:14:03,280
 My brain began to become overloaded with a complete understanding of things, of reality,

246
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,520
 through images in her head."

247
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,360
 So it wasn't that she was having full-on visual hallucinations, but all of a sudden her brain

248
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,600
 began being flooded with images.

249
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
 Super complex.

250
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,240
 She knew it was fictional.

251
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,840
 She knew that this stuff wasn't real, but it was a super complex storyline.

252
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:31,000
 Just began to build and branch out and constantly evolve inside of her mind.

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,720
 It involved this world where angels lived among humans, and there were these aliens

254
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,280
 coming down trying to create hybrids as well.

255
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,200
 And all of this was being controlled by Player X.

256
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:52,040
 Player X was this supreme alien intelligence that was playing the video game we call reality.

257
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,080
 This is all just a simulation, you see.

258
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:01,000
 We are trapped in this simulation, and there is an alien intelligence that is playing it,

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,320
 and we are part of this game.

260
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,640
 We're not puppets of the alien, apparently.

261
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,000
 We're not here to serve the alien.

262
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,720
 We're basically characters that populate this game.

263
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,520
 And also in this game are other aliens who are simulations.

264
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,480
 They are not real.

265
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,440
 And the angels are not real.

266
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,640
 We're all part of the simulation.

267
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,040
 Now listen, I knew this was not real.

268
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:30,080
 I knew this was fiction, but it was so overwhelming.

269
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,040
 She goes, "I couldn't focus on anything.

270
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,160
 I couldn't focus at work.

271
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,040
 I couldn't even focus at life."

272
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,880
 Imagine daydreaming nonstop.

273
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,120
 That's how she describes this.

274
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,240
 And the medication the doctors were giving her was not working.

275
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,320
 She doesn't give much detail on this part.

276
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,120
 I feel like there's some information missing.

277
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,000
 And again, unfortunately this person has disappeared.

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,480
 Will never be able to verify anything they write again is the original poster.

279
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,760
 But they say, "At some point she fell into an alcohol-induced coma."

280
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,040
 So I don't know if she had a serious drinking problem before these visions started.

281
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
 I don't know.

282
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,800
 Obviously, if you get to the point where you drink so much you go into a coma, you have

283
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,280
 a drinking problem at some point.

284
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,640
 I don't know when it started.

285
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,200
 I don't know if she was trying to drink away the visions.

286
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,760
 But she said everything got worse when she came back out of the coma.

287
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,880
 She said she began to have visions of a future lover.

288
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,160
 There was this man who was going to come into her life.

289
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,240
 Now remember, she's married.

290
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,760
 But these visions are so overwhelming, she believes that this man is coming to save her

291
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,760
 and that her current husband is evil.

292
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,040
 He's going to do horrible things to her.

293
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,720
 Now she knows the visions are fictitious, but she can't stop daydreaming.

294
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,800
 She makes the decision to leave her husband.

295
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,240
 So she ends her marriage and moves on.

296
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,200
 Now what's interesting is remember, she's writing this 10 years later and she goes,

297
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,800
 "There never was a future lover sent my way.

298
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 I never met the man that the visions told me was coming.

299
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,040
 However, I do not regret leaving my husband."

300
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,120
 And here's why.

301
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,160
 The voices.

302
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,440
 This is the era of the voices.

303
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,240
 She begins to hear voices in her head.

304
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
 She hears them.

305
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,520
 This sounds just so...

306
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,840
 I can't even imagine this.

307
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,840
 She said, "The voices are talking."

308
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,200
 This is insane.

309
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,960
 The voices are talking unless she is talking.

310
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,480
 If she is not saying anything, the voices are in her head and it is constant.

311
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,080
 We have a young man in town here who has been gone for about 10 years.

312
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,320
 He was this young man who just...

313
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,200
 He turned 20 and he went insane.

314
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,640
 Probably schizophrenia, right?

315
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,120
 It tends to pop up in that age, 20 to 30, I think it's kind of that age range.

316
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
 He turned 20.

317
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,560
 He started to go insane and then he disappeared for 10 years, which worries me because that

318
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
 usually...

319
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,600
 10 years is usually a jail stint, right?

320
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
 Nobody knows.

321
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,040
 I guess his family knows, but it's not like they're going to put it in the newspaper or

322
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
 anything like that.

323
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,360
 He goes away for 10 years, he's back and he just walks down the street, up and down the

324
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,440
 street talking to himself.

325
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
 Talking to himself.

326
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,880
 And I always just figured, I think we've all had encountered someone who's crazy, who's

327
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
 talking to themselves.

328
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,400
 I always figured that was...

329
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,160
 They were just because they were crazy, but I'm wondering if talking to yourself, at

330
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,160
 least in her case, it let her have some peace.

331
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,200
 The voices went away when she was talking, so maybe they're not talking to the voices

332
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,400
 in their head.

333
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,840
 Maybe they're talking to stop the voices.

334
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,000
 I don't know how common this symptom is.

335
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 The talking stops the voices.

336
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,520
 What's interesting too is that this young man, he looks relatively healthy.

337
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,000
 He's not a street person.

338
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,360
 He lives somewhere in the area with his family, but then he just walks around.

339
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,280
 It takes you a while to realize something's off, because nowadays people are constantly

340
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,120
 walking down the street talking to themselves with a little Bluetooth in their ear.

341
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,560
 I thought he was just on a phone.

342
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,040
 I thought he was just on the phone all the time.

343
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,360
 No, he's suffering through something.

344
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,280
 He seems quite nice, but again, I don't know where he's been for the last 10 years.

345
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,480
 When she talks though, the voices go away, but she is very, very clear on this.

346
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,680
 She spends the rest of her post talking about this.

347
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,080
 The voices help her.

348
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,520
 She said the voices taught her how to diagnose a tumor.

349
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,520
 They said if it feels like a grape, it's benign.

350
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,280
 It feels like a rock.

351
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,400
 It's not benign.

352
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
 It's malignant.

353
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,560
 I do not take that as medical advice.

354
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,720
 Don't take anything this podcast says is medical advice.

355
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,000
 She said when she had a tumor, she felt it and she goes, "Oh, that's just a grape."

356
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
 But she did get it taken out.

357
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,720
 She wasn't like, "I don't worry about that."

358
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,600
 But she said that allowed her to diagnose it.

359
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,560
 So when the doctor said, "You have a tumor, but don't worry, it's benign," it gave her...

360
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,000
 She knew that the voices were telling her something true.

361
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,360
 We didn't have a long time ago about a woman who had two voices in her head that was telling

362
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,840
 her she has a brain tumor.

363
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,120
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

364
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
 That one's fascinating as well.

365
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,440
 But that one, well, I won't spoil it.

366
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,240
 I won't spoil that one or this story.

367
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
 Let me go ahead and keep going.

368
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
 This one.

369
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,720
 So she can tell when she has a tumor and the voices told her how to tell the difference

370
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,120
 between a malignant or benign one.

371
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,640
 Now, that's something that maybe she came across when she was reading a magazine, a Time Magazine

372
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,720
 article five years ago.

373
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
 It's knowledge in the back of the head.

374
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,840
 It doesn't really mean anything if the voices are telling you that.

375
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,480
 But these voices also begin to give her advice.

376
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,280
 They begin to tell her she needs to start doing better at work.

377
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,560
 The fact that she's still employed at this point is mind boggling, but it's good, right?

378
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,080
 I'm not saying that she should be fired because she's having visions and hearing voices, but

379
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
 I don't know.

380
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,920
 I don't necessarily know if HR wasn't informed of all that either.

381
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,440
 It's not really any of their business.

382
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,000
 The voices are telling her that she needs to do better at work and she goes, the voices

383
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,720
 are actually giving me advice on how to be better at work.

384
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,960
 She says it starts to turn me into a more assertive type A personality.

385
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,240
 Like I'm listening to the voices, they're telling me what to do and it is good advice.

386
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,240
 They even taught me.

387
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,040
 What's interesting is she knows what she's saying sounds insane.

388
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,000
 She goes, I know this is going to sound super weird, but the voices taught me how to apply

389
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,760
 my makeup better.

390
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,120
 I look better.

391
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,280
 I physically look better.

392
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,920
 The voices have told me they're like not so much blush.

393
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,720
 She looked like a French hooker.

394
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,480
 She's going along with looking better.

395
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,680
 She goes, the voices actually got me to lose 50 pounds.

396
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,560
 Now I don't know if they were like insulting her calling her tubby or they were just voices

397
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,040
 going, come on, one more pushup.

398
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
 You can do it.

399
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
 Or maybe both.

400
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
 I don't know.

401
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
 I have no idea.

402
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,920
 She didn't go into detail, but she said through the advice from the voices, she lost 50 pounds.

403
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,200
 She became a better person at work.

404
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,560
 She became a more assertive person in general and she's better at putting on her makeup and

405
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,920
 the voices were very clear with one more piece of advice.

406
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,840
 Don't tell anyone about us.

407
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,160
 Don't tell anyone about us.

408
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,240
 Because every time you tell someone about us, even if you're trying to say that the voices

409
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,880
 help you do good things, they will think you're crazy.

410
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,640
 And you've seen that.

411
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:42,040
 So just take our advice and don't tell anyone we exist and everything will be A-okay.

412
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
 Fascinating, right?

413
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:49,880
 She's a better person now through the advice of the voices.

414
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:56,360
 She's healthier, better worker, all that stuff, right?

415
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:05,000
 But then the voices tell her they have made her quote unquote, "divinely sober."

416
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,720
 So again, I think there's a, might be a drinking problem here.

417
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,960
 A drinking problem floating around this whole narrative that's not really being addressed.

418
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,520
 Because sobriety is definitely something that these voices were working on.

419
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,560
 But these voices have made her divinely sober.

420
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:28,920
 They've actually challenged her to prove that they have made her divinely sober.

421
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:36,200
 So the voices tell her, "You will need physical proof of this miracle we've given you, so

422
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,480
 prove it."

423
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,360
 And what she does is she grabs an entire bottle, which I'm assuming is a 750 ml bottle, of

424
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,380
 absolute vodka, drinks the entire bottle.

425
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,160
 She doesn't get drunk.

426
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:01,400
 She then thinks, well, okay, that, that, that I just drank what really is toxic to the human

427
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,800
 body.

428
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,960
 That's what causes you to get drunk because it's poisoning your body.

429
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
 And I didn't get drunk.

430
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
 Well, maybe that was just a one off.

431
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,320
 Luckily, I have a 12 pack of white claw here.

432
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,120
 She drinks the entire 12 pack of white claw, or two six packs.

433
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
 I don't know how they sell it.

434
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
 Did they sell it in the case?

435
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
 I don't know.

436
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
 I don't drink.

437
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,060
 She drinks the bottle of absolute vodka.

438
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,920
 She drinks all of the white claw.

439
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:35,560
 And now for the first time, she has a visual hallucination.

440
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:42,160
 She says her entire visual space, all of her peripheral vision is filled with beautiful

441
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
 colors.

442
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:49,200
 And the voices say, you can even close your eyes, Samantha.

443
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,680
 Close your eyes and you'll still see this beautiful vision.

444
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
 And so she does.

445
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:03,240
 She closes her eyes and for 30 minutes she is enveloped in peace, in comfort.

446
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:12,280
 Her entire existence is at rest as she's watching this beautiful imagery play out behind closed

447
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,440
 eyes.

448
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,040
 The post ends with her saying, there's so much more stuff that I could talk about and

449
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,160
 I don't even really know where to go in a detail.

450
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,680
 I've already spent a lot of time talking about all this other crazy stuff, but she didn't

451
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,640
 mention she can write.

452
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,200
 This is so interesting.

453
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
 She can write.

454
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,320
 She can physically write stuff down for three days without being hungry.

455
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
 What?

456
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,000
 That's such a weird combination of things, right?

457
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,560
 There's no combination between writing and being hungry.

458
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,680
 It's not that she can just go three days without eating.

459
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,960
 She can write for three days straight without being hungry.

460
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,320
 And then this is why I wanted more clarification.

461
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,000
 Like, this sounds awesome.

462
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,800
 I want to have a battle with you.

463
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,600
 She can rap for four days straight.

464
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
 What could what could what?

465
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,320
 I'd be down for that.

466
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,880
 I'd be down for that rap battle.

467
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,840
 I do my minute and she does her four days and then I get one minute.

468
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,280
 I get a one minute rebuttal.

469
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,720
 Wrapping for four days straight.

470
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,440
 Wrapping is actually a symptom of schizophrenia.

471
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,000
 I'm saying the fabulous and Lil Wayne and all them are schizophrenic, but a lot of times

472
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,520
 schizophrenics, what they'll do is they make connections between things and rapping is

473
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,240
 all about making connections between things.

474
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,080
 So I talked about this on like one of my first episodes where I grew up in San Lorenzo, one

475
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,280
 of the places I grew up.

476
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,280
 There was a homeless schizophrenic dude named Joe Trombone.

477
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,360
 I don't think that was his actual name.

478
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,680
 I don't think the Trombones, Mr. and Mrs. Trombone had a baby and they named him Joe,

479
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,920
 but everyone in town called him Joe Trombone and he would rap.

480
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,960
 You'd get on the, this is back in the 90s, you'd get on the bus and you're like, Joe

481
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,360
 Trombone would be on the bus and you'd be like, yo, Joe, bust out a rap and a guy would

482
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,640
 be like, and he'd just start rapping about random stuff.

483
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,520
 There's actually, when I talked about him years ago on this show, someone sent me a

484
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 link.

485
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
 He's on YouTube.

486
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,720
 Fascinating side effect of schizophrenia is the ability to rap because you're making

487
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,760
 connections between things.

488
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,320
 She finishes out her post by saying her life is going really, really well.

489
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,640
 It's going better than it was before.

490
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,640
 And she said she wanted to impart this message to us.

491
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,040
 This is really interesting.

492
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:33,600
 She said, "What the voices taught me was to be happy, you must sacrifice.

493
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,640
 If you want to be in shape, time you would rather spend sitting there watching television

494
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,440
 and you have to work out.

495
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,960
 Sure we all want to eat Papa Murphy's pizza every night, but you can't.

496
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,640
 You have to sacrifice that delicious meal for no meal or eaten oats that night or something

497
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
 like that.

498
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,240
 You know what I mean?

499
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,320
 To physically get fit, you do have to sacrifice.

500
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,000
 There are things that you may go, "I want to be able to do X, Y, and Z, but I will have

501
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 to sacrifice parts of my life to work this job."

502
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,040
 That's not the best job, but it allows me to go to these places.

503
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
 To be happy, you must sacrifice.

504
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,320
 You want to have a good family, you have to give up some of your time, or a lot of your

505
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
 time really.

506
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,280
 To be happy, you must sacrifice things.

507
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
 Very, very interesting.

508
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,240
 I hadn't really thought about that, and she said being honest too.

509
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,320
 When you're honest to someone, you're actually sacrificing something.

510
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,600
 It's easier a lot of times to lie, but sometimes you have to sacrifice a little bit of your

511
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,480
 comfort and you have to admit the truth for true happiness to me there.

512
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,040
 Great way to end this if that was the way she ended this post.

513
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,320
 That was near the end.

514
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:56,760
 What we see truly at the end of the post is, "But there's a very dark side to these voices."

515
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:05,520
 I think that side has passed, but I don't really know what will happen.

516
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,560
 Fascinating story and a fascinating look at mental illness.

517
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,920
 I mean, that's the one way we can look at it, right?

518
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,240
 The scientific way that she's suffering some sort of mental illness.

519
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,320
 Or we can look at it from a paranormal angle that these voices are coming from somewhere

520
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
 else.

521
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,000
 Maybe the future, like the first story, maybe an angelic presence or an alien presence.

522
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,080
 Because we cover stories where all of those things are possible, right?

523
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,240
 I'll talk about someone getting telepathic messages from aliens, and I won't really

524
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,040
 use the word mental illness.

525
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,680
 But when she gives us the full picture, the full scope of what's going on, it's really

526
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,560
 hard to classify this as anything but mental illness.

527
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,320
 In fact, she classified it as mental illness in the beginning.

528
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,760
 But what's really, really, really interesting and kind of scary and we'll wrap it up like

529
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,640
 this, she's telling us half the story, right?

530
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,240
 She is not giving us all the information we need to really see what the intention of these

531
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,720
 voices are, and she admits it in the end.

532
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,960
 There's a very dark side to these voices.

533
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,680
 I think that side has passed.

534
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:17,440
 Other than getting her to drink all the alcohol, would anything that those voices told her

535
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,880
 to do be considered negative?

536
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,160
 And I guess you could argue her leaving her husband, right?

537
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,420
 But she saw that as a net positive.

538
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,360
 She left out the darkness of the story.

539
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,400
 When she wrote this story, she left out, there is nothing in the story.

540
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,520
 I read you, I mean, obviously I'm paraphrasing, I didn't read a verbatim or anything like

541
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,920
 that, but it's in the show and you can read it yourself.

542
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,760
 And if you do choose to read it yourself, you will not see anything in there that you

543
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,560
 could classify as a very dark side.

544
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,560
 She doesn't tell us any of that.

545
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:59,800
 This is a very rose-colored version of what these voices are telling her.

546
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,880
 There is nothing in there.

547
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,880
 We get no glimpse into the dark side of these voices.

548
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,600
 We get no glimpse into the dark side of herself.

549
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,520
 I think that side has passed, but I don't really know what will happen.

550
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,880
 She's leaving out so much.

551
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,000
 We only get the good stuff.

552
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,040
 What other things have these voices told her to do?

553
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,920
 Maybe she's ignored them in that moment.

554
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,560
 Maybe she's done them.

555
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,160
 But we don't, she's not telling us the total story.

556
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,600
 It's not like we have a right to, right?

557
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,320
 It's not like she has to tell it.

558
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,800
 And when someone's telling us that their mental illness has given them a positive effect and

559
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,320
 then they end it going, but there's a very dark side to this as well and we have no information

560
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,440
 and that is super suspect.

561
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,800
 It makes me wonder who the audience for this post really is.

562
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,880
 It was posted on the High Strangeness Board, the High Strangeness subreddit, but it makes

563
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,480
 me wonder who the audience really is.

564
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,360
 Is it people interested in the paranormal?

565
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,960
 Is it people who are interested in mental health?

566
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,320
 Or is it to people who are also experiencing these symptoms just because it was posted

567
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
 on this Reddit board?

568
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,680
 It doesn't mean that it hasn't proliferated on all other sorts of forums and boards across

569
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,720
 the internet.

570
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,000
 Just found it here.

571
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,920
 Who was the intended audience for this?

572
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,320
 Was it people who were struggling with hearing voices in their head and they were trying

573
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
 to fight them?

574
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:34,760
 And this story says, "Don't worry, the voices will lead you to good decisions.

575
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,560
 I'm a better person once I started listening to the voices in my head.

576
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:44,840
 Once I removed myself from my husband, the closest person to me who could see any sort

577
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:51,280
 of problems, now I'm in my own world and I don't tell anyone I'm going through this,

578
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,000
 the voices are helping me and the voices can help you too."

579
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,240
 I mean that's kind of what the message of this is and is the recipient of this story

580
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,880
 other people who are hearing voices in their head.

581
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:16,960
 And then you have to ask yourself, who wrote this?

582
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,040
 Was it Samantha?

583
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,160
 Or was it the voices in her head?

584
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,440
 Was she commanded to put this out there?

585
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,160
 Was she told that if she posted this, it would help her be a better person?

586
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:45,840
 Only for it to spread a harmful message?

587
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,400
 Is it possible that the voices in her head crafted this post and the only true line coming

588
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,600
 from Samantha is that last line, a warning?

589
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,200
 That is the only time she's shown through past the voices.

590
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,760
 There's a very dark side to these voices.

591
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,640
 Who wrote this?

592
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,800
 And why?

593
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:20,280
 With the post deleted and the account closed, we'll never know for sure.

594
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,760
 But if people struggling with mental illness come across this post in their search for

595
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,920
 answers, will it convince them to seek medical help?

596
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,520
 Will it have them seek advice from their spiritual leaders?

597
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:42,200
 Or will they read this and find some solace?

598
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,300
 Will they read this and find they are not alone?

599
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:54,840
 Will they read this post and decide to listen to the voices?

600
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:16,380
 the voices?

601
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:28,580
 the voices?

602
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,160
 (upbeat music)

603
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:41,160
