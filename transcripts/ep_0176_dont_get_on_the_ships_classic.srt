00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics, where we listen

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,920
 to a classic episode with a new intro.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,000
 Do not get on the ships.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,800
 I really love this episode.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,880
 I really really enjoy this episode for a couple reasons.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,400
 One, I think both stories really kind of click.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,200
 The Staff of Moses story I think is a really interesting story.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,440
 That's what we start the episode out with.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,640
 And I like that story.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,480
 Again, I've talked about this all week long.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,520
 I like talking about ancient history.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,280
 I don't want to become an ancient history podcast, but there's so much stuff in history

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,400
 that's just bizarre.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
 That's bizarre.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,560
 I might be sprinkling it more through season 9 and 10.

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,480
 But again, I don't want it to just become like hardcore history, which is a great podcast.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,120
 But I mean, again, that lane is taken.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,760
 I just like to kind of sprinkle it through.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,080
 So the Staff of Moses story I really really like, and it was stuff that I didn't know

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,280
 about.

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,960
 But the meat of the episode, the delicious human meat that the aliens are going to harvest

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,040
 is do not get on the ships.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,320
 I'll be honest.

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,840
 So originally, the podcast originally like way back in the day before Dead Rabbit Radio,

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,520
 I was going to do a podcast called Manifesto, where I was going to read people's manifestos

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,000
 and then analyze them afterwards.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,400
 And I recorded two or three episodes of that.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,600
 It was super grim.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,160
 It was super dark.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,320
 I think the only people who ever listened to them outside of me is Ash, my friends Ash

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
 and Dan.

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,920
 Carson may have listened to it as well.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,640
 Very very just dark.

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,680
 You get an idea for it if you listen to episodes, I think it's four and five of Dead Rabbit

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,440
 Radio or episodes of Manifesto where I'm reading this guy.

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,880
 I need to do those as a Dead Rabbit Radio classic.

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,440
 There's a guy who believes that John Lennon was killed by Stephen King.

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,760
 Now here's the thing.

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,880
 I thought about doing Manifesto and having it be this really kind of just like dramatic

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,400
 reading of manifestos.

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,040
 But I'll be honest with you, if I had to do any other podcast other than Dead Rabbit

42
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,520
 Radio, it would basically be this episode.

43
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:14,600
 It would be me finding kooks and cults and weird groups and just riffing on them the

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 whole episode.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,600
 If I wasn't talking about UFOs, if I wasn't talking about ghosts or conspiracies, I would

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:29,480
 love to just rip apart these wacky beliefs that these cults, these weirdos, these fringe

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
 lunatics have.

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,000
 I would, that would be my dream podcast if I wasn't doing Dead Rabbit.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,680
 Dead Rabbit Radio is my dream podcast, but you'll see these type of stories sprinkled

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,800
 in and you can almost hear me salivating as I'm recording these.

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,600
 Because I just love shredding these things to pieces.

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,720
 I've done it quite a few times and those are some of my favorite episodes.

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,240
 Monkeys Don't Exist I think is a great example of that because I'm not just reading off facts.

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,600
 I'm basically telling you what a crazy person believes and then just riffing on it, just

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
 making fun of it.

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,760
 That's what this episode is, but this episode has a twist at the ending, has a twist, which

57
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,320
 makes the episode shine.

58
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,400
 It's one thing to find a group of people and most of these are recommendations from you

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
 guys.

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,120
 Most of these are recommendations from you guys, but to find these groups of people and

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,960
 to talk about just how funny their beliefs are and things like that.

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,240
 This episode had a little bit of twist at the ending, so I'm actually going to stop the

63
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,320
 intro now.

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,200
 This episode you're going to get a little outro.

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,640
 We're going to talk about that twist, but I don't want to give it away now.

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,840
 So go ahead and listen now to episode 176.

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:58,720
 Do Not Get On The Ships Is The Magical Staff Of Moses Still Out There Somewhere?

68
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,680
 And then we take a look at the bizarre conspiracy known as Don't Get On The Ships.

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,400
 Is Simply Having An EBT Card Or Shopping At Walmart Opening You Up For Alien Abduction

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,680
 Today On Dead Rabbit Radio.

71
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:24,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

72
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

73
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
 I'm having a great day.

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,680
 I hope you're having a great day too.

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,320
 The snow has brought the war to me.

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,840
 Yesterday another snowstorm hit Hood River.

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,280
 It actually killed the power, shut the power off.

78
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,160
 I prefer the term killed the power.

79
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
 That's what snow does.

80
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
 It kills things.

81
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
 So that sucked.

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
 I had no heater.

83
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,360
 Then I had to go to work and when I came home, the electricity was back on, but the hot

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
 water is not.

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,280
 And I have to take a shower.

86
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
 So we'll figure that out.

87
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
 We'll figure that out.

88
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,880
 But that's my problem, not yours.

89
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
 But I appreciate your sympathy.

90
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
 We're going to go ahead and move on to our first story though.

91
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
 Now our first story.

92
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
 Quite a few episodes back.

93
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
 I don't remember exactly which one.

94
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,000
 I was talking about the staff of Moses and I go, I wonder what ever happened to that

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 thing.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,760
 And YouTube user Alexf reached out to me and says, oh, it's actually kind of well known

97
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
 where it's at.

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,920
 Let's take a quick look here.

99
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,400
 Now what the staff of Moses is, I had to do a bunch of research on this.

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
 It may actually be two staffs.

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,080
 It's kind of weird.

102
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,960
 Not even rabbinical scholars can really agree on this.

103
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,600
 Because I guess there were two staffs.

104
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,840
 I always thought it was Moses who threw his staff down and it turned into a snake.

105
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,680
 It was actually his brother Aaron who threw his staff down.

106
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,400
 So for those of you who aren't familiar with it, there's a story in the book of Exodus

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,400
 where the Pharaoh is like, hey, your god sucks.

108
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,840
 I'm the king of magic.

109
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,520
 I got all these magicians over here.

110
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,720
 They have all sorts of powers and he commanded his magicians to sorcerers to throw their

111
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,160
 staffs down and they turned into snakes.

112
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
 And then Aaron goes, pfft, whatever dude.

113
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,640
 Throws his staff down, turns into a larger snake, eats the other snakes, turns back

114
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
 into a staff.

115
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,360
 And I was like, what?

116
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,400
 So magic is real.

117
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
 Magic actually exists.

118
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,480
 And people were like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

119
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,360
 Only that part was magic.

120
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
 Everything else is not magic.

121
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 So I was like, what?

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,400
 Like obviously those guys' staffs turned to snakes.

123
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,480
 So they knew magic of some sort.

124
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,400
 Anyways, so that was Aaron's raw now.

125
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,680
 Of course scholars think that it was just one staff that the brothers were passing back

126
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,800
 and forth.

127
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,720
 But this was the same, and we'll accept that for an answer, that there was one staff that

128
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,280
 for some reason he loans to his brother every once in a while to turn into a snake.

129
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,360
 And he's like, hey Aaron, you got my staff and Aaron's like, uh, and there's like a

130
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,000
 giant snake slithering around the house.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,360
 He's like, yeah, yeah, give me five minutes.

132
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,560
 I'll get it ready for you.

133
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,040
 This is the same staff that Moses hit a rock with and a bunch of water shot out of it when

134
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,400
 the Israelites were thirsty.

135
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
 Well they're in the middle of nowhere.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
 It's not like they were just simply parched.

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,320
 There was like a gatorade stand 200 yards down the road, but they're like, no, I'm thirsty

138
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 now.

139
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
 Like they're in the middle of the desert.

140
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,280
 It was the same staff he hit the ground with and parted the Red Sea.

141
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,840
 One of the weird things was that once the staff blossomed almonds, that's pretty mild compared

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,280
 to bringing about the plagues of Egypt and turning into a snake.

143
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,240
 And it's interesting because then there's like this retcon to it.

144
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,920
 None of this stuff is in the Bible, but there's been this retcon to it that the staff was

145
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,320
 actually created on the sixth day of creation.

146
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,640
 It wasn't mentioned, but he created, God created this staff when he was creating the world.

147
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
 That's how powerful it is.

148
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,440
 He was like, he went out of his way to form this staff.

149
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,640
 And at one point the staff was stuck into the ground and only someone worthy to lead

150
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,320
 the Israelites would be able to remove the staff from the ground, i.e. the sword and the

151
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
 stone.

152
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,040
 So it's interesting how all these legends just continue to spread.

153
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,520
 I'm sure at some point in world history something was stuck somewhere and they go, ah, whoever

154
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,120
 strong enough to do that can lead.

155
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,000
 And there is a very common corollary to that.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,560
 If you can open a tight jar in a house, you are officially the man of the house, even

157
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,880
 if you're a woman.

158
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,760
 If you're strong enough to open a jar of pickles and nobody else can, that puts you in charge.

159
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,960
 It is your everyday sword and the stone.

160
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,480
 Now of course some people say that the staff was just a normal staff.

161
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,360
 And other people say that the staff itself was magical.

162
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,960
 The people who say it was normal said it's just a normal staff, God gave it power.

163
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,680
 And other people say, no, the staff itself has some sort of mystical quality to it.

164
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,200
 But what's interesting is we don't really know what happened to the staff after that.

165
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,680
 There's one of the, one of the, basically the story ends where when the first temple

166
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,240
 is destroyed in Israel, the staff was lost under the rubble of the temple.

167
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,840
 So we're, we're, that's way, way back in time.

168
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,120
 Other people say that it was locked in the Ark of the Covenant.

169
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,040
 And the Ark of the Covenant is another holy relic from the Bible.

170
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,920
 It's actually like a super weapon.

171
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,480
 You open it up and all your bad guys die, kind of like Raiders of the Lost Ark.

172
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,520
 Actually that is rumored to be in Ethiopia right now.

173
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,520
 It got smuggled out of Israel all the way to Ethiopia where it's at.

174
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,080
 St. Mary of Zion Cathedral, off in this little island.

175
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,040
 But other people say, and this is kind of where it's registered at, is there is a museum.

176
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,240
 And this is what Alex F. said.

177
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,800
 There's a museum in Turkey called Topokapi Palace.

178
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,560
 And they say that they have the Staff of Moses.

179
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,200
 Say, you can visit, you can go look at it.

180
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,520
 They don't let you handle it because they're afraid it's going to slither away.

181
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,640
 But they do, you can look at the staff, suppose it's Staff of Moses.

182
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,400
 They also have the sword of King David.

183
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,720
 That'd be pretty dope.

184
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,920
 I'd wield that.

185
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,640
 I'd be chasing security guards around with that.

186
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,960
 They have the Pot of Abraham, which I'm assuming is a metal pot and not some dankweed.

187
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,440
 And then they have a footprint of Muhammad and his tooth that he lost in a battle, all

188
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,320
 at Topokapi Palace.

189
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,640
 Now here's the thing.

190
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,200
 The tooth and the footprint and the pot and the sword are probably there.

191
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,800
 But stuff like the Ark of the Covenant and the Staff of Moses, if these things have any

192
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,320
 power whatsoever, because also the Staff of Moses, I forgot to mention earlier, there

193
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
 was this massive battle going on.

194
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,400
 If Moses was holding the staff high, the Israelites would win the battle and he says, "Oh, my

195
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
 arm's kind of cramping up."

196
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,840
 And he'd start to lower it, the tides would turn, they'd start losing the battle.

197
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,760
 So eventually a bunch of his homies had to like help hold his arm up.

198
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,360
 The whole battle, so the Israelites would win.

199
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,320
 So it's had some combat power, combat-based modifiers as well.

200
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,520
 If these artifacts are still around, they're not in Turkey or Ethiopia.

201
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,720
 I could almost guarantee that.

202
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,640
 There may be copies of them in those places.

203
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,960
 But any government worth their salt, if these things actually had any sort of power whatsoever,

204
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,760
 even if it was just symbolic power, any government worth their salt would have those in their

205
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
 possession.

206
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,120
 And especially something that was created on the sixth day of creation that can do everything

207
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,160
 from blossom almonds to turn the tide of battle, that's in a US warehouse somewhere.

208
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,120
 Wouldn't that be interesting if it turned out, here's my conspiracy theory that it

209
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
 just made up.

210
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,520
 Every US general in World War II carried a little sliver of the staff in his pocket.

211
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,560
 He put a splinter in his finger and they're like, "Okay, General MacArthur, once you

212
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,360
 go do this military battle, just hold your hand up.

213
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,720
 Everyone will think you're just waving at the troops, but you're holding up a splinter

214
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
 of the staff of Moses in your finger."

215
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,320
 And then they all die of snake, internal snake bites.

216
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,040
 They're like, "Oh, I should have thought about that other part of the story."

217
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,360
 If these objects are real, I think the US government has them locked away somewhere.

218
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,200
 And there's facsimiles in these other locations.

219
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,720
 And if they are super weapons, as has been purported, we definitely have them.

220
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,840
 And they're probably not locked away somewhere.

221
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,280
 They've probably been used.

222
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,960
 There's a little conspiracy theory for you.

223
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,160
 That would be interesting to find battles that...

224
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,320
 I've always thought, like, there's always these weird coincidences when you read about

225
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,840
 old-timey battles and you're like, "Hmm, if it hadn't been for this factor or because

226
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,760
 it was raining that day or something like that, the US won that battle, maybe they're

227
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,520
 using some divine super weapon or some divine tool."

228
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
 Who knows?

229
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,280
 Or maybe it's just fate and luck and good strategic planning.

230
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,440
 So thanks, Alex, for reaching out and letting me know where that artifact supposedly is,

231
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
 but I doubt it's there.

232
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,400
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

233
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:06,920
 Now our next story is a fascinating look at a website that gives us a very clear command.

234
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,640
 Very, very clear command.

235
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,080
 Do not get on the ships.

236
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,840
 Now this website is written by a couple, this man and this woman, and they talk about...

237
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,040
 They've been researching this for years and years and years and years.

238
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,240
 So I want you to imagine two people in a cluttered apartment, not far from mine, but

239
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,960
 mine is cluttered with happy things, like movies and clothes and toys that I've got

240
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,880
 collected over the years, not like a big toy collector, but you know, just like little

241
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
 Nicknack.

242
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,080
 I think I have a Ninja Turtle from each line, just one.

243
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
 You know, it's a happy clutter.

244
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,240
 This is a coming...

245
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,560
 This website is coming from a clutter of cigarette butts and discarded Mountain Dew cans everywhere,

246
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
 detritus surrounding the place.

247
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,880
 When you come to visit these people's houses, this is actually probably bordering on slanders.

248
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:02,440
 So I'll stop talking about how trashy their apartment is, but madness, an apartment surrounded

249
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,040
 in madness.

250
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,000
 Do not get on the UFOs.

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,440
 All of their information comes from three different sources.

252
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,720
 One, something they call a biofeedback machine or biofeedback meter.

253
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,360
 I'm assuming it's something that tests the electro...

254
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,320
 Electromagneticity or whatever, some made up thing in the human body.

255
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,760
 Probably close to an oddity machine that the Scientologists use.

256
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,200
 So they get it from that, they do these readings on people and they're like, "Oh, that's interesting.

257
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,640
 Your pulse is in Morse code for do not get on the ships."

258
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,440
 So they use the biofeedback meter.

259
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,320
 They use people's dreams, the number one authority of all things true in the world, what people

260
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,120
 dream, that's a huge source of information for them.

261
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,720
 But both of those, the made up technology and the sparks in our brain while we're unconscious,

262
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,760
 are far more credible than the other source of information they use.

263
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,680
 They constantly refer to the movie, Jupiter Ascending.

264
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,040
 The movie that nobody saw but them, I'm sure half the ticket sales for that movie came

265
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,600
 from these people watching them over and over again.

266
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,120
 They're still petitioning for the director's cut of Jupiter Ascending.

267
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,720
 Jupiter's Ascending, I didn't see it.

268
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
 Star Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis.

269
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,840
 It turns out that Earth is a factory farm and aliens have created factory farms all

270
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,360
 over the galaxy and once the population is ripe, they come there and they throw everyone

271
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,920
 in a meat grinder and eat them or drink them or they live longer because they're drinking

272
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,880
 our juices or something.

273
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
 Here's the little thing.

274
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
 This is the thing.

275
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,280
 If you get it, science fiction is a view into our future or the horrible implications of

276
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,840
 technology on mad or both.

277
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,240
 But these people could have easily walked into Transformers 5 and created a conspiracy

278
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,320
 theory that yes, Merlin did discover Transformers on Earth.

279
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,600
 Because that's really how ridiculous this is.

280
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,200
 And they use the argument of predictive programming.

281
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,240
 So there's this stupid rule out there, stupid thing that somebody came up with that before

282
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,040
 evil people can do something, they have to tell us they're going to do it.

283
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,360
 But anyways, they say Jupiter Ascending is part of that.

284
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,720
 Now I will give the Illuminati credit.

285
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,640
 If you're going to hide messages for what is in store for the future, you should put

286
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,000
 it in a movie no one's going to watch.

287
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I.e.

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Jupiter Ascending.

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,080
 You should put it in Jupiter Ascending.

290
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,000
 You should have put it in Han Solo.

291
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,400
 You put a lot of predictive programming in that because nobody saw that movie either.

292
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,160
 So anyways, they went to see this movie, Jupiter Ascending.

293
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,400
 They finally crawled out of the garbage of their apartment.

294
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,520
 They swam through it, all the credible newspapers.

295
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,480
 They swam through all that, get out to the movie theater and watch Jupiter Ascending and

296
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,520
 they're like "Oh my god, this is what is going to happen to us."

297
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,120
 So those are the three sources.

298
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,880
 They also use V, the old television show V, which I absolutely love.

299
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,320
 But they use that as well, but most of the stuff they keep referring back to, they're

300
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,360
 like "Just like a Jupiter Ascending."

301
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,960
 This part of our story is just like the movie Jupiter Ascending.

302
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,360
 And again, if they said the future is going to be a bunch of racetracks, i.e. speed racer,

303
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,880
 people would know that they are just full of nonsense, but nobody saw Jupiter Ascending

304
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,680
 so they can't really debate whether or not these guys are accurate.

305
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,160
 So this is their idea.

306
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,240
 There are good aliens and there are bad aliens.

307
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,960
 That's pretty normal in UFO lore.

308
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:32,480
 The bad aliens are going to show up in their spaceships and they're going to say "Do

309
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,720
 you want to come on our ship?"

310
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,880
 And if you say yes, they eat you.

311
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,280
 The good aliens will not ask you.

312
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,880
 And this is what they say the difference is.

313
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,920
 The evil aliens, part of their law, part of their rules, again they have rules for some

314
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,240
 reason, they have to ask you.

315
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,720
 They have to trick you into coming onto their ship.

316
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,240
 And then at that time, you're basically filled with fear.

317
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,760
 You finally see the horrible things that are going to happen to you.

318
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,440
 The torture, they let you know they're going to eat you, they're going to eat you slowly.

319
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,580
 And that makes you produce this chemical called Adrenal Chrome in your blood, which apparently

320
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:19,940
 makes your blood not only incredibly tasty, but also helps the aliens live longer.

321
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,480
 They got that from Jupiter sending, they live longer part, they stay young longer.

322
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,120
 The good aliens won't do that, they won't ask you, they won't trick you, they'll simply

323
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,400
 take you.

324
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,280
 This is a quote they keep using.

325
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,040
 Yes, there are good extraterrestrials out there, but if they decide to rescue you, they

326
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,080
 do not need your permission to do so.

327
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,360
 Which on Earth we call kidnapping, but good extraterrestrials will transport you aboard

328
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,780
 as quickly as a ship's crew would rescue a drowning man.

329
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:55,420
 What's bizarre is that last sentence about the drowning man, they use over and over and

330
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,660
 over and over in this article.

331
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
 It's kind of weird.

332
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,620
 It's almost like some sort of, to me, I was like, this article sounds like a conspiracy.

333
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,940
 That sounds like a trigger word.

334
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,100
 It sounds like a trigger phrase, because they kept using that same phrase over and over

335
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,100
 again.

336
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,900
 They will rescue you like a ship will rescue a drowning man in the sense that if you're

337
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,020
 drowning, a ship doesn't come up alongside you and go, do you want help?

338
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,640
 Do you want us to help you?

339
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
 They just rescue you.

340
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,760
 They throw you out a life preserver.

341
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
 They throw you out a life saver.

342
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
 Climb on it.

343
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
 They don't ask and get your permission.

344
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,040
 They just help you.

345
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,520
 So that's how they differentiate the two.

346
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,880
 The evil aliens will show up and say, would you like to come on our ship?

347
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,160
 And you're like, yeah, I've always wanted to meet an alien.

348
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,600
 You get on the little walkway.

349
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,760
 Door shuts behind you.

350
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,780
 It's darker than you thought it would be.

351
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,660
 The lights are dim.

352
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,500
 You start to see aliens crawl out of the corner.

353
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,260
 Oh, no.

354
00:18:54,260 --> 00:19:01,020
 So that's how they differentiate the two.

355
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
 Interesting.

356
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,020
 Interesting idea.

357
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,940
 They tell you the, if aliens show up, the best place to be is your house.

358
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,180
 You should have four weeks of food, which isn't a bad idea anyways, but you should have four

359
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,600
 weeks of food, four weeks of water, which would be very heavy, but that's their idea.

360
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,960
 And the reason why, they actually, the reason why you should stay in your house when the

361
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,400
 aliens show up is very, very simple.

362
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,080
 Don't know why I didn't think of this during a zombie invasion or anything.

363
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
 Aliens show up.

364
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,360
 A man's home is his castle.

365
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
 Bam.

366
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
 That's all you need to know.

367
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,800
 Trump's all technology.

368
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,080
 Trump's transported technology, laser beams, conventional firearms.

369
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,560
 A man's home is his castle.

370
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,080
 That's universal law.

371
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,160
 They can't get you in your house, apparently.

372
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,660
 They also recommend you to put signs up on your front lawn that say, "Do not get on

373
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,820
 the ships."

374
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,060
 To help spread the message for other people to not get on the ships.

375
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:54,660
 Now those signs will probably not be really popular in a navy town, but I don't think

376
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,060
 they'd be popular in any town.

377
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,460
 And if you have a homeowners association, you're going to be in a lot of trouble because

378
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,740
 if you, if you, if you were walking by a house in your neighborhood and you saw a sign that

379
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,380
 said, "Do not get on the ships," you're going to think the people who live there are crazy.

380
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,320
 And as you, every time you pass their house, you hear Jupiter ascending, playing at top

381
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
 volume.

382
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,160
 Now again, the people who believe in this stuff don't really care if people think they're

383
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
 crazy.

384
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,680
 It's part and parcel of their belief.

385
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,400
 They think that being thought of being crazy is persecution.

386
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,960
 So they're totally fine with it.

387
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,440
 But again, I don't recommend that.

388
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,120
 I guess I should have said this in the beginning, but again, it probably don't have to say it.

389
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,600
 Don't do any of this.

390
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,760
 Don't put a sign out on your front lawn saying, "Do not get on the ships."

391
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,700
 They also recommend, and they took a while for them to clarify this.

392
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,620
 Early on in the article, they said, "Wrap your cell phone in metal."

393
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,940
 And I'm thinking, who wrote this, Superman?

394
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,540
 Like who has the ability to wrap metal?

395
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
 Tin?

396
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
 Maybe, with pliers?

397
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,480
 But am I supposed to use iron?

398
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,580
 Am I supposed to use steel?

399
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,540
 About, I don't know, 20 minutes reading in the article, they specify aluminum foil, which

400
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,620
 I guess is a metal.

401
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,240
 But you might want to have said that earlier before people went out to Home Depot and got

402
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,840
 a giant metal crunching machine to wrap their cell phone in.

403
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,000
 It would actually be easier than wrapping your cell phone in metal to just throw your

404
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,560
 cell phone away.

405
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,720
 But they say wrap your cell phone in aluminum foil and then about, I don't know, 5-10 minutes

406
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,200
 after reading that, they started calling it metal again.

407
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
 So guys, come on.

408
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,840
 You gotta be specific.

409
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,760
 Our lives are at stake.

410
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,680
 They say that.

411
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,440
 This was probably my favorite part.

412
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,380
 This was a revelation to me.

413
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,900
 I don't know if you knew this, but this was a heading.

414
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,400
 This was like a specific part of their article.

415
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,540
 And trust me, dude, it took me like an hour to read this whole thing.

416
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,540
 It's massive.

417
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,300
 But this was a specific part of their article.

418
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
 Headlined.

419
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
 Aliens.

420
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,860
 Use carpet.

421
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,620
 And wooden desks.

422
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,300
 Just like judges do.

423
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,420
 So forget all the idea of the stainless steel spaceship.

424
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,840
 Forget the idea of hover chairs or giant vials of water that they float around in.

425
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
 Nope.

426
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,600
 They use carpet and wooden desks just like you can go and buy at any retail store.

427
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
 They use them.

428
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,400
 This comes from a whistleblower named Bill Shonoblin.

429
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,960
 Comes from this guy, credible name.

430
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,920
 In the 1970s, he was all of this at the same time.

431
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,440
 They were very specific.

432
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,520
 Bill was all of these things at the same time.

433
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,000
 He was a high ranking freemason.

434
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Okay.

435
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,620
 A witch.

436
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,940
 A satanic priest.

437
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,420
 That's kind of doubling up.

438
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,860
 That's like when you split your classes on D&D and you want to go as like a rogue and a

439
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
 bard.

440
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,260
 You're never great at any one of them, but you're kind of good at both of them.

441
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,540
 I don't know why he would be both a satanic priest and a witch.

442
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,900
 You got to specify your class if you really want to rank up in your levels and get to

443
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,980
 the good stuff.

444
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,340
 High ranking freemason.

445
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
 A witch.

446
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,100
 A satanic priest.

447
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,220
 And a Catholic priest.

448
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,380
 All of the same time.

449
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,320
 I have three jobs and do the podcast and I'm busy and I don't deal with aliens or witchcraft.

450
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
 So I can't imagine how busy this guy was.

451
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,240
 But all at the same time he was all four of those.

452
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,720
 And so Bill ends up getting abducted by four aliens.

453
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,120
 Four aliens.

454
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,120
 He's abducted by a gra-- this was in the 1970s, by the way.

455
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,040
 So he was abducted and when he goes to their spaceship, he sees four aliens in a carpeted

456
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,600
 room behind a desk.

457
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,060
 Now I'm going to assume that he was quote unquote "abducted on Halloween" and he was

458
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,540
 just taken to the freemason lodge.

459
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,660
 But apparently he was abducted into a spaceship that has carpeting.

460
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
 I'm assuming shag.

461
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,180
 It was the 70s.

462
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,180
 And a wooden desk.

463
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,580
 And here who was sitting behind the desk.

464
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,740
 A gray alien.

465
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:50,220
 A Nordic, which are the tall, blonde hair, blue-eyed white aliens, which these guys say are evil.

466
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,700
 Generally they're considered good aliens that fight the grays, but in this world they're

467
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
 evil.

468
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,240
 So a gray, a Nordic, a thing with a squid face, which is the first thing I thought of

469
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,940
 was plo-cune from Attack of the Clones, the Jedi with the squid face.

470
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,960
 Or you could really say any species of-- not the Mon Calamari, who were the other ones.

471
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,540
 They were actually squid-faced ones.

472
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,560
 But anyway, so he's saying, this guy might be George Lucas, but-- and we're definitely

473
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,140
 going to get to that because he sees a gray, a Nordic, a squid face thing.

474
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:25,700
 And then, this-- here's a quote, "One of the aliens in the center was all in black.

475
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,180
 Tall and masked.

476
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,740
 He looked vaguely like Darth Vader, oddly enough."

477
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,080
 Not really, exactly.

478
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,300
 This happened before Star Wars came out.

479
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:41,340
 So either Darth Vader is a real alien-- according to this, that there is a real alien out there

480
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,460
 who looks like Darth Vader.

481
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,180
 And we're supposed to wrap our cell phones in metal because of this.

482
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,300
 Because of this guy's testimony.

483
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,860
 But anyway, so these alien-- Darth Vader, plo-cune, a gray and a Nordic abduct him.

484
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,700
 He's like, "Oh, you got a nice carpeting," and they're like, "Silence!"

485
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,100
 This is the reason why they abducted him.

486
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
 He's not a good enough mason.

487
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,820
 They said, "You need to go down and be a better mason."

488
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,820
 They put him back on Earth.

489
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,460
 That was the end of that story.

490
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,660
 It had nothing to do with getting abducted on ships.

491
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,020
 It had nothing to do with the cell phones being wrapped in metal, nothing.

492
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,020
 They just threw that in there.

493
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,700
 I don't-- and I guess they threw it in there as proof?

494
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,060
 But that's-- that's-- come on, that's ridiculous.

495
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,660
 Carpet and desks and Darth Vader all telling someone to be a better mason and then dropping

496
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,420
 him off, that's ridiculous.

497
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,420
 That is a total waste of technology.

498
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,860
 If their bosses ever found out they used that beam-up technology for something that stupid,

499
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,900
 I guarantee they're getting fired.

500
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,220
 Then they have the heading.

501
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,620
 Yeah, but you didn't know this.

502
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:46,140
 We also find out that aliens act like lawyers, not robots.

503
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,140
 They don't act like they're aliens.

504
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,380
 They don't act like Darth Vader.

505
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,540
 So apparently at Roswell-- I love this quote.

506
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,220
 Before they tell this story, this is the quote the website says.

507
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,500
 The other story is harder to verify, but we find no reason to not believe it.

508
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,140
 At Roswell, when the ship crashed-- okay.

509
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,820
 There's some aliens who showed up to be like, "Hey man, sorry our ship crashed, but we

510
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,580
 need our stuff back."

511
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:16,060
 One of the aliens who walked in, Gray Alien, had a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist.

512
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,060
 A briefcase.

513
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,820
 A briefcase that a normal human would carry around.

514
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,660
 Now you know how thin a Gray's wrists are?

515
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,220
 You wouldn't have to be baby handcuffs.

516
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,380
 You'd have to be tiny little baby handcuffs.

517
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,960
 It'd be the size of a bagelbite handcuff.

518
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,700
 After that nugget that the alien walks in with a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, quote,

519
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,340
 that is he was acting as a regular lawyer.

520
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,680
 When is the last-- when's the first time you've seen a lawyer with a briefcase handcuffed

521
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,940
 to him?

522
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,740
 Outside of Jupiter ascending.

523
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,620
 Outside of a movie where a guy's carrying around nuclear codes.

524
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:54,880
 I've never seen a lawyer, even in television, having a briefcase handcuffed to him.

525
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,180
 But apparently that's how regular lawyers work in this world.

526
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,420
 Did you know?

527
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,980
 Did you know?

528
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,900
 That you are being programmed to trust aliens?

529
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,700
 Here's some examples of friendly aliens on television.

530
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,180
 Tell me which ones don't belong here.

531
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,060
 Teletubbies?

532
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,620
 No explanation given.

533
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,380
 There's just a picture of teletubbies.

534
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,500
 That's it.

535
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,220
 My little ponies, we do have explanations for the next two.

536
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,220
 My little ponies.

537
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,100
 Did you know they're aliens?

538
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,500
 Quote, these almond-shaped creatures do not look anything like ponies, but they make some

539
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,260
 very colorful aliens.

540
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,820
 I think they left a key word out there.

541
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
 Now I'm not sitting here.

542
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,260
 I just don't want to crap all over these guys because they can't copy edit their manifesto

543
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,820
 that's supposedly supposed to save your life and your soul from eternal torment.

544
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:48,580
 These almond-eyed shaped creatures, they don't look anything like almonds.

545
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,580
 They look more like ponies than they look like almonds.

546
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,740
 But anyways, they're aliens.

547
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,180
 They're getting people to believe in aliens.

548
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,980
 Dora the Explorer is an alien.

549
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,980
 Did you know that?

550
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,980
 Dora.

551
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,140
 Little Dora.

552
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:09,900
 Dora's her giant eyes and almost non-existent nose and quote, a monkey friend who was about

553
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,100
 the right size for a gray alien.

554
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,420
 Gray aliens are like three or four feet tall.

555
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,060
 Dora is three or four feet tall.

556
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,900
 I don't get a...

557
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,060
 We're bordering on Han's territory because they're just looking at pictures of stuff.

558
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,700
 And what's weird is they then choose, this is the last example of aliens that are friendly

559
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,700
 to us.

560
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
 Barney the Reptilian.

561
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,860
 No, there's just a picture of him and it says Barney the Reptilian.

562
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,860
 No telling me why.

563
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,820
 And no one watches that show anymore either.

564
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
 It's so funny.

565
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,180
 Nobody watches that show.

566
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,460
 But let's get into the real stuff.

567
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,060
 Now they believe that simply by ha...

568
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,020
 So the aliens have to ask you to board on their ship.

569
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,380
 You have all this predictive programming on.

570
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,940
 Jupiter Sene was the number one film, 12 months in a row, everyone in America, everyone in

571
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,280
 the world saw it at least five times.

572
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,420
 Everyone watches My Little Pony's Friendship is Magic.

573
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,740
 Everyone's a huge Dora the Explorer fan.

574
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,740
 We can't get away.

575
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,900
 We love this stuff so much.

576
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,780
 All of our lawyers have handcuffs attached to their briefcases.

577
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,300
 It is a truly wonderful world that the alien overlords have created for us.

578
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,860
 But they do have to ask for our permission to come on the ship.

579
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,860
 Now they do.

580
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,980
 There is a caveat to that.

581
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,740
 If you have an EBT card, which is a food card, which is basically food stamps in America.

582
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:31,280
 If you have an EBT card, you've actually signed away your rights to say no, I don't want to

583
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
 get on the ship.

584
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,080
 If you have an EBT card, it's too late.

585
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,440
 You get food stamps from the government, actually in the fine print, you are now selling your

586
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,480
 soul to the aliens.

587
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
 Maybe.

588
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,840
 Because even these guys say, we don't know if that's true.

589
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,160
 Like it might be true.

590
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,680
 Then why are you even saying it?

591
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,840
 Why are you even throwing it out there saying, ah, it might be in the fine print.

592
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,260
 I don't know, a lot of stuff might be in a lot of fine print.

593
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,060
 I may go to get my car serviced at Jiffy Lube and I don't look at the little alien claws

594
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,940
 at the bottom saying, by authorizing us to do these repairs, you will get on the ship.

595
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,940
 So I'm like, what's this about?

596
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,660
 And they're like, ah, just sign it.

597
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,660
 You have EBT?

598
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,660
 Yeah, well, you already signed it.

599
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,660
 It's fine.

600
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,940
 I mean, like, you should know.

601
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,620
 This is life or death, guys.

602
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,460
 You should know whether or not me having food stamps will make me get abducted by aliens.

603
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,340
 But now we get into the dreams.

604
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:24,120
 This is an interesting place to end this at, because I got a humdinger for you.

605
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,560
 If you guys are just like, hey, he's reading off a crazy website.

606
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,040
 This is kind of wacky.

607
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,040
 The story gets weird in the end.

608
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,320
 It's really weird.

609
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,160
 There's dreams of people going to Wal-

610
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,880
 A lot of dreams about Walmart, Audelena.

611
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,320
 Dreams about people going to Walmart and not coming out.

612
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,880
 These are dreams that people have submitted to them.

613
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,520
 Dreams of people going into Walmart and never coming out.

614
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,660
 Young lines outside of Walmart, there's troops surrounding it.

615
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,700
 You're in like a huge queue, not like the letter Q, but a line.

616
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,540
 And you go in to get your rations for the day and you don't come out.

617
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,220
 Another person had a dream that people would go into Walmart.

618
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
 This guy was dreaming.

619
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,340
 He was standing outside of Walmart.

620
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:13,140
 And every time someone went into Walmart, two guys as big as sumo wrestlers grabbed him

621
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,900
 and carried him away.

622
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,220
 I think this is just your average day at Walmart, honestly.

623
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,400
 But apparently that means something.

624
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,160
 But they have a lot of dreams about military control of these places.

625
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
 Of these Walmarts.

626
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,680
 They're big stations, basically.

627
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:35,280
 Dreams of a fake rapture, which is the Christian theory that before the end times comes, the

628
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,920
 believers, the followers of Christ, are going to be raptured.

629
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,040
 They're going to be lifted up into the sky and escape all the hell that's going to happen

630
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,680
 to everybody else.

631
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,460
 So there's been a lot of dreams of these ailing ships coming down and saying, "We are here

632
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,020
 on behalf of God.

633
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,900
 We're going to take you off of the planet before the Tribulation and you'll be safe."

634
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,100
 And people getting on the ships and then being eaten.

635
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,620
 That's been a dream that's been shared with these people.

636
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,900
 So what have we learned?

637
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,740
 Don't watch Jupiter ascending because it's going to drive you insane or just waste two

638
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,820
 hours of your life.

639
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,520
 Wrap your cell phone in metal, preferably steel or iron, but if you can't get that aluminum

640
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,040
 foil works as well.

641
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,160
 Put a sign out on your front yard saying, "Do not get on the ships."

642
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,760
 Most importantly, do not get on the ships.

643
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
 At all.

644
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
 Don't take a tour of them.

645
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,280
 Don't be tricked into them.

646
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,160
 Don't follow apples like you're really hungry one day and you see a bunch of apples leading

647
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,120
 out your front door all the way into a waiting UFO.

648
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,320
 Don't do that either.

649
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,560
 Do not get on the ships.

650
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,980
 And after a while the ships will leave because again they have to trick you and then you'll

651
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,360
 be left on a planet that has all the idiots.

652
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,360
 They're all gone because they got fooled by the ships.

653
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,000
 So Jason, you found a crazy website.

654
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,020
 A lot of craziness in the world and you found one.

655
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,600
 So why did you profile this one other than you just wanted to take the piss out of these

656
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,880
 guys and talk about how dirty their apartment was?

657
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,500
 Probably about five years ago now.

658
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,560
 I remember one day I was in Hood River.

659
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,800
 My mom came up to live with me for a while.

660
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,380
 And I was sitting in the living room and my mom comes out of her bedroom and she goes,

661
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,020
 "I had the weirdest, creepiest dream last night."

662
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,420
 So I'm gonna preface this by saying my mom doesn't believe in any conspiracy stuff.

663
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,400
 She doesn't believe in any paranormal stuff.

664
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,340
 No aliens, no Bigfoot, nothing.

665
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,280
 She's super super skeptical.

666
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,420
 But she's a devout Christian.

667
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,540
 And not like a Bible thumping Christian.

668
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,520
 She understands like you know you gotta question things and stuff like that.

669
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,760
 She's a devout Christian.

670
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,100
 She's constantly reading books.

671
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,520
 She listens to Christian radio and stuff like that and Christian speakers and stuff like

672
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
 that.

673
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,120
 But she doesn't believe in anything paranormal, conspiracy, none of that stuff.

674
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,280
 She doesn't even do true crime.

675
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
 She doesn't listen to the podcast at all.

676
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,920
 She comes down the stairs.

677
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,560
 I'm sitting in the living room and she goes, "I had the scariest, creepiest dream last

678
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
 night."

679
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
 It was super weird.

680
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
 And I go, "What was it about?"

681
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,520
 And she goes, "I wake up one morning."

682
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,700
 And the moon has a symbol on it.

683
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,500
 Like you could see the symbol carved into the moon.

684
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,140
 And I go, "Do you remember what it looked like?"

685
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,940
 She goes, "I do."

686
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,100
 She goes, "I don't think I could draw it."

687
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,100
 But it was just an odd symbol on the moon.

688
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,380
 And then these alien ships approached Earth.

689
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,500
 And the aliens were very friendly.

690
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,360
 Very friendly aliens.

691
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,340
 And they told us that the rapture was coming.

692
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,480
 And that they were here to save us before the tribulation started.

693
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,340
 So we packed up all of our things.

694
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,320
 We got on the ship.

695
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,600
 She goes, "I remember when we walked onto the ship, around the ship, like the ship, it

696
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,280
 was a traditional UFO, so it was a circle.

697
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,920
 And inside the ship were all of these like steel beds placed against the wall.

698
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,320
 So they were like upright.

699
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,680
 So like you would like lean back against them and they would strap you down for the flight."

700
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,000
 They didn't have seats.

701
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,420
 They just had like these metal slabs all along.

702
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,020
 And she goes, "I started to get nervous, but the aliens were, and they were typical gray

703
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,060
 aliens."

704
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
 She described it as that.

705
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,700
 I don't think she knew that she knew the term gray aliens, but I think she was talking

706
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,900
 about the aliens from the X-Files.

707
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,120
 She's like, "They were from the X-Files type aliens."

708
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,540
 She goes, "They were very polite and we're getting on the ship.

709
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,620
 And I remember getting on the ship and getting really nervous.

710
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,860
 And everyone else was super happy to be there."

711
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:32,540
 And she goes, "I saw a couple of the metal slabs that people were leaning against and

712
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,240
 getting strapped onto for the flight.

713
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,040
 Some of them were covered in plastic, like kind of covered in like a dark thick plastic

714
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,400
 so you couldn't see what was under them."

715
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,720
 And she goes, "And I noticed one or two of them had some blood on them.

716
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,200
 And I started to get really nervous and I wanted to get off the ship.

717
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,360
 And the aliens were like, "No, no, no, everything's fine.

718
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
 Just here.

719
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,880
 Go ahead and stand against this wall.

720
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,960
 You'll be totally fine.

721
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
 Don't worry about it."

722
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,480
 And they strapped her in.

723
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:06,060
 And she goes, "Then I knew that this wasn't the Rapture.

724
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,400
 Then I knew that I was tricked to get on this ship.

725
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,540
 Don't get on the ships."

 [Music]

741
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,560
 Okay, so here's the actual, you've heard the episode now, assuming you've stuck around.

742
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,560
 After I recorded this episode, I remember when I, the next time I hung out with my mom.

743
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,560
 A couple months later, I was down in Sacramento, hanging out with my mom.

744
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,560
 I said, "Hey, you know, I remember, I go I-ac-cut."

745
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
 And I told her, I said, "You know, I did it.

746
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,560
 I mentioned you on an episode the other day and she got all nervous.

747
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,560
 She's like, "Oh, did she find out I'm really the Pombero?"

748
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,560
 I was like, "Uh, no, I didn't think that."

749
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,560
 But I remember that dream you had, and it was so weird.

750
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,560
 I go, I did an episode about this cult called, I don't remember what they were called,

751
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,560
 but they told people not to get on the ships.

752
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:55,560
 And I go, "Do you remember that dream you had about like the moon and it had that weird symbol?"

753
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,560
 And she goes, "Oh, my God."

754
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,560
 Now, it had been years since she had the dream.

755
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,560
 And she goes, "Oh, my God, I totally remember that dream."

756
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,560
 Yeah, we got, I thought it was the Rapture.

757
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
 They brought us on the ships.

758
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:18,560
 And like, she remembered the dream in detail six, seven years later.

759
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,560
 Just by me mentioning a brief part of the dream.

760
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,560
 Maybe I remember there's like this symbol on the moon.

761
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
 [Gasp]

762
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
 She's like, "That was so scary."

763
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,560
 So it was definitely, and so she remembers the dream.

764
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,560
 It stuck with her all this time.

765
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,560
 The imagery of it is in her subconscious.

766
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,560
 And we're actually now, it's in her conscious, because she can remember it while she's awake.

767
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,560
 So is there really something to this weirdo, what movie did they watch again?

768
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,560
 I listened to this episode about a week ago, preparation for this.

769
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
 It wasn't, it wasn't cloud out.

770
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,560
 Oh, Jupiter is sending, Jupiter is sending.

771
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,560
 When your entire world philosophy is based on Jupiter ascending, you know there's a problem there.

772
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:15,560
 Anyways, anyways, these weirdos, you can be wrong about everything, but be right on one detail.

773
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:24,560
 Like, how is it that they were able to warn people about a dream that my mom had who doesn't believe in any of this stuff?

774
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,560
 Like, it's a coincidence, most likely it's a coincidence, right?

775
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:35,560
 But maybe there is something in the human subconscious that's like, trying to warn us.

776
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:43,560
 These people may have gotten every single detail wrong about whatever lunacy they were talking about.

777
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,560
 You know, like the EBT, if you have an EBT card, you've already given your soul up to the aliens all this time.

778
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,560
 But they could be wrong about everything.

779
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,560
 They just need to be right about one thing, do not get on the ships.

780
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,560
 And the fact that my mom and possibly other thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people have had these dreams and never really thought twice about it,

781
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,560
 because they never found this group, they just was like, "Oh, that's a creepy nightmare,"

782
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,560
 and it just kind of sticks with them for years and years and years.

783
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,560
 Would they be the ones who are prepared to not get on the ships?

784
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,560
 Who knows?

785
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:30,560
 The whole episode is just bizarre, and I think it's a perfect combination of me finding a group of nitwits and just making fun of them for 20 minutes straight.

786
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:39,560
 But then I love that ending that there may be something to that message.

787
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,560
 Just don't get on the ships, bro.

788
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,560
 Do not get on the ships.
