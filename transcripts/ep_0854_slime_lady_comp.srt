1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
 What happens when a young woman has her heart broken?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:11,560
 Does she get over it or does she combine a religious text and YouTube to create the

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,160
 ultimate black magic spell?

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,920
 And then we finish off the week by traveling to Georgia to meet a young man working at

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,400
 a gas station late one night.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,000
 He thinks it's just going to be an easy shift like all the others that have come before.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,520
 Instead he's going to have to fight for his life to take on a slime filled woman crawling

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,000
 out of Georgia's sewer system today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,920
 I'm your host Jason Carvin or I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,120
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,960
 I hope you guys have some fun plans for the week and this is a short week.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,360
 We're only doing 4 episodes this week.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,120
 The next week we'll be back to our regular schedule.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,080
 Someone who always is regular, I'm assuming they don't have any bowel obstructions.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,800
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
 Everyone on your feet.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
 Give it up for Boll Weevil.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
 Wooo!

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
 Everyone give big round of applause.

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,280
 He's rolling on and in.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,360
 Isn't that like a hedgehog or something?

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,480
 Or it's either that, it's either a hedgehog or some sort of pestilent bug.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,240
 Boll, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,360
 If you guys can't spread the Patreon, that's fine too.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,760
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
 Talk about it online.

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,320
 Talk about it to your friends.

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,440
 Spreading the word of the show helps the show grow.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,200
 Boll Weevil, whether you are fuzzy and cute or super disgusting with a thousand legs,

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,040
 let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,160
 We're going to glide out of Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,440
 We're flying all the way out to York University.

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:59,880
 If you don't know, if you didn't have Google to look that up, we're headed out to Toronto,

35
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
 Ontario.

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
 We're up in Canada.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,480
 That's where York University is at.

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,920
 And we're walking around campus.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,480
 We got on like our little backpacks.

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,160
 I'm cool so I only have like around one shoulder.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,800
 I have searing back pain, but it's okay.

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
 I look flippity flopping it.

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,440
 We're walking around campus playing a little Frisbee golf, just enjoying the college lifestyle.

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,160
 And also attending this campus, maybe, this is really, right when I'm one sentence into

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,840
 the story, this is really where we get into a bunch of bizarre stuff.

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:41,120
 Possibly going to this campus a couple years ago was a young woman named Sarah Ali.

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,640
 Now I got to give a shout out to a user online, it goes by the name of Amdrey.

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,520
 Amdrey, thank you so much for bringing this to my attention.

49
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,080
 I just found out about this yesterday.

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,800
 This is so weird.

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,960
 And already, pieces are starting to be removed from the internet.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,200
 So now I'm going to put it in this podcast.

53
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,840
 Hopefully this episode doesn't get removed.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
 Let's just get into it.

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
 Let's just get into it.

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,360
 So Amdrey, though, did a really good job of laying out this mystery.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,400
 What happens is there is a YouTube channel that goes by the name Sarah Ali.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,720
 And Sarah Ali posted two videos three years ago.

59
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,740
 There's only two videos on the channel in this whole time.

60
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,760
 One is called Koran, as in the Muslim holy book.

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,040
 And the other one is called Koran for sleep.

62
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,400
 And they both basically are the same thing.

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,240
 They are a long passage of the Koran.

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:39,040
 Specifically, it's a recording of the Surah al-Bakarah, which is the longest verse of

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
 the Koran.

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,320
 And it's something to fall asleep to.

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,520
 While I was researching this, they do this for Bible as well.

68
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,600
 It's just so you can fall asleep to Bible verses and stuff.

69
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,800
 I'm assuming it's some of the good ones, like Proverbs and it's not like.

70
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,040
 And David slew all of his enemies.

71
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,720
 He killed the babies because they were phyllis thieves.

72
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,240
 I don't know if that part's in the sleeping part for the Bible, but it's something to

73
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
 fall asleep to.

74
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,640
 So these videos are both about three to four hours long.

75
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,600
 And it's just the recitation.

76
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,680
 Now the one that I looked at the most was called Koran.

77
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,920
 There's the two Koran for sleep and the one titled Koran.

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,160
 But they both are the same thing.

79
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,000
 They're both something to listen to while you fall asleep.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,920
 The one called Koran, it shows still photographs while this voice is reading this.

81
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:33,760
 These passages from the Koran and the photographs of our two well-renowned Muslim clerics.

82
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,880
 They have nothing to do with this mystery.

83
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,160
 They have nothing to do with this mystery at all.

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,480
 Imagine you're going to go to sleep at night.

85
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,160
 You want to hear the Koran as you're sleeping.

86
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,440
 It's going to help put you to sleep.

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,720
 It's going to put peace in your heart.

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,400
 It's going to get you ready for the next day.

89
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,040
 You hit play and you start listening to it.

90
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:59,520
 And once you know something is up with this video, you pick up on it right away.

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,880
 But if you are just googling, going to YouTube and you're like, "I just kind of want to listen

92
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,920
 to something beautiful as I fall asleep."

93
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,560
 So I think that sparks the divine light inside of me.

94
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,800
 I'm going to listen to the Koran.

95
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,640
 You just hit play and you're probably asleep, you know, in a couple of minutes.

96
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:30,000
 But Sarah Ali has laid a second audio track underneath this recital of the Koran, of the

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,800
 Sarah Al-Bakra.

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,200
 Now on the one titled "Koran for Sleep," which had 6.5 million views until it was removed

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
 just yesterday.

100
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,640
 In three years it racked up 6.5 million views.

101
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:56,880
 And in the video known as Koran, which has a lot less views, it only had about 200,000

102
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
 views.

103
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
 That one's still up right now.

104
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
 200,000 views.

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,960
 And if you look at the YouTube comments, people are warning each other.

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,280
 Don't listen to this video.

107
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,800
 There's something wrong with this video.

108
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,240
 And the reason why this one got less plays, and the reason why people are calling this

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,680
 out, is because in the video known as the Koran, which again is like three to four hours long,

110
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,940
 the audio of the recital of the Sarah Al-Bakra drops out for a moment.

111
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,480
 And we clearly hear the reason why Sarah Ali posted these videos.

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,400
 This is insane.

113
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,960
 These video are up for years.

114
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,720
 Koran for sleep played 6.5 million times.

115
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
 And you can hear the background check, but you don't hear it drop out as drastically.

116
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,760
 Let me play for you what Sarah Ali, that might just be a pseudonym, right?

117
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,280
 But let me play for you right now what people heard when that audio, and this is like three

118
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,000
 hours into the video.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,480
 This is quite a ways in.

120
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
 Here we go.

121
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:28,040
 My mind is blocking any unnecessary fears.

122
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:36,240
 Let me read it to you if you weren't able to catch that.

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,760
 I'll read you some of it.

124
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,680
 First off it starts by going, "My mind is blocking any unnecessary fears.

125
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,880
 My mind is releasing any unnecessary fears."

126
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
 That's great, right?

127
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,080
 You shouldn't have unnecessary fears.

128
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,680
 Maybe this was my first thing when I heard this.

129
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,360
 My first thing when I heard this was that it's actually quite disturbing.

130
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,840
 But afterwards I go, "Okay, let's be skeptical."

131
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,240
 Maybe she made these videos for herself, intended them to just be on a private channel, something

132
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,600
 to help her sleep, something to help her get over some things.

133
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,560
 Because earlier in the video around an hour into it we hear a voice say, "I can swallow

134
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,800
 pills easily.

135
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,840
 I can swallow pills like anybody.

136
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,200
 I overcome my fear from swallowing pills.

137
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,960
 I can swallow pills easily.

138
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,000
 I can swallow pills like anybody.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,360
 I overcome my fear from swallowing pills.

140
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,160
 I can swallow pills easily.

141
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
 I can swallow pills like anybody.

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,560
 I overcome my fear from swallowing pills.

143
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,320
 I can swallow pills easily.

144
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,340
 I can swallow pills like anybody.

145
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,720
 I overcome my fear from swallowing pills.

146
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,480
 I can swallow pills easily.

147
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,520
 I can swallow pills like anybody.

148
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,880
 I overcome my fear from swallowing pills.

149
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
 I can swallow pills easily."

150
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,680
 And that says, "I can swallow pills easily.

151
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,000
 I can swallow pills like anybody."

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Or yeah.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,600
 And I overcome my fear from swallowing pills.

154
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,560
 So it sounds like maybe she's trying to do some introspection, right?

155
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,640
 It might be that she's trying to self hypnotize or law of attraction this.

156
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
 And she takes the Quran which she finds solace in and she puts this underneath.

157
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,760
 But let's listen to the rest of this track, the one that's really disturbing people.

158
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,440
 So again, I cut it off after she says my mind is blocking any unnecessary fears.

159
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:47,720
 Listen to this now.

160
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,280
 My mind is blocking any unnecessary fears.

161
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,480
 My mind is releasing any unnecessary fears.

162
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,720
 Owen Brown gets dumped and ghosted by any woman he is talking to.

163
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 Owen Brown gets dumped and ghosted by any woman he is dating.

164
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,000
 Owen Brown gets dumped and ghosted by any woman he is talking to.

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Owen Brown gets dumped and ghosted by any woman he is dating.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,280
 Owen Brown gets dumped and ghosted by any woman he is talking to.

167
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,360
 Owen Brown gets dumped and ghosted by any woman he is dating.

168
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,040
 The relationship between Owen Brown and any woman he is talking to get destroyed.

169
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,640
 The relationship between Owen Brown and any woman he is dating gets destroyed.

170
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
 The relationship between Owen Brown and any woman he is dating gets destroyed.

171
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
 I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan.

172
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,640
 In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.

173
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,400
 Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.

174
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
 It's a spell.

175
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
 Right?

176
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,760
 I mean, law of attraction is one of those things that does kind of stand in between

177
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,440
 the world of magic and science.

178
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,000
 But you know, there's always that big thing about law of attraction.

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 It's attraction, right?

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,920
 You're trying to bring stuff to you.

181
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,960
 This is definitely going after somebody named Owen Brown.

182
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,800
 Owen Brown gets dumped and ghosted by any woman he is talking to.

183
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,080
 Owen Brown gets dumped and ghosted by any woman he is dating.

184
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,240
 The relationship between--it goes on and on.

185
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,320
 And remember, we only know this is what she says here.

186
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,080
 Because this is what we can hear clearly.

187
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,640
 The rest of the video--it's three to four hours long.

188
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
 There's two different videos.

189
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,720
 One's four hours long, one's three hours long.

190
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,760
 What in the world is she saying the rest of the time?

191
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
 We do have a clip.

192
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,560
 I can actually tell you one of the things she says in this video.

193
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,440
 And this is why people have kind of started to piece things together.

194
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,040
 She says, "This is four hours and seven minutes into the video, Quran."

195
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,640
 Oh, I'm not going to play it again.

196
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,440
 Owen Brown is spending the rest of his life with me.

197
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,720
 Owen Brown is coming back to York University for me.

198
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,280
 Owen Brown, listen to every word I say to him.

199
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,480
 Owen Brown, listen to every order I give to him.

200
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,880
 And people have started talking about this online.

201
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,640
 This really blew up recently on this Reddit thread that Omdri posted.

202
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:09,280
 Apparently, there was a woman by the name of Sarah Ali who was attending York University

203
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
 three years ago.

204
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,520
 I haven't been able to verify that.

205
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,800
 People have been like posting LinkedIn's and stuff like that, but I think someone said

206
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,440
 they got it wrong and they were trying to find another one.

207
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,400
 I can't verify that as a fact.

208
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,160
 But based on--as she's saying, Owen Brown is coming back to York University for me, whether

209
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,440
 or not--I'm not going to include links to the LinkedIn stuff because I'm not down with

210
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
 that type of stuff.

211
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:37,640
 But by her own admission, she's saying that she's at York University.

212
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,400
 This is the stuff we can hear.

213
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,080
 So you could say--I think I could see a benefit to somebody who takes a religious text.

214
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,600
 They find a lot of peace and fall into sleep to it.

215
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,040
 I can also see someone taking a religious--this might be a little more sagacious, but it's

216
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,000
 your personal communication, your personal link with God to taking a religious text that

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,960
 you find solace in and combining it with something like the law of attraction.

218
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,280
 You know, I could see that.

219
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,680
 But this is--there's no other way to think of this other than some sort of black magic

220
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
 spell.

221
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,760
 She's not--it's not that she's just asking Owen Brown to come back.

222
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,440
 She wants every relationship he's in not to work.

223
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,920
 So you have that.

224
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:29,880
 You have someone spending four hours minimum, right, just getting the file together, casting

225
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,680
 this spell, and then--remember, these are the portions we can hear on the video that

226
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,800
 was only heard 115,000 times.

227
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,280
 On the video for Quran for Sleep, you can hear a female automated voice playing underneath

228
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
 it.

229
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,600
 You just can't tell what she's saying.

230
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,400
 There's no--as far as I could tell, because now the video is gone.

231
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,120
 I think someone's trying to get the video back up.

232
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,520
 It may be back up by the time this is up, because someone saved it.

233
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,120
 But I saved the audio.

234
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,760
 That's how I got this stuff for the video called the Quran.

235
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,200
 But unless there's that dramatic drop-off, you can't really tell what it's saying.

236
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,040
 Imagine cast--this is fascinating.

237
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,120
 It's super sacrilegious, right?

238
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
 It's super sacrilegious.

239
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,120
 So we'll set that--that's obviously not what these holy texts were intended for.

240
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:24,400
 But on a--on a--on a parapsychological level, Sarah Ali, or this person going by that name,

241
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:36,160
 crafted a spell that was played minimum 6.5 million times for hours and hours and hours.

242
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,280
 And really, with Law of Attraction, one of the most--really, people would argue, the

243
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,800
 most important time for Law of Attraction is the moment before sleep.

244
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,960
 That is when the subconscious is the most ready to accept your impressions upon it.

245
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,600
 And that's what this does, but it not just does it to her.

246
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:05,280
 She's not just sneaking it in for Owen Brown, 6.5 million plays of people listening to this

247
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,080
 right before they fall to sleep.

248
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:14,960
 And really, 4 hours into their sleep, maybe with the headphones on, this voice talking,

249
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,720
 this voice cursing, Owen Brown.

250
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,480
 I think it's a very--has a very, very, very low likelihood of an ARG.

251
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,400
 That's one of the things that I think you have to be aware of when you're a paranormal,

252
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,760
 investigator paranormal, podcaster, YouTuber, whatever label you want to use.

253
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,720
 ARGs, while they are fun, are not good things to cover because they're just kind of--the

254
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,640
 ending's kind of like, "Oh, and a bunch of people made it up."

255
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,560
 I don't like--ARGs are very, very fun.

256
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,800
 I'm not knocking ARGs, but I don't cover them personally.

257
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
 I don't cover them.

258
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,360
 But there are people who do, and they get a lot of fun, and they have a lot of fun with

259
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
 them.

260
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:01,840
 But I don't think--I don't think the average ARG would take a holy text and wrap clues in

261
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,240
 it like that.

262
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,840
 So, I kind of--I did think that it could have been an ARG when I first saw the post,

263
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,080
 and once I started looking into it and watching the videos for myself and taking--taking a

264
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
 fall asleep, I'm like, "I'll test this.

265
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,920
 Owen Brown, here comes another horrible relationship for you."

266
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,400
 As I started looking at it, I go, "It's most likely not an ARG."

267
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:27,360
 I think either she made it for herself, and she didn't realize that you could private

268
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,360
 a video, and she made it for herself to listen to, which still makes it a black magic spell,

269
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
 right?

270
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,640
 A lot of attraction is to bring stuff to you.

271
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,000
 Once you start cursing other people, then it's a curse, right?

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,880
 But then you have to realize that Sarah Ali has 34,000 subscribers.

273
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,200
 So while she could have uploaded the videos for herself three years ago and not knowing

274
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,560
 that there was a private function to watch the video privately, I'm not--she would know

275
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,240
 that she had 34,000 subscribers.

276
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,560
 She would start to see the comments come through.

277
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,680
 She would start to be notified, "Hey, you reached this many, so that's more subscribers than

278
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,240
 Dead Rapper Radio's YouTube channel has."

279
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,680
 And I'm constantly getting little notifications and stuff like that when I hit these benchmarks.

280
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,520
 So if you--and if you are subscribing on YouTube, I appreciate it.

281
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,320
 But if you're not, that's fine too.

282
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,000
 Most of the listeners are podcast listeners.

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,760
 But so I think--I thought maybe she meant for it to be private, but at this point she

284
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,160
 would know she should know that it's no longer private.

285
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:36,920
 So what it seems like is a spell that she meant to get out there, a spell that she was hoping

286
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,920
 millions of people would listen to and millions of people would play and millions of people

287
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,880
 would put that message out there and really hear that message in their sleep when we're

288
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,120
 the most vulnerable when they hear that sleep.

289
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,600
 The pill-popping thing--you know, and I was a little cautious about the pill-popping thing

290
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,920
 because on the one hand she might have a hard time swallowing pills.

291
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,680
 I was not able to swallow pills until I started doing drugs in college, which my drug of choice

292
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,960
 because I was college student, I was doing a bunch of stuff, is this stuff called Minithins.

293
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,800
 It was pure ephedra.

294
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,720
 I could never grow enough, I could never take a Tylenol or an ibuprofen or nothing like

295
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,800
 that, but you got me a pack of Minithins from the gas station.

296
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,400
 I was working at the newspaper all night long.

297
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,120
 They stopped selling them over the counter because people easily turned them into meth.

298
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,280
 You can no longer buy Minithins or at least the ones we took.

299
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,640
 It was just taking pure ephedra.

300
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,400
 But until I was in my 20s, I couldn't swallow pills.

301
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,440
 I go to the doctor and they would have to give me medical medicine in a unicorn shaped

302
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,120
 bottle because I couldn't actually take any pills.

303
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,920
 Painkillers either.

304
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,040
 But yeah, so I could see someone wanting to--because it sucks, right?

305
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,760
 It's super embarrassing and medicine can be way more efficiently delivered in a pill form.

306
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,360
 But yeah, I could see you're trying to get over the pill.

307
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,760
 But what if someone's trying to be like, "Oh dude, I have this pill addiction.

308
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,160
 I need to stop taking pills.

309
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 You know what?

310
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,280
 I'm going to work on that.

311
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
 That'll be something I work on."

312
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,480
 But while I'm working on that, while I'm awake, while I'm asleep, I'm going to listen to this

313
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,920
 video and it says I can swallow pills easily.

314
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,440
 I overcame my fear from swallowing pills.

315
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,040
 So this is one of the problems with magic, right?

316
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,720
 Is it getting out there and getting loose?

317
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,520
 It's always been a thing when you talk about doing rituals, whether it's some goofy made

318
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,400
 up one like one man hiding go seek or it's something real where you're trying to bend

319
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,560
 the laws of reality by having a repeating verse go on and having a belief system go

320
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,120
 on in your head while you're sleeping.

321
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,080
 Owen Brown is going to have horrible relationships.

322
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,440
 Owen Brown is going to have horrible relationship.

323
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,920
 And then you play at 6.5 million times to a minimum of 34,000 people.

324
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,920
 Even if she was the only one listening to it for most of the time.

325
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,520
 She has 34,000 subscribers.

326
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
 It's insane.

327
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,840
 You have to be careful of the rituals getting loose.

328
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,360
 The one man hiding go seek you're supposed to do in your house because if you take a

329
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,080
 doll and you get some dumb creepypasta, basically you walk up to, you put your fingernails in

330
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,600
 the doll or fingernail clippings, put down those pliers guys.

331
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,440
 You don't need to pull off your whole fingernails.

332
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,800
 Put fingernail clippings on, I think a drop of blood in a teddy bear and you sew it up

333
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,080
 and you put it in your bathtub and then you find it.

334
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,640
 This is gone from talking about the Koran to a Japanese creepypasta, but you go into

335
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,960
 your bathroom and you touch the bear and go, you're it and then you have to hide in your

336
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
 house and the teddy bear follows you around.

337
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
 It doesn't work.

338
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
 It doesn't work.

339
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
 It doesn't work, right?

340
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
 And so I'm super scared.

341
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,520
 I was like, oh no, I forgot I was playing one man hide and go seek.

342
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,320
 I thought I had to do this episode as this little doll is trying to get out of the bathroom.

343
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,440
 You're not supposed to do it outdoors because apparently then the doll will just ravage the

344
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
 city.

345
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,840
 You'll never see a doll walking down the dark cities of Detroit one night.

346
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,560
 Somebody didn't follow the rules.

347
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,960
 That doll is looking for some vengeance.

348
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
 But yeah, or this, right?

349
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,880
 You have to be careful of the rituals you put out there because if she did not intend

350
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:10,400
 this to blow up, if she did not intend this to be repeated 6.5 million times, she failed

351
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,920
 miserably at that.

352
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,800
 And it has been played that many times and who in the world is Owen Brown?

353
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,600
 I mean, for all we know, this guy, for all we know it's you.

354
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,920
 Owen Brown's listening to the spot guys right now.

355
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,600
 York University diploma on the wall and he can't realize why none of his relationships

356
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
 work.

357
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,640
 Well, it could be because a woman that you had a bad breakup with or you turned down

358
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:38,840
 on a date or whatever convinced millions of people to play a spell against you while

359
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,040
 they were sleeping.

360
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,120
 And this is insane.

361
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
 This is crazy.

362
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,400
 So what I'll say, let me wrap it up like this.

363
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,540
 I said one of the videos was already taken down.

364
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:56,120
 What happened apparently was the video Koran for sleep got copyright strike by a group

365
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,320
 out of the United Kingdom.

366
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,320
 So and Omdri has been really good at updating the Reddit about what's going on.

367
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,260
 They did a copyright strike against it.

368
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,120
 So that one's taken down, but the other one Koran with the obvious audio drops so you

369
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,720
 can clearly hear what's saying.

370
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,920
 That one's still up.

371
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,440
 It's just a unintelligible audio track.

372
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,440
 And in the world of magic and the world of curses and black magic, even an unintelligible

373
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,080
 noise underneath something else.

374
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,320
 So that's good enough because you're getting the thoughts into the subconscious of someone

375
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,320
 listening to it while they're sleeping.

376
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,760
 Absolutely fascinating story.

377
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,580
 We'll see what happens.

378
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,780
 These videos have become so popular in the past 24 to 48 hours.

379
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,420
 I'll be surprised if anyone can get rid of them now.

380
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,940
 I've already saved a couple copies.

381
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,740
 As now the FBI is going to come after me.

382
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:55,060
 I've saved a couple copies of Koran, that video just for research purposes.

383
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:00,940
 And I'm not going to re-upload the video itself, but we do have the video here.

384
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,940
 Just fascinating.

385
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,940
 Who knows?

386
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,140
 Maybe Owen Brown will come forward.

387
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,920
 Maybe Sarah Lee will come forward.

388
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,040
 We don't know.

389
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,320
 But if there are any major developments, we will circle back around.

390
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,840
 Because I've never seen black magic.

391
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
 I've seen people try to...

392
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
 Remember there was that weird thing.

393
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,840
 What was it?

394
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,200
 TikTok versus Trump or Twitter versus Twitter, witches versus Trump or whatever it was.

395
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,800
 We've seen stuff like that.

396
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,240
 I've never seen something on this scale.

397
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:33,000
 I've never come across something that's been able to hide for so long and be played so

398
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 much.

399
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,300
 And it wasn't some viral moment.

400
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,820
 This was created by someone and did it serve its purpose?

401
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,620
 Did Owen Brown never have another happy relationship?

402
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,900
 Dude, what if Owen Brown right now, he is listening to this York University diploma on the wall

403
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,980
 and he's married to Sarah Lee.

404
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
 And he's hearing this.

405
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,560
 Owen Brown, if that is you and you can verify your identity, hit me up.

406
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,060
 We would love to interview you and your wife, Sarah.

407
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,680
 But hopefully you are doing well, sir.

408
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,680
 Bull, Weevill, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonicopter.

409
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,960
 We are leaving behind York University.

410
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,240
 I really do feel bad for this dude.

411
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,240
 That's rough.

412
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
 That's rough.

413
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,840
 And you're just like, why are none of my relationships working?

414
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,560
 Well as we're waving goodbye to a young man, just kind of having his hands in his pocket,

415
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,640
 walking around the grounds of York University all sad.

416
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,280
 We got a slimy story to cover.

417
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
 So let's leave.

418
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
 Let's help Owen Brown get on the copter.

419
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,700
 We're going to hop in the carbonicopter.

420
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,100
 Bull, Weevill, take us out of here.

421
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,820
 We're going to cheer this young man up as we fly all the way out to Georgia.

422
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,500
 [HUMMING]

423
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,820
 Recently on the export, we talked about this earlier in the week, but there was a thread

424
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,140
 about Georgia spooky stories.

425
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,780
 Weird stuff that happened in the state of Georgia.

426
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,940
 We covered one, what was it, two episodes ago about the car in the clearing.

427
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
 Really liked that one.

428
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,700
 Very, very good.

429
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,120
 We also talked briefly about the guy who was just making up stories, pretending he was

430
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,080
 ex files meets supernatural meets wasting my time man.

431
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,560
 As I'm trying to do research for our podcast, as he regaled us with the stories of a wasp

432
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,520
 with a slug body, haunted pirate swords.

433
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,200
 It was just too good to be true.

434
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
 Too good to be true.

435
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,120
 But anyways, I was able to find another really cool story to wrap up our Georgia week.

436
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
 That was the theme this week.

437
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
 You didn't know?

438
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
 Georgia week.

439
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
 This story comes from a young man.

440
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,780
 We're going to call him Brent.

441
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,480
 That's your real name is just the guess.

442
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,060
 I am not psychic.

443
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,860
 Brent works at a gas station somewhere in Georgia.

444
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,660
 [MAKING NOISES]

445
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,060
 He actually works the overnight shift.

446
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,700
 So three cars drove by that one after another.

447
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,300
 It'd probably be one of his busiest nights.

448
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,060
 He worked the overnight shift at this gas station.

449
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,580
 He says, you know, for the most part, totally chill job.

450
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,560
 A lot of truckers would come through.

451
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,640
 And the way it was set up was just for safety, right?

452
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,280
 We're in the middle of Georgia.

453
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,440
 The front door was locked.

454
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,960
 And he goes, what I would do is when a trucker would come up, I'd put down my phone.

455
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,560
 I was mostly on my phone all the time.

456
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,400
 I'd go, I'd open the door, let the trucker in, and he'd pay for the gas or he'd buy his

457
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,200
 munchies, whatever he needs.

458
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,440
 And sometimes I would help him do stuff.

459
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
 Sometimes I'd help him do stuff.

460
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,000
 Just those two bodies.

461
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,400
 He's like, I got these oil drums with a family of four in them.

462
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,620
 Here's 20 bucks.

463
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,540
 No, he did not implicate himself in any crimes.

464
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,260
 He was pretty chill.

465
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,900
 He was either on his phone or briefly talking to a cross-country trucker driving through

466
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
 the area.

467
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,900
 But one night, he's on his phone.

468
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:46,020
 Yeah, high score.

469
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,020
 And then he looks outside.

470
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,140
 Apparently his phone is from the 1980s.

471
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,660
 It has Gallagher on it.

472
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:57,480
 He turns and he looks outside and he sees this old woman digging through the trash cans.

473
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,240
 Now these are the trash cans.

474
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,640
 So let me give you a layout of American gas stations if you don't know.

475
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,680
 You have the trash cans right next to the door, like the front door of the gas station.

476
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,080
 But then generally where you have the gas pumps, there's also trash there as well.

477
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,520
 So where she is at, she's not at like the front of the gas station.

478
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
 This is actually important.

479
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
 We do have to give this distance here.

480
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,100
 She's by the pumps where those garbage cans are.

481
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,780
 And she's kind of riffling through the garbage.

482
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,180
 Now Brent goes, listen, that's not new, right?

483
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,420
 We see a lot of people come through this area.

484
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,100
 It's not super out of the way, right?

485
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,780
 It's not next to the Okifanoki swamp.

486
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,780
 There's no ghost pirates walking around with their made up swords.

487
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,700
 He goes, you do get people coming through the area, homeless people, and they'll dig

488
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:47,380
 through the trash looking for cigarette butts.

489
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,720
 And trying to get one or two last puffs off of that camel cigarette that some wayward

490
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
 traveler wasted.

491
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,000
 He's like, what?

492
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 You wasted this.

493
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Ah, delicious goodness.

494
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,760
 This is all covered in motor oil.

495
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 He explodes.

496
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,640
 Ah, it was worth it.

497
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,080
 People would go through the trash cans looking for their nicotine fix.

498
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,440
 So he has the perfect fix for this, right?

499
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
 He doesn't want this person here.

500
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,200
 He doesn't want this person going through the garbage can.

501
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,640
 Last week, a guy lit a cigarette covered in oil, almost blooped the entire gas station.

502
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,340
 So the gas pump's here, and a lot of it, again, this is something that's pretty common in

503
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,340
 American gas stations.

504
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,980
 They have an intercom system.

505
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,300
 So the driver of the vehicle and the gas station attendant can talk to each other without

506
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
 actually having to meet each other.

507
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,060
 Because heaven forbid, we actually have conversations of any meaning with our neighbors.

508
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,260
 Brent hits the intercom button.

509
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,380
 Hey, go away.

510
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,380
 Get out of here.

511
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,420
 I don't know if he sounded like Beavis and Thor Butthead, but he told the lady to scram.

512
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,580
 Just get lost, right?

513
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,080
 I don't want you to go rifling through my trash, making a big old mess.

514
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,560
 And the intercom goes off, and the woman looks up, and she hears the intercom, right?

515
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,080
 But she looks at the gas station.

516
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,320
 And it's probably separated by maybe, like, what would they normally be like?

517
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,560
 Maybe 15, 20 feet, and it's not that big.

518
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,800
 She looks at the gas station.

519
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,400
 Now it's one of those mini-mart-type things with the big, giant windows.

520
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,220
 And Brent can see out of the gas station, but because of the huge decals for, like, energy

521
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:25,300
 drinks and slurpees or whatever it is, she can't see in.

522
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,500
 He can see her kind of looking around, trying to get a good view of him, or whoever said

523
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
 that, right?

524
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 She just got her scram.

525
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,580
 She thinks it might be the great Cornholio.

526
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,580
 He's looking at her, and she begins to walk towards the gas station.

527
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:45,480
 And basically, she's headed right to the front door.

528
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:52,000
 Now as she is moving towards him, he's able to kind of figure out more of what's going

529
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,080
 on, because even though he can see out through the decals, it's still hard to see full detail

530
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,960
 when there's a giant slurpee in front of you.

531
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
 And she was far away.

532
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,760
 She was obscured by the gas pumps as well.

533
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,340
 As she's getting closer to the store, he realizes she's holding something metal.

534
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,940
 Doesn't know what it is.

535
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,780
 It doesn't even really venture a guess.

536
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:24,460
 But, but late at night, anyone, anyone who's strange with any metal in their hands, right?

537
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,460
 Not good.

538
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,300
 Unless the leprechaun's there to give you some coins.

539
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,700
 Most likely it's a weapon of some sort, whether it be a crowbar, a knife, or a handgun.

540
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,680
 You don't want to have any part of it.

541
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,360
 Luckily, you know, the doors are locked.

542
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,160
 He knows that she's not going to be able to get in.

543
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,760
 So she's walking towards her front door.

544
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,440
 I don't know if he was taunting her at this point.

545
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
 He's like, "Ha ha ha!

546
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
 Try it!

547
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,560
 Try to use that metal against my glass!"

548
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,480
 As she's walking towards the door, he knows that she can't get in.

549
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,040
 And she realizes that quickly as well.

550
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,620
 She tries pulling the doors open, and they won't open.

551
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,620
 They're locked.

552
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,380
 Then she begins banging on the glass.

553
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,900
 She's banging on the glass with her hands, or plexiglass most likely.

554
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:16,580
 And she begins shouting at him in Spanish, but he says some of the curse words were in

555
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
 English.

556
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,020
 So, it was mostly Spanish, but every so often there was an F word or a B word or whatever

557
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,860
 thrown in it.

558
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,340
 He has the upper ground, right?

559
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,820
 He's inside a locked building.

560
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,820
 He has phones.

561
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,820
 He has technology.

562
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,000
 He has unlimited slurpees.

563
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,160
 Nothing can stop him.

564
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,600
 He tells her, "Hey, get lost!

565
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
 Get out of here!

566
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
 Get out of here!"

567
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,340
 Or, "I'm calling the cops."

568
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,240
 And when he makes that threat, she punches the glass door.

569
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,300
 But she's not the Hulk.

570
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,540
 She punches the glass door.

571
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,880
 It just goes, "Wah!"

572
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,840
 Does that vibrate when you punch something that's a little too strong for you to actually

573
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,960
 penetrate?

574
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,480
 And then she runs off.

575
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,880
 She leaves the scene in quite a hurry.

576
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,100
 The faster you would think that a homeless woman carrying a metal something could run

577
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
 away.

578
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,580
 Now, Brent is actually pretty smart.

579
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,100
 He's smarter than I would.

580
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,260
 Because he waited an hour.

581
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,460
 He waited a full hour to make sure she had left.

582
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,940
 I probably would have went out right away.

583
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,460
 I probably would have been like, "Those are my cigarette butts.

584
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,580
 How dare she try to steal this from me and I'm all smoking them."

585
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:28,140
 I probably would have went out and checked earlier because I'm kind of dumb when it comes

586
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,600
 to stuff like this, right?

587
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,400
 He waits an hour and his motivation isn't to go steal cigarette butts.

588
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,080
 He wants to see if she damaged the door.

589
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,040
 When she punched it really hard, he wants to see if she scratched it or anything like

590
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
 that.

591
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:46,320
 And he goes out and he opens the door and the first thing he notices is all over the

592
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:54,920
 ground right in front of the door is green slime.

593
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,420
 He says that this slime looked like, he gives us a pretty vivid description.

594
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,900
 If you're eating green jello right now, stop.

595
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:09,100
 He says that it looked like if someone was eating green jello and begin to vomit it all

596
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,820
 over the ground.

597
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,580
 So there's probably like chunks, chunks of green jello.

598
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,780
 There's also probably like a smear.

599
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,100
 This episode brought to you by Crafter who ever mixes stuff.

600
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,220
 He's probably like a smear of it too.

601
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,000
 I imagine it to be like thick and sticky but also you can see through it and there's just

602
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,120
 kind of like chunks of wobbly green things kind of poking out of this ooze.

603
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
 He says that's what it looked like.

604
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,160
 He goes, it looks like someone threw up green jello all over the place.

605
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
 And that's bad, right?

606
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,560
 That's not good.

607
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,440
 But also it's not just on the ground.

608
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,880
 It's all over the door as well.

609
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,280
 It's all over the handle.

610
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
 And he's saying that's weird.

611
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,680
 Now maybe I figured, maybe I figured she had green jello when it was falling out of her

612
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,020
 jacket or something like that.

613
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,100
 But I don't remember when she was banging on the door.

614
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:59,180
 I don't remember seeing green jello like it flung all over the place.

615
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:07,660
 And while he's looking at this disgusting mixture of fluids and solids, what he's really

616
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:13,740
 worried about, he's really worried about how it came to be, the smell.

617
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:19,620
 The smell is, what's the, what's the, what is the, if something loud is deafening,

618
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,840
 for your hearing, it's that but nose related.

619
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,160
 I'm sure there's a word for it.

620
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,160
 Overpowering is probably the word for it.

621
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:34,440
 His nostrils immediately are engulfed with the smell of rotting animal flesh and burnt

622
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,760
 rubber.

623
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:45,040
 A smell that is so natural and a smell that is so of the modern world colliding together.

624
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,560
 So he figures, I'm gonna have to clean this up later.

625
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,660
 Like I'm gonna have to get like some gloves and a hasmetsuit and a new job and just quit

626
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
 this one.

627
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,020
 Because I'm gonna have to clean this up later because this is super disgusting and super

628
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,020
 smelly.

629
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,260
 I'm not ready to do this yet.

630
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,820
 So he goes back into the gas station, locks the door.

631
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,500
 And a short time later, like a couple minutes later, a car pulls up.

632
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
 He's like, great, man.

633
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,780
 Now I'm gonna have to explain what this smell is and why I didn't clean it up and all this

634
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
 stuff.

635
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,220
 And the customer is walking up to the front door and Brent opens the door to let him in.

636
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,200
 And as the dude's walking inside, Brent goes, hey, listen, I know, I'm so sorry about that.

637
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,840
 So sorry about that mess out there.

638
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,560
 I'm just super gross, but I'll get it in a second.

639
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,320
 And he says the customer looked at me like I was the biggest idiot in the world.

640
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,720
 Like he, the customer was like, he didn't say this, but he got the impression the customer

641
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
 is thinking, what mess?

642
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,520
 What are you talking about?

643
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,260
 The customer goes about his business and his Brent is taking him back out of the store

644
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,380
 because he has to lock the front door again, opens the door up.

645
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,980
 The slime is gone.

646
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,100
 It's all gone.

647
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,980
 The next day, Brent brings us up to his manager.

648
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,340
 The next day he goes, hey man, you won't believe what happened.

649
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,140
 This woman came, crazy homeless lady.

650
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,780
 I'm sure that part you believe that happens all the time, but crazy homeless lady came,

651
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
 told her to get lost.

652
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,520
 She's bang on the door and then all of a sudden she left this green slime everywhere.

653
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,160
 It's super stinky.

654
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,520
 It's kind of freaked me out because it just disappeared at a certain point.

655
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,280
 And he says the manager looked him dead in the eyes and said, quote, next time you should

656
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,520
 mind your own business.

657
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,560
 To which I Brent doesn't say what his reply was, but technically it was his business.

658
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:47,740
 He was literally in a business, but he kind of just let it drop.

659
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,060
 He didn't understand why his manager had their reaction.

660
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,540
 Brent says to wrap the story up, one day he mentioned this story to a friend of his.

661
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,340
 This is a story you would want to tell people because it's just so weird.

662
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,500
 The friend who actually works for the city, we don't know what city this is, but Brent

663
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,380
 says in the city they're at, his friend goes, you want to know what's weird.

664
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,220
 Like, yeah, that's weird, but I have a story.

665
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,220
 I'm a one upper.

666
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,780
 I have a story we're doing.

667
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:16,280
 We so often hear from people working in the municipal district and the sewage workers

668
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
 and stuff like that.

669
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,960
 He goes, they'll be down there.

670
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,480
 And this happens all the time.

671
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:31,080
 The walls will be coated with green slime.

672
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:38,160
 Something down there is oozing its way around the city.

673
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:48,500
 To wrap all of this up, Brent says to this day, when he shows up to work, when he walks

674
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:55,660
 up to that front door, to this day he can still smell the slime.

675
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,980
 We don't get enough of these.

676
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:07,860
 I love urban legends, but I love when the urban world collides with the supernatural.

677
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,860
 It's really cool.

678
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,520
 And it's an underrated, I'm sure it happens way more often.

679
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,640
 We've covered homeless shapeshifters and we covered that predator, that giant who was

680
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,360
 in the subway system hunting humans.

681
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,880
 I'll try to find those episodes for the show notes.

682
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,680
 The older episodes, sometimes those little stories are hard to find, but it's the perfect

683
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,960
 hunting ground for a cryptid, the cities, because people go missing all the time.

684
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,840
 Chicago has a really big problem.

685
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,500
 They have a really big problem with a lot of stuff, but one of the problems cryptid-related

686
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:45,740
 is there is a winged creature stalking Chicago.

687
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,300
 It's been sighted so many times.

688
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,580
 This Batman of Chicago.

689
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,620
 I would move to Chicago if Batman was there.

690
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,700
 But I've become a criminal.

691
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,300
 But there's some sort of gargoyle-esque winged creature flying around Chicago.

692
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
 There's been sightings of it for years.

693
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,320
 It's not like some old, old legend.

694
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,080
 I mean, like years as in the past 10 years.

695
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,520
 So I love the idea.

696
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:19,120
 And when you have a gas station, those also live in those weird spaces in between the

697
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,760
 urban and the suburban.

698
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,720
 Gas stations always seem to be, even when the gas station in a city, it seems to almost

699
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,220
 have its own atmosphere.

700
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,120
 Little gas stations, little mini-marts seem to have their own ecosystem.

701
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:35,500
 And when you have this cryptid or whatever this was, I think more of cryptid.

702
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,240
 Originally I was thinking it could be some sort of demon, some sort of cursed spirit

703
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,900
 or cursed person.

704
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:47,340
 But the fact that it's leaving residue in the sewer system starts to give it a feeling

705
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,260
 that it's part of an ecosystem.

706
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,220
 Demons don't really recycle their cans, right?

707
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,800
 Demons aren't looking for cigarette butts, but someone who was in between a cryptid and

708
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,200
 a human, they're not worried about finding the eternal battle for their soul.

709
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,360
 They're a cryptid.

710
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:10,920
 The cryptids, I think, do exist in some sort of biological reality versus a ghost or an

711
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,920
 alien.

712
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,200
 Aliens, but they're from the final.

713
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
 You know what I mean?

714
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,320
 My point is that I think that's what I would classify this story.

715
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
 If this story is true, right?

716
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,360
 This story could be totally made up.

717
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:26,700
 But if this story is true, that's what I would classify it as, as a cryptid, that again is

718
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:35,260
 savvy enough to disguise itself as someone who for the most part is ignored.

719
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,940
 Homeless people are completely invisible for the most part, unless there's too many of

720
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,260
 them, unless the crime rate gets too high, unless they're screaming right in your face.

721
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,220
 Other than that, they can exist right next to you and you would never know.

722
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:53,120
 You've learned to just ignore them.

723
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,480
 Very, very interesting, very, very interesting story.

724
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,720
 But we're going to put a Dead Rabbit radio twist on it to wrap this up.

725
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:08,680
 The problem with cryptids are that they don't procreate.

726
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,520
 We hear stories about fairies stealing human babies.

727
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,560
 That's how they keep their race going or they drop off their changeling and it's raised

728
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
 by human people.

729
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,500
 But cryptid procreation is not a well-studied thing.

730
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,980
 Do chupacabras lay eggs?

731
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,380
 What's the infant mortality rate of a unicorn?

732
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,780
 These things aren't really well known.

733
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,740
 One thing we've talked a lot about Bigfoot is, one of my fascinating theories about Bigfoot

734
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,580
 is that you can become a Bigfoot.

735
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,140
 We've had stories of people turning into Bigfoot.

736
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,980
 I'm going to have to find so many episodes for the show notes for this one.

737
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:52,080
 People turning into Bigfoot and then Bigfoot's wearing remnants of human clothing.

738
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,720
 So I've always thought, I don't think Bigfoot's are actually, they have a biological life

739
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
 cycle.

740
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
 I think people can turn into Bigfoot.

741
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,280
 It's against their will, almost like a werewolf.

742
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,240
 So I'm a little concerned for Brent because the fact that he's the only one who saw this

743
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:12,720
 slime and to this day he can smell the slime along with his boss's admonishment, is that

744
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
 a word?

745
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,940
 I'm not going to edit it out, I'm sure it's fine.

746
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,820
 To say, you should mind your own business, what if this is the life cycle of this cryptid?

747
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:32,020
 They go about their business but when somebody gets in their way, they slime them.

748
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:38,940
 And now that essence is slowly taking over Brent.

749
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,800
 Like he may have not have physically seen the slime enter on him but no one was able

750
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,020
 to physically see the slime in that area where she left it.

751
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,660
 But he does and to this day he still smells the slime.

752
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,140
 It's still part of his reality.

753
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,140
 It's actually breaking his reality because he shouldn't smell anything and nobody else

754
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,820
 smells anything, just him.

755
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,980
 So right now he's smelling the slime but what happens when a year or two from now he begins

756
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,580
 to find it leaking?

757
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,640
 He's the one who's smelling the slime around his bedroom.

758
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,640
 He's like "What?

759
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,640
 Why do I feel something cold between my butt cheeks?"

760
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,760
 He gets up out of bed, he's a little piece of poop.

761
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,360
 That'd be the most startling thing ever.

762
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,600
 If you got up out of bed one night and in between your butt cheeks was a giant piece of green

763
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
 jello oozing out.

764
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:42,980
 I haven't had green jello since I was six and I might not have even eaten it then.

765
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,580
 Green stuff is gross but dude, I would have eaten it if it was cold 9-1-1.

766
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,880
 I was like dude you gotta give me up to the hospital.

767
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,140
 Green jello just came out of my butt and I don't know why.

768
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,540
 But he just, he's just like "Ah whatever, I'll deal with it."

769
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,540
 Then he's taking a shower.

770
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,580
 He's all washing his hair and he doesn't realize that green jello's coming out of

771
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,560
 his pores in the back of his head or maybe he doesn't care.

772
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:14,520
 Maybe he's becoming more jello than man at this point.

773
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,480
 And then one day he just doesn't show up to work.

774
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:23,120
 And you know the boss goes "Young kid, college kid, whatever."

775
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,320
 He's probably off, he's probably off casting spells against somebody.

776
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,760
 He'll be back, he'll be back.

777
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,160
 Then another weekend comes around and Brent's still not at work and the boss gets more

778
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
 concerned.

779
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,700
 Can't get a hold of him, friends don't know where Brent is.

780
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,340
 And then another week passes, missing persons report file.

781
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,700
 They probably did that earlier.

782
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,220
 But my point is, is that time is passing and people are worried about Brent and he's

783
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:49,620
 never seen again.

784
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:55,220
 But the manager of that gas station that sits on the edge of town, he has a theory, one

785
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,220
 that he would never state publicly.

786
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,560
 Because this isn't the first time he's had an employee just quit.

787
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,800
 Supposedly leave town, never to be seen again.

788
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,960
 It's not the first time.

789
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,480
 He's had it happen many times before over the years.

790
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:18,000
 There are always young people and police know that young people just leave town, try to

791
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 find themselves in another city.

792
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,440
 But the manager, he knows better.

793
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,780
 Every time before one of his employees goes missing, they say they have a run-in with

794
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,820
 somebody oozing out green slime.

795
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:43,300
 The first couple times, manager didn't put two and two together, but Brent is the sixth

796
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,460
 guy this has happened to, the ninth.

797
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,180
 Who knows, I've lost count.

798
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,220
 The manager just tries to forget about it.

799
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,220
 Maybe he's wrong.

800
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,220
 He has no proof.

801
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,560
 Maybe these are young people just dropping out of college and finding themselves by traveling

802
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,840
 the country.

803
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,520
 Maybe there is no connection to these people that they always say are coming to the gas

804
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:10,680
 station late at night, dripping green slime at the front door.

805
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,640
 The manager, he doesn't know for sure.

806
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,720
 And he never will.

807
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,800
 He'll never look into it.

808
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,840
 The manager will be sure that he will never work the night shift.

809
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,820
 The manager will be sure he will always find a new employee.

810
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:33,860
 And most of all, the manager will be sure that he just won't ask too many questions.

811
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,100
 And he won't offer too many answers.

812
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,700
 The manager knows one thing above all.

813
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,500
 He knows how to mind his own business.

814
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:54,500
 I'm going to be back.

815
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:16,500
 I'm going to be back.

816
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:23,500
 Thanks for watching.

817
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:33,500
 Bye.

818
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,080
 (upbeat music)

819
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,660
 (upbeat music)
