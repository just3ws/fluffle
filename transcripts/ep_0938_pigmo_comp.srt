1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
 If you just got a phone call telling you that someone you knew had died,

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,160
 this is a bad way to start an episode, but imagine you just got a...

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,600
 Imagine you just found out that someone close to you passed away.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,000
 Would you think there was a possibility that your friend was actually killed

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,820
 not by some sort of natural cause, but a shadow man did it?

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,740
 Hmm? Interesting story.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,740
 And then we're gonna go ahead and take a look at the conspiracy theory

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,440
 that humans are not all what they seem.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:45,320
 Is it possible that you and your now dead friend are actually part pig today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:53,080
 [music]

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,280
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,780
 All the words, pen, news, about your friend. I'm so sorry about that.

15
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,280
 But someone who I'm never sorry to have around coming back from yesterday's episode

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,280
 is our newest Patreon supporter. Everyone give it up for AskSwo.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,580
 Woohoo! Yeah, come on in AskSwo.

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,780
 Walking on into Dead Rabbit Command. He was flying us around last episode,

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,280
 but we didn't get him in the Carpenter Copter and I wanted Patreon supporters to be able to have their turn to the Carpenter Copter.

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
 The episode yesterday's episode just kind of ended. It just came to an end.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
 But I really, really like yesterday's episode. I just, it was going on too long.

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
 I didn't have enough time to give full justice to the pig humanoid story.

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,280
 We'll get to that in a second. But AskSwo, you once again are going to be our captain or pilot.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,280
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it. Just help spread the word about the show.

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,280
 That really, really helps out a lot. AskSwo, we're going to start off by giving you the hair hang glider.

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,280
 Just hold on to AskSwo's ankles. He's going to jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,280
 We're going to glide all the way out to Canada.

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,280
 [deep breath]

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,280
 Specifically, we're headed to Peterborough. That's in Ontario, Canada.

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,280
 It's January 10th, 1970. And this is kind of a late night.

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,280
 It's late at night, but not too late. We're not talking like spooky 3 a.m. nighttime.

32
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,280
 Just, you know, evening. Late evening, probably a better way to take a look at it.

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,280
 And there's currently two friends staying at this hotel in Peterborough.

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,280
 There's this guy. We're going to go in and call him Drew.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,280
 Don't have his real name, but Drew is staying at this hotel with his friend.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,280
 Now, Drew's hotel room is on the third floor. His friend's hotel room is on the second floor.

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,280
 So, I mean, maybe they're not that good friends. Maybe they're just acquaintances who hang out in hotels.

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,280
 It's an Eloise horror story going on.

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,280
 So, his room's in the third floor, but currently he's in the hotel lobby.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,280
 He's just sitting there relaxing.

41
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,280
 And then all of a sudden, Drew, he gets this very, very strong feeling that there's currently somebody in his room.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:10,280
 This guy, Drew, when he gets this image that there's currently someone in his hotel room, he runs upstairs.

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,280
 Maybe he got an elevator and then ran out of the elevator.

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 The only thing is, is he was running. He was in a hurry to get into his room.

45
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,280
 And what happens is he's running so focused.

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
 Here's the thing. I don't mean to break. I don't mean to break the immersion. You're on pins and needles.

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,280
 This, there are part, whenever you're covering the paranormal, you obviously come across stuff that is quote unquote unbelievable

48
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
 because it involves like UFOs or Bigfoot or Goblins or ghosts and stuff like that.

49
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
 I think for the most part, we believe in those things. That's why we're listening to this podcast.

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,280
 Or maybe you're just entertained by these type of stories, but I know a lot of people believe in some sort of paranormal phenomenon.

51
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,280
 These are things that I call unbelievable believables.

52
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,280
 Because yes, if a story has a UFO show up, I don't go, "What? Interstellar travels? Not possible."

53
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,280
 Like, it's part of, it's part of talking about UFOs.

54
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:13,280
 I don't break down all of these stories. We're about to follow Drew into a room where the unknown, where an unbelievable, believable will happen.

55
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:22,280
 But what I find odd about this story, I'm not going to use the word unbelievable, is that Drew runs to his room.

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:33,280
 Apparently he's on the hedgehog. He's running so fast that he runs, he runs into his hotel room.

57
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,280
 His hotel room door, and it falls off the hinges.

58
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,280
 I still just don't believe, I don't, maybe in the 1970s, hinges aren't what they are nowadays.

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,280
 Maybe this was some totally cheap hotel. It was a Canadian Motel 6.

60
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,280
 We don't know how big this guy was, we don't know how fast this guy was, we don't know how many chaos emeralds he has on him.

61
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,280
 But he's somehow able to run so fast he knocks the door off his hinges.

62
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,280
 And now he's standing in his pitch black, I'm assuming just covered in blood, right?

63
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,280
 He's now standing in his pitch black hotel room, he runs so fast he didn't have time to turn on the light.

64
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:20,280
 And in the room with him, in the darkness, he sees a six-foot tall shadow man.

65
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,280
 Now he doesn't use the term shadow man, shadow man's a relatively recent term in the paranormal world.

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:37,280
 Honestly, you might find incidents of it farther back, but as far as generally used in the paranormal nomenclature, it's probably only 20 years old.

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,280
 The term shadow man isn't something that was used a lot, so he describes it as a six-foot tall dark human figure standing there.

68
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:53,280
 And the reason why I believe it's a shadow man is because shadow men have this weird, I mean I can talk about shadow men like they're the most believable thing in the world,

69
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,280
 because I've seen them, I've never seen anyone knock a door down using speed.

70
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,280
 But shadow men have this unique characteristic where you can be in a black room, you can be in a room with absolutely no light,

71
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
 and you can see the shadow standing there, it's bizarre.

72
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,280
 It's bizarre, you see something darker than black.

73
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:25,280
 So anyways, he's seen this thing now, remember this guy was running, this guy was running around the hotel, they're like stop it, Zach and Cody, and do your homework.

74
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:35,280
 He's running around the hotel, he burst through his hotel room door, he sees this dark shadow with a figure standing there, but Drew's running so fast he can't stop.

75
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:49,280
 So he's running, I love this story, he runs into the shadow man, he's running so fast, he can't, even after hitting the door and it falling to the ground, he's somehow able to keep the speed up,

76
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,280
 and he smashes into the shadow man.

77
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:08,280
 And then the next thing Drew knows, he's sitting in his friend's hotel room, which was on the second floor, and he's surrounded by police officers.

78
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:17,280
 Apparently what happened, this is what everyone reported, this is what was found in the prestigious journal.

79
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:27,280
 I got this story from Docs.com, which is one of my favorite UFO websites, they got it from Wally World UFO page, it doesn't exist anymore, I tried, I really wish it did.

80
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,280
 The prestigious journal Wally World UFO page, this is where they got this story.

81
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:45,280
 Apparently he ran into the shadow person, everyone else at the hotel, what they saw was they saw a young man jump out of a third floor window.

82
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,280
 He didn't open it up, this guy is an incredibly fast man, he didn't have time to do that.

83
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:59,280
 He's incredibly fast, he runs through his third story window, it shatters, and him and a bunch of shards of glass are now falling.

84
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:12,280
 And you know how hotels have like those awnings above the door, so if you've ever seen a Looney Tune cartoon, there's a, you know, you guys have seen the cartoons, when you go into, I've never been in a nice hotel,

85
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:30,280
 when you go into a nice hotel, there's like an awning with a cover on it, right, so you don't get all rainy, so you don't get rained on, and you walk in and there's like a butler standing there, he goes, good day sir, and you go, Charles, make sure that my bags are upstairs.

86
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:45,280
 He's 80 years old, he's like, oh man, yes sir, you packed extra weights just to be mean, you know what I mean, it has the awning and it's like a covered thing, usually green, that's what's in the cartoons.

87
00:08:45,280 --> 00:09:03,280
 The dude, Drew, jumped out the window and he landed on the awning, he fell on the canopy and there was glass all around him, he wasn't injured by it either, no one could figure out how he fell at 30 feet roughly, hit an awning surrounded by broken glass and didn't die.

88
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:13,280
 The reason why I'm telling you this story is that, I think I've touched on this once or twice over the course of 900 and some old episodes, what is this, 935, 936.

89
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:27,280
 I think I've touched on it a couple times and I always kind of hold back because I think it's pretty insensitive, I think it's kind of, I think it could be insensitive, let's put it that way, but I'm gonna try to discuss it in full here.

90
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:35,280
 What if more people are murdered by paranormal factors than we know of?

91
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:52,280
 What do I mean by that? How many old people do you think have heart attacks in bed and you're like, well, he was 82 and his heart just gave out, well what if that night, that night when you carried my luggage all the way up to the third floor, he's like, oh, can I go take a nap now?

92
00:09:52,280 --> 00:10:04,280
 That night, a ghost showed up and it was so scary, he had heart attack, right? It could be possible.

93
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:20,280
 That's not too insensitive, but then I started thinking, what about all the times where people are dying their house and they must have just fallen down the stairs, these stairs that they've walked up and down for 20 years, but their legs aren't what they used to be, they're an old person, they fell down the stairs.

94
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:31,280
 They're like, are you basically saying that whenever an old person dies, could be a ghost? No, I'm not saying that at all, it could be young people too, like freak accidents, right?

95
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:41,280
 Someone skateboarding down the road, look how fast I can go, look how fast I can go, and they're skateboarding and then all of a sudden they get hit by a car, right? Totally tragic.

96
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,280
 But did anyone check if that car was driven by a ghost? No, what if they were skateboarding and then like a ghost showed up?

97
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,280
 Now you scared them, scared them the opposite direction, it was just Casper wanted to give them a hug.

98
00:10:52,280 --> 00:11:00,280
 Now you could go Jason, you've totally lost your mind. I actually have another, I didn't plan on doing this, I didn't plan on doing this story, but I have another story real quick.

99
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:11,280
 Let me pull it up because it is that. I was just reading it last night and I go, oh, that'll be cool to talk about and I realize now I can have to talk about it now, otherwise you guys are going to think I'm crazy.

100
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:20,280
 Back in, this is basically what my computer's full of is notes like this, let me read you this thing here, where did it go?

101
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:27,280
 Okay, this took place in Goldborn or near Goldborn, England, it was 1970, whoa, it was the same year.

102
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,280
 1970, Goldborn, England, it was nighttime, I'll read this for Vadim because I don't have my notes typed down.

103
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,280
 A motorcyclist was traveling home when suddenly a white figure drifted out in front of him.

104
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,280
 He felt an arm wrap itself around his neck and was hurled from his motorcycle.

105
00:11:46,280 --> 00:12:01,280
 He fled the area on foot, leaving his motorcycle behind. He returned the next day with police escort and then it says no other information and that's from Peter Hoag and Jenny Randall's mystery, a book written Mysteries of the Mercy Valley.

106
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,280
 So, I mean, you could have this, obviously only the survivors would talk about it, right?

107
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,280
 And then like this dude, you know, he just jumped out of a window.

108
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:16,280
 Now, let's say that the canopy wasn't there, let's say that he didn't live in a loony toon cartoon and he fell and he splattered all over the ground.

109
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:26,280
 People would go, "Oh no, Drew, he killed himself. He lost the trap and fueled me to the fastest man in the world. Drew's not only the second fastest.

110
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,280
 He killed himself and everyone would be like, "What? I didn't think Drew would ever kill himself."

111
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:41,280
 Is it insensitive to insinuate that not all, but some suicides may be paranormal related?

112
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:49,280
 I think it's super insensitive. I think it's super insensitive. That's a theory that I've had for a while, honestly, and not all of them, obviously.

113
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,280
 Some suicides you unfortunately see coming and there's a series of attempts and stuff like that, but what?

114
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:02,280
 I mean, as a conspiracy theorist, we do chalk up certain suicides to government intervention.

115
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:11,280
 Or, you know, we did that whole episode, the Marconi Systems suicides, whereas all these people were dying in these weird ways.

116
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,280
 Some of them just really painful suicides and it was all of them worked for this company called Marconi, Marconi Systems.

117
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,280
 And obviously we have the famous ones like John McCaffey and Jeffrey Epstein. We've done episodes on those guys as well.

118
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:35,280
 So we don't have any problem attributing a portion of suicides, the young man from Lincoln Park and the young man from, what was it, other band?

119
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,280
 Stonehenge or something like that? Stone Temple Pilots, I don't remember.

120
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,280
 But anyways, we have them that's been linked to, they were going to expose child sex trafficking so they got killed.

121
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,280
 Ann Haish, we talked about it yesterday, was supposed to expose child sex trafficking.

122
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,280
 Isaac Cappy, remember, he jumped off an overpass, linked to darker forces that made him kill himself.

123
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 So we don't have a problem thinking of suicides being linked to conspiracy theories.

124
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:05,280
 I wonder if there is a connection between suicides and paranormal.

125
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:18,280
 I will say this, I do think that there probably are a portion of suicides that may not be the shadow man or just some roving ghost walking around Goldborn, England throwing, that wouldn't be a suicide,

126
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,280
 but he could have died in an accident and people would have just been like, oh, he's reckless driving.

127
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:33,280
 I'm sure there is a good portion of suicides that are demonic, right, that are evil entities tricking you, putting thoughts into your head.

128
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:39,280
 Like once you get to a low enough moment where your psychic defenses are down, they just swoop in and they just start feeding off of you.

129
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,280
 I believe that, it's funny, I believe that so much I didn't even really think about talking about that.

130
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,280
 I was like, well, that happens. We know that companies kill people, we know that governments kill people.

131
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,280
 And it'd be best that they made it look like a suicide just to cover up their murder.

132
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:00,280
 We don't have any problem, we never really debate that, we may debate singular cases and stuff like that, but we know that that happens as a whole.

133
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,280
 And I believe that there are people who are influenced by demonic forces to do that, to kill themselves.

134
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:13,280
 But the shadow man, I mean, it seemed like he was just kind of passing through, like was his goal there to get Drew to kill himself?

135
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:22,280
 We don't know, like what was the lead up to this, but really we don't know in the world of paranormal, there's always so many questions, but he could have died

136
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:29,280
 and they would have just thought it was a tragic accident, he was running so fast in his hotel room, we ran through the window or that he killed himself.

137
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,280
 The family would always have questions, a friend would always have questions, but you would never be able to answer them.

138
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:41,280
 Who would be so insensitive to think that a ghost could have made him kill himself intentionally or accidentally?

139
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:52,280
 But creepy story, probably borderline insensitive, but the world of the paranormal, we do know, if you believe in this stuff, if you don't, that's fine too,

140
00:15:52,280 --> 00:16:00,280
 but in the world of the paranormal, we do know that these entities can physically kill you.

141
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:09,280
 We've covered stories before, it's rare, but it does happen, but whether or not they're physically killing you, these paranormal entities can definitely put the thought in your head.

142
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:18,280
 And once it is there, once it takes a nest and starts growing, then their power only grows stronger.

143
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,280
 It's creepy story, there's a cherry story for you, there's a cherry one.

144
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:30,280
 Ask Swo, ask Swo, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter, we are leaving behind Canada.

145
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:37,280
 Fly us all the way out to a slaughterhouse.

146
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,280
 We're walking around in this big old bloodied aprons and wearing goggles and a hard hat.

147
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,280
 Sure you need that stuff in a slaughterhouse as well, like bones flying everywhere, teeth getting caught up in grinders.

148
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:55,280
 We're walking around in this assquout, it's totally not listening to anything.

149
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
 He's like, pronounce my name right you jerk.

150
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,280
 We're walking around this slaughterhouse and we got on all of our safety gear.

151
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,280
 We're walking around on this catwalk, there's a bunch of pigs making pig noises underneath us.

152
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:17,280
 And I say the mighty swine, this lovable little porky monster man, walking around on all fours, eating poop, rolling around in its own filth.

153
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,280
 Did you know that some of these beasts may be our brothers?

154
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
 You're like, what are you talking about bro?

155
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,280
 And I said, listen, see that pig over there?

156
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
 That might be your 18th cousin.

157
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,280
 You're like, what? No, I'm not related to a pig, dude, I'm not related to a pig.

158
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,280
 And I go, yeah, that's the weird thing, you might be.

159
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,280
 And I just turn around and walk away all slow.

160
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
 You're like, is that the end of the story?

161
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
 What, did you bring me here just to say that?

162
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,280
 This story was recommended to me by Dylan Dobb.

163
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
 Dylan Dobb, Dylan Dabb.

164
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,280
 Maybe Dylan, thank you so much for sending this over.

165
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,280
 It's absolutely fascinating because we're going to take a look at a conspiracy theory.

166
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,280
 This is the thesis statement for this story.

167
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,280
 Is it possible, you're already shaking your head, you're already shaking your head.

168
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:15,280
 Is it possible that a chimp, if you took a male chimp and a female pig and made them had sex,

169
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,280
 would a half pig, half monkey come out of that pig's vagina?

170
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
 And you go, Jason, no.

171
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,280
 Jason, just last week you're telling me that people saw with a 15 seconds delay.

172
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:36,280
 And I've been nothing but bombarded with emails and YouTube comments since saying that I got that wrong.

173
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,280
 And I did say in that episode, this doesn't make sense, so let me report on it anyways.

174
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,280
 You guys, I love you guys, but I've got several emails being like,

175
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,280
 "Jason, no, you don't see with a 15 seconds delay."

176
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,280
 But this story, I think, I got right.

177
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,280
 Apparently, you can take a boar, I don't know if you could do it with a domesticated pig,

178
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:03,280
 but if you took a boar, a wild boar, female, and you took a male chimpanzee and made them had sex,

179
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,280
 there is a possibility that the baby that comes out will be half monkey, half pig.

180
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
 And so, I'm not just saying this.

181
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,280
 This comes from a doctor Eugene McCarthy.

182
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,280
 He's a geneticist who specializes in the study of hybridization.

183
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,280
 And he says, "No, this is totally possible. You actually could get these two species to breed."

184
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,280
 And most of the information I got about the story, I got it from an article in fizz.org.

185
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
 It's written by John Hewitt.

186
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,280
 The article is called, quote, "A Chimp Pig Hybrid Origin for Humans?"

187
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,280
 This is what Dr. Eugene McCarthy is saying.

188
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,280
 He says, "Generally, biologists, when they look at animals and we try to figure out where they came from,

189
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,280
 how they bred, like modern day animals, like what was its story, how did it get here?"

190
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,280
 They go, "We look at the DNA. We look at the DNA and we go, 'Hmm, this is the DNA of a monkey.'

191
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,280
 You see on the DNA, this little monkey man dancing around on the double helix?

192
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
 They're like, 'It's obviously monkey!'

193
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,280
 But Dr. Eugene says, "There's another way to look at these things. There's another way to look at these things.

194
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,280
 You have to step back. Don't look at the microscope.

195
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,280
 Just smash it on the ground. Let that monkey DNA crawl all over the floor."

196
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,280
 Don't look at the microscope. He goes, "There's obvious similarities between species."

197
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,280
 He goes, "Kason boy, if you look at a monkey and you look at a man, right? You look at a chimpanzee and a human being,

198
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
 you see a lot of similarities."

199
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,280
 You know, it's funny because my great grandma, she lived to be 92, and she looked like a chim-

200
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
 [laughs]

201
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,280
 She did. She did. I love her to death.

202
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,280
 But she looked like a chimpanzee and we're Basque. We're one of the oldest living,

203
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,280
 or still around, there's only like 2 million of us left, whatever, but,

204
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,280
 oldest ethnic groups, right, coming out of Europe. They don't even know where we came from.

205
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
 We just kind of appeared one day.

206
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,280
 My great grandma kind of looked like a chimpanzee. Now, she wasn't, you know,

207
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,280
 she wasn't dragging her knuckles or nothing like that. She never threw her poop at me.

208
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,280
 But her face did start to take a chimpanzee look. And I remember thinking,

209
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:20,280
 maybe, maybe the Basque people on the missing link, maybe we're that close to the genetic structure.

210
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,280
 I don't know, but she did. I adore her. I love her. She didn't look like a chimpanzee when she was younger,

211
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,280
 but as she got older, she still looked like a chimp.

212
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,280
 And so, basically, because my grandma vaguely resembled the chimpanzee,

213
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,280
 you know, he's saying that you can obviously see similarities between primates and humans.

214
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,280
 So that's kind of a no-brainer. And our DNA is close. But if you look at a pig and a human,

215
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,280
 he goes, "You also see similarities." He goes, "There are clear similarities."

216
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,280
 You can look right at him. They said the face is similar. The skin is similar to a human skin.

217
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,280
 And they said, even when you go into the organs, get the microscope back out,

218
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,280
 because when you look at pig organs, they are built with this microstructure system

219
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:15,280
 that is similar to a human's organs. Which is why we use pig organs for human transplants.

220
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,280
 Now, the pig heart, that didn't turn out. They recently tried putting a pig heart in a man

221
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,280
 and he passed away two months later. We also, a long time ago, tried putting a baboon's heart

222
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,280
 in a baby, sparking the great Paul Simon song. You have this, and that baby died too,

223
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,280
 so don't look at a formal Facebooker like, "Oh, I wonder what she's up to?"

224
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:43,280
 She's dead. But we took a baboon, tried that with a baby, and then the next animal we tried is a pig.

225
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,280
 And I really, reading through this stuff, it really made me think scientists are hiding something from us,

226
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:54,280
 because when you Google about organ transplants, they're all for pigs. They're all for pigs and humans.

227
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,280
 What they're trying to do, I think it's kidneys to help with people who have diabetes.

228
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,280
 You give them a pig kidney. You can do all this stuff, and they said,

229
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,280
 "Well, the reason why we use pig organs is because pigs, when they have a litter, there's a bunch of them."

230
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,280
 Basically, you can breed them out super quickly. They grow pretty quickly.

231
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:20,280
 And their organs are close to the size of human organs, and apparently they're less likely to transfer diseases

232
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,280
 from the zoophilic diseases, I think they're called. Probably not.

233
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,280
 Probably I think that's someone who has sex with animals.

234
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:35,280
 But diseases that can affect animals for whatever reason, they're harder to transfer from a pig organ when you put it in a human body.

235
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:46,280
 None of them say, none of them say, "Well, it's because pig organs are genetically closer to human organs than almost every other species."

236
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:54,280
 But that is what Dr. McCarthy is stating. He's saying that that microstructure within the organs, it is close to a human.

237
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,280
 It's close enough that you can take out a pig heart and put it in a human, and he'll live for two months.

238
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,280
 He ended up apparently dying of a pig disease while he went around in the mud.

239
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,280
 They're like, "John, John, stop!" He's like, "No, I can't stop!" He's all drowning in the mud.

240
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:16,280
 I should have made a joke about a man who recently died, I'm sorry.

241
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,280
 But pig heart, right? They try to give him a pig heart. They think they can do it again, right?

242
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,280
 They think they can fix it. They think they can get this going.

243
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,280
 Now, I got to Google a bunch of fun stuff while I was researching this story.

244
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,280
 I Googled, "Can you get a horse heart?" Like, can a human get a horse heart to put in them?

245
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,280
 I found out an interesting fact about horses. Did you know, I didn't know this,

246
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:47,280
 that a horse can detect a human heartbeat from up to four feet away?

247
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,280
 And, if you're Googling that, you're like, "Clearly, Jason got that wrong."

248
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,280
 They can detect human heartbeats from up to four feet away.

249
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,280
 Have you ever seen horses running, watching a movie or something like that, and the horses are running,

250
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,280
 and then a spooky thing happens and they turn and they run the other direction?

251
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,280
 Almost like a flock of birds going all over the place.

252
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,280
 You know how they do that? It's other than movie magic, other than a horse trainer making them do that.

253
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,280
 In the wild, they can sense each other's heartbeats.

254
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,280
 So, they move as a whole. Basically, if one horse gets spooked,

255
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,280
 the other horses can sense how fast their heart's beating,

256
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,280
 and then all the horses are going, "Ahh, they start running away."

257
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,280
 So, yes, those are facts. Feel free to Google them.

258
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:37,280
 Feel free to fill my email account as well with emails telling me I'm wrong.

259
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,280
 They can. So, I was like, "But that's interesting, but can a human get a horse?"

260
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,280
 And I kept trying to find this and I kept finding facts about horse hearts.

261
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,280
 I just wanted to know. And I just picked the horse at random because I figured it's big.

262
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,280
 Can you get a horse heart? Because obviously, you can't get a duck heart, right?

263
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
 Obviously, you're going to get like a cat heart.

264
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,280
 And then finally, I found this website and they were saying no.

265
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,280
 Someone else said, "Some other lunatic asked that question."

266
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,280
 And they said, "No, the reason why you can't get a horse heart is for two reasons.

267
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
 One, it's huge."

268
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,280
 They said, "The horse heart has to pump blood through this massive creature.

269
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,280
 So, if we put a horse heart inside a human, it would crush their lungs."

270
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,280
 But then the second reason, they go, "It's too different.

271
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,280
 It's just too different your body would instantly reject it and you would die."

272
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,280
 So, now we're going back to the pig thing.

273
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
 We're going back to the pig thing.

274
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,280
 Because those organs do generally work and we're working to make them work.

275
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:41,280
 Even though they may not be 100%, no one's saying, "Hey, have we tried to get, I don't know, an emu's heart?"

276
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,280
 Have we tried to get, I don't know, like a taper's heart or like a giant tree sloth?

277
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
 No, they're picking pig hearts.

278
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,280
 And Dr. McCarthy is saying it's because they are related to humans.

279
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
 And this is what he's saying.

280
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:00,280
 He goes, "The reason why it doesn't show up in the genetic code is that a monkey and a boar have a baby.

281
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,280
 And the baby comes out as this halfling type creature that has a hobbit pipe.

282
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,280
 It's like, "Where's my ring? Where's my ring?"

283
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
 Okay, anyways.

284
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,280
 Not a halfling, a hybrid is the word I was looking for.

285
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,280
 It pops out, it's a little hybrid.

286
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,280
 It's a half monkey, half pig.

287
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
 But this story gets super disturbing.

288
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,280
 Then apparently, because I'm sure this happens in real life, right?

289
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,280
 Because in humans, I go, "I'm an adult now.

290
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
 I'm going to go have my children on my own.

291
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,280
 I'm going to go have sex with adult women and have children on my own."

292
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,280
 That's what I see every single day before I leave the house.

293
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,280
 Animals though, right?

294
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
 They don't think about that.

295
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
 They're just like, "I'm going to bang whatever's close."

296
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,280
 So the hybrid will then have sex with one of its parents.

297
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:52,280
 And then that baby will be closer to either a pig or a monkey,

298
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,280
 because it's now breeding out basically the hybrid part.

299
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,280
 So if you had a pig and a chimp, they had a baby that's half and half,

300
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:05,280
 and then that half hybrid baby had sex with another monkey.

301
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,280
 Now it's only a quarter pig, right?

302
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,280
 You see how this plays out?

303
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,280
 And they go, "What would happen is you would have this going on

304
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
 so you'd have all of these hybrids created,

305
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,280
 but then they would kind of work out and become either more pig or more monkey."

306
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
 But at a certain point, they were both.

307
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
 They were both.

308
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,280
 And some of them evolved like over the course of millions of years

309
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:36,280
 of interbreeding became more and more chimp-like and became the missing link

310
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
 or came close to human.

311
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,280
 And then some of these hybrids kept sleeping with the pigs and stuff like that.

312
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
 And then they became more pig-like.

313
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,280
 But the point is that some of the pigs that we have today,

314
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
 or really the species pig that we have today,

315
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,280
 is in an essence we have a shared ancestor.

316
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
 We have a shared...

317
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
 That's the word I was trying to get to.

318
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,280
 We have a shared ancestor between the pigs of today and us.

319
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,280
 At one point, we were related through hybridization.

320
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,280
 And Dr. McCarthy goes, "Listen, this could be happening right now."

321
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,280
 And he goes, "South Sudan, there's a large population of chimps apparently

322
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
 and a large population of wild boars."

323
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,280
 And he goes, "There could be hybrids being born today that are half-chimp, half-bore."

324
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
 He says, "That is possible."

325
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,280
 He has a website called macroevolution.net,

326
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,280
 which despite the fact that it looks like it was made in 1998 on like Lycos webpage,

327
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
 it's absolutely horrible design.

328
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,280
 You just have all these articles.

329
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,280
 And even like fizz.org is a mainstream science website.

330
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,280
 They weren't calling him a kook.

331
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
 They were just kind of talking about his theory,

332
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,280
 but they weren't like, "Look at this lunatic over here."

333
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,280
 He writes up all these articles.

334
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,280
 He has like what people get wrong about hybridization.

335
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,280
 And he goes, "Most people think that all hybrids are sterile."

336
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
 He goes, "That's not true."

337
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,280
 He says, "Most people think that all hybrids are created under human,

338
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
 like man-made conditions like we do with dogs."

339
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,280
 He goes, "No, out of the 4,000 hybrid bird species,

340
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,280
 2,000 of them we've seen in nature, like they do it."

341
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,280
 He goes, "Hybridization is super common. It can happen."

342
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
 And stuff like that.

343
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
 So, very, very interesting idea.

344
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,280
 And I was thinking too, let's say it's true for a second,

345
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,280
 that pigs, the pigs of today are a shared ancestor.

346
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
 And that's his theory, right?

347
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
 That they're just, just through observation.

348
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,280
 They look more human than they should.

349
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,280
 If they had no shared DNA, they wouldn't have the same type of organ structure

350
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
 or the micro structure on the organs.

351
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
 They wouldn't have the same type of skin or face.

352
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
 I don't really see the face, right?

353
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,280
 But I guess they do their eyeballs to kind of look at you and stuff like that.

354
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,280
 But, yeah, he goes, "If you step back, get away from the microscope nerds,

355
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:51,280
 step back and actually look at a pig, it looks more human than it should."

356
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,280
 So that's an interesting conspiracy theory.

357
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
 But that's not the end of it.

358
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
 As we're standing in the slaughterhouse,

359
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,280
 you totally forgot the story took place in the slaughterhouse.

360
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
 As we're standing there in the slaughterhouse

361
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,280
 and we're like trying to rescue pigs on the down low without getting fired,

362
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,280
 we're still walking around the slaughterhouse and we're like riding pigs around.

363
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,280
 We're getting in as close as we can to the meat grinder and going, "Weee!"

364
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,280
 and jumping out of the way with the pig.

365
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
 I'm not letting the pig go in the meat grinder anyways.

366
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
 We've caused a pig riot.

367
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
 We're breaking them out.

368
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
 It's like animal farm on steroids, literally,

369
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,280
 because they pump the food supply full of steroids.

370
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,280
 That's where kind of this conspiracy theory goes.

371
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:37,280
 There's someone posted on the export recently that pigs in our food supply right now,

372
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,280
 like forget the whole, if you don't believe in hybrids,

373
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
 you don't believe any of that stuff could happen,

374
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,280
 you're still eating your pulled pork sandwich as you're listening to this episode,

375
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,280
 the bag of pork rinds right next to you,

376
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
 you might be eating a person.

377
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,280
 Forget the first conspiracy theory because the idea is,

378
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,280
 and this totally makes sense,

379
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
 whether or not pigs were related to humans,

380
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:04,280
 we've definitely been in laboratories fiddling around with pigs,

381
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:12,280
 putting human DNA in them to make them more useful as far as organ transplants go.

382
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,280
 We have been messing with them on a genetic level

383
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
 to give them a little bit of human DNA here and there.

384
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,280
 So then, yeah, they are basically being raised to, one,

385
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
 do experiments on that is for human medication,

386
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,280
 or two, to harvest their organs.

387
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,280
 And this theory goes is that they did that,

388
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
 they've been doing that for decades,

389
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
 but because people make mistakes,

390
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:40,280
 some of these pigs got into the food supply chain.

391
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,280
 Some of these pigs that are part human got into the food supply,

392
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,280
 and not like he went right out of the research laboratory

393
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,280
 into an Oscar Meyer weiner van and got chopped up.

394
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,280
 No, they would have been maybe sent to a farm

395
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
 or sent to the wrong location,

396
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,280
 ended up breeding with other pigs,

397
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:06,280
 and so you have hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of pigs today,

398
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,280
 because they're constantly interbreeding with each other,

399
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
 that are in some way partially human.

400
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,280
 They have human DNA injected into them.

401
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,280
 Because remember that first story, that took place over millions of years?

402
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,280
 These hybrids, I could go, it's 50% now, it's a quarter,

403
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,280
 it wouldn't disappear in just two or three generations.

404
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,280
 For a long time you would have pigs that were part chimp.

405
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,280
 So if pigs got loose, not just in the 80s,

406
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:36,280
 but since the 80s, if pigs that were genetically designed to have human DNA in them,

407
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,280
 got loose, not that they broke out of their cages or anything,

408
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,280
 but human mismanagement, that's just a matter of fact.

409
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
 There is nothing that is perfect.

410
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
 So if you're making these pigs and you're like,

411
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
 you hold up the first piglet and you go,

412
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,280
 ladies and gentlemen, this is the first piglet to be injected with human DNA

413
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,280
 and all the scientists are clapping, yay, breaking open champagne bottles and stuff like that.

414
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
 Yeah, that's day one.

415
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,280
 After eight years of making these pigs, you're just like,

416
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
 you're like, whatever, it's another pig.

417
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,280
 It's not this special thing, it's just another thing in your office.

418
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
 And then people are going to lose stuff.

419
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,280
 Haven't you ever gone to work and you can't find your stapler?

420
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
 [laughs]

421
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
 Your stapler was a half human pig.

422
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
 These things aren't even half human, they're just partially human,

423
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,280
 but the fact is that in our food supply right now,

424
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,280
 if you're assuming you eat pork, right, there's two major religions that don't even eat pork.

425
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
 They're just like coasting on this whole episode.

426
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,280
 They're like, I'm not worried about any of this stuff,

427
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,280
 but if you eat pork, you could be eating part human.

428
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
 You could be eating a little bit of human DNA every time you sit down at Thai food

429
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,280
 and you have pork Thai food.

430
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,280
 You're really eating a dude.

431
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,280
 Or to be fair, maybe like 1% of a dude, maybe like 0.5% of a dude.

432
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
 But actually, no, think about it.

433
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,280
 If you had two pigs that were 1% human, their DNA was changed,

434
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,280
 and those two pigs mate, now you have a pig that's 2% human.

435
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,280
 And then that pig goes, that pig's very picky

436
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,280
 and only has sex with other pigs that are hybrids, right?

437
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,280
 And they're like going around and they're having sex.

438
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,280
 Eventually, someday at a slaughterhouse, you could have this guy working there.

439
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
 He's working long days.

440
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
 He has his bloody apron on.

441
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
 He's like pulling this chain.

442
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
 There's like a conveyor belt and the pigs are falling into this vat.

443
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
 And they're like, ah, they're going in.

444
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:32,280
 And he's like, ah, yes, another day, another dollar, another big screaming in my face.

445
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
 Ah, I love this job.

446
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
 And the pigs are going up.

447
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,280
 And then what if one day he starts to see like it's a giant hog, it goes in the grinder.

448
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,280
 And the second one, the hog's a little bit smaller and it goes into a grinder.

449
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
 And then the next hog's just a little bit smaller.

450
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
 And he's like, that's weird.

451
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,280
 That one had a little curly hair, a little bow, a little bow on its head.

452
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,280
 And like he observes, like eventually he's watching these pigs become more and more human.

453
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,280
 And then eventually there's a baby on the conveyor belt.

454
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,280
 And he's like, ah, that's, I mean, think about it.

455
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,280
 Eventually you could have so many of these pigs.

456
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,280
 I didn't want to joke about a baby falling into a meat grinder, even I have my limits.

457
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,280
 You could have this, you could have so many hybrids having sex there.

458
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:28,280
 What if like half, like a full on on the slaughterhouse floor, a pig gives birth to like three normal looking pigs and then like a little human baby pig.

459
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,280
 And you know what would happen if that happened, right?

460
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
 You know what they would do?

461
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,280
 They would call out the foreman and be like, hey, the baby's on the floor.

462
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
 Maybe it's on the floor.

463
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
 What do we do?

464
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
 And they would kill it.

465
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,280
 They absolutely like, because you couldn't let that get out.

466
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:52,280
 You could not let it get out into the general public that the pigs you are eating are having human babies or close to human babies.

467
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
 Right.

468
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
 It wouldn't have to be a full human.

469
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,280
 What if you saw a pig with a little baby hands?

470
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
 Would you eat that?

471
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
 No.

472
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
 So if this is happening, they are covering it up.

473
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
 And that's kind of what the poster on the export was saying too.

474
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,280
 Everyone's just covering it up or they don't care or they don't know.

475
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:19,280
 But if you had all of these pigs that are slowly getting into the food supply and they're different levels of hybridization or even, I mean, again, just slight human DNA over time.

476
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:27,280
 Is it possible that these pigs start giving birth to babies that are 10% human or 20% human or 50% human?

477
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:42,280
 And because of the industrial nature of our food industry, they will just be either thrown into the machines and turned into pork pot pie or they'll just be killed and covered up because the truth could never get out.

478
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,280
 It's a terrifying story and it may be completely baseless.

479
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,280
 I should say that before I get sued by the pork industry.

480
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,280
 There could be nothing to it or there could be everything to it or it could be somewhere in between.

481
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,280
 It could not be, it could not be happening.

482
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:04,280
 It could be happening every day or it could be, but is it possible that the pork products we're eating today are partially human?

483
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,280
 Well, anything's possible.

484
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
 Literally anything's possible.

485
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,280
 So who knows?

486
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:26,280
 But while I will continue to eat pork products because they're delicious even though they might be, even though they might be part human, I would never work in a slaughterhouse because I would never want to be faced with the decision.

487
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,280
 I'm a man in principles.

488
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,280
 I will never, ever throw a baby into a meat grinder.

489
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,280
 I would probably take the baby home and raise it as my own.

490
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
 Raise it as my own.

491
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,280
 I will call him PIGMO, the pig baby.

492
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
 And we'll have a good time.

493
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
 He'll be my co-host.

494
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,280
