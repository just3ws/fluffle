1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A man from the future uses TikTok to warn the world of incoming disasters.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,360
 Then we travel to Palm Springs to take a look at an old story of a man who was just minding

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:21,140
 his own business until his body got invaded by an impossibly strong foe today on Dead

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,140
 Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:33,380

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,660
 Let's go ahead and start off by saying thank you to our latest Patreon, Revren Samuel.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,420
 Revren Samuel thank you so much for supporting the show.

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,860
 Hope you guys are clapping along unless you're driving.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,460
 No clapping if you're driving.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,740
 Just a salute thank you so much Revren Samuel.

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,660
 If you can't support the Patreon that's fine too.

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,100
 Just hope to get the word out about the show that really really helps out a lot.

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,180
 We also have the merch store and the Minecraft server.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,420
 Hopefully by the time that you're hearing this that I'll have the new update for the

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,220
 Minecraft server the new Nether update.

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,060
 A lot of you guys are just shaking your head.

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,540
 You sure like it there's no way I'm playing Minecraft.

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,540
 It's fun.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,580
 If you do play Minecraft top on the server it's in the show notes.

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,940
 If you don't play Minecraft just give Minecraft a little salute.

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,820
 Little salute to Steve and Alex.

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,660
 Revren Samuel let's hop in that Jason Jalopy.

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,940
 We are leaving behind Sunny Sunny Oregon and headed out too to Houston Texas.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,460
 You're driving along we're leaving behind Oregon we're driving out to Sunny Sunny Texas.

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,500
 Now as we're driving there we're gonna go into the future but just a little bit.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,140
 Just a little bit into the future.

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,740
 About a month or two from now that's where we're headed.

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,220
 It's August 10th 2020.

33
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,300
 We're in the middle of Houston Texas and a massive hurricane we watch it start to wrap

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,460
 around the buildings.

35
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,180
 It's like hugging them with high powered winds big alarms but instead of like a hug of love

36
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,140
 it's a hug of whirling debris.

37
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,740
 There's cows smashing through high rise buildings glass shattering all that stuff 30 floors of

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,340
 that sound effect just have it keep going over put it on repeat and then like a bunch

39
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,580
 of stuff it's raining and we're like ahhh we're like holding on to trees and we're almost

40
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,740
 getting blown away.

41
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,860
 Now you're wondering why I took you to this death zone this possible death zone.

42
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,660
 Blame it on Beatrice Leyva she recommended we do this story thinking she's also holding

43
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,260
 on to a tree wait oh no she got blown away sorry Beatrice we're waving to her with one

44
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,500
 arm the other arm we're holding on to the tree she's fine she fell into a mattress factory

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,180
 but she wanted us to do this story so thank you for this recommendation it's now August

46
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,500
 11th and the hurricane is done and now we're walking through the rubble that was previously

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,980
 Houston and I'm gonna sit down on this pile of human bodies and I'm gonna tell you this

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,660
 story why we're here so obviously this is in the future this hasn't happened August 10th

49
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:05,700
 2020 hasn't happened yet but according to one man it's going to unless little asterix

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,100
 let's go back and take a look at this so I'm a sitting on this pile of bodies and it's

51
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,420
 pretty comfortable the residents of Houston make really comfortable seats let's take a

52
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,420
 look at why what brought us here let's take a look at what brought us here so what brought

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,100
 us here is a man known as 2028 man he's a man from the future who the first thing he

54
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,860
 does when he gets back to our timeline is set up a tick tock account which I'm sure

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,380
 would be the first thing we like if you went back in time to like save Kennedy's life the

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,860
 first thing you're gonna do is put a personal ad in the newspaper announcing you're there

57
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,980
 to save Kennedy's life but that's what this guy does by the way your mission failed if

58
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,700
 that's why you went back in time to 1963 this guy comes down he sets up a tick tock account

59
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,140
 called 2028 man he weaves the story about the great collapse there's an incoming civil

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,380
 war Trump loses the election but he won't stop being president Biden wins but dies like

61
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,220
 a month later the thing is is that he weaves his tail and then he also says there's gonna

62
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,820
 be a major hurricane hurricane Kyle on August 10th 2020 that's going to destroy Houston

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,900
 there's gonna be a massive civil war currency is going to fail crypto currency is going to

64
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,700
 fail everything's gonna fall apart but there's hope we have to be kind to each other he keeps

65
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,460
 saying because I don't know what being kind to each other how that prevents a hurricane

66
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,380
 the hurricane's getting ready to beat up Houston he sees everyone hugging and hurricane Kyle's

67
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,380
 like oh and then like goes goes and destroys a meaner city I don't know but that's his

68
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,340
 whole shtick but it's a nice message right kind of falls apart because he starts hardcore

69
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,900
 trolling people it's whole thing gets weird Beatrice thank you so much for sending this

70
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,140
 over because it's a very weird thing he sets this thing up it it blows up it goes viral

71
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:55,700
 like he has like 150,000 followers it it got big very very quickly so we have like we basically

72
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,700
 have dual storylines one is this weird thing about him in the future and the other thing

73
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,380
 is just this weird thing about him as a person so the future thing he says that he makes

74
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,900
 these bizarre claims yes more bizarre than hurricane destroy in Houston one in every

75
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,180
 thousand people right now is from the future that's huge I don't know if this guy understands

76
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:21,700
 percentages but that's a massive amount that means if you go to like a baseball game there's

77
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,700
 going to be at least 500 time travelers there and that at that point we're almost being replaced

78
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,540
 by people from the future that's a lot that's a huge percentage but all of it's only men

79
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,780
 only men are sent back in time because women are too valuable they have to be breeding

80
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,900
 they're like apparently some sort of breeding pit in the future which is just that's grim

81
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,140
 that's grim and that's one of those details that he kind of added in to build the mythology

82
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,820
 or he doesn't mention that early on I don't think he would have gotten 150,000 followers

83
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,820
 if he was breaking into a car and being like oh by the way we keep women in cages they're

84
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:04,260
 far too valuable to be sent back in time he also says he's back in time because he's a

85
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:11,820
 criminal or he did okay he did quote something wrong or something bad he says that people

86
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,320
 are like well wait a second if the great collapse has happened and there's this horrible civil

87
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,780
 war 90% of the population is dead and all the women are kept in breeding pits why would

88
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,100
 it be a punishment to get sent back to 2020 when it's none of those things are happening

89
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,300
 right and he goes oh because that way we're gonna have to live through them like this

90
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,700
 is the worst point in human history from now until the election and all that stuff this

91
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,460
 is the worst point in human history so they sent us back they sent us back to this sunny

92
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,700
 place where we can buy sprite and eat roundtable pizza underneath the summer sun no how dare

93
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,900
 you future okay so then he does the normal thing where he again a surprise this is so

94
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,860
 popular he does this normal thing where after probably about 10 videos he goes I did it

95
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:03,260
 guys I met this person who's going to help change the future so now everything's in flux

96
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:09,060
 none of this stuff may even happen now you're welcome and that's really typical of this

97
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,140
 type of myth someone comes back someone makes these bizarre claims and then they don't they're

98
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,580
 not they were never meant to come true in the first place the person making them up knew

99
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,140
 they were making them up because they were literally making them up and then they go

100
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,300
 oh we avoided it there's a thing called the godlike productions effect or the GLP effect

101
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,460
 it's from the website godlike productions happen all the time someone would make a claim

102
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,220
 the Illuminati are going to strike on March 13th 2015 they're going to do this big exercise

103
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,340
 because there's this military exercise that's planned for Houston Texas they're going to

104
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,140
 do with some so that's the day that the Illuminati is going to make and then it doesn't happen

105
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,540
 and and then they go we averted it because we were talking about it the Illuminati overlords

106
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:58,220
 went we're also on godlike productions they go our plans have been exposed godlike productions

107
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:06,140
 knows we can't do it now it's called the GLP effect you make up a claim it doesn't happen

108
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,420
 and you say it didn't happen because you exposed the claim that's the same thing he's doing

109
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,620
 here an odd detail though when he because I was watching all these videos thank you

110
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,260
 Beatrice I had to lose several days and I still get alerts from this guy by the way right

111
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,500
 I'm just sitting there doing my thing and it did loop and it's like you have a new video

112
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,700
 oh cute now I gotta watch it right because I gotta see how the story evolves I'm unsubscribing

113
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,260
 right after this episode because it's super irritating but he doxes himself which was

114
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,540
 very odd he showed photos of his wife but he also shows his kids and then he takes that

115
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,980
 video down and he goes yeah I probably shouldn't have shown my kids yeah probably or your wife

116
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,380
 and then someone's they I just the video that just popped up today someone was like that

117
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,260
 woman's too hot to be married to you so you start showing photos of his women his wife

118
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,500
 again it's all bizarre and that's where that's a good segue to get away from the prophecy

119
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,460
 stuff and just to kind of this man as an individual now I don't know him I don't know his real

120
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,100
 name but I have some ideas about what's going on here I definitely don't think he's a time

121
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,100
 traveler right I think we're pretty clear on that I don't think he's a time traveler but

122
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,860
 I don't think even he imagined it would blow up as much as it did can you imagine putting

123
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,820
 I mean I obviously put out material I've been putting material out for two years I have about

124
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:29,580
 I'd say 1500 1700 follower daily followers and that's a good I started off with 14 that's

125
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,740
 a good ramp up right if I had put out my first episode on I had 135,000 people listening

126
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,140
 from episode one it would definitely I think the show I think that would have went to my

127
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,820
 head obviously like I think most people most of those bands they were we were talking about

128
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,020
 Motley Crue last week you work you perfect your craft you make an album it's a hit and

129
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:54,220
 then it grows from there it's not like you play one song and they have 135,000 fans that's

130
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,020
 what happened to this guy and it's just at that I think is kind of affecting him in an

131
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,740
 odd way because now he's running for president now he's running for president in the year

132
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,340
 you guessed it 2028 and he's turned his tick-tock platform away from time travel he still talks

133
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,020
 about it from time to time but now he's talking about how he's going to become president of

134
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,500
 the United States and I wouldn't be shocked this could be part of the jokes narrative

135
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,900
 or something like that but I wouldn't be shocked if he actually thinks because he developed

136
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,700
 a following so quickly that he has a chance of becoming president in 2028 to be fair he

137
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,940
 is a time traveler so maybe he knows more than I do but that's weird that's weird right

138
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,540
 though the first when Beatrice sent this to me she goes there's this guy on tick-tock

139
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,980
 who's claiming to know the future the first video I pulled up of his his latest video

140
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,820
 at the time was he was selling merch so I immediately was like this is this is ridiculous

141
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:53,060
 time traveler coming back in time getting his message across maybe I mean most likely not

142
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,220
 but selling t-shirts he's like I just got to make money bro and that was see that was

143
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,820
 the kickoff for me if you were a time traveler and you needed to make money what would you

144
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,220
 do like obviously you're headed back into the past you know you're headed back in the past

145
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,260
 lottery lottery right lottery so that was the first kickoff for me was that he comes

146
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,940
 back to the past and now he's selling t-shirts because he needs to make money when any time

147
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,660
 traveler worth their salt would bring back lottery ticket numbers but anyways that also

148
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,580
 the fact that time travel most likely doesn't exist but anyways so now he's thinking he's

149
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,420
 going to run for president there's some guy going around called 2029 man who's just taking

150
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,900
 his videos and repeating them word for word which is kind of funny and 2028 man is now

151
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,060
 making videos against 2029 man and fabricating evidence from the future and then he goes

152
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,860
 oh I'm just joking people are like if you're a time traveler and trying to convince people

153
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,820
 that you're from the future you probably shouldn't photoshop articles and but now he's kind of

154
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:54,420
 on this presidential kick someone was complaining about him and he goes I gave $110 to a girl

155
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,140
 with stage 4 cancer so if you complain about me you're complaining about her and people

156
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:06,420
 are like what and he did apparently give money to a $110 to a girl with stage 4 cancer but

157
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,540
 I mean that doesn't mean I can't analyze this behavior as far as I know the whole thing's

158
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,340
 an act and he's a totally nice guy and he's doing some sort of OVENT guard performance

159
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,940
 art hopefully he doesn't turn around and turn it into this was just a social experiment

160
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,140
 I wanted to see how gola people were because that's always kind of a cop out thing I think

161
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,100
 the easiest thing would have been for him to make the predictions and then say it's

162
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:35,060
 time for me to go back home and delete everything and that the myth would have lived on right

163
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,460
 what happened was the August 10th would have come around and there would have been no hurricane

164
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,020
 or would have hit Houston and people would be like oh he almost saved us or he saved us

165
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,060
 and stuff like that but now that he's trying to run for president in 2020 it's just basically

166
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,660
 the mythology is going to go on and on so I find it fascinating on the level of one

167
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,780
 just the time travel element two he see it seems to be going to his head and then three

168
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,940
 because it that easy to get successful on tiktok he's not dancing there's no booty

169
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,460
 shaking it's him sitting in a car that he hot wired which is most likely his own car

170
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:13,300
 that he hot wired but again I think there's a short shelf life to that but we'll find

171
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:21,860
 out I'll if on August 10th a hurricane destroys Houston I will give 2028 man $110 there we

172
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,060
 go I will pay him back that $110 but I really don't think that's going to happen so Reverend

173
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,060
 Samuel let's go ahead we're going to wave goodbye Houston is being repaired I'm giving

174
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,900
 2028 man $110 we're waving goodbye to Beatrice she just has her arm in a sling she's going

175
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,860
 to be fine but I was wrong the city was destroyed and we're not going to assist in the relief

176
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,660
 efforts though they're like we could really use that helicopter we're flying away we're

177
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:54,340
 headed out to Palm Springs recently I did a story about the giant shrimp living in the

178
00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:00,140
 wall or walking around in the wall in Seattle and I got that from a magazine called Strange

179
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,220
 Magazine and in that same issue there was this story as well Strange Magazine issue

180
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,420
 6 very kind of bizarre story let's take a look at this there's no time period for this

181
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,620
 and it was written anonymously so you know take take what you will from it but it's it's

182
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,180
 one of those stories that sounds realistic enough definitely more realistic than what

183
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,620
 we just covered Reverend Samuel bring that carbonic hopper nice and low we're going to

184
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,540
 fly over the desert landscape a man from Santa Barbara let's call him Timothy Timothy was

185
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,820
 living in Santa Barbara and he bought a house in Palm Springs Palm Springs a really nice

186
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,540
 area I grew up down there in Riverside County Palm Springs was farther away but is where

187
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,540
 all the rich people either lived or vacationed is kind of a nice temperature away from all

188
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,420
 the pollution so Timothy's leaving behind Santa Barbara and he's talking to his UPS

189
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,780
 man he's like yeah you know you're gonna start having to drive hundreds of miles away to

190
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,980
 start delivering packages and the UPS man goes that's not how it works like there's other

191
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,060
 drivers we drive all over the country what I thought it was just one no I thought your

192
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:08,540
 name was UPS no he tells Mr. UPS yeah I'm moving down to Palm Springs and the guy's like what

193
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,140
 Palm Springs sucks bro you don't want to go there and what do you mean it's like there's

194
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,740
 like big old mosquitoes and there's like giant bugs and then there's like the the the mushrooms

195
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:23,380
 dude the mushrooms that stick to your skin Timothy's what Cthulhu level horror are you talking

196
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,780
 about this is Palm Springs is where all the rich people go Mr. Ups is like it's your funeral

197
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,220
 bro like I would not live there I would not live there Timothy moves out he doesn't really

198
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,060
 think anything of it he moves out he goes out to Palm Springs and sure enough dude giant

199
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,300
 cockroaches are all flying around he said there's five different kinds of fire ants

200
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:48,020
 and then there's the Podex is is terrillus also known as the desert inky cap mushroom

201
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,020
 and he was actually into mushrooms like this was a hobby of his so he's like who yeah he's

202
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,620
 like sees a little inky thing he's like yes I'm gonna take a picture of this because my

203
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,740
 life is completely devoid of meaning click and he would read books on mushrooms and stuff

204
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,260
 like okay I don't think he had a mushroom fetish he might just had a passing interest

205
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:12,620
 but he was intrigued by this mushroom he had heard about it he read about it in a book

206
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,780
 and it's a mushroom that's like a puffball mushroom so it has a little stalk and there's

207
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,920
 a little ball on top and then it goes when it blows up and the spores will just flow

208
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,540
 it all around to plant other mushrooms in the book that he had read years earlier he

209
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,460
 remember coming across a weird sentence in it it said it was quote implicated in attacks

210
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,460
 on living tissue and quote and they at the time he's like that's kind of weird like does

211
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,580
 it is like a triphid is it walking around breaking into people's houses they wake up

212
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,660
 they're half mushroom it also said no matter what you should never eat one of these no

213
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,740
 matter how hungry you are don't eat a mushroom that that attacks living tissue so Timothy

214
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,200
 reads that has horrible nightmare that night about inky caps but then kind of goes on with

215
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,240
 his life so then when he's in Palm Springs and he sees one of these he's like that's

216
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,680
 fascinating I've heard about these Palm Springs it's in the desert and these mushrooms ought

217
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:12,060
 everywhere but they're there and they only puff in 110 degree heat so the chances of

218
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:18,600
 you ever coming across one of these things and it exploding near you is very very small

219
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,900
 usually they're out in the middle of the desert they're puff if it's 110 degrees you're not

220
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,280
 out on a nature hike probably have more serious things to worry about that a mushroom puffing

221
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:34,960
 all over you but Timothy he's living there for a while he starts because he's a mushroom

222
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,400
 dude he's a mushroom man he starts to hear stories from people people know him he's

223
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,540
 interested in mushrooms so whenever they come across an interesting mushroom anecdote they

224
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,680
 tell him he said that there are stories of hunters duck hunters in the area rabbit hunters

225
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:56,440
 in the area tracking their prey down getting that gun ready killing the rabbit walking

226
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,920
 up cutting it open full of mushrooms not like it eating them not in stomach it's not all

227
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:10,960
 like it would didn't die having a good last meal like fungus in the skin on the skin little

228
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:18,620
 mushrooms growing on a up until a few minutes ago living creature I swear Timothy that's

229
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,620
 what I saw you're the mushroom man I figured I'd tell you that story thank you thank you

230
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,060
 really appreciate it would you like to have a drink no because I know you're gonna give

231
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,740
 me some sort of mushroom concoction and I'm I think mushrooms are gross myself Timothy

232
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,060
 I just wanted to tell you that story have a good day he would hear these stories from

233
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,880
 multiple people he couldn't get he never got him to drink mushroom juice but he'd hear

234
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,320
 these stories from multiple people one day Timothy is gardening and he sees one of these

235
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:51,280
 mushrooms in his garden he's like oh it's interesting I mean Palm Springs again is a desert so

236
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,680
 it's not like he's living on a patch of dirt but they explode and they spore everywhere

237
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,720
 it's not 110 degrees outside he's just looking at this and it's fascinating it's this mushroom

238
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:10,200
 he's looking at it puffs and he watches the black spores just flying cover him now he gets

239
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,340
 it pretty bad he gets it on his neck gets it all over him but he mostly gets it on his

240
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,060
 left arm and his left leg his left foot but he gets it on his neck gets it on his shirt

241
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,980
 and he's just looking I mean there's a ton of spores and he's kind of laughing about

242
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,120
 it oh oh good ol' linky's at it again can't wait to talk about this on my mushroom newsletter

243
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,140
 because they didn't have blogs back then I'm sure he'd have one if they existed he just

244
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,800
 goes in and washes it off he just goes in and he washes it off but then we have this

245
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:43,480
 quote I rinse myself off with a hose but the spores stayed in my pores and in every scratch

246
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,840
 and small wound on my arms neck and feet about a month later I got my first indication that

247
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:57,800
 something was wrong a series of small black growths began to emerge from my left arm I

248
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,060
 thought they might be spots of road tar that had somehow splashed on me so I scrubbed them

249
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:15,900
 with no results just got the weirdest case of deja vu this is bizarre he started washing

250
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,580
 them off with bleach these little bumps these little growths and after a while they started

251
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,960
 crumble away then we have this quote I was relieved until I noticed that the skin around

252
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,400
 them felt strange I touched my arm into my amazed horror a circular area about four inches

253
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:46,060
 across was numb and cold absolutely cold it stayed cold too and began to harden and then

254
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:54,740
 disintegrate he said goo started leaking out of this little growth hole in his arm and

255
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,900
 he started seeing more spores pop up where his body was exposed to this now he's going

256
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,020
 to doctors he's going to doctors in the Palm Springs area he's saying hey I got sprayed

257
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,460
 with one of these inky camp mushrooms and this I don't know what's going on like I feel

258
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,220
 like I'm turning into my I'm turning into what I love most and all the doctors are like

259
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,660
 that's impossible and he's like these things exist in this area like these are real things

260
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,460
 but none of the doctors are like this that's not true like mushrooms don't grow on people

261
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,700
 like this so maybe something is maybe it's this fungus well I mean the mushroom is the

262
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,420
 fungus but they didn't believe it was the inky cap could have been anything else but

263
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:38,540
 that what he ended up doing was using athletes foot medication which deals with fungus he's

264
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,700
 put an athlete's foot medication and eventually that kills off all the spores but he still

265
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:49,980
 has scar tissue in his arms it was eating his flesh as he's trying to figure out what's

266
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,580
 going on and treat it and to prevent himself from turning into a full-on mushroom man he

267
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,900
 begins to talk to other people in town and he knew three other people that this happened

268
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:06,620
 to one of them use agricultural grade fungicide to take it out he's like I really should have

269
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,340
 tried that athlete's foot medicine I didn't I just dipped my arm in a straight up Agent

270
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,180
 Orange brought it out of his just a skeleton arm one woman got him and she just could she

271
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,940
 had him on her legs and she could not get rid of him and Timothy said it sucks because

272
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,660
 when I figured out kind of how to deal with it with the athletes foot nothing not the

273
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:31,180
 agricultural grade liquid he can never find her she moved out of the area so he kind of

274
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,860
 that story kind of ends with him kind of shrugging his shoulders and going I hope she's okay

275
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:43,260
 it was a bad thing it was eating through his skin he ends up this experience was so awful

276
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,540
 for him he ends up poisoning the plant he goes back to where the mushroom was and poisons

277
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:52,700
 the soil and moves out of the area because he knows these things are out there he had

278
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,500
 seen them around he knew they existed in Palm Springs but he never had a close encounter

279
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,820
 with one and he wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper and said hey you guys got

280
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,500
 to be careful about these puffball mushrooms this is what happened to me like I was injured

281
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,100
 by these things the newspaper never published his letter to the editor he began writing

282
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,100
 several letters to them saying hey guys you know this is a serious problem but the newspaper

283
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,940
 didn't want to have anything to do with it the newspaper never talked about it and the

284
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,220
 doctors had no idea what was going on and what he believes at this time is that it's

285
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:32,500
 a cover-up because Palm Springs is a tourist town he ends the story by saying that these

286
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,460
 things can heavily damage a human body imagine if you got one of these in your eyes or a

287
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:44,580
 kid ate one he believes it was a town-wide cover-up and he says sure they grow in the

288
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,980
 desert and it has to be in 110 heat for them to explode but it's not always the case because

289
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,340
 the one blew up on him and he goes as Palm Springs expands as the city gets bigger the

290
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,380
 chances of these mushrooms landing in residential neighborhoods they're like living landmines

291
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,420
 the more houses that are built the bigger the town gets the more likely that these things

292
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:12,320
 are going to be popping up in this area all over the place a dog in the backyard comes

293
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,380
 down with a mysterious illness a child has a horrible coughing fit and the doctors just

294
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:25,660
 don't know what to do a gardener gets his hand covered in black spores and ignores it

295
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:32,220
 until he feels growths underneath his skin and the whole time the city of Palm Springs

296
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,380
 know this is an issue but it's one they can't control they're the invasive species the mushroom

297
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,140
 had already been there it would be almost impossible for them to eradicate this thing

298
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,060
 it's just messing with one of them just make it explode and now you got possibly thousands

299
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,420
 of more in the area so he moved away it wasn't worth the risk to have this happen to him

300
00:24:53,420 --> 00:25:00,800
 again this may be happening a lot in that area a lot not like not like the entire town

301
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,300
 singing over by mushrooms but even once I mean he met three other people that this happened

302
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,780
 to so even if it only happened to three or four people a year that's still a lot when

303
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,180
 you're talking about being eaten alive by mushrooms right is it possible that the city

304
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:21,660
 of Palm Springs is covering up this event because they can't stop it who wants to move

305
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,700
 who wants to buy a million dollar home in a posh neighborhood if you can't even leave

306
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:33,500
 your house safely who wants to visit this place if while you're taking photos of your

307
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:41,900
 family step on a little mushroom it spores on your leg it's a creepy story because it

308
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:49,060
 sounds true sounds true it's one of those small town conspiracies that you could see

309
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:54,540
 the city government covering up it could be that the doctors were in on it as well it's

310
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,360
 possible that at least one of those doctors knew exactly what it was but he's not going

311
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,580
 to risk his job you know doctors like I don't know I don't know what it could be I don't

312
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:09,660
 know what it could be and then Timothy leaves and doctors goes home and his wife is like

313
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:17,460
 what's happened again like I don't my hands are tied though I can't tell him what it is

314
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,380
 he says it's the inky cat mushroom he's right but just got to keep my mouth shut this is

315
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:28,820
 how small town conspiracies work in which I think are far more easy to contain because

316
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:34,180
 you only need to control a certain group of people and everyone else just lives unaware

317
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,940
 if you're listening to this in your mom Springs right now you're like oh I was supposed to

318
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:43,660
 go to the mushroom festival tomorrow don't by the way don't know how much you love mushrooms

319
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:49,900
 but yeah a creepy story it sounds it sounds realistic it just sounds creepy has all the

320
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,180
 elements you have a conspiracy a town-wide conspiracy of silence like the steppford wives

321
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:01,300
 you have an innocent looking thing that can ruin your body imagine again if he'd gotten

322
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:07,340
 this in his eye good luck putting athletes foot stuff in your eyeball and if you did

323
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,740
 get it in your eye you take your nine-year-old son to the doctor his face is covered in black

324
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,860
 spores I don't know what happened I don't know what happened he's just freaking out

325
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,820
 take him into the doctor and the doctor looks at that boy and the doctor knows he can say

326
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:30,980
 nothing it'll be fine I don't know what it is but it'll be fine the creepiest conspiracies

327
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,580
 are the ones we don't know about and if it wasn't for this small article in a strange

328
