1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A language barrier causes the poisoning of an entire country

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 and we travel to Chile where we discuss a mythical creature in the last significant witch trial ever held today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 A little bit of a sinus infection, but you know I've power through it.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Gotta get my episodes out. I know you guys are enjoying it and I enjoy making them so...

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'll make a phone call to the doctor after this, but let's go ahead and get started here.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Now, you know, I have my Dead Rabbit Recommends going on.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I saw a movie recently. I don't necessarily think it falls into Dead Rabbit Recommends, but it was completely weird.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 It was so bizarre.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 So it's this new movie, newer, came out in 2017 called Deadly Crush.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Now a lot of times I don't like to know anything about a movie when I watch them.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I just want to go unblind.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And from the title I thought it was going to be about like a babysitter falls in love with the man of the house.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 And after she tries to kill everyone, no, but it wasn't.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 It's Deadly Crush. I thought it was going to be like The Crush.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Sorry, who was that? At least it's Silverstone.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 This was a movie.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And again, since I didn't know what it was about, I had to discover it as the movie went on.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 It was a movie about a young artist, this young woman.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 She was a struggling painter.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 She gets a cabin up in the woods to kind of isolate herself and work on her art.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 And a very beautiful actress.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I think her character's name was Brynn.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 But anyway, so she's up there and she's painting and stuff like that.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And there is a ghost there that as she's sleeping, it's making love to her.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 So you get, it opens up with a couple like tasteful shots of you know, like this sex scene.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And she's dreaming this. So she's seeing this guy and they're just like, it's also in silhouettes or she's just like laying there on bed and she's like, mmm.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And then the sheriff shows up and is like, hey, you shouldn't be in this house.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And the woman's like, well, I rented it out for three weeks. So you know, you can't do anything.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And then like she meets a guy on Tinder or something.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Some guy she barely knows shows up to the house and he's, they're like hitting it off.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And then the dude starts to like rape her.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And then the ghost shows up and beats up the dude and he's like, ah, it's getting all beat up.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 So now the woman knows that there's actual a ghost there before she was just having these dreams.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And she's like, oh, you know, you saved me, but it's super scary because you're a ghost floating around.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And the movie progresses where she starts to communicate with the ghost.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And then we find out that the local cop killed the guy, turned him into a ghost basically and his girlfriend.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And the ghost was like, I need to get back at the cop.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And the woman's like, no, no, you don't have to kill anybody.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And then the artist's friend comes over to visit and she's also like the art dealer and she's super drunk.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So the ghost possesses her and that's when the ghost realizes, oh, I can actually jump into the living if they're like inebriated or, you know,

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 they don't have a strong will and I can definitely jump into the body of a dead guy.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So the movie progresses, pretty much the whole second act is the ghost saying, we need to find a body I can jump into.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And the woman's completely rational for the first two thirds of the movie.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 She's like, no, we're not going to let you jump into a dead guy that's gross.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And then he's like, what if we kill somebody?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And she's like, no, no, no killing people. I'm not going to let you kill anybody.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 The climax of the movie is the cop who wants to cover up the, he knows there's a ghost there now.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 He's like, we have to go and get the ghost out of there.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So he finds a local drunk who's also a priest and is like, come to this house and exercise this ghost so he can't testify against me and try or something.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 So the priest and the cop, the dirty cop go to the house and then the rapist that comes back and he's like, I just want to make things up to you.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And they have this weird shootout and the girl's like, oh my God, help.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 You know, she's like running around. The cop gets killed, the priest gets killed and the rapist gets shot.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And the ghost, the ghost lover of this woman possesses the body, the dead body of the man who was a rapist.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And we find out later, he's a serial rapist.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 He's been raping women all over because the police are looking for him.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And it ends with the ghost in the rapist body and the, and Bren, the woman going like, let's just leave together because she did love the ghost.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And then there's another like 20 minutes of the movie where the guy is slowly, she's banging this corpse now and she finds out like she, she didn't, she didn't know he got shot.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And they're like having like, they're having all the sex. And then she realizes, oh, because a guy tries carjacking her and instead shoots the rapist in the brain.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But he's still alive because he's just possessed by this ghost.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 The woman's like, oh my God, I've been having sex with a dead man for these past couple weeks.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Then the cops show up and the dude's gone.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And then the movie has another 10 minutes where the art dealer is at like a resort and Bren's like, oh yeah, that was so crazy when that rapist kidnapped me.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 You know, she didn't say he was possessed by a ghost.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And then she realizes that the ghost guys are going to try to possess the art dealer.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So she runs the resort and there's this big fight and the woman and the rapist fall off a cliff.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And there's like this, I laughed out loud. There's just a ridiculous shot of both bodies laying there.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And then the woman survives, Bren survives and the art dealer's like, that was close.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And then it turns out that the ghost left the rapist body and went into her body. The end.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Now you're like, Jason, that's just a stupid plot. Why did you spend seven minutes telling us this?

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 The movie itself was fairly basic, but I left out a key detail.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 So I'm watching the movie and it's like, you know, it's pretty much what I just told you in the middle of it.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 It becomes a soft core borderline hardcore porno.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And she's just getting railed by this ghost.

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Like there's just she's just like top comes off, bottoms come off. She's naked.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 She's getting like it's multiple positions.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I just see this weird CGI thing thrusting into her and I'm thinking this poor actress had to lay in bed and then lean against the refrigerator and then get twisted around and die.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 It's like as many positions as you can fit into a five minute clip and he's just railing her.

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I was like, who is this movie made for? If you took that scene out, this movie could be on the lifetime channel, but this scene was strictly put in for dudes.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I have no idea what this what audience is movies made for.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I will say this, if you're looking for a good movie this Halloween to trick your girlfriend or any other significant other into watching, watch deadly crush because it totally catches you off guard.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I just had to talk about that. Every show often you'll come across the movie that is just flat out bizarre and you watch it and you go, who made this and what is the audience.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 It either should have been a ton of go sex or no go sex or tasteful go sex, which is what it was in the beginning instead of just full on walking into the kitchen to drink some milk and then she gets thrust against the fridge and then turned around and spun around and it is so bizarre.

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I had no idea what I was watching.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Also tip, if you're going to have a like a dark romance, you may not want to have the rapist be the guy that the ghost possessed.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 It wasn't a lot of pickings there.

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It could also possess the drunk priest or a old cop.

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 But yeah, bizarre, bizarre movie.

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I just don't know what they were going for in that one.

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So not necessarily dead rabbit recommends, but if you're into go sex that had probably the longest go sex scene I've ever seen in a movie and I've seen a few and she was really hot.

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 So the first story we're going to talk about is one was interesting. Originally I had planned to do a thing about disasters.

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I wanted to do a week where I just talked about disasters and then I was like, yeah, that gets kind of sad at the end.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 So I'm going to kind of break it up.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Now, so this disaster is really bizarre.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 So back in 1971, Iraq was going through a big food shortage.

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 They weren't there. Crops weren't producing. They're having a massive drought and they were just suffering.

99
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Didn't have enough food to go around.

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And what happened was they knew that Mexico had these special seeds that were drought resistant.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Now, the reason why they were drought resistant is because they were coated with mercury and the Mexican government actually had them all spray painted pink.

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 So you wouldn't get them mixed up with regular wheat seeds and they shipped them off to Iraq.

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 A couple of things went wrong right off the bat.

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 One, the Iraqi government, who was led by Saddam Hussein at the time, was very slow in distributing the seeds to the farmers.

105
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Two, people started stealing the seeds out of the warehouses.

106
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 They started stealing back there like, we need these seeds. They started stealing the seeds.

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And three, when the seeds finally did start to get distributed, the growing season was already towards the end.

108
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 So the seeds weren't going to do them any good until next spring, next harvest.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 So you have all these seeds that are floating around. They're covered in mercury. They're spray painted pink.

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And on the bags themselves, they had two things. They had a skull and crossbones.

111
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And it said, do not eat these seeds. They're poisonous. But it said it in Spanish.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 So when I racked, they're like, yeah.

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And the skull and crossbones, we think that's as an international symbol of don't eat this. This is poison.

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 But it's other regions, it hadn't reached them yet, or they didn't really make the connection.

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I know they're talking about building a nuclear waste dump in Nevada.

116
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And one of the things that they're looking at, and they're trying to design a symbol that says, do not come here.

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 That will be easily understood 10,000 years from now.

118
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 That's what these people are trying to figure out.

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 What type of symbol can we come up with that 10,000 years from now, if someone saw that symbol and had no idea what English was, they would know not to go in there.

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 A skull doesn't work, because we see skulls in ancient history as religious shrines.

121
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 So just seeing a skull doesn't mean this is deadly.

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 There are certain symbols like the biohazard symbol is designed the way it is with the thorns, because it looks dangerous.

123
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 It's a symbol that's designed to say, don't go here.

124
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But if you look at the symbol for radiation, it looks like a religious symbol.

125
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Skull and crossbones looks like a religious symbol.

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 So is there a symbol that we can create that 10,000 years from now, people will go, that is a dangerous place, don't go.

127
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So the skull and crossbones, they really didn't think anything of it.

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 They had the seeds, they couldn't plant them, so people began to do one or two things.

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 They either were scraping off the pink paint, thinking then the seeds would be safe to cook into bread, or they weren't even doing that.

130
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 They were just taking the pink seeds and mashing them up and turning them into grain, either for their animals or for bread for themselves.

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Massive catastrophe.

132
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 6,500 dead from eating this mercury-coated seeds.

133
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 100,000 injured.

134
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 People were going to the hospital with severe mercury poisoning.

135
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And depending on the region, the doctors either figured it out very quickly, and they go, oh, you have mercury poisoning, what have you done?

136
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 How have you come in contact with this much mercury?

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And you're able to track it down very quickly?

138
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Or in other regions, they're like, I don't know why all these people are sick.

139
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 People are just coming in and they're like, just blurry.

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 They're not blurry, but their vision is blurry, they're very sick, and they're dying.

141
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 So the signs of this mercury poisoning, first off, you'll get numb in your extremities.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Then you start to get really unsteady.

143
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 You're not able to walk, you're really not able to stand.

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Your coordination goes, eventually you do start to get blurred vision to just outright blindness.

145
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Slurred speech, nervous damage, central nervous system damage.

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 So it was just laying waste to entire communities.

147
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Now, what happened was once the government started to catch on that this was causing a problem, they said, if anyone has any of this grain left,

148
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 we're going to shoot you.

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 It's poison. You can't, you got to get rid of it.

150
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Which is a weird escalation.

151
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 They're like, you got to get rid of it, we're going to shoot you.

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And it's Saddam Hussein, so it's not like there's a lot of gray area there.

153
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 So people are like, oh crap, I got to get rid of this grain.

154
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 So they dump it in the river, causing even more cases of mercury poisoning.

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's killing off fish.

156
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 People who are eating the fish are getting mercury poisoning.

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 They are feeding it to their cows, like I said before, they're feeding it to their livestock.

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 If you ate the meat, you got mercury poisoning.

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 To this day, Iraq has the highest concentration of Parkinson's in the world.

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And Parkinson's is very, the symptoms are very close to mercury poisoning.

161
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So the question is, are the Parkinson's, people who have Parkinson's being misdiagnosed,

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 do they just have super amounts of mercury poisoning in them?

163
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Did the mercury cause the Parkinson's?

164
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And once it enters into your brain, it has a half-life of 27 years.

165
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 So you're stuck with it.

166
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 This happened back in the 70s.

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 You would, newer generate, well I guess not even if it was still, if water supplies were tainted and things like that,

168
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 they'd still have problems with it.

169
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 But yeah, all from a simple error in the packaging.

170
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 If it had said in Arabic, this is poison, it's poison even if you remove the paint,

171
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 do not eat under any circumstances, do not feed to your livestock for planting only.

172
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 That's probably too much to put on the bag.

173
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 But you could have it poisoned for planting only.

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And they've had to change their labeling practices since.

175
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But yeah, from a just a, you know, it was a, it was confluence of, is that a right word?

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Confluence, confluence, okay, so it was a confluence of fa, is that even a word?

177
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 We'll just say it is.

178
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And it was a confluence of factors where you had the bags that weren't labeled for that region.

179
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 You had the severe drought.

180
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 You had people who were like, I can't wait a year to make some bread.

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 They use this 6,500 dead, 100,000 injured and it continues to this day.

182
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Massive catastrophe, it's crazy what little mistakes can do to entire swaths of people to an entire region, really.

183
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Because that mercury is still out in that water supply from them just dumping.

184
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And we're talking, it wasn't like a couple, we're talking tons of grain here that entered into that ecosystem.

185
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I wonder if you bury a body that has mercury poisoning, how that affects the soil.

186
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Weird, weird stuff.

187
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Our next story was something that I stumbled across when I was looking up our, when I was looking at cryptids.

188
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 We did Crypto-Quick a while back and I still have a ton of cryptids over, those were just the ones that I picked out.

189
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 For this story, we're going to have to go south or, assuming that you're in America, if you're in Europe, you're gonna go west.

190
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And if you're already in South America, just kind of stay where you're at.

191
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Because we're going to South America, that sounded bad, I'm not saying you need to stay where you're at.

192
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But this story is gonna take place in South America, in Chile.

193
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And we have quite a few Chile listeners too, so that's always cool.

194
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 This is the story of the, now I do have to warn you, if you've listened to this show long enough,

195
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 there's gonna be quite a few mispronunciations, no disrespect.

196
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 It's just, we're gonna be talking about some terminology that necessarily doesn't have pronunciation guides online.

197
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 We're gonna be talking about a creature called the "imbuche".

198
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 The imbuche is actually, I think, one of the creepiest sounding cryptids.

199
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Because it is a human that is twisted into a creature.

200
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And twisted, I mean literally.

201
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 So the story goes like this, you take a boy nine days after he was born.

202
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And the local warlocks in this area of Chile, it's actually was thought to be mostly around what was known as the Place of Seagulls.

203
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Which was almost, the Incas considered it a dark region.

204
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 It's 700 miles south of the Chilean capital, Santiago.

205
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 So the Incas are like, "I don't go there." And this is where this story takes place.

206
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And mostly on the island of Chileo.

207
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 I think that's how you pronounce it.

208
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 So that's the name of the island, I just don't know if I'm pronouncing it right.

209
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 But anyway, so the imbuche, so the imbuche was you take a boy who's nine days old.

210
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 A warlock will either kidnap the child or pay the parents for the child.

211
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And there's a couple different ways you make an imbuche.

212
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 One of them is you take their right leg and you bend it around to the back of their neck.

213
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And you make it so it's stuck there.

214
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 So now they have one leg and two arms and they kind of scurry around.

215
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 You start off just feeding them like goat milk.

216
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 But if the warlock is in a particularly giving mood, he can dig up a corpse and feed you corpse meat.

217
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And your job is to guard the cave of the warlock.

218
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 So it's a lookout.

219
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And sometimes he sends you out on missions.

220
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And even though you never get to learn to speak language, you can only talk in guttural tones.

221
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Just by being around the warlock so much, you'll pick up magic spells.

222
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Now that one, that description, I thought that's horrifying.

223
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 That description is actually quaint compared to the other way imbunches are made.

224
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And this came out during a witch trial in 1880.

225
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So during the witch trial of 1880 or warlock trial of 1880,

226
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 the Chilean government rounded up a ton of warlocks.

227
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 There was actually about a hundred arrests.

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 And this was on the island of Chaloé.

229
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And it's, there was a group called the Righteous Province.

230
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And they operated throughout the like from 1850 to 1880.

231
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And probably before that, but they were practicing warlocks.

232
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And that's when people started to hear about the imbunche.

233
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 So this was their method for creating an imbunche.

234
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 They would take a kid between six months and a year old, so a little bit older.

235
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Same thing, buy it or kidnap it.

236
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 What they do is when they first get it, they have to unbaptize it.

237
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And their method of unbaptizing is for 15 days, you soak them in freezing cold river water.

238
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Not for 15 days, like for 24 hours a day,

239
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 but every day you have to take them out there and soak them in freezing cold river water.

240
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And then you basically put a tourniquet around the kid's head and you twist it a little bit each day.

241
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And then you let it adjust and then you twist a little bit more.

242
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And you keep doing that until the head is completely turned 180 degrees around.

243
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And so it's looking by through its back.

244
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I mean, not through it, but it's like, you can see its spine.

245
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Its nose is vertical with its spine.

246
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Then they cut a hole in the right shoulder blade, take the right arm and put it into that hole.

247
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 So you put the hand into that hole by your shoulder blade and then you heal it up.

248
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 So again, now they have two legs and one arm, but they're still this deformed creature.

249
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Again, they're fed on either animal milk or human flesh.

250
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And the rest of it's the same.

251
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 They guard the cave, they watch out for the warlocks and things like that.

252
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 So that idea in and of itself is terrifying,

253
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 taking a human and deforming them and turning them into some sort of creature.

254
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 But let's look more at the righteous province.

255
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 So this cult of warlocks basically ran that area of Chile.

256
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 It was almost like a shadow government.

257
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 The people in the area were completely petrified of them.

258
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Now, when they were arrested, the Chilean government knew that there was a group out in that part of the country.

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 But it wasn't a part of the country, they spent much time in.

260
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 The Chilean government had other stuff going on.

261
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 You had the shadow government is almost like a mafia rule.

262
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 They ran that area.

263
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 But what happened in round 1880,

264
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Chile was getting involved in warfare with other countries in South America.

265
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And they realized that they had basically an insurrection in their own country they had to put down.

266
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 This was called the War of the Pacific.

267
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It was all of these South American countries basically having,

268
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 what it sounds like brush wars, it's like border wars.

269
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So at some point they dispatched a bunch of troops deep into their country to say,

270
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 "Hey, we need to find out what's going on back there."

271
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Because we're involved in these wars.

272
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 We need to make sure there's nothing going on back there.

273
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 When they go back there, that's when the government really learns the truth about the righteous province.

274
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 They were in the area considered smugglers, assassins, racketeers.

275
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 The people believed that they had these magical powers.

276
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 So the government arrested, and this is all true.

277
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 This is all true.

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 We actually have court transcripts, because this was only back in 1880.

279
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And the article I was reading was the Smithsonian.org article.

280
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It said, "This is considered the last significant witch trial ever held."

281
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 So we have full transcripts of testimony of the witches and stuff like that.

282
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 They arrested 100 or so witches, warlocks,

283
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 brought them in a trial, and the confession started coming out.

284
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Now, the emboonche was considered part of that.

285
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 You had an explorer who went out to the cave and was being shown around by a warlock,

286
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 and he said he saw an emboonche run at him to form a man all covered in hair running at him,

287
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 not Mormon Bigfoot, another guy, not Cain.

288
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 During the testimony of the witch trial, people said,

289
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 "Okay, this is what we have. We have this cave that's completely hidden.

290
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 We have a magic word to open it. It's guarded by an emboonche,

291
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 and then this other weirdo creature that looks like a pig. That used to be a human as well."

292
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And inside there's a magic book that's super old, and we have a bowl of water

293
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 that if you look into the water, you can learn secrets.

294
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 So the government's like, "Oh, we don't want to know that."

295
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 They also had a flying jacket.

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 So they also have this thing called the "makun."

297
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 It was a flying or magical waistcoat.

298
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 So I think that's a jacket. Is that a coat that comes down your waist?

299
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 The warlocks would put it on, and they would leap into the air and say this magical word,

300
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 which was a real "uhu."

301
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I'm really sorry for my listeners who speak Spanish natively.

302
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Again, I'm sorry.

303
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Anyways, you put the jacket on, you can fly around, and you're like,

304
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 "Oh, that's kind of cool. How do you make one of those?"

305
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 You have to flay up a recently buried Christian corpse

306
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 or the skin of a virgin girl or a dead sorcerer.

307
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 So not something you can find that hot topic.

308
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 But anyways, they believed that with these waistcoats, they could fly around.

309
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And also one of the things that the people in the area believed,

310
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 and it was coming out during the trial, was that the righteous province had a ghost submarine,

311
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 which in 1880, I mean, we had submarines during the Civil War,

312
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 but this was a submarine that they used.

313
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 It was basically a ghost ship that could be piloted underwater,

314
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 and you're like, "Okay, that's just a legend,"

315
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 but it was used to unload contraband onto the island,

316
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 which is how the warlocks made their money, selling black market goods.

317
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And people to this day in that area still say that that ghost ship is still out there under the waters.

318
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 So that came out, that's how they're getting their black market goods.

319
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I think from based on that story, they probably did have a submarine.

320
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I bet you if they wore-- 'cause they wore racketeers, they were mobsters.

321
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 They were telling people, "You need to pay us money or something bad might happen to you tonight.

322
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Mayim Bunche may come into your town and poison all your crops.

323
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Your husband may be murdered.

324
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 So people in the area were paying them protection money.

325
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 They were selling black market goods.

326
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 They were also assassins.

327
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 You could pay them to "put a spell on somebody."

328
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 They would just poison you.

329
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 So it was like you had this group of people who--

330
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 they probably believed they had magical powers,

331
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 and the people in town believed they had magical powers,

332
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 but everything they did was 100% real.

333
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Moving in black market goods, poisoning crops, poisoning people,

334
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 they would just say, "Oh yeah, there was a ghost that did that

335
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 as someone's dying from arsenic poisoning."

336
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 It was weird.

337
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 So you could join this cult, an initiate could join the-- the righteous province.

338
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 They had this list of rituals.

339
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 One of them was you also had to be unbaptized.

340
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 So you had to be in the river every night for 15 days to wash away the baptism.

341
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 You had to run around the island naked telling people how much you love the devil.

342
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And you go through this whole process, and then it gets to this weird part where

343
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 they basically tell you some of the prohibitions, some of the things you can't do,

344
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 and they had rules against theft,

345
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 which is most probably theft towards other members of the province.

346
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Because again, they were shaking down villagers for money.

347
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 They had prohibitions against rape.

348
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Okay, that's cool. That's awesome.

349
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 They had prohibitions against eating salt, you know,

350
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 high sodium leads to early death, that makes sense.

351
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You're like, "That's fairly reasonable. Don't steal, you know, don't rape people.

352
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Don't eat too much salt."

353
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And then after going over those rules, they celebrated by eating the flesh of a dead baby.

354
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 No gray area, guys.

355
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Don't eat too much salt.

356
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Let's eat this baby.

357
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Completely bizarre.

358
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Now, to be fair, a lot of this, most of this stuff came out during a witch trial.

359
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 So, people, this information may have been coerced through torture out of people.

360
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 This information may have been made up to get a better sentence yourself.

361
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 This trial went on for a year.

362
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And in the end, like I said, 100 people were arrested.

363
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 In the end, 30% of them, so about 30 of them, were just considered healers.

364
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Local healers and people who believe that, you know, herbs and stuff like that, 11 herbs and spices,

365
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 will, you know, heal that wart on your face, things like that.

366
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Other people, though, were charged with manslaughter.

367
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 People were charged with, like I said, racketeering, running protection schemes.

368
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And then other people were charged with just being part of an unlawful society,

369
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 because the Chilean government still considered this group a threat.

370
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 It was basically running an entire region within their country.

371
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 A year later, though, almost all of the sentences were vacated.

372
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 The government was like, you know what, just let everybody go, which is kind of a weird decision.

373
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 But that was the end of the Righteous Province.

374
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Even though the leaders, people weren't in prison for long periods of time,

375
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 the fact that they were arrested seemed to shut everything down.

376
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And so, to this day, it's kind of been gone.

377
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 The Righteous Province no longer exists.

378
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 The questions that remain are this.

379
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 How likely is it that they were practicing magic?

380
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And I think the answer is probably pretty likely,

381
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 but I think that they were using it as a guise to instill fear.

382
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Did they really kidnap children and try to turn them into this monster?

383
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Turning someone's head every day to make it look behind the back,

384
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 I don't know how physically possible that is.

385
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 But you could take anybody and make them deformed by doing something horrendous.

386
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 This is basically like a cryptid in that area.

387
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And the Imbunche has popped up in popular media from time to time.

388
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I think I saw that he was in the comic book Constantine and Swamp Thing fought one.

389
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 I don't think that a cult that operated for 30 years and was shut down for one year,

390
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 I don't think they would just completely disband.

391
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 I think they would just get better at hiding.

392
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I find it very unlikely that this group no longer exists.

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 So somewhere in the place of seagulls, where the Incas even said this place is full of darkness,

394
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 there may still be a group, an offshoot of an offshoot of the righteous province.

395
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And somewhere deep in one of those caves, there may be a deformed child who was turned into an Imbunche.

396
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
