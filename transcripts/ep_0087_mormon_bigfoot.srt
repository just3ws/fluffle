1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
 Are there Nazis on another planet?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:12,400
 And then we take a look at the unique take of the Mormon Church and its view on Bigfoot today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,400
 [Music]

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,900
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 We've got some weird stuff going on today. Nothing to actually be considered its own story, but I did want to get this out here.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 First off, YouTube is down. I imagine that YouTube will be up by tomorrow, if not before then.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,500
 But of course, people are freaking out and they're like, "Was something uploaded to YouTube?"

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,000
 And they had to shut down the entire site to prevent the masses from seeing it.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Unlikely possible, but unlikely. Most likely, some sort of technical issue, but we're gonna have an open mind about it.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 We're gonna keep looking at it. You know, and also, I want to touch back on this too.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 We never heard more about the Sunspot Observatory in the janitor who was downloading Child porn. That was it.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Like, that's public information. When you arrest somebody for that, unless they're cooperating with the police to wrap up like a ring of other people.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Like, a ring of other predators. That should be public information. We haven't heard anything more about that.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 So, I'm gonna do some more research on that. I just was looking at something today about that and I was like, "Okay, this is getting fishy."

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Like, at the time I go, "Well, maybe it's a legit thing, but we still have no more information on this janitor."

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 At least that I've seen. So, we're gonna look into that.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I did want to start the story off with this. Now, you know that I don't like to do political stuff unless it becomes a conspiracy thing.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And I actually have a conspiracy theory about what's going on right now. And I don't have much proof. Just have a hunch. Just have a hunch.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 There is, about a couple days ago, at least we heard about it a couple days ago, 3,000 immigrants left Honduras and begin making its way up through Central America.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And their goal is to either stop in Mexico or come into the United States.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And there's already the photos of like, hundreds of people, like, you know, waving flags and stuff like that.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And they tried to block them at the Honduras border, but they just let them through. They're like, "We can't do this."

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 This is about 3 weeks before the US election. I think this is a CIA operation.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I think that the images that are, this is gonna play out for about a week or two. As they're moving, they're gonna keep covering this.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And I think that it is a political move. What are the chances that 3,000 people gather together before, three weeks before the election?

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I think that the point of the march is, is that it creates a face where basically President Trump can say, "If you vote for the Democrats, this is going to be a continuous thing."

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I'm the guy who's strong on immigration. And I need a Congress to support my immigration goals.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I have absolutely no proof of that. But we're gonna see this group march forward. And I'm sure that there are Democratic operatives who are like, "This is the worst timing possible."

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Because you're putting a face, and you're putting sounds and all these huge images of this big crowd, and there's gonna be people in the Democrats say, "No, like, this is a humanitarian crisis. We have to let them in."

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And, and independence are just, they've spent the last two years in the middle going, "I, I, I, both of these groups are nutty, but I'm gonna have to pick somebody soon."

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 So after all of the ups and downs of President Trump's administration and all the ups and downs of the Resist movement, within three weeks those independence are gonna have to make a decision.

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And this puts a very, very vivid picture. So that's, I think it was, I think it's a political operation. So we'll see. I think it's a, I, I, again, though, I have no proof of that whatsoever.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Just a hunch. The timing was really weird. Really weird. So it's been the last half hour reading about this whole YouTube thing. So I'm a little discombobulated.

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And when I sat down to start recording this episode, I said, "You know what? I'm gonna give one more look at my notes regarding the Vril Society and the Nazi plan to build these UFOs."

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And I had, I was like, "Okay, I know the approach I'm taking with this story." And I sat down, I looked at my notes a little bit more to kind of like get my head wrapped around it.

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And I was like, "I don't know anymore. I don't know where I'm at anymore on this story. So."

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 The Vril Society. The Vril Society is something that you've probably heard a lot of if you like are consuming mass media.

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Vril Society is always that like Nazis on the moon type of thing, like with Iron Sky, I believe they're the villains in a couple Wolfenstein games.

40
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Then along with the Thule Society, so the Thule Society was a group of occultists who believed that the like the Aryan race was supreme.

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So obviously they were quite popular among the higher echelon echelon echelon of the Nazi regime.

42
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 The Vril Society was a bit different. It was mostly headed by women and they believed there was this substance called Vril.

43
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 It was basically like an unlimited energy supply that you could find and you could use it to power your weapons.

44
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Vril might actually have even been in, "No, no, they use the Cosmic Cube in Captain America."

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 But anyway, so it's like this fantastical thing that I had always heard about as a kid researching like weird stuff.

46
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 I heard about the Vril Society and the Thule Society and the Nazi UFOs and all of that stuff.

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And so I go, "You know, I'm gonna take a look at this. I think that might be a good subject for the podcast."

48
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 So here's the gist of it. You have the Vril Society and you had its leader, Maria Orsik.

49
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And she was this famous medium. In 1919, she claimed to have received a blueprint into her brain and it told her the technical data for building a flying saucer.

50
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So in 1919, she's like, "Uhhh." And like now she knows how to build a flying saucer and it talks about like she gets these visions of Vril.

51
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Which it was already kind of known of before that, but this was kind of her big thing.

52
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 So she knows that they need Vril to power it and she knows where they should go in case, you know, things don't work out well.

53
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Which is a little bit of foresight on her part. To Aldebron. Not Aldebron from Star Wars, but there's a real star system called Aldebron with a B. 68 layers away.

54
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 So anyways, she became very popular among the Thule Society and high-raking Nazis.

55
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Hitler actually, I didn't know this. Hitler kind of frowned upon occult practices altogether.

56
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 He was not, he was just kind of like, "Ah, whatever." Like, I'm glad he talks like a belly girl.

57
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 But you know, he just didn't really care for much about religion in general.

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 He saw it as like an unnecessary distraction for his leadership, but they were doing it.

59
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 So he's like, "Whatever guys, like I'm, whatever. Like I got other stuff to do."

60
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So he goes in the other room and I imagine they're like playing with the Ouija board and they're full on Nazi regalia.

61
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 So Maria meets with Rudolf Hess, who's a high-ranking political, like high-ranking in the political party of the Nazis.

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And he's like, "Whoa, you can like this Vril stuff. We need to attain this. Like, look at all these blueprints that you have. This is great technology."

63
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 The war, obviously, spoiler alert, doesn't work out well for the Nazis.

64
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And this Maria Orsik girl and the other followers of the Vril Society disappeared.

65
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 In 1945, they're just gone. All traces of them are gone. Nobody could ever really figure out where they went.

66
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And the theory put forth was that they were able to get the Vril and they were able to build the spacecraft that took them, and possibly others, to Aldebron.

67
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So I had heard that story before. That's actually very like popular, like, deep Nazi esotericism.

68
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I need to stop saying words that I don't understand. I mean, I understand. I have to stop saying words I can't pronounce.

69
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 That was like deep Nazi supernatural lore. And like I said, it's in a lot of popular culture.

70
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 I had heard about the Vril Society, the Duel Society, growing up.

71
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Because it's an intriguing image of this high science fiction weaponry being crafted in laboratories and, you know, being used in war.

72
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Like you had small units of like US commandos like shooting Nazis and like taking possession of this.

73
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 They're like, what is this? It's some sort of hoverboard or something. I don't know.

74
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 But anyways, you know, so like it's a very intriguing thing. 100% totally fake.

75
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 There is no proof whatsoever that Maria Orsik ever existed.

76
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And I was when I was researching this, I was going into it looking for these groups that existed, never existed. Absolutely never existed.

77
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I'm like, are you kidding me? It was so disappointing. Not saying that I want the Nazis to have space age weapons.

78
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 But it was something that I didn't. Okay, I didn't think they actually succeeded in getting space age weapons.

79
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 But I thought there was a group of people who were trying to get... They don't exist.

80
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 There was no real society whatsoever. Maria Orsik, they say her dad was born here and her mom was born here.

81
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 We don't know their names. There's no photos of her. Well, let me rephrase that.

82
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Every photo, there's one photo of a girl and then there's drawings of a totally different girl.

83
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And depending on what website you go to, it's a different drawing or a different photo. Doesn't exist.

84
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 That's why she disappeared after the war. Totally made up. And you're like, Jason, that, you know, maybe the documentation, maybe... No.

85
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Because she was actually the narrator of a fictional novel. She was the narrator of a book called...

86
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 So after the fact, after she supposedly lived and died and or lived and floated away to space, in 1960, a book came out called "Morning of the Magicians".

87
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It's a collection of short stories, conspiracy theories basically. And it has a giant once ruled the earth. We've heard that one before.

88
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 The Nazca lines are like the giants making them supposedly. It also includes speculations about Germanic autism and supernatural phenomenon.

89
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So it's completely made up and that's where the real society comes from.

90
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Vril, you go, what about the energy source? That also came from a novel. That novel was published in 1871 and it was called Vril, the power of the coming race.

91
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 It was a book about people living in the hollow earth and how great they were and how sucky humans were.

92
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Again, you can see the allure of the Nazi regime to that. These giant great leaders of humanity were better than the subhumans above earth.

93
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And everything they had was powered by Vril. So Vril was a completely made up thing in a book. The Vril society was a completely made up thing.

94
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Maria Orsik, completely made up. There was no such things as any of those. And it's very, very disappointing for me to discover that.

95
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Now the Thule society is real, but all they were was an occult group that believed in racial superiority.

96
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 They may have been like light eight candles. Hey, Rudolph Hess, go say Bloody Mary through. No, I'm not doing that. No, you got to do what it's part of the ritual.

97
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 There might have been like that level of occult stuff. They weren't summoning demons. They weren't making UFOs appear. They weren't doing anything cool.

98
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 They were just being like anti-cosmic satanists in 1943. So I was disappointed. We know Vril doesn't exist. We know she doesn't exist.

99
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 We know the Vril society doesn't exist. And then you go, OK, Jason, but you said you changed your mind on this story.

100
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Did you believe it? And now you don't know. This is what was interesting is I was going through my notes and I still believe that Maria Orsik doesn't exist and that the Vril society never existed.

101
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And that Vril is fictional. So it strikes, you know, three strikes. In 1947, Willie Lehe, he was a German rocket engineer who fled Germany in 1937.

102
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Again, he had a good foresight. In 1947, he published an article called "Sudo Science in Nazi Land" and he was talking about all the weird stuff that Germans believe.

103
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 He's like, "Dude, these guys are nuts. So this is only two years after the end of the war." He did say, he goes, "There's a bunch of weird groups over there."

104
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And he goes, "There's a group that all they do is look for Vril, which is totally made up. It doesn't exist."

105
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 He called them the Warheitzschlettgelstschaft or the Society for Truth. And he says it was just a group of people among all the other weirdo cults.

106
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So he was just talking about all these weird beliefs at the time. He says the Society for Truth did go around looking for Vril.

107
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 So there were groups of people, there was a group of people who believed a fictional novel talking about Vril was real.

108
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And I think that is, and that was the end of it. He didn't name anybody in particular. The group name is completely different.

109
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I think from that, the authors who wrote "Morning of the Magicians," which is all like the little tales and stuff like that, most likely read his article and elaborated on it.

110
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And that's fine. I just think it's ridiculous that now it's almost become common knowledge that, oh, the Nazis had this war at least working on this high technology.

111
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And some people believe they actually achieved it. And they didn't, which I mean is good. So yeah, it doesn't exist.

112
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 You let me down Wolfenstein. The Vril Society, Nazis find Aldebron living on the moon, doesn't exist.

113
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 People think the Nazis went to Antarctica and we had this huge war with them and they had this high technology there. No.

114
00:14:34,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 History is interesting enough. History really is interesting enough. We don't need to add "doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

115
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And I think that's why my Bigfoot episode yesterday said, "Why don't you cover Mormon Bigfoot?" And I responded because I'd never heard of it before and I will look into it.

116
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So I spent this morning looking into and assuming I'm going to find nothing. No offense Platinum P. I figured that it was a real thing that you had heard about, but I figured it would be totally obscure.

117
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 There are a ton of resources on Mormon Bigfoot. Now, this is what's interesting. It's not that Bigfoot himself is Mormon. It's the Mormons theory on Bigfoot.

118
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 So we're going to have to go back in time to start this story off. We're going to go back to late 1800s.

119
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 David W. Patton. So David W. Patton is Mormon, was Mormon, and he was one of the like original leaders of the Mormon Church. Now, not like a founding member, but he knew Joseph Smith.

120
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 This is his story of what happened to him one day in Tennessee. I couldn't find a date for this, but as I was riding along the road on my mule, I should put like Western music in this part.

121
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 As I was riding along the road on my mule, I suddenly noticed a very strange personage walking beside me. His head was about even with my shoulders as I sat in my saddle. He wore no clothing, but was covered with hair.

122
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 His skin was very dark. I asked him where he dwelt, and he replied that he had no home, that he was a wanderer in the earth and traveled to and fro.

123
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 He said he was a very miserable creature, that he had earnestly sought death during his sojourn upon the earth, that he could not die.

124
00:16:42,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And his mission was to destroy the souls of men. About this time he expressed himself thus, "I rebuked him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by virtue of the holy priesthood, and commanded him to go hence, and he immediately departed from my sight."

125
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 So, that story, the reason why we know about that story was apparently he told that story to his buddy, Lycurgus Wilson. Lycurgus Wilson wrote a letter to another guy named Abraham Smoot.

126
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Abraham Smoot was writing a biography about David W. Patton in 1900. So the first time that this story came to light was in 1900.

127
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Now, Bigfoot sightings obviously had been around for a long time with the Native Americans, but even among Westerners, Bigfoot sightings were very, very, like, 1800s, like early 1800s.

128
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 So it wouldn't make sense that he would... they didn't... every area had a different name for them, like in the Walking Dead, some people call them walkers, and other areas call them biters and stuff like that, because they wouldn't have national communication lines.

129
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 You should watch the Walking Dead, by the way. It's really good.

130
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Anyways, so this story, you know, again, this is coming from a, you know, a established member of the Mormon church, one of the original guys.

131
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I mean, I'm using that term wrong, but he was highly... and he died a martyr for the Mormon cause.

132
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 He was killed by... he was killed trying to rescue Mormons who had been arrested, and they shot him like they had discharged, and he died... he died in Joseph Smith was like, "This dude was dope, and we should always remember him."

133
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 So it's like this guy was OG Mormon. So he tells this story that he supposedly told this one guy, and then the guy wrote it.

134
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 People were like, "How do we take this?"

135
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Now, the first thing that they do is they go... in the Mormon community, they go, "Okay, we really trust this guy, and we trust this whole chain of people."

136
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 He might have met Bigfoot, and Bigfoot may have been Cain.

137
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 So the story of Cain and Abel, it's Bible class guys, it's Bible class time.

138
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Cain and Abel were the sons of Adam and Eve, and Abel was like a really good worker, and Cain was like a total dick, never did anything, and he was really jealous of his brother.

139
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 So one day he picks a rock up and just bashes his brains and kills him. It's considered... it's not true, but some people consider it the first murder.

140
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Obviously there had been murders before that, we'll get into that in a second, but...

141
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So he just bashes his brother's brain out and God shows up.

142
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Like, voice in the sky, burning bush, however, he just is there, and he says, "What have you done, dude? You're covered in your brother's blood. Your brother cries out from me from the ground."

143
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Which is creepy, actually, so dude, like, corpses go, "Help! God, get me out of here!"

144
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 So then God says, "Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth up to receive your brother's blood from your hand.

145
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."

146
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is more than I can bear. Today you are driving me from the land and I will be hidden from your presence.

147
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."

148
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And then God says, "Not so."

149
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over. Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.

150
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So Cain went out of the Lord's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

151
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 There's been a lot of, you know, this particular passage has been, the whole Bible's been analyzed over and over again.

152
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 The first question is, if Adam and Eve had Cain enabled, but how does Cain go to a city?

153
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Like, he's headed out to Nod, and he ends up having a wife and having kids and stuff like that, and that's, again, always the pushback.

154
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 The Bible is not a scientific textbook. It is not a genealogical tree of the entire planet.

155
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It is a religious history and a religious text of particular people.

156
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 So don't go to it looking for scientific questions.

157
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 There were a ton of other people in the area, obviously, if Cain is able to leave and have a family and it not be his sister.

158
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 That little rant aside, that's where they're getting this idea that he has to wander the earth, nobody can kill him,

159
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and the mark is the hairiness.

160
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And since he can't till the land, since the land is dead to him, how else would you feed yourself?

161
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 You would just have to walk through the forest and, like, eat squirrels and stuff, eat berries.

162
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 You could never be in any sort of industrialized society, one, especially back then, an agrarian society,

163
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 because you'd be cursed to not have anything grow.

164
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Two, nowadays, people would be like, "Dude, you're seven feet tall and you're hairy. Where are you supposed to work, McDonald's? I can't have you behind the counter."

165
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 You might be able to work in a call center, depending on how he smells.

166
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 But the PW Patton had that encounter with whatever it was.

167
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Maybe he made it up, but let's assume that this actually happened.

168
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And, like, anything, when something pops up that's kind of weird, there's two--

169
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Generally, the religion mainstream will take it one or two ways.

170
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 They'll either go, "That's a quaint story, but let's not get out of hand with that."

171
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 And other people will say, "You know, this guy is so high up in the church and he was well respected, we should give it some veracity."

172
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And the story was just kind of there for a while. There was something people would talk about as kind of a weird part of Mormon lore.

173
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Like, did David W. Patton really see Bigfoot? He's on a horse and the guy's as tall as he is and he's covered in hair.

174
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 So years, years later, in 1969, the president of the church at that time was President Kimball.

175
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 He wrote a book called The Miracle of Forgiveness, and he used that story in that book.

176
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So more than 100 years later--well, about 69 years later, actually.

177
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 So 69 years later, he used that story and he's the president.

178
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 So the president of the Mormon church is basically the Mormon pope.

179
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Like, they actually receive visions from God and they can change certain laws.

180
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 They can say, "You know what? We're going to allow this. We're going to allow you to drink caffeine now.

181
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 I just got a message from God," and he says, "We can drink caffeine."

182
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 "Just got a message from God. We can start dancing."

183
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 So they are the ultimate prophet. They are a Latter-day Saint, in a way.

184
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 I think they're all considered Latter-day Saints, but I mean, the prophet, he's like, in charge.

185
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 So him writing a book and using this story in it led a ton of renewed interest in it and credibility behind it.

186
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And when he uses that quote, he's basically saying, "This actually happened."

187
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So the common belief, unspoken, is in the Mormon church that Bigfoot is actually Cain, almost like--

188
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 and that would explain why you can't catch him, you can't kill him.

189
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 He's doomed to wander the planet.

190
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 So if we caught him, if we proved that it was him, then we just put him in a cage.

191
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 His punishment is just to walk the earth until the end of time.

192
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 So it would explain why we can't catch him.

193
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Now, it doesn't explain why there are sometimes sightings of multiple Bigfoot, Bigfi,

194
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 unless he brought his family with him or he continues to have kids, but would they live forever?

195
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 So next time you see a Mormon, you should ask them.

196
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Don't be rude, but just ask them if they've heard this story.

197
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And I can almost guarantee it's going to be 50/50.

198
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Some of them are going to be like, "Yeah, it's the fairy tale that, you know, we tell our kids,

199
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 but I personally don't believe it." And they're most likely being honest.

200
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And then other ones will be like, "Oh, yeah, I've heard that before.

201
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 I don't know whether or not I believe it, but I have heard that story before."

202
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Every religion has wacky stories in it.

203
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 When I was reading about this, there's debate in...

204
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 There's debate that whether or not Bigfoot could exist at all based on Bible...

205
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 I was going down the rabbit hole or the Bigfoot hole on this one.

206
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Could Bigfoot exist at all in biblical tradition?

207
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 One site says no. The flood would have wiped out Bigfoot.

208
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Like if he existed and if Cain was Bigfoot, that was one of the pushbacks.

209
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 If Cain really was Bigfoot, the flood would have destroyed him.

210
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 The flood would have killed Cain/Bigfoot. That would have been the end of it.

211
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Other people think that it could be the leftover of the Nephilim,

212
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 but since the point of the flood was to wipe them out, that's unlikely.

213
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Some people think this is post-flood. Some people think it's a dude.

214
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 This is so funny. The Bible, again, just has the weirdest stories in it.

215
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 There's a dude. There was two sons. There was Jacob.

216
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Everyone's shutting the show off now. They're like, "I don't want to hear your stupid Bible stories."

217
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 This one's funny. There's Jacob and there's a dude named Isu.

218
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Might be saying that wrong, but just bear with me.

219
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 God's like, "Listen, you're going to have twins, but they're going to be separated.

220
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 One of them is going to be super strong and take command.

221
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Most likely, the older will serve the younger one."

222
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 This woman gives birth to Isu first, covered in hair.

223
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Absolutely covered in hair. She's like, "I will name you Isu," which means Harry.

224
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 She looks at the baby and goes, "Oh, man, you're covered in hair. Your name is Harry."

225
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The next baby she gives birth to is named Jacob. They're brothers.

226
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 This is the start of the genealogy of the Israelites.

227
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 They said, "One of them was going to help lead the people."

228
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Isu was kind of hot-headed. He couldn't think of anything.

229
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 One day, he's out. They don't explain what happened, but he comes barreling into the house.

230
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Jacob is eating some soup.

231
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Isu walks into the house half-dead. No, like 75% dead, and he's like, "Oh, I need your soup.

232
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Oh, my God, if I don't eat right now, I'm going to fall over and die."

233
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 What he was doing previous to walking into the house, nobody knows.

234
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 But he walks into the house and he's like, "Oh, give me some lentil soup."

235
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And Jacob goes, "I will give you this soup if you give me your birthright."

236
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Because Isu was the oldest. He was supposed to be the one in charge.

237
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Jacob is sitting there with a bowl of hot lentil soup, and a man is starving to death, doing what?

238
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Who knows what? Just 10 minutes previous.

239
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I will give you the soup if you give me leadership of the clan, basically.

240
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And Isu goes, "What point is the leadership of the clan if I dive starvation right here?"

241
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 So Jacob gives him the soup and takes over.

242
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 What was he playing like Fortnite for like 10 days straight?

243
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 How can you... There's multiple problems with that story.

244
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Just like moral problems. One, your brother is starving to death,

245
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 and you're like just eating soup in front of him and being like,

246
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 "Oh, you know, if you give me that, I don't know."

247
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Secondly, what were you doing that you were starving to death?

248
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 You're in... You're like...

249
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 What a bizarre way to jump into the middle of that story.

250
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 It's not even that Isu... It says he came in from the open country.

251
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 That's what we know. But was he just like out?

252
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 I can imagine him like sitting in the middle of nowhere with like a piece of wheat in his teeth, like a huck fin.

253
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 And then going, "Oh my God, I'm going to starve to death."

254
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And he runs into the house and being like, "Please give me some soup."

255
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Because apparently they had soup. How far away? I don't know.

256
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 So bizarre. Oh, and I want to say this too.

257
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 There's a pushback also on Bigfoot being Cain, because a lot of Mormons for a long time,

258
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 they don't think it so much, but for a long time, they believed that the mark of Cain was your black.

259
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 So when everyone was white in the Garden of Eden, and Cain kills Abel,

260
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 they're already kicked out of the Garden of Eden, but so when Cain kills Abel, God goes,

261
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 "Anything you do with the ground will produce no harvest, and you will wander the earth forever."

262
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And then he made him a black dude.

263
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 That was a legitimate belief for a long time. Not legitimate, like it makes sense, but there was a belief for a long time.

264
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 It wasn't until 1979 that the President of the Church had a vision.

265
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 And he goes, "You know what? God just told me black people can be members of our church."

266
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Now, it's interesting to note, there were, I guess, a few before that, but now they could like, rise up in the church.

267
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 It is interesting to note that after he had that vision, they began doing a lot more missionary work in Africa.

268
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 So it could have been a financial decision, could have been a message from God, I don't know.

269
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 But so that's been the pushback, because the Bigfoot that David W. Patton describes is both Harry and he was completely black.

270
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 So you could take that as the skin being black or the hair being black.

271
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 But yeah, there was a belief for a long time that black people were cursed by the mark of Cain,

272
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 which makes it kind of complicated, because they said, "If you kill me, you'll suffer seven times over."

273
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And I don't think there's been much retribution for killing black people. A little bit, but not a lot.

274
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Not seven times worth.

275
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 So that is the convoluted story of Cain, Isu, Bigfoot.

276
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Oh, and I should say that, yeah, they thought Isu might be Bigfoot because he's covered in hair.

277
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 But, you know, again, it was weird. People will, you know, if you're religious, you will go to your religious texts and say,

278
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 "Can you help me explain this stuff?"

279
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And sometimes it can help you explain moral dilemmas you have, but it's not going to tell you whether or not Bigfoot is real.

280
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
