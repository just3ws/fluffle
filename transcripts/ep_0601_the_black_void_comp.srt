1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 What happens if a conspiracy theory appears?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 But no one pays attention to it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at the story of a young woman and her husband out for a walk one night.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 She was hoping for a moonlight stroll underneath a sea of stars.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Instead, she almost disappeared completely from our reality.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm back at home.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 My house sitting duties have been fulfilled.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And I'm also recording this episode and future episodes on a brand new laptop.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 So thank you so much for those of you who have financially supported the show.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 You have allowed me to invest into the show.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 The first 600 episodes were on my first laptop.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm putting that in a museum. Actually, I'm gonna use it to watch television.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 But after that, someday it'll be in the Dead Rabbit Radio Museum

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 somewhere in Akron, Ohio. I don't know why it won't be here.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 But it'll be there. It'll be in Akron, Ohio.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 That laptop with the first 600 episodes were recorded beyond display.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And you can take your kids there and take photos of it.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Holographic photos, because it'll be in the future.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 And speaking of the future, the future of the show is supporters like Jenny West.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Every one give a round of applause to Jenny West as she's walking and throwing bayonets.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Not bayonets. Obviously, we're dangerous.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 What are the things you-- batons, batons.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 She was getting ready to throw a bunch of bayonets, but I corrected her.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 She's now throwing batons like an awesome marionette.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Is that the person? Isn't that a puppet? Doesn't matter.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Show's already getting off to a great start.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Jenny West put down those batons and those bayonets.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. That also really helps out a lot.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Now, Jenny, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the reins to the Hair Hanglider.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 We're gonna go for a little trip. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 We're gonna sail the blue skies.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 [whoosh]

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Out to Hollywood, so everyone grab on a Jenny's ankles as she expertly pilots us to this story.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Now, this story, I actually didn't plan on covering.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Because apparently, I know nothing about conspiracy theory.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Apparently, I know nothing about-- not only nothing about conspiracy theories,

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 but how conspiracy theorists react to conspiracy theories.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I always go. I've been doing this for 30 years.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I've been researching all this stuff since I was 12.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 But apparently, I do not know what I'm talking about,

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 because a conspiracy theory popped off a couple weeks ago,

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 and I go, "I'm not gonna talk about it. It'll be super big news in the conspiracy theory circles."

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 What's the point? I don't like covering mainstream stuff.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 No one is talking about this, and now I have to. Now it is obscure.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And I'm kinda curious how many of you guys know what I'm about to talk about.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 So Jenny lands us in Hollywood, in this city of glamour and glitz. It's post-COVID.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 So everyone's walking around doing Hollywood stuff.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 They're like, "Hey, I live in Hollywood!" That's what everyone says all the time down there.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 We're walking around. You can tell we're tourists, because we're not saying that.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And we see this restaurant. It's called the Long Pig.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And we're looking at each other.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 That sounds delicious. I love pigs.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And if they're long, they're probably even better. They're probably even tasty, right?

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So we go in, there's a bouncer at the door. He's like, "Hey, what's going on?"

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 He's like, "You're on a chat us up." We're like, "Hey, we want to come into this place."

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Does this serve a lot of pigs and stuff like that? And the bouncer's like, "Oh, yeah. Long pigs."

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And then he's practicing to be a stand-up comedian. It's actually Carrot Top's day job.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 He opens the door. Carrot Top leads us into the Long Pig.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So I'll just get to the story. I'll just get to the story.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Everyone's becoming incredibly impatient at this point. Even Carrot Top.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Here's the story. And if you don't know, Long Pig is a slang term for human meat.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Like cannibals use it. Really edgy. People use it.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Edgy cannibals. Just not seeing more on it.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 But anyways, the point, that's where that joke was going.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 There's been this rumor or this story going around for about a week now that Armie Hammer.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Armie Hammer is this actor? You hear the question mark in my voice?

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I've never seen him in anything. That doesn't mean he doesn't exist.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I'm not a newborn baby if I don't see it. It doesn't exist.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Now, Armie Hammer, he was in The Man from Uncle. I didn't see it.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And then he was in The Lone Ranger, which nobody saw that. Nobody saw that.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 He's just this big, hunky actor. So the news has come out recently that he might be a cannibal.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 He might be a cannibal. You're thinking, "How did I not know about this?"

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Maybe you did know about this, but I'm going to break it down in a special way.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 We're going to make some stew. We're going to make some long pig stew out of this story.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It came out in the general media, in the mainstream media, that Armie Hammer, this famous actor,

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 hasn't used both of those terms, might be a cannibal.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Actually, people are straight up accusing him of being a cannibal.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Why are they accusing this Hollywood actor of being a cannibal?

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 He was sending these DMs to random women. I think they were women he knew.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I think it was women he had met. I don't think he was just sending out spam alerts.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 But here's some of the-- And you could say, "Jason, these could be out of context."

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And you're right. They could be out of context. Let's take a look at some of these DMs he sent to women.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 "I want to bite pieces off of you."

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 So, I mean, that could be-- Maybe he was DMing a chocolate bunny.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 That could also be like, you know, girls like to have their neck nibbled on.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Maybe there's kind of wiggle room there.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 "I want to eat you." was one of these DMs.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Again, that could easily be a euphemism for something else.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 How about, "I am--" He sent this to this woman.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Allegedly, he's denying he sent these.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But the evidence is starting to mount. Apparently, so he said, "I want to bite pieces off you."

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 He said, "I want to eat you." He also said, "I am 100% a cannibal."

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 That is a direct quote from this account. "I am 100% a cannibal."

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So there, he kind of taken the wiggle room out of it.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 My favorite is he asked very politely. He asked someone if he could chop their toe off to keep it in his pocket.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So he'll always have a memento of them.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 The answer was no, if you're curious.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 If you ever see a Hollywood starlet walking around missing a toe,

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 the answer was no to that one.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 But here's the thing. So I thought it was super interesting.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 I'm really into celebrity gossip. I don't talk about it on the show because it doesn't have a place on the show.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 But I grew up reading tabloids and People Magazine and National Enquirer and all that stuff.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 So I really enjoy reading or hearing Hollywood gossip. It's one of my hobbies.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 But this is when the gossip actually allows me to talk about it.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 But even then, I thought, this is my first thing. I don't know if he's actually saying this stuff.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Most of the time I just go, "It's probably fake. It's probably fake."

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 The DMs kept coming out. He actually quit a movie. He was supposed to do with Jennifer Lopez.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 It's called The Broom or Vacuum Cleaner Man or something like that.

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It was named after some utility tool.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 I'll look it up later. I'll look it up later.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Not like I have the internet right in front of me, but it's pointless.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 It doesn't matter what the name of the movie was.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 He quit because of this. And he's like, "Dag Nabbit, you guys."

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 He's barely an 80-year-old man. "Dag Nabbit, I'm just trying to do this movie

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 and now I have to stay home with my children because I'm afraid one of you lunatics is going to come after them

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 and eat them before I do. I mean, get them before I do. I mean, not even before I do.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I'm afraid one of you guys is going to get him. He's afraid that lunatics are going to go after him.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Now, here's my thing. I'm floored.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I almost said the F word there because I am so floored that this story is not front-page news

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 across every conspiracy theory website right now.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 For decades, people have been talking about reptilians eating people and they're the elite.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And even without the reptilian angle, people have been talking about adrenal chrome and the elite

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 drinking the blood and eating the people and the spirit cooking and all of this stuff.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 And then the time that an actual, this guy's in real life, forget the acting,

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 he's part of the arm and hammer corporation.

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Even without the acting, he's like a billionaire or maybe a multi-millionaire.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So we have a guy who comes from like old money, he's part of the elite, he's celebrated in the media,

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 and he's eating people he admits to wanting to eat people. Nobody's talking about this.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 This is so bizarre. I left it alone because I figured everyone's going to get a fill of this on the export

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 or on godlike productions or above top secret.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And I'm not saying that it's never talked about on there. I haven't seen it.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I'm going to assume every time I shut off my browser, then people are magically talking about it.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 How are people not talking about this story? Here's the thing.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I don't honestly believe he's a cannibal.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 However, if anyone was a cannibal, it would be rich, super rich people.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Either super rich people or people who ran out of food.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 People in the middle class aren't like, "You know what I want to do tonight, Debbie?"

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 "What Arnold? I want to eat somebody."

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It's either people who are so wealthy, they're bored with existence,

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 or people who are so unwealthy, I think the term is poor, people who are so poor,

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 that they'll do anything to prolong their existence.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 That's how I imagine cannibals to be.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And then every show after you've got a crazy serial killer running around.

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 But I don't think this guy is super poor, and I don't think he's a serial killer.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Although one of his tweets, or DMs actually, wasn't a tweet, he said,

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 after he said, "I'm 100% a cannibal," this is the rest of this, to put this in context,

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 because I know you're wondering.

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Let me actually read you the whole thing. It says, "Somebody said something."

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I don't know what the start of it says, but it's not really context.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Here we go. It says, "Oh my God, that just made me so hard, and it makes me confused as to why."

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Is that even possible? So hard.

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 This is like a romance novel. So hard.

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 "Thanking of holding your heart in my hand and controlling when it beats, I am 100% a cannibal.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I want to eat you."

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 F-word. He actually says it, but I'm not even going to talk about cannibals,

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 and holding people's hearts, I'm not going to cuss.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 F-word. That's scary to admit. I've never admitted that before.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 "I've cut the heart out of a living animal before, and eaten it while still warm."

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 That's the full context of that DM. He might be a cannibal, he's probably not a cannibal,

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 people are now trying to spin it like maybe he just has a cannibal fetish,

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 and that's okay, I was talking to a friend of mine about this, and he goes,

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 "Cannibalism is probably just a fetish, it's not that bad." And I go, "It's up there."

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Like if someone has a list of worst fetishes to have, it's in the top five.

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Like, let's not pretend it's like he likes feet. It's way, way to the top of the worst fetishes.

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And I'm not going to list them. I'm not going to list them, but...

171
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Why isn't this huge news in the conspiracy theory circles?

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 I have a couple theories, and we'll wrap it up like this.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I don't want to go too long on about it, because we got some crazy stuff to cover,

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 I'm crazier than this, because it's actually spooky stuff, but I think it's because the political stuff.

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Conspiracy theorists are focused so much on the political sphere right now.

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 They're focused on Biden and Trump, and three days of darkness, and ten days of darkness,

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 and two more weeks, and the Great Reset, and eating bugs on a box, and all of that,

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 all of that stuff that's based on the flimsiest of evidence.

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 There's a photo going around of the Vatican with the lights shut off,

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 and it was just a camera angle thing. There's multiple webcams.

181
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 One of them showed the lights were still on, one of them showed the lights were off.

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Within like an hour or something like that.

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Conspiracy theory already popped up, and I want to give a shout out to Josh,

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 because he contacted me as well about this story.

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Apparently, the power was shut off in the Vatican. There's one photo.

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Power shut off in the Vatican. This is the story that develops.

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Navy SEALs go into the Vatican, arrest the Pope.

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Clone the Pope? They then clone him while they're there like, "Don't move!"

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 He's like, "Oh, what are you guys doing to me? I'll never tell all the secrets of the Vatican!"

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 The Navy SEALs are drinking from every cup. They're trying to find the Holy Chalice.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 They're like, "Ah, it's not this one."

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 The Pope, they tie him up, they clone him, they arrest the Pope.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So the Pope that gave Sunday Mass the very next day, it was like eight hours later,

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 after the power supposedly went out, Navy SEALs crashed the place.

195
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 They cloned the Pope.

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Because we can do that now. You didn't know that? You haven't been reading US News and World Report.

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 We can clone adults now. That conspiracy theory is still going around.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Did you know Mike Pence? He's a clone, which that's the most ridiculous thing.

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 We all know Mike Pence is from the future.

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 But if you don't believe the truth, he was also, he's in a cell in Guantanamo Bay.

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And the Mike Pence you see now is a clone. So we can do that now.

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 There's a guy out there saying, "I am 100% a cannibal."

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Who is who people normally assume with the elite, and they don't care about the little people,

204
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 and they're into all this eating people and all these horrible rituals?

205
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Nobody's talking about that. They're talking about it in People Magazine.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 They're talking about it on New York Post, on like, legitimate news websites.

207
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 But everyone else is talking about clones running around.

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Which really, that would be Armie Hammer's fantasy, right?

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Because then he could just keep eating people and keep cloning them.

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 He's like, "Oh, can I keep a toe in my pocket?"

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 He has 50 toes. He just keeps cutting them off the women and they grow back.

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 That would be Armie Hammer's dream. He's working towards a world where you could clone meat.

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 The ultimate long pig is the one you can eat over and over again.

214
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Allegedly, allegedly Armie Hammer, don't sue me.

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 That went on a little bit longer than I thought. I just find it so fascinating.

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I thought it would be big conspiracy news and we'd be talking about it for the next 20 years.

217
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 See, there's proof reptilians exist. Armie Hammer eats people, but no, no one's talking about it.

218
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Jenny West, I hope you have those bayonets ready now. We might need them to fight our way out of Long Pig, this restaurant carrot top.

219
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Roar's coming after us. He's throwing. He's throwing other patrons at us.

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Luckily, they're all skinny Hollywood types, so we're easily able to avoid them.

221
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 We break out of Long Pig.

222
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Jenny, call in that carbonar copter. We are headed out to Russia.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Before we get there, I want to give you guys a quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 I found this documentary the other day. It's called The Wet House and it's the story.

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I don't even know if it has a plot. It's more of just like, it's more of like a camera hovering around chaos.

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 In Britain or in the UK, apparently, they have these hostels that you can spend $20 a week, which is a deal, right?

227
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 $20 a week to live in a hostel, $20 a week, and the rest of everyone else there is a hardcore alcoholic.

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Now, I know you're thinking, what, Rodney Dangerfield having a party, lampshade on his head? No.

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 These people, you're like, "Jayson, I wasn't thinking that at all. Alcoholism is serious to see."

230
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I wasn't thinking about your crazy 80s adventures. The Wet House is a documentary about these people.

231
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Social security checks, they spend $20 a week on this hostel, the rest of the money they spend in alcohol and booze,

232
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 and they drink so much alcohol. It's so heartbreaking. It's maybe only an hour and 15 minutes long,

233
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 and it's just 20 alcoholics living in a house together.

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Again, it's not funny. It's not like Animal House. You're like, "Oh, that's awesome. Is that like the movie Caddy Shack?"

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 No. It's terrible. And you're watching the movie and you're hearing these people's stories of how they became that way,

236
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 their origin stories, and you're like, "Oh my God. This is awful. Is that guy crying or does his eyes always look like that?"

237
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 You just don't know. And the movie is really rough to watch. And there are a couple parts that are funny,

238
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 and it's not a comedy, but you're watching it and you're like, "Oh, you get to like some of them and other people you hate,"

239
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 and then you get to the part where there's a girl there, she's like 30 something.

240
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Everyone else is an alcoholic. She sniffs glue. And I saw that in the description, so I imagined her with a little container of Elmer's

241
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 and be like, "Ooh, you know, no. She's like pouring, modeling, like rubber cement or this heavy toxic glue into a bag."

242
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And she sings a song, "Blue bag, blue bag, help me escape from the pain. My parents disowned me."

243
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 It's really tragic. And then she goes, "Pfft."

244
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And that's when it hits you. Like, it's so weird, because you see people drink alcohol. I've drank alcohol. A lot of people drink alcohol.

245
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 I know it's a serious problem, but when you watch someone pour glue into a bag, it was rough, man.

246
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 The whole movie was rough, but I remember that gluth. I've never seen anyone do that before. I saw Charlie do it on, it's always Sunday in Philadelphia.

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I thought it was hilarious. It's not when the woman's singing a song to her bag about how horrible her life is, but the blue bag will take away all of her pain.

248
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 It was also filmed in 2001, so none of these people are alive anymore, which makes it even more tragic.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Watch the wet house. Jenny, she's sadly flying the carbonicopter.

250
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 We're headed to Primoor Sky Cray. That's in the Vladvistok region. People are shaking their heads. They're like, "No, it's not. There's nothing by that name anywhere in Russia."

251
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 But if it was the correct pronunciation, it would be in Vladvistok in Russia. It's October 8th, 1989.

252
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Go ahead and land that carbonicopter. We see a young couple walking down the street. It's 11 p.m. They're out enjoying the beautiful evening.

253
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Anna is the name of the wife, Anna L. And then her husband, we'll call him "Jonesy." We don't have a name for him. They're walking home.

254
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Now, on the sidewalk, there's a muddy puddle, and Anna steps into the puddle and immediately falls to the ground.

255
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 "Ugh!" Jonesy, immediately concerned about this, his loved one, slipped in a bunch of mud. "Who's going to get those stains out of that dress?"

256
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I'll say she may be hurt. But as he's asking, "Are you okay? Are you okay?" He's leaning down to help her. She begins screaming, "Please, please, don't take me."

257
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 She's yelling at the top of her lungs. I'm not going to do that, because some of you guys are sleeping by now.

258
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 He's watching his wife scream out, "Please, don't take me." And she starts kind of spinning around in a circle on the ground.

259
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Not three stuages. Not "whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop," but you know what I mean? Like, you can tell she's starting to move around in a circle.

260
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 She's not just laying there flat. She's not just flailing her arms. It actually appears to Jonesy that someone is holding her limbs down.

261
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Now, right now, it's just him standing over her, but the way that her limbs are starting to stretch out as she's moving in a circle,

262
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 it looks like someone's trying to drag her in different directions.

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 She says, "Please, don't take me." She pleads out, "I do not want to fly away."

264
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Another quote she says, "Leave me alone. Don't touch me." And Jonesy's looking at this, and he's thinking,

265
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 "My wife's having some sort of conifption fit, but what is she seeing?" She keeps saying, "She's going to get taken away. Don't take me. Let go of me."

266
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 What it looks like to him is something is holding her down.

267
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Now, he's trying to calm her and help her up at the same time, and he's like, "Honey, it's okay. We'll get you a new dress.

268
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Another ground super muddy." And when he grabs her to lift her up, she feels far heavier than she should, as if someone is holding her down.

269
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Now, she's screaming, she's writhing, people walking on the street. The only thing they can really make out is a man holding a woman down.

270
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 "Get away from me. Get away from me. Let go of me." And they see a man crouch down over her. So they think he is the perpetrator.

271
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 They call in the local authorities, the cops show up. "Get away from her. Get away from her." And he's like, "No, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. I'm here helping her."

272
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And they're like, "From what?" Like, she's just laying on the ground. You're the only person in the area.

273
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 At that point, she just gets up. Anna gets up and goes, "Everything's fine. I just need to go home."

274
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 So the police kind of look at each other. They look at Jonesy. He's just kind of shaking his head. He's like, "I don't know anything either."

275
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 But at least I'm not getting arrested by Russian police tonight.

276
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 So they go back home. She doesn't really talk about what happened. He doesn't really seem to ask.

277
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Or if he did ask, she just kind of brushed it off.

278
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Because it's not until the next morning that we start to get some answers as to what happened. It's really terrifying, sorry.

279
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Next morning, she wakes up with a fever and she's just extremely depressed.

280
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Which I would be depressed if I woke up with a fever, too. It's the horrible way to wake up.

281
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 But she's talking to her husband. She's like, "Oh, I'm so depressed." She's not a very good actor.

282
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 "Show don't tell." But she's like, "Oh, I'm so depressed and I have a fever."

283
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And he's like, "What happened last night?" She goes, "You want to know what's weird. I mean, a bunch of stuff."

284
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 But the weirdest thing is, I don't remember walking home.

285
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 I remember walking down the street and then I just remembered waking up with this fever, being extremely depressed.

286
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And he goes, "So you don't remember to walk home?" And she's like, "I don't. I just blanked on that."

287
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 He goes, "Well, do you remember what happened when you fell down?"

288
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 She goes, "Yeah, unfortunately I do. That might be why I'm so depressed."

289
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 She said, "This is what happened." She's walking on the street with her husband.

290
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 She gets to the puddle and then the world goes black.

291
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 She is now standing in an infinite dark void.

292
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Before she can really get her bearings, and there are no bearings, you're basically outside of reality.

293
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 She's in a pitch black void. She sees three tall beans show up.

294
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 They're wearing silvery clothes. They were all about six and a half feet tall, which is barely normal, actually, paranormal encounters.

295
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 They're either three feet tall or about six and a half feet tall.

296
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 But she sees these three humanoids dressed in silvery clothes and one of them looked like her husband.

297
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So she's standing there in the infinite darkness of nothing.

298
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 There's three people standing next to her. One of them looks like her husband.

299
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It's then when she begins to hear a loud machine humming.

300
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 [machines humming]

301
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 She's looking around. These three beans are getting closer and closer to her.

302
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 They're not saying anything.

303
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 [machines humming]

304
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 The machine drones on.

305
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And that's when they grab her arm.

306
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And she begins yelling, "Let go of me! Please don't take me. I don't want to fly away."

307
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And these figures are grabbing her arms, grabbing her legs, trying to carry her somewhere.

308
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 The next thing she knows, she's waking up in bed with a fever.

309
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Very, very depressed. Extremely depressed, actually, is what was written in my notes. Not just very depressed.

310
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 So she's sitting there on the bed talking to her husband.

311
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And he tells her what he saw. She was walking, she stepped on the puddle, she slipped, she fell in the puddle.

312
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 She begins saying these things and she's just nodding because she remembers saying those things.

313
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Those were direct quotes that I was reading earlier.

314
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And then she just popped up and they went home.

315
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And you could go, "Jason, she had an epileptic fit."

316
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Which would kind of make sense. She had an undetected mental disorder.

317
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Maybe she had like a miniature stroke. She saw herself like dying and she came back.

318
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 All of these things, these medical things you can point towards.

319
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 But to add another last twist to this story, when she fell into the puddle and was screaming and writhing around on the ground

320
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 and then she pops back up and she goes home, nobody really noticed anything at the time.

321
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 But the next morning when she was looking at the clothes she was wearing on that walk, they were perfectly clean.

322
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Not a single drop of water or mud appeared on her dress as she was rolling around in the puddle.

323
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 It's almost like her physical body was taken out of reality.

324
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 So much so that her clothes wouldn't become soiled in the accident.

325
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I'm not saying that's why the beans did it. They're like, "Oh, let's not mess up her skirt.

326
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Let's take her soul away to the darkness of the void, but let's leave those clothes clean."

327
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Whatever this experience was actually disrupted reality enough that she could roll around in a muddy puddle and not get dirty.

328
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 That story was originally reported by the Vladvistok UFOological Association.

329
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 That's a mouthful. That's what Armie Ammer likes. A mouthful.

330
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And then I got it from ThinkAboutItDocs.com, which again vets their stuff really well.

331
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 A bizarre story that has all the hallmarks of things I find the most creepy.

332
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Reality-defying physics surrounded by multiple witnesses and bizarre phenomenon happening.

333
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Both of those things always kind of creep me out.

334
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 You think they're safety in numbers, so she's walking down the street with her husband.

335
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 She's whisked away to this void.

336
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Near-death experience was my first thing when I was reading this.

337
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 The other one was some sort of epileptic fit because it's like shutting her brain off, parts of her brain off.

338
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 But the fact that the clothes don't get dirty just takes it to a whole other level of reality-warping.

339
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 So the next time you're out with your loved ones and you're thinking about a scary movie you saw,

340
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 or a chilling story you heard on Dead Rabbit Radio, we always have the tendency to feel comfortable

341
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 sitting in a well-lit room next to our friends and family.

342
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Or you're in your house and you think you heard something in the other room, but your trusty dog

343
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 would always alert you if there was something truly hiding under the bed.

344
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Just remember that in those moments when we think we are safe, we aren't.

345
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 If something wants you, it will get you.

346
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I've told that story time and time again on this show.

347
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 You may think you can fight back, you may think you can outwit them,

348
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 but if they can pluck you from this very reality, any moment they want,

349
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 and take you to the infinite black void, what chance do we truly have

350
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 in protecting ourselves against the overlords of the paranormal?

351
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 In the end, we really are just long pigs on the dessert tray of reality,

352
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 and those that want to eat us will eat us the minute they get hungry.
