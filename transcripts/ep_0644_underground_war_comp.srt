1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 Today we start Sea Serpent Week.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,800
 We're starting on a Wednesday because I only have three stories.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,400
 First off, has a researcher discovered the truth behind whether or not sea serpents actually exist.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:23,600
 Then we travel to Washington DC and go 800 miles underground to find out that U.S. soldiers are fighting

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:33,200
 insane worshipers in the tunnels beneath the White House. And if you thought that was crazy, just wait till you meet the people exposing the truth.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,200
 [Music]

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,200
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover so we are going to get started right away.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,600
 Flying into Dead Rabbit Command on the back of a bumblebee.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 It's Joseph Logan. Everyone clap. Everyone clap. He's dodging our claps.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
 He's flying in between our claps on his little bumblebee.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
 Very, very brave of you, Joseph.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,400
 You are going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,600
 If you guys can't afford to pay to your honor, if you don't fit on the back of the bee, I'm assuming Joseph doesn't either.

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
 He's making his Patreon pledge by jumping on each key. It took him a week to sign up.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,400
 Whoever's just saying, "Oh yeah, don't worry if you can't do that either."

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600
 Just helps to rid the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
 Tell your friends, tell your family, tell the Tulpa you created in your room.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Tell the Shadow Man who follows you down the street.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,200
 Tell everyone you know about Dead Rabbit Radio. That's the way you can help support the show.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,600
 So, Joseph, we are going to go ahead and hit you with a growth ray.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,000
 You are now human size. We hit your bee with the growth ray as well.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,800
 So now he's just standing in the corner of the room. He's like, "Dude, I'm huge. Sorry bee."

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,400
 But Joseph, we're going to tash the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,600
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command and we are headed out for the high seas.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,400
 Splish. Splash. Splish. Splash. We're rowing.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,200
 We're making the bee row. This time he has six arms.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
 He can straight do it like a trameur. All the rows. We're just banging drums.

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
 He's rowing for us. Joseph is standing on the bow of the ship leading the way.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,400
 This is Sea Monster Week, which is real funny because I always say I don't like sea monsters.

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,800
 But there's always a little asterisk to that. Just the stories are always the same.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,200
 It's always the same thing. I love covering unusual sea monsters.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,000
 Same reason I don't cover lights in the sky. It's boring.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,800
 I want to cover aliens coming down and making people eat pancakes or kidnapping kids and putting them next to a grizzly bear.

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,200
 Stuff like that. We've covered those. We'll see if I can find those for the show notes.

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,600
 But sea monsters, they're usually just lumps in the water.

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,800
 But I found three really cool sea monster stories this week.

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,600
 So we're going to finish the week off with the sea monsters.

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,000
 This article, we're going to start this off. I found this article on Mysterious Universe.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,800
 It was written by Paul Seaburn. So thank you very much Paul for doing the legwork on this one.

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,200
 And his article is based on a research paper written by Robert L. France.

44
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,400
 This is nuts. This is really, really cool. This is one of the things I really like about paranormal research.

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,400
 Joseph, order your bee buddy to take us to the British Isles. It's a long way to row, but again, he has six arms.

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
 We see a lump in the water.

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
 Blue, blue, blue.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
 Blue, blue, blue.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
 And we see another lump behind it.

50
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,600
 Blue, blue, blue.

51
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,000
 Blue, blue, blue.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,200
 And then we keep looking. There's like 15 knots.

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,400
 And I keep making that noise.

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,000
 Blue, blue, blue. I do it 15 times in real life.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,800
 For the podcast, I'm going to edit them out.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,800
 You're just very annoyed by the time we get done seeing.

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:50,000
 Well, a sea serpent is what we just saw. We saw this long bumpy creature swimming in the water.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,400
 What's interesting is Robert L. France, he works for the Dollhouse University.

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,400
 It's a, I think I'm mispronouncing that. I just imagine a tiny little university.

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,800
 And it's like, none of the students can move their elbows or knees.

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,800
 They're like Barbie dolls walking around the Dollhouse University in Canada.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,200
 And he took a look at 200 sea serpent accounts from 1809 to the 2000s.

63
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,400
 And the one centered around the British Isles.

64
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,200
 And he looked at everything from like firsthand reports to cryptozoology books to newspapers to historical accounts to scientific papers.

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 He compiled all of this stuff. And he said, out of these 200 sea serpent sightings,

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,200
 there were four things that were in common with all of them.

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,800
 One, they were unnaturally long, far bigger than any fish or whale or anything like that.

68
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,200
 He says they would often be up to 328 feet, which is like around 100 meters or something like that.

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
 So very, very huge creatures.

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,600
 It's not like people were seeing trout and be like, ah.

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,000
 Two, many humps or coils.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 So you're not like a spring. Sometimes you would see, when we think of the Loch Ness monster or sea monster,

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I've always thought of like the different humps of it.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 But that's why the term is sea serpent.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's because like you're seeing a hump and then the rest of it goes underwater and then it comes back up like a tail, like a coil.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 So he goes, sometimes it looks like it's a coiled spring in the water where you can see it.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And then sometimes it just looks like a hump. But the idea is the same.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 It's very, very long and it's not like one uniform body exposed above the water.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 You see a lump and then you can kind of see it go underwater.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And then it crests and comes up the top of the water again and goes underneath. It's like a coil or lumpy.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Three, they usually have hair or whiskers or both.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 So they're a little fuzzy, which is an interesting thing for a fish.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 It's not unheard of to have fuzzy fish, but it's not super common.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Actually, I don't know if that's true. I didn't research that. This is off the top of my head.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I've never, I know that normally fish aren't fuzzy, but I'm not going to say that there aren't any.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 But anyways, that's one of the things. These creatures, they're abnormally long.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 They have coils or lumps. They're hairy, fuzzy, or have whiskers.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And number, this is so fascinating. I love this story.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And number four, the fourth thing that all of these sightings have, it was either fast moving, thrashing about on the water or both.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 So very, very violent movements in the water.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So a naturally long mini-humps or coils, hair or whiskers, and fast moving, thrashing about or both.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Those were pretty much consistent across all 200 stories that he looked at.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So this is the hypothesis he came to. Fishing nets.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 It's a group of fish caught in a fishing net, and they're trying to get away.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 We've talked about rat kings before, and what it is, they don't even know if these really exist.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 The hypothesis is that they do, and I know they found like there's examples of them, but in whole, I think people are really, really...

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I think they exist, but other people say that they're not a real thing.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Rats will end up moving through a sewer tunnel that's so tight their tails get tangled together.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Like all of your cords sitting down by your search protector, except instead of your cell phone being plugged in, it's hundreds and hundreds of rats down there.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Like your cables get tangled together, their tails get tangled together.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Basically forms a giant ball of rats that begins to roll down the sewer, and the rats at the bottom are panicking, they're drowning, they're being pushed into the water.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 So they're running forward, and that makes the ball roll, so now they're able to breathe, but the rats behind them are now running in the dark, in the water, they're trying to breathe.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 So they keep running, and this ball is rolling through the sewer, devouring everything in its way, because obviously as it's rolling over you, each little mouth is going to take a bite.

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 I think people believe rat tails can get tangled and things like that, but the idea of it rolling through the sewer is just like a hairy disgusting grimace moving through the sewers of London.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I think that's what people are thinking that it's mythological. I don't think they go, "What? Rat tails can't get tangled?" No, they know that.

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 So that's the hypothesis of Robert L. France.

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 It's basically a rat king in the water. He says, "You have all of these fishing lines, all of these fishing nets around the British Isles that have been laying in the water for decades, and a group of fish will get stuck in one of these nets, and they can't get out of it."

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 They're swimming and they start moving the net through the water, and that accounts for the lumps, the coils. It's actually the matted net. It's like there could be a buoy, because they will sometimes attach buoys to the fishing net.

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 So the buoy's coming up and you have like the lump. You're like, "Jason, when I look out and I see a sea monster, I'm assuming you've seen a sea monster."

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 You guys didn't see a buoy, but what you do is you see all of these pictures, all of these sightings, are just lumps in the water. And the hair, the whiskers, is actually the fuzziness of the net itself.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 It accounts for the length of it, and it accounts for why it's moving so quickly and it's thrashing about. The fish are panicked. They're stuck.

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 It would explain why we're not finding bodies of these things, because the fish would eventually die. They can't get out of the net. The net just falls back to the ocean floor, or just gets taken away in the tide and ends up on a beach.

113
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 If you found the net, you want to go, "Oh, it's the remains of a sea monster." It's just a fishing net. And he said he could actually show an increase in sea serpent sightings.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 He said in the olden times around Britain, the nets were smaller. It wasn't this huge commercial fishing thing. It was local fishermen for local villages.

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 So fish would get stuck in those nets, but you'd just see a little lump. But he goes, "As the fishing industry grew and the nets grew bigger and stronger and harder to get out of, sea serpent sightings increased."

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I saw recently that the nets we use nowadays kind of close in on the fish like a cocoon. So it doesn't allow them to drag the net away.

117
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So we have the old smaller nets. You didn't seem to have much of a problem with it. You might have an occasional big net sighting.

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Then as fishing operations grew and the nets grew bigger, there was a glut of sea serpent sightings.

119
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Nowadays, the reason why we'll see less of them is the nets are different. They're not able to swim away and drag 300 feet of rope and net with them.

120
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 The nets like close up around the fish. It's done. Once they're caught in the net, they're done.

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 So it's a hypothesis, but it's an interesting hypothesis. And it's one of those things that we can look at observationally.

122
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 We can look at photos. We can look at sightings, which with sea serpents, it's usually just sightings and not a ton of photography, just like UFOs.

123
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 You have these sightings, and then if you can make a correlation to historical events, which would explain that, the fishing nets,

124
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 we have to take that hypothesis into account. It may not be the answer for every sea serpent sighting, but it may be the answer for a lot of them.

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And I'd say the same thing about UFOs or ghosts. I'd say that sometimes it's a trick of the light. Sometimes it's imagination. Sometimes you're tired.

126
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But it doesn't account for all of them. It doesn't account for all of them. So just because this steady has come forward, doesn't mean sea serpents don't exist.

127
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 It just means that a lot of them might not. A lot of the sea serpents out there may just be a bunch of fish trying to survive, and they're caught in nets.

128
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And doesn't that make us the real monsters? It doesn't. It doesn't. I saw then one of the articles I was reading, they said,

129
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 "Man is the real monster for making nets fish can't get out of." And I thought, "Yeah, but you know, like shark's stomachs, you fish can't get out of there either?"

130
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 And sharks eat a bunch of fish? Is it really bad? Like, if you had to figure out what's worse, getting stuck on a net, and thrashing about,

131
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 and having some bloke in England take a picture of you, the picture of your corpse, picture of your half a life corpse thrashing for life,

132
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 someone takes a picture of you and then you become the world's most famous sea monster, what's worse, that, or you're swimming.

133
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 This is going to give some vor freak. This is going to give some vor fetish guy. This is going to make his day. You're swimming in the water,

134
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 and then you feel like stuff come up behind you. You're like, "What's that? What's that? I can't see behind me."

135
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And then you see teeth in front of you, OOP, and now you're in a shark's belly. And nobody, you're not famous at all. You're not famous at all.

136
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 You're just getting digested in a shark's belly. What would you rather, is humans, is man the real monster because fish get tangled in nets?

137
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 The very least, they're famous. But again, I think that's an interesting story, and I don't think man is the true monster. The true monster are the monsters,

138
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 like Dracula and Frankenstein and the great white shark.

139
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 So Joseph, call on that, CarpenterCopter. We're leaving behind the British Isles. Joseph is like, "Wait a second. So the first episode of Sea Serpent Week,

140
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 you dedicated to debunking sea serpents." Kind of. I just found this story so fascinating, and I actually love looking at the other side of paranormal phenomenon.

141
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 I just love it. I love it. I hope you guys enjoy that too. I hope you guys found it fascinating. Again, it doesn't answer every sea serpent sighting,

142
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 but it really may explain a bunch of them. Joseph, now that you're done, now that you're done back-sassin' me, let's go ahead and hop in that CarpenterCopter.

143
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 I want you to take us away from the British Isles we are headed to Washington, D.C.

144
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 CarpenterCopter is flying over the Atlantic Ocean. I gotta watch this movie. I have a copy of it.

145
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And let me read you the promo here, and then I'll kind of explain a little bit more to you. But, new today on Digital and On Demand,

146
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Joel McHale and Carrie Bache lead an all-star cast in the dark romantic comedy, Happily.

147
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 The film centers around a couple who, after 14 years of marriage, discover their friends are resentful of their constant public displays of affection.

148
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 When a visit from a mysterious stranger leads to a dead body, they begin to question the loyalty of their so-called friends.

149
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Buy or rent Happily today on Digital and On Demand, rated R, from Paramount Pictures.

150
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 So before I take on promos, I'll watch the trailer for the movie to see if it will fit the audience and be something that I'm interested in watching.

151
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 If that promo read, if that description of the movie doesn't sell you on it, watch the trailer.

152
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I'm gonna put it in the show notes, because the trailer looks a lot...hmmm...the trailer looks really...weird.

153
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 The trailer, if you're like that dark romantic comedy, what's Jason talking about?

154
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Watch the trailer. Watch the trailer. I'm really curious about this movie. I really wanna watch this, and I like Joel McHale.

155
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 So, yeah, yeah, if that promo read doesn't do it for you, watch the trailer. I'll put it in the show notes, because it definitely does look very interesting.

156
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I'm just so busy, but I am gonna watch it this weekend. Happily, today on Digital and On Demand.

157
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 As we're headed out to Washington, DC, rock music starts playing.

158
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 [singing]

159
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Rock music's playing. I'm handing out military weaponry. I'm putting a bulletproof vest on a bee.

160
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I didn't think I'd ever do that, but here we are.

161
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 [singing]

162
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Load your weapons, guys. Get everything ready.

163
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Bee, do you got that stinger missile? I mean, nods.

164
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 [laughs]

165
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Anyways. I don't know. It's been a long day. It's been a long day.

166
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 We are headed to the underground tunnels underneath the United States.

167
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 So, Carbinder Coptor. [singing]

168
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Just like-- Originally, I was gonna say it was flying through tunnels and all that stuff, but whatever.

169
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 We just get out and land Josephs like, "What? I was totally ready to navigate these underground tunnels."

170
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And he goes, "Yeah, you know, it's been a long, loud day. Let's get out of the Carbinder Coptor.

171
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 We are walking. We just opened a door. It's way less dramatic."

172
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 We go into the underground tunnels.

173
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Now, we actually started covering the Underground War back on Episode 586.

174
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 It's a really common conspiracy theory, and it makes a lot of sense.

175
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Not in the sense that it exists, but it makes sense in this narrative of US militaries fighting a cabalist.

176
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 A cabal of Satan worshipers, because if someone says, "Did you know that the US military is fighting Satan worshipers?"

177
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Your first question would be, "Okay, that's kind of cool. Where?"

178
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And then the person's eyes shift from side to side, because obviously, you want to see footage of that, right?

179
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You want to see guys with hoods and daggers that make all the wavy things.

180
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 They look like sea servant daggers. They're all hairy. They're just sea nets with fish on the end of them.

181
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 You know the ceremonial daggers? You want to see guys in the hoods going "Oh, nom, nom, nom."

182
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 "Oh, nom, nom." They're eating a bunch of cookies.

183
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And then US soldiers kicking down the door and being like, "Chucka, chucka, chucka, chucka!"

184
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Shooting them. And then they're throwing snakes. They're casting spells and things like that.

185
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And the soldiers are like, "Barry, no!" And then Barry gets turned into a toad.

186
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And you have to go home to his wife and be like, "We're so sorry. Your beloved husband."

187
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Here he is. If they give the woman a toad. This is your new dad, Billy. He's a toad.

188
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 The sane worshippers got him. If someone said that US soldiers were fighting sane worshippers,

189
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 you'd want to see video of it, live leak or something, right? You'd want to see it.

190
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 So the obvious answer for it is, "Oh, no, you can't see it because it's underground."

191
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Then your second question will be, "Well, don't cameras work underground?"

192
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is 800 miles underground, according to one source.

193
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 800 miles underground, I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure everyone's a sane worshipper

194
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 because it's as hot as hell down there. I don't know where they got 800 miles underground.

195
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 But that was one of the comments left on this whole series of articles we're going to be taking a look at.

196
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And so let's assume that person was wrong and that it's were only 10 miles underground,

197
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 which is still incredibly hot. Let's say we're a little bit underground.

198
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Everyone's looking at me in the darkness or in a tunnel. You guys are like,

199
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 "You really don't know how deep underground we are." Well, where we're at,

200
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 it doesn't really matter the number because we're in what's known as a deep underground military base,

201
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 or a DUM. And these are really common in conspiracy theory culture.

202
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I'll tell you this right now. There are underground military bases.

203
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 I don't know if they're as plentiful as the DUM conspiracy, and that's what they call it.

204
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 The DUM conspiracy lets it out to be, but I'm 100% believe that there's underground military bases.

205
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I just don't think they're as deep. I don't think they're full as reptilians or sane worshippers.

206
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 But of course there's underground military bases.

207
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 So there's a little bit, when you have a little bit of truth sprinkled into your conspiracy theory,

208
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 it's even better. It's an even better story.

209
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 But anyway, so US soldiers fighting sane worshippers underneath the United States.

210
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 It's a perfect story because there's no physical proof of it. You can never find it.

211
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And it's kick-ass, right? That's dope.

212
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Shootin' a bunch of dudes running around in cloaks. They're riding on brooms.

213
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Woohoohoohoo! I'll get you next time, Joe! NEXT TIME!

214
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Awesome.

215
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 We covered it in episode 586 when it turns out that 50,000 Chinese troops were trying to invade the state of Maine.

216
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Why they chose that state? I'm not for sure.

217
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And we blew the tunnels up and we instantly killed 50,000 Chinese troops.

218
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 That happened according to DarkOutPost.com. 50,000 Chinese troops were blowing up underneath the state of Maine.

219
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 The word is right now. And this is all... I kind of am jumping the lead here.

220
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 This is all from DarkOutPost.com, which is where I got the Chinese story from.

221
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 They're really big on underground tunnels. They're really big on sane worshippers as well.

222
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 DarkOutPost... I'll be serious. DarkOutPost.com makes Alex Jones' podcast look like NPR.

223
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 They say just the most outlandish stuff on DarkOutPost.com.

224
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Like this. Like this stuff we're about to talk about.

225
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 So on February 26, 2021, the news was exposed to the world.

226
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Sane worshippers were being hunted in tunnels underneath the United States.

227
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But on March 3rd, if you thought that was big news, if you thought that was big news, put down your sandwich right now.

228
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Make a sandwich. Make a sandwich if you didn't have one. And then put it down.

229
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 On March 3rd, 2021, the military are moving through the tunnels and they actually reach the White House.

230
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And the soldiers are like making those hand signs and stuff like that.

231
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 They're like, "Go, go, go. You, stand in that corner. You. If you're dead, you got killed by a sane worshipper.

232
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I didn't give you an order soon enough."

233
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 The rest of us, go Joe and everyone's running. Be running in a battle.

234
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 He left us to join the fray.

235
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Sane worshippers have a, of course, according to this conspiracy, the sane worshippers have a huge base underneath the White House itself.

236
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And as the military are surrounding the sane worshippers underneath the White House, they've actually saved thousands of children.

237
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 That's a lot of kids to be underground.

238
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 I guess that's a lot of kids to be in the possession of sane worshippers as well.

239
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 But it's definitely a lot of kids to be crammed under tunnels under the United States. Thousands of children.

240
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Now, remember, what was it? 1% or 0.1% of all missing people who go missing in a year are stranger abductions.

241
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And I think that came out to like 600 people a year are kidnapped.

242
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 There's like so many people, like 600,000 people go missing a year, but most of those are runaways and then most of them are kidnapping from non-custodial parents.

243
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 But 0.1% of them actually are children going to bed at night and the parents come in the next day and the kid's gone.

244
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Or the little kid at the mall wandering around the corner and never seeing again.

245
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 It comes out to about 600.

246
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 So if you had thousands of children found in these tunnels, they've been put in work.

247
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Like, they're beating the odds. They're beating the odds.

248
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 If 600 kids are missing a year, they would have had to been doing this for 10, 20 years.

249
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And you go, "Jason, they have been doing this for 10, 20 years."

250
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And I go, "Probably."

251
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 But children age if you were kid... I don't mean to make light of this, but if you were kidnapped 20 years ago and you're rescued in 2021,

252
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 you're now like 28, you're 28, 30 year old man.

253
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You're kidnapped from a mall when you're playing Hang On at the local arcade and now you're underneath the White House and the soldiers are like, "We freed you, little Timmy."

254
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And little Timmy turns and goes, "Thank you."

255
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 His voice is super deep.

256
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 He still has his old little Timmy clothes on, but it's like the shirt only comes up to his chest.

257
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 It's like this giant crop top and he's wearing like shorts that he burst out of.

258
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 He looks like the Hulk.

259
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Thank you, guys.

260
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 If anyone beat my high score on Cruise in USA, they're like, "Timmy, you'll find out. You'll find out."

261
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 So the US soldiers, after they're rescuing these kids, their plan is to explode the tunnels.

262
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Just blow out all of these tunnels, because they're infested with sand worshipers.

263
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 You can't go and you fight them.

264
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 I saw one comment that they had that it was so contained, they have to fight hand to hand.

265
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Tunnels are, I mean, I'm not an architect or a sewer man or a rat king, but aren't tunnels usually straight?

266
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 One of that actually be the easiest place to shoot someone?

267
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 A long straight tunnel?

268
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Anyways, I love the comment section on DarkOutBose.com, because people are always arguing with these bizarre beliefs.

269
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And not really in like, "You're dumb," a thing. They actually try to poke holes in the--

270
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 or some of them are like, "You're an idiot."

271
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 But they actually try to poke holes in the argument, so I think a lot of people who are in the comments--

272
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 it's such an obscure website.

273
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I think people in the comment section actually kind of believe or maybe are interested in these theories,

274
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 but then they go, "Wait, what?"

275
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Lori in the comment section says this, so they're getting ready to blow these tunnels up, and this is Lori's comment.

276
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Why would they blow the tunnels up underground?

277
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 If they rescue and clean out the tunnels, why not keep the tunnels there?

278
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 If these crisscross the United States, because there are these maps of these tunnel systems all over the United States, why are they blowing up?

279
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 She has a good point. She says, "If we need to hide in the tunnels from an asteroid, a world killer coming down,

280
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 if we have this massive underground system that was created by the US military, taken over by sane worshipers, expanded by said sane worshipers,

281
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 why wouldn't we want to keep them instead of blowing them up?"

282
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Moab, famous commenter Moab, says, "I love this, so imagine that an asteroid is coming towards Earth.

283
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 It's going to peel back the crust of the planet. It's going to plunge us into a thousand years of darkness.

284
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 However, if you can get underground, you can survive. You have a choice. You can do that.

285
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 You can survive the asteroid impact, or according to Moab, these tunnels and bases are haunted

286
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 because the sane worshipers have been down there for so long, the malevolent forces they call upon have infested the walls.

287
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 There's blood everywhere, and you're in the fallout shelter, you go get some coffee.

288
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Ring around the rosy little girls in the corner of the room. No eyes have been clawed out by the demons.

289
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 You can live there, live, be in the operative word, or you can get obliterated by an asteroid and all of human history go with it.

290
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Would you hide in a haunted house if it would save you from not just certain death, but annihilation of the race of humans?

291
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I would take my chances with the ring around the rosy girls versus a planet killer asteroid.

292
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 But anyways, so Moab, point taken, however, you can easily stay outside as the sky turns to fire.

293
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I will go down into the underground base and sure I might have to sleep in the nightlight on and uninstall all the mirrors.

294
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Bloody Mary doesn't get me, but I'm still alive.

295
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 It's funny, so and then a lot of other commenters were like, wait a second, if these underground bases are everywhere and you blow them up, won't that cause huge sinkholes and the structural integrity of boring?

296
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 No one wants to talk about that. No one wants to talk about that.

297
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 So many people were commenting on that and they're just basically getting brushed under the rug.

298
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 They're like, if these things crisscross the United States and you're blowing them out, shouldn't it like entire sections of, oh, we don't want to talk about structural integrity?

299
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 What are you talking about, you bum?

300
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And I don't know why I even wasted time talking about it because we got breaking news.

301
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 March 5th, 20, I don't know why I'm so dumb, guys.

302
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 I don't know why I even, I, I, I don't know why I'm debating this because on March 5th, we have video evidence.

303
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 The bombs underneath Washington DC were detonated.

304
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 The tunnels were destroyed.

305
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 The St. Worshipers were cleared out.

306
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 It's all over, ladies and gentlemen.

307
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 We won.

308
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 The United States military exploded stuff underneath the Capitol.

309
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Why did I even doubt that?

310
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I did see the video footage. I feel like such a fool.

311
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 This video footage, this video footage of, it looks like, it looks like steam, it looks like steam coming out of vents, but it's not.

312
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 You fool.

313
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 It's smoke.

314
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Sure.

315
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 It's been happening for decades.

316
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Steam, I mean, I mean smoke coming out of the vents.

317
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Have you ever seen a movie filmed in New York?

318
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Have you ever lived in New York and seen steam come out of the manholes?

319
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 You fool.

320
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 That wasn't steam.

321
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 That was smoke from bombs.

322
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And that wasn't in an '80s movie.

323
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 That movie was filmed yesterday.

324
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Those bombs just went off on March 5th.

325
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 There's video footage.

326
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 There's video footage of white gas coming out of the ground all over Washington, D.C.

327
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 out of these vents that are strategically placed all around the city that happen to line up with the main heating system of the Capitol building.

328
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Yes, these things are called steam tunnels, and they've been called steam tunnels since the '40s.

329
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And yes, these tunnels link a massive heating generating building, a steam building.

330
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 The building's not made of steam, but a giant building used to supply heat through steam.

331
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 These vents move underneath the city to all these other government facilities to provide them with heat.

332
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Yes, that is totally verifiable, and the steam tunnels have been around for decades.

333
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Yes.

334
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 And there's smoke coming out of those tunnels right now in that same order all around the White House.

335
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 But even though you could have seen this stuff pretty much on any cold day, there was bombs too.

336
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 It's been bombs the whole time.

337
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 The next time you're walking outside and it's a cold day and you breathe, you ate a bomb.

338
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 There was a Saint worshiper in your mouth while you were sleeping, and a U.S. soldier threw a grenade in, saluted you, and said, "You're welcome."

339
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 That's what that is.

340
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 That's what that is.

341
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 That's what it is.

342
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 It's all smoke.

343
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Now, if you think I'm exaggerating that people actually are confusing steam with smoke, you can go to the show notes and you can watch a certain video from...

344
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 This is such a beautiful mess, and this is one of the reasons why I love stuff like Dark Outpost.

345
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 There's a video on Dark Outpost.

346
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 I would love to play the audio clip, but I have a sneaking suspicion that if I did, this group would come after me and throw me in a tunnel, put a bomb in my stomach.

347
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 They would try to get into the podcast shut down.

348
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Copyright violation, DMCA. You gotta be real careful with that type of stuff.

349
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 I use audio clips very sparingly on the show.

350
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 A lot of other podcasts get away with it, but it's a risky game, and I gotta thank a thousand episodes from now.

351
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I can't think about just the pure entertainment value of this one.

352
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 But luckily, I will do a reenactment of this video.

353
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 But the video will be in the show notes and you can jump ahead to nine minutes in the video and hear what I'm about to do for you.

354
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 So let me play the...

355
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Let me give you an image of what we're seeing in this video.

356
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 This video is a DarkOutpost.com video that was submitted to them or they had found on YouTube, one of the two.

357
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And it is a man holding his cell phone, recording...

358
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Not in Washington, DC.

359
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 He's not recording it live in Washington, DC.

360
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 He is recording a YouTube video.

361
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 So he's watching something on YouTube and he's recording it with his phone.

362
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Height of technology, guys.

363
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 He's recording so it's all blurry and shaky and stuff like that.

364
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And he's holding his phone and he's like, "Look, look, there's no one at the White House."

365
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 It's like, the view is so huge.

366
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 The view between the original camera and the White House is so big.

367
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And now we're looking at it on a cell phone, on a wiggly cell phone, and his laptop monitor.

368
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And he's like, "Look, there's no one there."

369
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 And I was like, "I don't know. There could be a hundred people there. I can't tell."

370
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 But he's not really focused on that. That does have to do with this weird conspiracy right now that no one's in the White House.

371
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 But he keeps showing these steam vents.

372
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 I mean, you could call it smoke, except it very quickly evaporates.

373
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Smoke normally doesn't go up four feet in the air and just evaporate.

374
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 But this steam, he shows all these steam vents all over Washington, DC.

375
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 It's evidence.

376
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 I mean, again, you could go...

377
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 I found a YouTube video from another guy, and he's like, "He does videos about Washington, DC. He lives there."

378
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And he tested it.

379
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 I don't even think it was about this conspiracy theory. I just think he was curious about it.

380
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 But he tests it. He actually drives up.

381
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 He rents a bicycle and goes up to one of these vents.

382
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And he holds his...

383
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 He takes the lens cap.

384
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 This is how you actually test this stuff.

385
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 He takes the lens cap off of his camera, and he holds it up and it condensates.

386
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And he goes, "This is what happens steam. Steam will condensate."

387
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 So he goes, "Yeah, steam."

388
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And then he went into the history of the steam tunnels, and he kind of showed like an old blueprint,

389
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 because you can't get blueprints to these anymore, because these tunnels lead...

390
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 They do lead to government buildings all over.

391
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 You know there has to be secret service agents in the tunnels.

392
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 But anyway, so that was a really cool video.

393
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 That's also in the show notes.

394
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 It's very observational based.

395
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 You know, this is that, and da-da-da-da-da.

396
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Let's return to the knuckleheads@darkappos.com, because they have this camera, and they're filming the laptop.

397
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And then he goes...

398
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 He's talking to his girlfriend or his wife off camera, and he goes, "Hey, honey, honey, pull up that video.

399
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Pull up that other video of the smoke."

400
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And then you hear this, "I can't. I can't. I can't, honey."

401
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And he's like, "No, no, no. Click the button. Click that button. I can't do it.

402
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 It's not... It says cannot be played."

403
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And he's like, "Your fingernail is in the way. This is not me improv-ing."

404
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 They're actually recording all of this stuff, and he's like, "No, it's your fingertip.

405
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 It's it."

406
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 And then they start arguing over why she can't get the video to play.

407
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 And then he... She shows him her cell phone, and it says this video cannot be played.

408
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And the man says, "You know, I gotta tell you right now, we're not able to access these videos.

409
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 These videos are being shut down.

410
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 They don't want the truth to get out."

411
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 The CIA demons, the demonically possessed CIA piggly wigglies, is what he calls them,

412
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 makes them sound kind of cute, right?

413
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 You can't really use demonically possessed and piggly wigglies in the same sentence,

414
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 but these demonically possessed CIA piggly wigglies don't want the truth to get out.

415
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Oh, wait, no, she got it going.

416
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 And then she holds up her phone, and they watch the video on her phone.

417
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 So the demonically possessed... I found that so fascinating.

418
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 They have a brief technological glitch, probably because of her two inch long nails,

419
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 which they show as she's trying to click on the button.

420
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And it says this video cannot be played.

421
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 He immediately goes on a diatribe about how demon possessed CIA agents are currently stopping the truth from getting out.

422
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 He is then able to access the video, and he does not backtrack that at all.

423
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 He doesn't go, "Oh, I guess I was wrong.

424
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 It was just a technical glitch.

425
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Maybe the CIA demon piggly wigglies were taking the day off."

426
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Sorry about that. No, it's working just fine.

427
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Once they get the video working, that's it.

428
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 He does not backtrack at all.

429
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 The video is not working because the truth is being shut down.

430
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Oh, wait, never mind.

431
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 He didn't say never mind.

432
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 The video just starts working, and then he shows it.

433
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Fascinate that I don't understand how that brain processes information.

434
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 I understand you can make statements that are wrong.

435
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I can understand, "I've had that.

436
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 We've all had that where something's not going right with our phone,

437
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 and we start thinking, 'Oh, something, we don't think the CIA demon piggly wigglies are doing anything,'

438
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 or we don't find something, and we think, 'Oh, did that stupid girl who came over to my house the other day,

439
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 did she steal my watch or something like that?'

440
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 And then you find it, and you're like, 'Ah, I guess she didn't.'

441
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 We've all had that sensation, right?

442
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 We've all had that sensation when some strange girl comes over.

443
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 But, one, I wasn't recording, and I could have edited it out if I realized that she's not the one who stole my watch.

444
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 But, he makes this claim, and then it turns out to be true.

445
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 It turns out that it was a technical error, and he doesn't backtrack at all,

446
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 because his brain is processing information at such a...

447
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 It's...

448
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 I can't...

449
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 It's not...

450
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 He's not thinking critically.

451
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Computer glitch equals CIA demon piggly wigglies.

452
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I can actually, in his worldview, I can understand that,

453
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 once the video starts working, then how does he...

454
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Then they are letting the truth get out.

455
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 That's what... The second part is what I don't... How his brain would process that.

456
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 We can't reveal the truth. Oh, wait, now we can.

457
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 How does his brain hold? How do... How do... What...

458
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 I would have loved to have been able to, like, become a neutron in his brain during that moment.

459
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 How does that work?

460
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 But, I'm not a brain specialist. I'm not a neutron.

461
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 I'm not a psychologist. I'm just an ordinary man.

462
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Trying to make sense of a world where CIA demonic piggly wigglies

463
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 are suppressing information and then just letting it out,

464
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 and where steam is actually smoke, and...

465
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 200... This was the end of it being the total.

466
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 200,000 children were rescued underneath the White House.

467
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 The first couple thousand? That was just a warm-up.

468
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 It ended up being a total of 200,000 kids.

469
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Now, that's dope, right? I'm not saying that kids need to be kept underneath the White House.

470
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 So, we can at least celebrate that.

471
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 200,000 imaginary children have been rescued.

472
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 They've been returned to their imaginary households,

473
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 and they will go on to live happily ever after imaginary lives.

474
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 So, that is the saga. I know you guys are like, "Jason, why are you wasting my time?"

475
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Of course. We all knew about this. We all saw the news

476
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 about the tunnels underneath Washington DC, and we saw the explosions and the smoke.

477
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Jason, who do you think I am? Why do you think I listen to your podcasts?

478
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 I listen for obscure stuff, not stuff that's reported on the nightly news, and I'm sorry.

479
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 Don't know why I wasted your time.

480
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 And, sure, but I wanted to make sure...

481
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 I wanted to really make sure for those of you out there who don't read fiction on these papers,

482
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 don't read the Daily Planet, read newspapers from this reality,

483
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 I wanted to make sure that you guys knew about this.

484
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 The next time you pick up your phone to share a video exposing the truth and it doesn't work,

485
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 CIA demonic piggly wigglies.

486
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Your phone isn't charged. Your phone, you let it sit out too long, you let it sit out too long,

487
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 and you're using it and the battery goes down.

488
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 CIA demonic piggly wigglies.

489
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 You go outside, you see smoke in the sky. It's blocking the view of the sun.

490
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 It should just be blue sky and sun, nothing else, but instead you see big, fluffy clouds of smoke.

491
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 The sky bombs were detonated once again. You've been seeing the smoke all your life.

492
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 You know the truth.

493
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 You took a video of it too and you shared it on YouTube.

494
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 It was up forever. Never got taken down.

495
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 But you know it's only because the CIA demonic piggly wigglies haven't found it yet.

496
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Just remember that the world you observe is not the truth.

497
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 And science is not the truth.

498
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 And just plain common sense is not the truth.

499
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 You can blow up tunnels underneath cities with no repercussions whatsoever.

500
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 You can go 800 miles underground and find reptilians that you have to fight hand to hand.

501
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Bowie knife versus ceremonial dagger.

502
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 And even though 200,000 children is a lot of children to cram underneath a single building, you fool.

503
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 You're not thinking, well you are.

504
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 You're thinking of physics and how space inhabits things and how matter can only be in one space at one time.

505
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 But you've got to stop thinking about that stuff.

506
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 The only thing you have to remember is CIA demonic piggly wigglies.

507
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 After that, everything else falls into place.

508
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
