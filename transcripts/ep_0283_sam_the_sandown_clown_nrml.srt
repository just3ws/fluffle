1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 An attempted kidnapping turns really weird, really quick.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,760
 And then we take a look at the story of Sam, a clown who was in town for just one day.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,240
 But where he came from was far away from any big top on Earth.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:26,400
 [Music]

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,720
 It's root canal day.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,920
 I'm recording this episode pretty early because I have to run to the dentist.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,160
 But anyways, you can tell how excited I am about that.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,160
 Let's go ahead and move on to a happier topic and that is our Patreon, our newest Patreon

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,280
 supporters.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,200
 We have Dalton Ogden.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,720
 We have Carson Wright, good friend of mine actually, I know him in real life.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,480
 It's weird when somebody you know is like, "Here's $5 a month."

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,200
 And before if I'd been like, "Hey Carson, can I borrow $5?

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
 I want to go buy some gum."

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,920
 He'd be like, "Get a job, hippie."

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,000
 But now he can pay me $5 a month for doing the show.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,160
 Actually, no, he's a really good guy.

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,360
 He would have given me some gum.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,280
 And I'm going to apologize right now because this is one of the names I have a really hard

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,360
 time pronouncing.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
 One of the names.

27
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,840
 There's so many names I have a hard time pronouncing.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,240
 I'm going to say it very slowly here.

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
 Jeremy Davis.

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,840
 I had a friend name.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,280
 It's Jeremy, right?

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,440
 I had a friend for years.

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
 I kept calling him.

34
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
 He's a really good guy.

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
 I really miss him.

36
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
 I haven't seen him in years.

37
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,080
 But I thought it was pronounced "Jermy."

38
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,440
 That's how you said it was "Jermy."

39
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,000
 "Hey, Jeremy."

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,200
 And I'm 25 at this point.

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,640
 I was in seven.

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,080
 And finally he pulls me aside one day and he goes, "Dude, that's not how you pronounce

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
 my name.

44
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,760
 That's how people used to make fun of me in school."

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
 I was like, "What?

46
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
 I thought that's how you say it.

47
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,440
 I thought your name was "Jermy."

48
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
 And he's like, "Shh.

49
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
 Quit saying it.

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,400
 You've been saying it all this time.

51
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,240
 My name's not "Jermy."

52
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,600
 It's "Jermy."

53
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,120
 But then I've met people who said, "Oh, no.

54
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,200
 My name's Jeremy."

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,960
 So I don't even know anymore.

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,520
 But either way, Jeremy Davis, thank you so much for the support of the show.

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,080
 Same thing with you, Dalton Ogden and Carson Wright.

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
 Sorry, Dalton.

59
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,680
 I don't have a funny story about your name.

60
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,840
 It's a very cool name, though.

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,280
 It reminds me of Timothy Dalton because I'm an old man and I know who Timothy Dalton is.

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,240
 Let's go ahead and get started with the story here.

63
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,880
 So the first story, I woke up and I read this story.

64
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,080
 Now a lot of times I'm doing a lot of research and I'm kind of building this stuff up.

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,640
 But every show often, a story pops up and I'm like, "This is it.

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,240
 This is what I need to talk about this story today.

67
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
 So weird."

68
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
 And it actually just happened on Friday.

69
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
 So we're going to go ahead.

70
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,320
 At the top of the Jason Jalopy, we're going to drive to Cleveland, Ohio.

71
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,880
 We're going way back in time to August 16th, 2019, driving by in the Jason Jalopy.

72
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,120
 And we stop at a street corner and we see a 12-year-old girl sitting down waiting for

73
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
 the bus.

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,880
 She's kind of sitting there eating our gum that Carson got us.

75
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,560
 And we see a car pull up and a dude starts talking to the girl.

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
 So now we're like, "Great.

77
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,760
 It's going to be one of those type of stories."

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,400
 He's talking to the girl and he's basically like, "Hey, what are you doing?"

79
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,480
 And she's like, "I'm waiting for a school bus.

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,960
 I am a school-aged child after all.

81
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,600
 I'm 12 years old."

82
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,800
 And he's like, "Well, you know, I could drive you to school."

83
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,440
 And she's like, "No, I'm good."

84
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,960
 And he's like, "Can I ask you a couple of questions?"

85
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,720
 Like he wanted to talk with her at this point.

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
 She's like, "No."

87
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
 But she kept shutting him down.

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,800
 And when the police were talking about this, the police said she was very insistent she

89
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
 did not want to talk to this guy.

90
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,080
 But he keeps on like, "Hey, you know, like so what do you think?

91
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
 It's Fortnite season 10."

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,560
 And she's like, "Dude, just leave.

93
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,240
 I don't want to talk to you."

94
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,920
 He ends up driving away.

95
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,920
 So we're like, "Whoa, that was close."

96
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,680
 And a couple minutes later, the car pulls back up and the guy gets out of the car and

97
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,520
 gets his cell phone and begins videotaping what's going to happen.

98
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,280
 I guess the term is recording.

99
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,040
 It's not videotaping if you're using an iPhone.

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,400
 But again, old man, he begins recording what he's going to do.

101
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,840
 So he gets out of his car, he starts walking towards her and he's recording her.

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
 And then he begins to pee on her.

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,880
 Just pee right on her.

104
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,640
 Now, here's the thing.

105
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,680
 No matter how bad your day is, that didn't happen to you.

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,840
 And trust me, you can have a really, you can have a really bad day.

107
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,080
 People car accident, loss of a loved one.

108
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
 Or you just stubbed your toe.

109
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
 It doesn't have to be super dramatic.

110
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,400
 It doesn't have to be horrible, life changing things.

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,320
 But okay, let's just go with a lighthearted one.

112
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,160
 You stub your toe and you're like, "Oh my God, I stubbed my toe."

113
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,560
 But if you stubbed your toe and then you turn around and there's a dude peeing on you, total,

114
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,840
 total, I'm having a root canal today as long as the dentist doesn't pee in my mouth, I'm

115
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
 good.

116
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
 I'm good.

117
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,640
 He begins peeing on her in broad daylight, middle of the day.

118
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,760
 And it's funny because we have the quotes of what she was saying, like that original

119
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,280
 conversation, how she was responding to this guy, this weirdo trying to get her in his car.

120
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,680
 And it was very like girl at the club.

121
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,040
 Like when you go to a bar or something like that and you try picking up a random girl and

122
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,400
 she's not interested, they just are very just like stone faced.

123
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,920
 They usually don't string you along.

124
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
 I'm like, "Hey."

125
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,120
 That's pretty much all the way.

126
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
 Like, "Hey."

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
 And they're like, "No."

128
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
 I'm like, "Okay."

129
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,640
 "Hey, I don't buy drinks, but if I'm like, "Hey, how you doing?"

130
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
 They'll be like, "No."

131
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
 I'm like, "Okay."

132
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,760
 And turn and walk away like a lot.

133
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,480
 And that's what this girl was, which is unfortunate because I, not that was unfortunate that she

134
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
 was shutting this guy down.

135
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,280
 It makes me think she's used to this kind of interaction with adults where she's just

136
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,280
 got into that club girl mode where she's like, "Nope."

137
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,840
 Just very, very brusque.

138
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,600
 She wasn't even trying to pretend to be polite.

139
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,920
 So I think she's had encounters with men like this before.

140
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:52,720
 But as he's pe- and again, not non- if someone was peeing on me, I don't- I think- I've never

141
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,960
 been peeing on in my life.

142
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,680
 I don't know how I would react.

143
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,960
 I don't think I would enjoy it.

144
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
 That would be a turn of events.

145
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
 I'm like, "Oh, it's kind of fun."

146
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,640
 I think I would just see red and then there would be red everywhere.

147
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,040
 Like I can't imagine my reaction if a stranger pissed on me.

148
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,240
 Her reaction was, "What's your problem?"

149
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,240
 Like I'm assuming she tried moving out of the way during this whole thing.

150
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,440
 But again, very non-plussed about the whole thing.

151
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
 She's like, "What's your problem?"

152
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,600
 Well, your problem right now is that somebody is peeing on you.

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,760
 Such a normal reaction.

154
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,840
 It'd be the same thing if someone spilled coffee on you.

155
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,280
 You're like, "What's wrong with you?"

156
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,800
 But instead of coffee, it's coming out of someone's genitals.

157
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
 And so he runs away.

158
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,520
 I think he- she did not give him the reaction that he wanted.

159
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,400
 She didn't freak out or run away or start crying or anything like that.

160
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,240
 She basically stared up into that stream and basically said, "What's your problem?"

161
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
 Like again, putting it back on him.

162
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,480
 He didn't have any power in the situation.

163
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
 He runs away.

164
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,840
 A couple hours later, he's spotted looking through some cars in the area acting weird

165
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,360
 so someone calls the cops.

166
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,600
 Now the cops have a description from the girl.

167
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,160
 The cops have a description from the person who saw him wandering the neighborhood.

168
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,640
 And the cops know who this guy is.

169
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,080
 He's a cop.

170
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
 He was a cop.

171
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,400
 His name is Solomon Hiewatiewa.

172
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,600
 34 years old.

173
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
 He'd been a cop for five years.

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,520
 And it's funny in the article they're like, "He's also been cited for losing his walkie-talkie."

175
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,220
 And I'm like, "I get you need to pad out your article, but I don't think that's relevant

176
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,840
 to peeing on a 12-year-old girl."

177
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,600
 And he's facing a ton of charges.

178
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,040
 So bravo to that girl.

179
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,400
 Bravo to that girl.

180
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,600
 She- he did not get what he wanted from her.

181
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,480
 I think he initially wanted to kidnap her and do whatever horrible things.

182
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,120
 And then when she shut him down, he wanted to have some sort of power over her.

183
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,480
 And even in that moment when she's being peed on, she's basically just like, "You're a little

184
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,880
 little man.

185
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,880
 I'm not reacting to this in any way, shape, or form as you would want me to."

186
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
 Again, I don't think she sat there like Buddha.

187
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,560
 I don't think she sat there in a monk pose as it's raining down on her.

188
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,240
 But she definitely did not give him the power and the panic that he wanted.

189
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,360
 So good on you, 12-year-old girl.

190
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,360
 I always love stories where people get their comeuppance in a very, very easy way.

191
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,880
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story now.

192
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,200
 Now our next story, we're going to England.

193
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,800
 Jolly Old England.

194
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,720
 And luckily, the Jason Jalopy doubles as a chitty-chitty-bing-bing cart.

195
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:39,200
 So it starts to slowly go up into the sky.

196
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
 It wasn't just a bizarre movie, but it was weird.

197
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,000
 Like I was maybe like 8 or 6 or something like that when the movie came out.

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,320
 It made me super attracted to Goth Girls because Farooza Bulk is in it.

199
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,840
 I think I've developed a stutter doing this show.

200
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,880
 Farooza Bulk is in it and she's a little Goth girl.

201
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,800
 And may not want to tell that story so close to the abduction story, but I was age appropriate

202
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,480
 when I had to think for her.

203
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
 Now I just like Goth Girls in general.

204
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,400
 There's not many Goth adults or when they're usually just called heroine users.

205
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,160
 But the reason why I'm getting at that was that the whole movie totally tripped me out.

206
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,200
 I remember that scene where they took a couch and if you've never seen the movie of no

207
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,320
 idea what I'm talking about, I recommend it.

208
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
 Return to Oz.

209
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,800
 You take a couch and you put a moose head on one end of it and put some feathers in

210
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,000
 the side of it and then they threw some juice on it and it came to life and they flew away.

211
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,800
 That is what I'm trying to say is that is the aerodynamic ability of the Jason Jalopy.

212
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,480
 Took way too long to build that visual.

213
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,000
 But I'll save it.

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,520
 Dead Rapper recommends Return to Oz.

215
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,280
 Okay so it's totally scary movie.

216
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,200
 Dorothy gets electroshock treatment at the beginning of the movie.

217
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,640
 That's how dark that movie is.

218
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,040
 But anyways, where was I going?

219
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,920
 Oh yeah, yeah, we're flying the Jason Jalopy.

220
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,040
 But we do land in England.

221
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,120
 And we land in the year 1973.

222
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
 It's May.

223
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,720
 It's a beautiful May afternoon.

224
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,960
 And two little friends, they're both seven years old, are out on a magical adventure

225
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,440
 walking around a golf course.

226
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:23,640
 We're at Lake Common, which is in Sandown, which is on the Isle of Wight.

227
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,360
 And on that location at Lake Common, there's the Shanklin and Sandown Golf Club.

228
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,640
 And we got these two little kids.

229
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,160
 Now we don't have names, so we're going to call them, we're going to call, you know

230
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
 what dude?

231
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,440
 We are going to call them Dalton and Jeremy.

232
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
 They're a Patreon subscriber.

233
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,160
 So it's sorry, Carson.

234
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,920
 You're a ghost floating around, but I don't mention you again.

235
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,360
 So Jeremy is the girl.

236
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,160
 This is going real off the rails.

237
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,600
 Anyways, Jeremy and Dalton, you can assign which gender you want to be.

238
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,160
 There's Boy and a Girl walking through this golf club.

239
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,640
 Yeah, walking through this golf club.

240
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,280
 Now, again, we don't know their real names.

241
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,160
 We don't know their real names.

242
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,680
 Okay, so I'll just refer to them as Boy and Girl.

243
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,160
 I think that'll be far easier than calling.

244
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,520
 Okay, anyways, Boy and Girl are walking through the golf club.

245
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,020
 Golf course.

246
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
 Golf course.

247
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,080
 They're walking through the golf course.

248
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
 Okay.

249
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,800
 And the golf course butts up against an old semi-abandoned airfield, which is ridiculous

250
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,160
 because you either want to land your plane at a functional airfield or not at all.

251
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,160
 Like I can understand if it was an emergency airfield, but it was described as an oft-abandoned

252
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,600
 airfield, which again, there's just like bales of hay in the middle of it.

253
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 Planes are crashing.

254
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,760
 So anyways, let's get this back on track.

255
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,800
 They are at the golf course against the airport.

256
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,720
 Now, they're walking across this foot.

257
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,960
 They're just having fun, just two little kids having fun walking around.

258
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,920
 Jeremy and Dalton on an adventure.

259
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,320
 So they're crossing this wooden footbridge, right?

260
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,960
 And it's over this creek.

261
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,440
 And they're like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun," walking through.

262
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 And they're walking through, and then they hear a "Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

263
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:41,440
 And they're walking through and then they hear a "Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

264
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,440
 Underneath the footbridge, they see a blue-gloved hand reach out of the darkness and begin beckoning

265
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,120
 them towards the hand.

266
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,440
 Are we seeing this correctly?

267
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,000
 Because not only are they seeing a blue-gloved hand kind of saying, "Come here.

268
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,680
 Come here."

269
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:10,040
 The hand seems to have a wooden slat that pops out of a sleeve going into the glove of the

270
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,760
 hand.

271
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,560
 And the hand only has three fingers.

272
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,320
 But it's still kind of beckoning them closer.

273
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,720
 And they just stand there motionless.

274
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,520
 And then the owner of the hand appears.

275
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,920
 They see a near-seven-foot-tall person step out from underneath the bridge.

276
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,040
 Long, lanky limbs.

277
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,600
 A perfectly round head.

278
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,640
 But it's too large for its skinny frame.

279
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,680
 And then the descriptions get really weird.

280
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 They see its face.

281
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,280
 It has a hat, like a pointed hat with a little ball on top.

282
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
 That's not the face.

283
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
 That's the hat.

284
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
 But I'm describing that first.

285
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,680
 Now we're going down to the face.

286
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,080
 The face looked like someone was wearing a mask.

287
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:08,000
 It had triangle eyes, a little brown nose, and a mouth.

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,800
 But you could see into those darkness.

289
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,960
 So it wasn't just like it was necessarily having makeup.

290
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
 It wasn't just like someone had makeup on.

291
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:24,320
 It was like someone had put on a helmet that had these markings on it.

292
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
 And you couldn't see through it.

293
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,200
 But underneath the hat, they could see hair.

294
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,080
 So hair was coming out of this supposed mask.

295
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,760
 Imagine someone putting on a scuba diver mask because the head's completely round.

296
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,960
 So it wasn't just covering the face.

297
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,560
 Imagine someone putting on a scuba diving mask so it's completely round over their head.

298
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,480
 But then there's hair coming out of the top, the scuba diving helmet.

299
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,600
 The hair is actually part of the scuba diving helmet.

300
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
 Has this little hat on.

301
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,080
 You just see a little bit of hair sticking out here and there is like a reddish hair.

302
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,880
 And it had like little circles for cheeks.

303
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,720
 You know, it was basically like if someone drew, if a kid drew a picture of a clown, that's

304
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,600
 what this dude's face looked like.

305
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,120
 And it had wooden antennas sticking out of both sides of the head.

306
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,520
 So you have the cap on and then the wooden antennas sticking out of it.

307
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,080
 And its feet also had three toes.

308
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,600
 Like well the hands didn't have three toes.

309
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,440
 Had three digits and they could see a piece of wood coming out of each leg going towards

310
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
 the ground.

311
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,600
 So it almost like it had stilts in its sleeves and its legs.

312
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,000
 Now you're thinking, okay, so this guy's supposedly close to seven feet tall.

313
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,520
 He's probably a normal sized human wearing some sort of stilts and something to make

314
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
 its arms look longer.

315
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,840
 We're going to get into some of the theories of what this thing is in a bit.

316
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,560
 But whatever it was, this clown, how it's often described, this clown looks up at the

317
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
 kids.

318
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
 The kids are looking down at the clown.

319
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,280
 And then the clown in quite a clownish fashion drops his book.

320
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,840
 He had some sort of book in his hands.

321
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,440
 Drops it into the water and then begins fumbling around for it.

322
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,600
 Oh no, my book, my book.

323
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,120
 In a ridiculous fashion the kids are like, if this is an alien encounter we've encountered

324
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
 one of the lame ones.

325
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,040
 The clowns fishing around for the book finally gets it out and then turns and begins moving

326
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
 from the kids.

327
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,160
 Now this is something we've talked about in a previous episode.

328
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,760
 It was the one about the UFO encounter in Finland where the lumberjack chased the alien

329
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,920
 with a chainsaw.

330
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,360
 Just like that story, this clown as it moved it was taking these long slow leaps like an

331
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,600
 astronaut does on the moon.

332
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,360
 So some sort of gravitational difference between where it's used to going and where

333
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,080
 we are here now on Earth.

334
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,920
 And it eventually just kind of bounces away and the kids are following it at this point

335
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,800
 because they're idiots and they want to know what this thing is and it disappears.

336
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
 They can't find it.

337
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,240
 And they're like, well that's enough for that adventure I guess is what they both say

338
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,760
 because they've just lost track of them.

339
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,720
 And then they hear the siren sound again but much, much louder to the point that it freaks

340
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,560
 the boy out and he takes off and the girl is scared too and she starts to move away.

341
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,280
 But then she sees the clown show back up, pop up from behind some bushes and he's holding

342
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,680
 a microphone attached to a speaker.

343
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,320
 So like a little portable karaoke machine and he puts the microphone into his mouth

344
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,600
 and he goes, are you still here?

345
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,720
 And she said it sounded like someone was talking through a mask.

346
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,160
 Like she can understand what it was saying but it sounded like it's voice, it sounded

347
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,360
 like someone talking through a Halloween mask.

348
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,440
 And so she pauses when she hears that and the clown looks at her.

349
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,760
 The boy totally kicked bricks out of here but he's watching it from a distance.

350
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,320
 So the clown slowly lumbers up to the little girl, has his book still, he opens it up and

351
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,520
 he writes in the book and he shows it to her.

352
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:49,400
 And in the pages what he had written was, "Hello and I am all colors Sam."

353
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,520
 So at this point the boy's like, well my friend's not getting devoured by this creature, not

354
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,920
 getting pissed on either.

355
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,920
 So he comes back and now they're both standing next to this clown and they begin asking him

356
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,520
 questions.

357
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,360
 The first question, the most obvious question the little girl asks is, are you human?

358
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,760
 And Sam goes, no.

359
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,680
 They're like, this is getting really weird, really quick.

360
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,960
 Next question the girl asks is, the best follow up question really is, second best maybe.

361
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,520
 Are you a ghost?

362
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,200
 Now it's funny because I think when people hear this story, when I hear this story, I

363
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,000
 immediately assumed alien.

364
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,960
 But to a seven year old kid in 1973 that may not be the first question you ask, I think

365
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,680
 ghosts would be something more that little kids would be knowledgeable about.

366
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,040
 Like if you're not human and you're weird, you must be a ghost.

367
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,600
 Anyway she goes, are you a ghost?

368
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,920
 And he answered, well, not really.

369
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,800
 But I am in an odd sort of way.

370
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,120
 And then she goes, the most general question you can ask, what are you then?

371
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,920
 And Sam looks down at the girl and says, you know.

372
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,640
 Sam tells the kid, those are all exact quotes from, those are the exact questions and answers.

373
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,320
 Sam goes on to tell the kids that there are more like him on earth.

374
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,880
 And that he's afraid of humans.

375
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,640
 He's afraid that they are going to hurt him.

376
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,120
 But no matter what happens, he will never hurt a human.

377
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,920
 Kids are like, I've heard that one before.

378
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,280
 Do not believe you, no, the kids actually do believe him.

379
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,480
 They're like, oh, yay, Mr. Sam says he's not gonna hurt us.

380
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,440
 Then Sam goes, do you wanna see where I live?

381
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,240
 I didn't plan it this way.

382
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,480
 Both of these stories involve children and adults and or tall people.

383
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,800
 I didn't even plan it, the peen story just popped up this morning.

384
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,280
 But Sam goes, you wanna go see my house.

385
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,560
 Now these kids go, yes, let us go see your house, Sam.

386
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,800
 So he takes them off to where there's this part of this field.

387
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,440
 And there is a shed, it's described as like a shed or a hut type of thing.

388
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,640
 But basically it is a two story domicile.

389
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,760
 And the opening is like a flap.

390
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,840
 So they all go into this house and it's described as having the two stories.

391
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,000
 And they can see both of them.

392
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,400
 So I think there's a loft.

393
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,640
 They said on the bottom floor there's a bunch of like rough made wooden furniture,

394
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,160
 like a wall that had some dials on it and a heater, like a portable heater.

395
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,800
 So basically a hobo's hovel, a drifter's domain.

396
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,320
 This is not a high tech spaceship.

397
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,040
 And when I'm reading the story and when you're listening to the story,

398
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,440
 you're probably like, oh, great, where is this story going?

399
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,680
 Is it a weirdo in a mask?

400
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,400
 Is it an alien?

401
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,440
 Is it a ghost?

402
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
 We will continue.

403
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,840
 So they all go into his house and he says, oh, it's so funny because he realizes that

404
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,800
 this was in the story that he realizes the kids are not impressed by his house.

405
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,920
 So he said, oh, this is just a temporary house.

406
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,480
 I have a way bigger one.

407
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,760
 Super nice house in England that I spend all my time in.

408
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,080
 This is just a temporary house.

409
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,920
 And the kids are like, uh-huh, heard that one before too.

410
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,440
 He could tell they weren't impressed by the house, so he tried telling them he had a nicer house.

411
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,400
 He also told him he has a girlfriend in Canada that they'll never meet.

412
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
 But the kids basically are still peppering him with questions.

413
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,960
 And he says, well, you know, I drink water, which I was weird that this didn't even come up in conversation.

414
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,360
 When's the last time you were talking to someone there?

415
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,760
 Like, hey, did you see the game last night?

416
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,800
 And you're like, I drink water.

417
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,200
 But he tells them I drink water, but I have to cleanse it first.

418
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
 I have to do this processing for it.

419
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,880
 And the kids are like, OK.

420
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,920
 And he goes, I also eat berries.

421
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,840
 That's why I was down there.

422
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,800
 I was picking berries.

423
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,480
 And the kids are like, no, it's weird because his mouth has not been moving this whole time.

424
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,560
 Like, it looks like he's wearing a mask.

425
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:38,960
 You know what?

426
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
 I'm going to eat a berry right now.

427
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,040
 Now, what do you think the next course of action is going to be?

428
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,440
 This is where you're like, this is where I was thinking, OK, there's two ways you can eat a berry.

429
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,360
 You can eat a berry in a way that exposes you as a hobo drifter, or you can do what's coming up.

430
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,760
 He then takes a berry.

431
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,320
 He's like, oh, look at delicious berry.

432
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,640
 And he sticks it in his ear.

433
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,160
 OK, he sticks it in his ear.

434
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,000
 And then he leans forward really quickly.

435
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,920
 And then he's standing back up and the berry is visible in the eyeball.

436
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,840
 So he has that triangle hole for both eyes, two triangle holes.

437
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,960
 And you can see the berry.

438
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,120
 They saw the berry kind of bouncing around in there.

439
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,040
 He leans forward again really quickly.

440
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,080
 He stands up and now the berry they can see in the mouth gap.

441
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,360
 And then it disappears like he ate it.

442
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,040
 At that point, there was many points in the story where I would have ran away.

443
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,720
 But at that point, I would have been like, OK, it's definitely not hobo.

444
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
 Hobos can't do that.

445
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,200
 Now, it could have been some sort of sleight of hand, some sort of magic.

446
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,120
 But they continue to talk to him.

447
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,400
 They are there for a half hour talking about stuff.

448
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,440
 And we don't have many details.

449
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,920
 What we've been told is that the kids continued to pepper him with questions

450
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,880
 and he just gave off fairly vague answers.

451
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,520
 But after a half hour, the kids leave and Sam's like, bye.

452
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
 The kids take off.

453
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,080
 First thing the kids do, they see the groundskeeper at the golf course.

454
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,680
 They tell him, we saw a ghost, we saw a ghost.

455
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,760
 And the golf, the groundskeeper is like, you guys are idiots.

456
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,400
 There's no ghost.

457
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,880
 But it sends him on their way.

458
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,600
 They end up going home and telling their parents.

459
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,560
 And it's funny because the dad's basically reading the newspaper.

460
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,600
 His daughter comes in and he's like, Daddy, Daddy, guess what?

461
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,440
 I had a ghost, I had an encounter with a ghost today and we went to his house.

462
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,360
 We hung out there for a half hour and he has really bad furniture and a mechanical heater.

463
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,000
 That was kind of weird.

464
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,920
 Why would a ghost need a heater?

465
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,960
 But he ate berries, he ate berries in his ear.

466
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,880
 And the dad was like, totally was just like my kid has an overactive imagination.

467
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,560
 I'll pick up that prescription tomorrow.

468
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,960
 The shrink was telling me about.

469
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,800
 But as she kept telling the story and he was also hearing the story from her friend,

470
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,520
 he realized the details were always the same.

471
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,440
 So he goes, I'm going to go check this place out because my kid might be making up this story.

472
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,640
 And then I have to go pick up that prescription or some creepo might have had my daughter

473
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,320
 and her friend in a shack in the middle of nowhere telling them he was a ghost.

474
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,880
 So he goes out to where the shack was.

475
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,280
 It's gone.

476
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,440
 And they say that the soil wasn't disturbed like there was never a shack there.

477
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,320
 And the people who worked in that area said there was never a shack there.

478
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,680
 Now that's the only sighting of Sam the sand down clown is what it's known as.

479
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:24,320
 So, you know, I looked more into this and I said it's a little, it's a little click baity,

480
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,160
 a little interesting, it's an interesting story, but I needed to see how true it was.

481
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:36,520
 Apparently this story first appeared in the 1978 edition of the British UFO Research Association's Journal,

482
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,560
 1978 copy of that.

483
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,760
 I wasn't able to verify that.

484
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,960
 They did list like names of the authors and people who investigated it.

485
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,360
 And one of the people who investigated it is the founder of the British UFO Research Association.

486
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:54,400
 So as easy as details to make up the story took place in 1973, it was reported in 1978,

487
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,040
 supposedly in this journal.

488
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,760
 The very earliest internet reference to this story was in 2018.

489
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,320
 January 2018 was the earliest reference I could find of this story.

490
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,920
 So that's a little suspicious.

491
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,000
 I'm thinking maybe someone made it up because of all the clown sightings and stuff like that.

492
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,840
 But let's look back at this quote.

493
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,400
 "Hello and I am all colors, Sam."

494
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,840
 He's also said through the story that later on the story, he said his name really wasn't Sam,

495
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,280
 but like that's how he identified himself for some sort of weirdness.

496
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,880
 But anyways, "Hello and I am all colors, Sam" was his quote.

497
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,320
 In August of 1965, we're going to Spain very, very briefly here.

498
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,520
 August 1965, we're going to Caracas, Spain.

499
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,200
 Juan and Isabel Dominguez.

500
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,120
 They are walking through the countryside from a nearby village to their home.

501
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,320
 They just bought a bunch of peaches.

502
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,600
 Taking them home, going to have peach pie and peach cobbler and peach alamode, which is just a peach.

503
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,200
 Or does that mean with ice cream?

504
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
 It doesn't matter.

505
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
 Yeah, no, it just means a peach.

506
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,600
 It doesn't matter, Jason.

507
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
 So I'll have to look that up later.

508
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,600
 I'll look at it again later.

509
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,280
 They're walking with their bushels of peaches, imagining all the great peach flavored things

510
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,360
 they're about to have, peach schnobs.

511
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:16,480
 And they see something black walking near a countryside wall, like a garden wall.

512
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
 And then they hear a humming noise.

513
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,160
 They're like, "What is going on?"

514
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:28,400
 And that's when this creature stands up, seven feet tall, but it was opaque, gelatinous,

515
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,880
 just oozing and wet.

516
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:42,800
 But it had a humanoid form, but they could just see it like throbbing as it moved around.

517
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,760
 And it turned towards them, and it had no face at all.

518
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,160
 And they could tell, though, that it was looking at them, and it began moving towards them

519
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,080
 across the countryside.

520
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,960
 They dropped their peaches and ran home, terrified of what they'd just seen.

521
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,560
 Now if you were a gelatinous ooze monster, but you wanted to interact with people, you

522
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,440
 would need a disguise.

523
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,120
 If you didn't want to pulsate all over the place, you would find braces.

524
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,000
 You would get some wood to make it so your legs didn't buckle so much, so you would

525
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,160
 have the appearance of a normal human being.

526
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,720
 You would basically build an exosuit made of materials you'd find on that planet to

527
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,200
 keep your form normal.

528
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,680
 If people are afraid that you don't have a face, make yourself a helmet.

529
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,120
 But that might be related.

530
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,160
 That might be the creature that's underneath the sand down clown helmet.

531
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,720
 Something truly alien that makes people run away in fear.

532
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,120
 But I have another theory.

533
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
 We've talked about it.

534
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
 It could be an alien.

535
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
 It could be a demon.

536
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,320
 It could be a spirit.

537
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,680
 It could be all three.

538
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
 It could be none of them.

539
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,440
 It could be something totally different.

540
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,920
 Because all of those theories have been bandied about.

541
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,480
 But what if it's something darker than that?

542
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,760
 People have a fear of clowns.

543
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,320
 It's one of the most popular fears.

544
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,000
 And it's one of those things that people can never really point to why they're afraid

545
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 of it.

546
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,160
 There's been lots of theories from a culture aspect because people use faces to determine

547
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,520
 intent so when the faces are exaggerated it's hard to determine intent.

548
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,920
 Cultural factors like serial killers dressing as clowns like John Wayne Gacy, horror movies.

549
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,920
 But none of these really account for the deep-seated fear.

550
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,320
 But what if people aren't petrified of clowns?

551
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:41,280
 But when they see a clown they're reminded of something alien.

552
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,760
 When someone sees a clown and they're terrified they're not necessarily terrified of the

553
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
 clown.

554
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,240
 They're terrified at something the clown reminds them of.

555
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,440
 Not a horror movie, not a serial killer, not a nightmare, but something real.

556
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:01,000
 What if we cross-referenced people who have been abducted by aliens, experienced lost

557
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,360
 time and whether or not they have a fear of clowns.

558
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,520
 But they don't know why they have a fear of clowns.

559
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,000
 They've been afraid of clowns since they were eight.

560
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 They don't know why.

561
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,360
 But then when you look into it they did have that weird time where they woke up in their

562
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,640
 backyard and never figured out how they got there.

563
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,080
 What if there is a connection between that?

564
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,560
 Because you're not really afraid of clowns, you're afraid of what clowns remind you of.

565
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,440
 Those people who took you away that night.

566
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,640
 And then wiped your memory clean.

567
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,320
 I don't believe those two kids sat in that house for a half hour and don't remember the

568
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,400
 details of the conversation.

569
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,120
 I don't believe it was just vague questions and answers because everything else is so

570
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,400
 detailed in that story.

571
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,880
 It's lost time.

572
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,440
 They're sitting in that house and then they leave.

573
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,680
 And when people ask what you talk about for that half hour they're like, "Ah, just normal

574
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,560
 stuff."

575
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
 Because they don't remember.

576
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,560
 And so their brain has to create memories for it to fill in that gap of time.

577
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:09,120
 What happened to those kids in that house during that half hour?

578
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,840
 Was it just questions and answers or was it something more alien, more dark?

579
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:21,160
 I think it would be very interesting to find out if those two kids now, as adults, are

580
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,680
 petrified whenever they see a clown.
