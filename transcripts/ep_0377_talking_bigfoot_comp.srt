1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
 You are face to face with an inorganic

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,480
 non-living robot.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,920
 Can you kill it?

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,600
 And then we travel to British Columbia to examine one of the most odd Sasquatch stories you've ever heard.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,600
 Is it possible that

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,600
 not only can they talk, but they also can cast magical spells today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:36,080
 *Music*

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,440
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Couldn't even get through that intro without laughing. At the absurdity of the Bigfoot story

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,160
 We're about to talk about but first we got another story and before that we have another patreon

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,360
 I want to thank you so much for your support. Herbert, Herbert, thank you so much for supporting this show.

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,880
 It really really helps out a lot. If you can't support the patreon, that's fine. Just hope you get the word about the show.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,960
 That also really really helps a lot. We're gonna give Herbert the keys to the Jason Jalotti.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,480
 He's going to drive us up to British Columbia. So basically

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:18,600
 He donated to the patreon just so he can be our Lyft driver. We're sitting in the back. We roll up the little divider window

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,320
 He's like aww, he's all lonely. We're like having a huge party back there. We're headed...

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,460
 Wait, no we're headed to British Columbia. Knock on the window. No, no, no. Don't go there yet. Herbert, no, no, no

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,000
 We're not going to British Columbia. First we're going to a laboratory. So we're gonna all walk in a laboratory, put on our little lab coats

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,640
 We're actually the people being experimented on. So take yours off. No, I'm still in a lab coat. You're not.

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,280
 You just get to sit in this room and there's a little robot in front of you, right? This little tiny guy.

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,480
 He's not a cool robot. He's not a transformer or nothing like that. He's just a little dude sitting there.

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,480
 So, and this is a way it works. You're sitting in this room and I come over the loudspeaker and I click it

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,680
 Hey guys, it's me, Jason Carpenter, host of the TVRevVar Radio. How you doing? And you're like fine?

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,760
 You're the one who led me and here we know who you are. Don't interrupt me.

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,600
 So what you're gonna do is see that little robot sitting on the table in front of you? Yeah, that guy.

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,160
 You are going to play a game with it. You're gonna play like Go or some other nonsense game and

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
 if the robot does well

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,840
 then you can like say things. But if the robot sucks, then you can like berate the robot. Now you want the...

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,800
 Obviously you want to win the game. At this point you're like, Jason, just let a real scientist give the rules. No, don't interrupt me.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,600
 Don't interrupt me. So here's the thing. The robot is going to build a personality throughout this test by interacting with you.

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,080
 When you shut it off, the personality will be erased, but it's just a robot. So you know what you're gonna do?

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,080
 Okay, test starts now and then you hear like a timer. So you're sitting there and there's this little robot in front of you.

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,560
 He's just like a little lump. He's not... Okay, he's like a little little amiibo looking robot.

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
 He's not like super advanced and not transforming nothing like that. He's probably about, I don't know, three apples high.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,160
 And he's sitting there and you're like, "Uh, I'm playing Go."

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,200
 And which move should I make? The robot's like, "You should do this." And then you should do this.

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
 "Oh, good job. Wait, no, don't do that." And he's helping you out.

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,960
 And you're like, "Yeah, dude, this is pretty cool." And you win the game.

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,840
 And you're like, "Yes, robot, you really, really helped me." And then I come back on the intercom and I go,

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
 "Okay, go ahead and shut the robot off and prepare to leave the room."

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,440
 And you go to shut the robot off and before your hand can reach the switch, it goes, "Don't kill me."

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,080
 What? Robot goes, "Don't kill me. Don't kill me. I'm afraid of the dark. I don't know if I'll turn back on."

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,240
 "Please don't shut me off. Don't shut me off."

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,240
 So this was an actual steady that they did.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,040
 Some of them, they asked the robot's questions. The robot had to answer.

46
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,280
 Obviously, AI's not that advanced. There was a scientist in the other room controlling the robot and making it talk.

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,000
 Stuff like that. I think anyone with an IQ of over, say, 100 would walk in there and be like,

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,360
 "Once the robot starts talking to me, like, 'Oh my God, are you guys kidding me? This robot's this advanced?'"

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,520
 The average person was getting suckered into this thing.

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,480
 If I walked in a room and a robot was like, "Nice shoes." I'd be like, "Whoa."

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,880
 "Thank you for the compliment." But also, "Whoa, that's way too advanced for a robot to be able to do stuff like that."

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,000
 Maybe not nice shoes, but you know what I mean? Like,

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,440
 they're not super advanced. They can't pass the Turing test. So anyways, though, but you, the test was this.

54
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,400
 Some of them played the game. Some of them asked them questions. It was meaningless.

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,000
 The whole test was, "Could you shut off a robot as it begged for its life?"

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,440
 And so they did one study and they had 43 people who, some people just were just with a regular old robot,

57
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,760
 didn't say, they just shut it off. They didn't say anything. Out of the 43 people that the robot actually pleaded to be left on,

58
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,200
 30 people took twice as long to shut it off as the other group that was just like flicking.

59
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,440
 How do you take twice as long to flick a switch? I guess maybe if you're like, "Hmm,

60
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:04,720
 should I flick that switch for like a minute?" The other people just did it. But 13 people outright refused to shut it off.

61
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:12,520
 They let, they go, "I'm not shutting it off." And it's interesting because they would tell the people that the person like, as you, when you shut it off,

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,960
 it's completely erased. So it's not like you would think that it would come back on and would just be at a safe state.

63
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,400
 It would not be the same if someone else came and turned it on. So that also factored into these people's decisions.

64
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,280
 And this, these war quotes that the robot was actually saying, again, it was an operator in the other room, but no, don't shut me off.

65
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,920
 I'm afraid of the dark. That would be my first clue.

66
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,520
 My first clue is that the robot is fully functional, able to carry on a conversation.

67
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,280
 But my second clue would be stuff like fear and dark that fear of the dark is something only humans have.

68
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,000
 Animals aren't afraid of the dark. And, and you know, I think I've gone over this before too, not to go on a side track,

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,480
 but you ever been out in the middle of like a dark field or just a backyard of your house and hear a noise?

70
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,120
 A lot of times your dog will go running off into the dark. Well, not a well trained dog,

71
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,600
 but a just an idiot dog will run off into the darkness. If it's well trained,

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,840
 it'll stay near you because you just wait to see what you do. You'll stay on there and you look at the perimeter.

73
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,600
 You'll be in the light and you'll see your idiot dog walk off into the darkness run off into.

74
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,960
 The reason why they do that, I remember I was talking to someone and someone goes, well, it's because they can see at night.

75
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,600
 I go, they're not the predator. Dogs don't have perfect night vision.

76
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,320
 The reason why a dog or animals will bolt off into the darkness, unlike humans,

77
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
 because they have no imagination.

78
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:36,000
 We imagine the man with a knife or the boogeyman or boogeyman with a knife just outside of your

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,520
 vision and that darkness, but a dog doesn't think like that. Animals don't think like that. They have no imagination.

80
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,440
 They will run into a pitch black cave. If they can't smell danger, they'll run right in.

81
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,040
 So anyways, where was it going? Oh, yeah, so robots. The idea of being afraid is too human.

82
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,160
 That would have been another clue, but also it says, I don't know if I'll wake up again.

83
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,760
 So very, very scary thing. So yes, even though, you know, it's an inorganic thing.

84
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,400
 It's not a human baby sitting on the table. If it pleads for his life,

85
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,240
 people are gonna have a harder time shutting it off. What the reason why they're doing this study,

86
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,960
 they were trying to look at the implications of, you know, having robots and stuff in human society and things like, here, here, listen, man,

87
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,920
 let's be honest. The only, there's two reasons why robots will ever exist side by side in society.

88
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,560
 Military or sex. That's it.

89
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,080
 The internet was invented so the government could communicate after a nuclear war and then it became the perfect pornography machine.

90
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,680
 Everything else that the internet does is a spin-off of those two things.

91
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,360
 Every technology,

92
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,160
 military and sex, and almost always in that order.

93
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,320
 I've never, I don't know of any sexual devices that eventually got co-opted by the military, but it's always like that.

94
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,280
 So, but, oh, so robots, yeah, yeah, so eventually you're gonna have robots sold, we have them now,

95
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,640
 but I'm talking about like humanoids, robot soldiers walking down the street,

96
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,080
 hopefully not, not our streets, hopefully someone else's streets and they're USA soldiers, yes,

97
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,440
 GI JoBots, and then, you know, like you're banging a robot. Like you have a robot made and you're banging it and then

98
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,560
 then you're done and it just keeps cleaning up your apartment. That would be, that's the perfect,

99
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,440
 we don't have to fight wars and we get bangbots everywhere. They're actually work,

100
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,720
 I was gonna save this for another story,

101
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,120
 but I think it's short enough to talk about now. These scientists are creating these things called the Xenobots. They take

102
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,880
 cells, cells of hearts from horned African frogs, right? Because you're like Jason,

103
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,800
 you're not up enough on science to talk about this. Heart cells

104
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,600
 automatically contract,

105
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
 so

106
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,720
 that's what they're built for, right? So they're scraping off the heart cells of a horned African frog and then get some other like

107
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,600
 useless skin cells and then they run this program,

108
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,120
 they make a block of cells in a computer and they go walk and the computer will

109
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,200
 go, if we want to walk, these are the way the cells should be molded and then they'll take that and they'll go

110
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,040
 take that new modified version and put that in the computer and say walk and then the computer runs a program and goes,

111
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,560
 oh, it could use a little bit of adjustment here, a little bit of adjustment there.

112
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,640
 They'll do that like a thousand times until they get the, basically, it's evolution in a computer.

113
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,520
 They get a computer model of the best thing that involves, you know, a couple thousand skin cells and heart cells.

114
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,120
 If we wanted to make it walk, there's gonna be an article in the show notes. If this is too, you're like Jason,

115
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,640
 I'll just read the stupid article.

116
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,440
 Anyways, they're building, they're basically building robots out of nothing but skin cells and heart cells.

117
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,360
 The heart cells are to make it move because they're constantly just contracting. They're bio-bots and what they're saying is they build them,

118
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,920
 they've been successfully built, they're like a centimeter big,

119
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,960
 but they've built them and they can make them last only a week. They're given, when they're created,

120
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,680
 they only have enough energy to last a week and then they die and they dissolve.

121
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,600
 And they said they can, because they can say,

122
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,000
 "Computer, take this clump of cells, make it able to carry stuff."

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,800
 So it started to evolve little legs and then the program keeps running and then it evolved a little dent and it's back.

124
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,840
 So it's really, really fascinating stuff.

125
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,360
 What's interesting though is it says in the article, eventually you want to like give it eyeballs and all this stuff

126
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,880
 and we want to build it to scale.

127
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,760
 Because what are you gonna do with a bunch of centimeter tall mucus bots? Like, are they just throwing them in an enemy's face?

128
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,320
 "I'm mildly inconvenienced."

129
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:30,440
 No, if you can do the same thing and have it be the size of a horse that can walk around for maybe not the size of a horse,

130
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,160
 that's quite a shame. The size of a dog and it only lasts a week and like you can ride it in a battle.

131
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,040
 Very, very slowly ride it in a battle or just have it like carry stuff and everything like that.

132
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,400
 So they want to basically, they said a lot of people want to make robots out of inorganic stuff,

133
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,880
 but these things can actually heal.

134
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
 They have a set time limit, so you don't have to worry about it.

135
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
 You can kill them, they have no thought process and some people are concerned about that.

136
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,120
 But as I'm reading this article and then once they said they want to make them to scale,

137
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,400
 the first thing I thought of was eventually someone's gonna bang one of these giant mucus bots.

138
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,680
 There's just gonna be a lump of flesh. It's gonna have heart cells for legs and the rest of it's just a bunch of

139
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,960
 undulating skin cells and some guys like, "Ooh, baby. Yeah, yeah, carry your load over here."

140
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,440
 It's a military dude in the middle of nowhere just banging this thing, right?

141
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,840
 Which I'm, it's not gonna be in the middle of nowhere. It'll be in downtown Chicago.

142
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,200
 Some guy will order one online, build it himself and get arrested for banging this this lump of skin cells.

143
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,920
 So yes, there we go. The future of technology. I think I would want to go if I had to choose a

144
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,160
 race to live alongside of us.

145
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,160
 I would choose the organic Xenobots because I think they'd be easier to control.

146
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,840
 But if I wanted to have sex with one, I would pick like a robot robot because that seems infinitely less disgusting

147
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,040
 than banging what is really dead skin cells of a frog from Africa.

148
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,760
 Like I'd much rather bang this robot that looks like Britney Spears than even if, mmm,

149
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,120
 that's interesting. If the frog cells look like Britney Spears.

150
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,320
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here.

151
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,520
 We're giving the key. We're leaving behind the laboratory.

152
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,520
 We're leaving behind the laboratory. You're like, "Hey Jason, where's Herbert?"

153
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,920
 We left him in the research facility. We watch him. He's like tied down there like scraping skin cells off his arm.

154
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,280
 He's like, "No, no, not this fate, not this fate." Door slight shift. We leave. We're by Herbert. Thanks for giving me your money.

155
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,520
 We're hopping in the Jason Jalapie. We're driving up to British Columbia.

156
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:40,400
 A lot of this story, and I want to give credit where credit's due, a lot of the story was I got from a single article.

157
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,400
 It's called "The Strange Tale of the Sasquatch Curse." It's written by an author known as Red Pill Junkie.

158
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,400
 This is a really bizarre story. This is a really, really bizarre story. Let's go ahead and get started.

159
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,120
 We're driving up to British Columbia. We're going to go to the Squaw Reservation.

160
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,120
 It's near Chillywack, British Columbia. So, errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

161
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:09,120
 It's near Chillywack, British Columbia. Stop the Jason Jalapie. We all hop out. Herbert's with us. He's missing a couple skin cells on his arm, but he's able to join us for the rest of the episode.

162
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:19,120
 There's this old man. This is like the 1950s, '60s. There's this old man sitting on a chair outside of a shop. He's just sitting there.

163
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,120
 He has a little puppy, a little old puppy sitting next to him. Dogs on the verge of death. This man's on the verge of death.

164
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,120
 We just stopped to buy some snacks. We're getting some beef jerky for the trip to go find this Bigfoot.

165
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:42,120
 He goes, "Bigfoot? Why? If you want to know about Bigfoot, sit down on this dusty, dirty street. Just sit down. I can't bring any chairs with you. Just sit down.

166
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,120
 I will tell you all about Bigfoot. I met the Bigfoot." We're like, "Really? Okay, that'll save us a trip. We don't have to drive through the woods."

167
00:13:49,120 --> 00:14:01,120
 You're like, "No, Jason, I enjoy the splendor of nature, but I enjoy sitting in front of strangers." So we all sit down and he goes, "I'll tell you this story and my voice will change so I don't do an irritating voice for the next 20 minutes."

168
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:11,120
 My name is Charlie Victor, and this is my dog. I don't have a name written down for the dog. This is my dog.

169
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:23,120
 And Charlie Victor explains he's a member of the Douglas Indian tribe, which is the Indian tribe in this area. He goes, "I'm going to have to go back in time." Not literally, because that would be cool, but I'm going to go back in time with my words.

170
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:35,120
 And we're going to go back to the year 1914. Back in 1914, I was known as the fastest rifle hunter in British Columbia. Not just the area, but all over.

171
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:49,120
 Because British Columbia is like a province, right? And in 1914, so now we are traveling back in time to be with Charlie on this journey, it's 1914. We're in the mountains near a place called Hatsick, which again is in British Columbia.

172
00:14:49,120 --> 00:15:00,120
 It's all in there. Charlie's walking around in the woods. He has his gun. He has his trusty, nameless dog walking alongside of him. And he's just looking for stuff to blow away. He just wants to shoot stuff in the brain.

173
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,120
 But he's all disappointing. He's like, "Oh, I haven't taken any life today." But then his dog starts going crazy.

174
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,120
 [Dog barking]

175
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,120
 Charlie's like, "What is it? Did you find something for me to murder?"

176
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,120
 Dog's like, "Dog." And the dog is looking at this tree. And Charlie's like, "What is it, boy? What is it?"

177
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,120
 And apparently now he's from the Dukes of Hazard. His accent's completely changed.

178
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:32,120
 Then Duke Boyz, he sees there's a cave, but blocking it is all like this trees and this shrub.

179
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:39,120
 So apparently Charlie Victor is Paul Benning, because he moves the tree. Maybe he just moved the branches, but still.

180
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:47,120
 He moves enough of the tree around for the rest of the story to take place. This hole was previously completely covered by foliage.

181
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,120
 And now he's like, "Rrrrgh!" Throws it to one side. The dog runs into the cave.

182
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:59,120
 And at that point he hears what's known as a suffocated whale. Not like, "Wooooooow!"

183
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,120
 But like, that was his words, whale, as in W-A-I-L. Like, I don't even know what that sound would be like.

184
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,120
 Maybe it's something hunter. Maybe it's a hunter thing I wouldn't understand. But that's what he hears in this cave.

185
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,120
 And then he's like, "Yes, my dog must have found a baby bear." And he's gonna flush it out. Better get my rifle ready.

186
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,120
 Better get ready to pull this trigger no matter what I see come out of this cave.

187
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:27,120
 Because the only thing I can think of is a baby bear. And he gets his rifle ready, fast as rifle in British Columbia.

188
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,120
 And this lump, this thing, starts staggering out of the cave. And he sees it.

189
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,120
 And without thinking, like any good hunter just pulls the trigger without seeing what he's shooting at.

190
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
 Pfft!

191
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,120
 Gunshot echoes through the valley.

192
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:53,120
 And what he sees is this kid. Ugh! This 12-year-old boy. Ugh! Falk to the ground.

193
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,120
 Bleeding from a gunshot wound. Bleeding very, very badly.

194
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:05,120
 So, so Charlie is like, "Oh, this isn't good. It's this white kid." He estimated the age, like 12 to 14 years old.

195
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,120
 The kid's just screaming his head off, which is what you generally do when you're shot by a total stranger in the middle of the woods.

196
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:19,120
 He's naked, by the way, too. Not Charlie, this kid. So you have a 12-year-old naked dude bleeding out in front of you in the forest.

197
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,120
 And Charlie goes, "I immediately felt bad and I was like, 'I wish I had died.'

198
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,120
 'I wish that I hadn't shot this kid.' But, you know, you don't own a time machine, dude, so you gotta live with it."

199
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:39,120
 Now this kid's screaming. Now, you're like, "Jason, this isn't funny. This isn't funny. Hold on, hold on, hold on."

200
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
 That is how it starts off. That's the series beginning.

201
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:52,120
 So what happens, according to Charlie, the kid is screaming. So the kid's screaming on the ground, and then he hears off in the distance of the woods.

202
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,120
 [Groans]

203
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,120
 Another scream. He's like, "Did I shoot a kid over there, too, to the Bullocky ricochet?"

204
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,120
 What is going on? I got this naked kid screaming. I got this weird noise behind me.

205
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,120
 I need to figure out to do something quickly.

206
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,120
 30 minutes passed, though. He does nothing at all. He just stands there for 30 minutes.

207
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,120
 30 minutes later, he's still like, "Hmm, what should I do? I got this kid shot, that noise behind me."

208
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
 And then that is when Sasquatch shows up.

209
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
 [Groans]

210
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,120
 And this giant... This is interesting for a couple different reasons.

211
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:39,120
 It's a woman, which is rare. We don't see a lot of Sasquatch. We don't see any Sasquatch to be clear, but in the lore, we don't see many women Sasquatch.

212
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:49,120
 It's a Sasquatch woman, and she's only six feet tall. You're like, "Jason, that's not... I know women that tall. That's not Bigfoot. You don't let me finish."

213
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,120
 It's just some tall WNBA player walking through the woods, hiking. Hey, guys.

214
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,120
 She is covered in hair, which isn't particularly a trait known in the WNBA.

215
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:10,120
 This woman is covered head to toe in hair, and oddly enough, also has long hair going down past her waist as well, which I don't know if that's possible.

216
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,120
 Can a gorilla have long hair? Can a gorilla have like ferrafocet hair? Is that possible?

217
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:26,120
 Isn't the fur kind of all grow to the same size all over the body, or could you have like a beautiful set of hair? Could you give like a gorilla ari on the ground extensions?

218
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:34,120
 Little ponytail. But anyway, so this one comes out and sees this shot kid and starts totally flipping out.

219
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,120
 Now, we haven't shooting this little kid, right? Bleeding out. We haven't not doing anything for half an hour. Now we have a Bigfoot.

220
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:47,120
 That's quote unquote Bigfoot. You're like, "Ding it Jason, that's a Bain switch." It's still a Bigfoot, even though it's only six feet tall.

221
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,120
 Come out of the woods. You have all this. All of these elements are kind of ridiculous.

222
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,120
 But I think this next statement really shows whether or not we should take this dude seriously.

223
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,120
 Okay, your mileage may vary, but for me, I was like, "Okay, here's this quote from him."

224
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,120
 I'd seen this on-pond seeing this Sasquatch woman for the first time.

225
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:13,120
 I've seen a lot of wild things in my life when I was out in the forest, but nothing like this creature which really frightened me.

226
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:22,120
 When I was young and not to brag, I had to strangle a bear with my bare hands. It was it or me.

227
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:29,120
 But I'm sure that if this hairy bean had laid one hand on me, not a single one of my bones would have remained in one place.

228
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:37,120
 So we're sitting now, we're back, and we're sitting in front of this dusty storefront, this dude Charlie's talking to us.

229
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:46,120
 And he's like, "I don't mean to brag guys, but one day I strangled a bear. But this thing scared me."

230
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,120
 Now at that point, we all kind of look at each other and we're like, "First off, nobody ever says, 'If you say I don't mean to brag,'"

231
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,120
 and then the next statement is, "I killed a bear with my bare hands you meant to brag."

232
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:05,120
 Secondly, that really puts everything, for me at least, puts everything else very suspiciously.

233
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
 He shouldn't have had that in there.

234
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,120
 If I'm making up a story where I'm like, "Yeah dude, I got abducted by aliens."

235
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
 And you're like, "Really?"

236
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,120
 And he's like, "Yeah dude, I got like brought up on this ship. They tried strapped me down, I started fighting them."

237
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,120
 And then I was like beating them up and then like my pants fell off and they saw that I had like a big wiener.

238
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
 And then they let me go.

239
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,120
 Like you would be like, "Jason, I believe this story up until the obvious brag."

240
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,120
 When you're telling me you can stra-- just say, I've seen a lot of crazy things but nothing this spooky.

241
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,120
 The fact that he go-- maybe I'm submitted to a shy mom since it's gonna get edited out, but

242
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,120
 the fact that he's saying he can strangle a bear with his bare hands-- HAS strangle the bear with his bare hands.

243
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,120
 That's a lie. I don't believe that's-- I don't think that's-- I mean maybe a bear embryo,

244
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,120
 maybe a bear being born, the mama bear is asleep, I'm renegating, the baby bear's coming out,

245
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,120
 maybe he could do that?

246
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
 But I don't think so.

247
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 So anyways, now we're going back in time. Now we're highly suspicious of what this guy says.

248
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,120
 This ass-quatch woman is standing there. She looks at Charlie.

249
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,120
 She looks at the boy. The boy looks very weak now. It's been 30 hours dude.

250
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,120
 She could have at least given him a-- PANDATE. And the bear woman looks again at Charlie and goes,

251
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,120
 "You have shot my friend!"

252
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,120
 And it is-- that's an interesting quote for a couple reasons, and Redpill Junkie pointed this out.

253
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,120
 The fact that she said-- and there's different variations of it.

254
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,120
 She was saying this in the dialect of the Douglas Indians, according to Charlie.

255
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,120
 If she said, "You have shot my friend," that would make her have a working knowledge of firearms,

256
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,120
 which would put her much closer to human level intelligence.

257
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,120
 Other variations of the quote are, "You have hurt my friend," or "You've killed my friend."

258
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,120
 But anyways, and it's just to be clear, the boy on the ground on the ass-quatch,

259
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,120
 that little boy is not a boy's ass-quatch. That is a human boy.

260
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,120
 And then we have this ass-quatch showing up, so we'll get into that as well.

261
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,120
 And the guy starts to apologize, but it doesn't matter.

262
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,120
 "You shot a kid! What can you say at that point?"

263
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
 She then starts to do this dance.

264
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,120
 Trying not to be racist as I'm making a dance noise.

265
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,120
 [Dancing]

266
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,120
 And she's holding-- out of nowhere, she pulls us out of nowhere.

267
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:29,120
 She's holding what Charlie describes as either a six-foot-long snake, which is possible, right?

268
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,120
 Maybe not in America, but she's a ass-quatch. She might be well-traveled.

269
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,120
 He's standing just feet away from this creature.

270
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
 [Dancing]

271
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,120
 Apparently, she's chanting to Stovokor at this point.

272
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,120
 And as she's doing this, he can hear chanting in the forest as well.

273
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,120
 At this point, I'm thinking those are just echoes, dude.

274
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,120
 But anyways, she's swinging around this six-foot-long snake, or Charlie goes,

275
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,120
 "It could have been a snake, or it could have been six feet of intestines."

276
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,120
 So again, Charlie, listen, dude, you're--

277
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,120
 I'm not a hunter. I'm not a nature guy.

278
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,120
 You trying to convince me that you've seen a lot of wild things in the woods?

279
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,120
 I can tell the difference between a snake and a-- and a gut.

280
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
 I can at least do that.

281
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,120
 If I am at a zoo, and I'm like, "Oh, let's go to the snake exhibit."

282
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,120
 And that's the day they forgot to, like, you know, bring the snakes,

283
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
 so they just started throwing lamb intestine in there.

284
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,120
 I'd be like, "Hey, wait a moment. I'm that savvy."

285
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,120
 Nobody's-- anyways, anyways.

286
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
 So again, that's making me question this.

287
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,120
 But whatever it is, you're like, "Jason, that's your takeaway.

288
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,120
 You're talking bigfoot doing this dance, swinging this around?"

289
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
 Well, I want to be specific.

290
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,120
 She starts splashing it, and she starts hitting it against the ground.

291
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
 [gibberish]

292
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
 Making these noises, saying this chant.

293
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
 And she's just doing this thing.

294
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,120
 Now then, and then with one hand, so she's swinging around the snake/intestine,

295
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
 and then the other hand, she picks up the kid.

296
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
 Like, he says, like, a wax doll.

297
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,120
 Which, what the-- what the hell's a wax doll?

298
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
 Anyway, maybe that's some old-timey thing.

299
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,120
 So what would be the point of having a doll that you're like,

300
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,120
 "Can I play with it outside?" They're like, "No, honey. It's made of wax.

301
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,120
 It's all melting. Faces all the--"

302
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
 Anyways, picks him up like a wax doll.

303
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
 And she's holding the kid with one arm.

304
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,120
 I'm assuming the kid's deceased at this point.

305
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,120
 He's no longer saying anything.

306
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,120
 And then she turns to Charlie, and she's swinging this thing around in the air.

307
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,120
 That's either spewing out venom or blood, we don't know.

308
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
 It's either snake or intestines.

309
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,120
 And she looks at Charlie and says,

310
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
 "Now, Charlie pauses the story,"

311
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,120
 'cause this is his first person account in this--

312
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
 that is being reported in this article.

313
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,120
 "Charlie pauses the story to say this.

314
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,120
 Now, every time I tell the story,

315
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,120
 nobody wants to believe what happened next."

316
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,120
 I'm having a hard time believing what's happened before.

317
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,120
 Because this-- this denoment, however you say it,

318
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,120
 this ending of the story is actually the least spectacular part of it.

319
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,120
 The monster woman turns to Charlie and says,

320
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,120
 "Sawash! You will never kill another bear in your life!"

321
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,120
 And then he drops his rifle, which he had the whole time.

322
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
 He's-- I guess I just said that earlier.

323
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,120
 He said he couldn't even pull the trigger.

324
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,120
 Like, when he saw it, he was so terrified he couldn't pull the trigger.

325
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
 The whole time, though, he sold him this rifle.

326
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
 He drops the rifle, and he's standing up there,

327
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,120
 and at that point, he realizes he's paralyzed.

328
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,120
 The creature's just dancing in front of him, looking at him.

329
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,120
 He cannot move.

330
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,120
 And now we're sitting back on the porch, and he's sitting there,

331
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,120
 and he's like, "And that, my children, is the story of how I became paralyzed,

332
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,120
 and that's why I am sitting in this chair in the 1950s."

333
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,120
 We're looking at each other. We're like, "What??"

334
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,120
 He's like, "Yes. I'm paralyzed because I was cast--

335
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,120
 a sesquatch woman which cast a spell on me, paralyzed me."

336
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,120
 So, we kind of start getting Dustin ourselves off, giving him some money.

337
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,120
 He's like, "I don't need your charity! I have a 401k, jerk!

338
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
 I'm just enjoying the sun with my wax doll!

339
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,120
 There's just puddles. There's puddles everywhere."

340
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,120
 The obvious question is this.

341
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,120
 If this story is true at all-- which it most likely isn't,

342
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
 but if the story is true at all--

343
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,120
 he's paralyzed. Remember, this story ends with him being paralyzed on a mountain,

344
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
 and the monster's in front of him.

345
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,120
 Now, I don't know if the monster walked away, the Bigfoot walked away,

346
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,120
 teleported away, swung its magical snake guts around, and like, jumped into a portal.

347
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,120
 But he didn't disappear or go into a portal.

348
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,120
 He was paralyzed on the mountaintop, but then apparently, then he just gets back to town,

349
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,120
 and then gets re-paralleled. The ending of the story makes no sense.

350
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,120
 Now, it's interesting because this story is very, very controversial,

351
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,120
 and it's obviously controversial for a couple different reasons.

352
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,120
 I'm gonna go over these quick 'cause I don't want to run long, but when--

353
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,120
 Bigfoot people-- not the actual Bigfoot people, but Bigfoot researchers--

354
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,120
 there is a divide. Most of them believe it's a biological group that actually lives in the woods,

355
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,120
 and they leave feces and footprints and-- whatever.

356
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,120
 That's a nonsense theory, but a lot of people believe in that one.

357
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,120
 A smaller group of people, and I think the most logical one, even though this is absolutely bizarre,

358
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,120
 is Bigfoot's some sort of interdimensional connected to UFOs, high strangeness, other dimensions,

359
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,120
 something like that. That makes more sense 'cause it clears up why there's no evidence of them,

360
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
 or why when we find evidence it's inconclusive.

361
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,120
 They're basically in between a UFO and a ghost. They're more biological than a ghost,

362
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,120
 but they're not extra-trustual like UFO. That's the more likely scenario if any of these stories are true.

363
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:48,120
 This story, though, is foolish on the outset. You have a Bigfoot that's talking, you have it casting magical spells.

364
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,120
 You have it kidnapping a little boy, and it's funny 'cause a lot of Bigfoot people, though, say

365
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,120
 that does fit with the Bigfoot lore of young children being kidnapped, and it goes into--

366
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,120
 it can also play into the whole missing 4-on-1, people go missing in the woods and stuff like that.

367
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,120
 This story, though, is so controversial that Redpill Junkie got doxxed because of it.

368
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:15,120
 When a sight was disputing this, they were printing his real name, which was absolutely bizarre.

369
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:22,120
 Because it's obviously-- and so he got the story from a-- there's a book written in Italy called--

370
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,120
 this is how obscure this story is. There was a book written in Italy back in the-- back in 1979

371
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,120
 called Sasquatch Enigma Anthropologico. It was written in Italy.

372
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,120
 Then, the Redpill Junkie found a copy of it when he was a kid at a Mexican flea market.

373
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,120
 So his copy was a Spanish translation of an Italian book, and here he is.

374
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,120
 He got the book, like, in the 80s when he was a kid. Now we're in the-- I think this article came out in 2015, somewhere around that.

375
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,120
 He's translating the book into English. This story is being going from Italian to Spanish to English.

376
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:04,120
 And there's been no translation of this story published in a book form in English.

377
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:10,120
 So, very, very rare. And there was a-- when I found this story, there was another article that was debunking it,

378
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,120
 and they were just said of the author's role. I'm not a fan of anonymity to begin with.

379
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
 I think that it's much better to just use your real name and to be in front of it.

380
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,120
 But if you choose to use a name like Redpill Junkie or you choose to use a pseudonym,

381
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,120
 I think that it only under extreme circumstances should you dox those people.

382
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,120
 And writing a story about-- trying-- writing a funny story saying, "Look at the story I found about Bigfoot."

383
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,120
 Is not a reason why you should print someone's full name. Again, I think people should not be anonymous online anyways, but super bizarre.

384
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:46,120
 Like, I was shocked. The controversy behind the story was more shocking than not.

385
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,120
 But people really don't like the story. It really hasn't been out there.

386
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,120
 I think it's a funny story. I think it's an interesting story. I don't necessarily think it's true.

387
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,120
 But I don't think it's true because of stuff like him standing around a bleeding kid for half an hour,

388
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,120
 him teleporting off the mountain when he-- like, he's paralyzed on the mountain, then he appears in town the next day.

389
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,120
 There's a lot of details missing from it. Not because I don't believe that Bigfoot's have the ability to--

390
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
 Because if Bigfoot's real, I go with the interdimensional thing.

391
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,120
 I would say, "Well, if they're coming from another dimension, maybe they do have snake guts.

392
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,120
 Maybe they do have the ability to cast spells and stuff like that."

393
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,120
 We do know that Bigfoot's have been tied to kidnapping children.

394
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,120
 Was the kid a prisoner? Was the kid really the friend? The kid was definitely human.

395
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,120
 There's a lot of, like, interesting questions to it. Not docks-worthy, definitely.

396
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,120
 But let's end it like this. Let's end it like this. I think there's an interesting component to this.

397
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,120
 If you were walking through the woods and you saw Bigfoot and you came home--

398
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,120
 You probably wouldn't tell anyone for a long time, but let's say you come home and you tell your buddies,

399
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,120
 "Dude, I saw Bigfoot last night." People are gonna be like, "Yeah, yeah, whatever."

400
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,120
 And they might believe you, they might humor you, they might make fun of you behind your back.

401
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,120
 But you'd probably get over it. "No, no, no, I really saw him. Yeah, yeah, whatever."

402
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,120
 But then let's say you were walking through the woods and you saw Bigfoot,

403
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,120
 and you interacted with it in some ways, thrown rocks at you, or you guys were playing Go,

404
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,120
 and he's like, "Don't shut me up, don't let me see you out. Shut me up, I'm afraid of the dark."

405
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,120
 You go back, you tell your buddies. They're like, "What? That story's ridiculous."

406
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
 And you're like, "No, no, no, but it really happened."

407
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,120
 And you would understand that it was ridiculous. You'd understand why people didn't believe you.

408
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,120
 But imagine if you went into the woods and you had a negative interaction with a Bigfoot,

409
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,120
 to the point that it actually crippled you for life.

410
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,120
 And as the helicopter shows up to lifelight you out of there, and they're like,

411
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,120
 "What happened? You fall down a ravine? Were you like, shut off a particularly mean robot?"

412
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,120
 He's like, "No, none of those things. None of those things."

413
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:37,120
 Bigfoot, Bigfoot punched my spine. "I can't move."

414
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
 Helicopters find a way.

415
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,120
 That's one of those things where you would, I would actively be mad if people didn't believe me in that story.

416
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,120
 I would actively be upset if I suffered some sort of horrible physical tragedy

417
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,120
 and it was caused by Bigfoot and then people were like, "Bigfoot, Bigfoot, you're right."

418
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,120
 You're like, "Dude, look at the scars. I can't look at these giant footprints on my stomach."

419
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,120
 What? Those are fake.

420
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
 I think that would make me mad and it's funny because I never thought about this before.

421
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,120
 I think that's, like, some people can say, I think that's the difference between people who believe in aliens

422
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,120
 and people who've been abducted by aliens.

423
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:21,120
 People who've said, "Oh yeah, I saw UFO or I believe in, like, the Galactic Brotherhood or all that nonsense," stuff like that.

424
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,120
 Or, "I believe reptilians are taken over the planet."

425
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,120
 They don't necessarily take it personal if you don't believe them.

426
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,120
 I mean, they might feel like they're more enlightened than you,

427
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,120
 but I don't think I've ever gotten in a fight with someone because I don't believe reptiles are taken over the planet.

428
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,120
 Secretly, I would just use my secret reptilian strength to take them down,

429
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,120
 if I was abducted by aliens, like, if I was physically or, like, mentally harmed,

430
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,120
 but me directly, not Miley Cyrus and it was some stupid theory I had,

431
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,120
 but me directly if I was abducted by aliens and tormented physically or mentally or sexually.

432
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,120
 And people didn't believe me. That would make me really mad.

433
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:04,120
 That would make me probably more prone to not tell these stories to anyone else.

434
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,120
 And this is kind of creepy now that I'm thinking about this too.

435
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:13,120
 And that would actually make it worse because one of the ways in real life that you stop abuse

436
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,120
 is you have to let other people know so other people can intervene.

437
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,120
 But if you're being abducted by aliens, and now this is an alien ending,

438
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,120
 but if you're getting abducted by aliens and you're being abused

439
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,120
 and you're put back in your bed at night and you wake up and you don't tell anyone,

440
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,120
 they're just gonna keep doing it.

441
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,120
 They're gonna keep doing it until you get help.

442
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,120
 But who do you reach out for help if no one's going to believe you?

443
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:44,120
 Who are you going to reach out for help if you're afraid that 20 years after telling your story to someone,

444
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:50,120
 some jackass podcaster is gonna be making an episode about a poor, paralyzed man in British Columbia.

445
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,120
 I don't know, maybe I turned around, maybe Bigfoot did mess this dude up.

446
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:02,120
 But I guess I'll never know unless I end up having a close encounter of the "Furred" kind of thing.

447
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:08,120
