1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 What would you do if someone offered you day old Chinese food?

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,320
 If your answer is "I'd eat it," then I guess I'll see you in the emergency room.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,040
 As you're eating Chinese food right now, you're like, "Oh, better fast forward to that part."

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:26,520
 And then we travel to Watts, California, to meet a pimp who has a very unusual prostitute.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,520
 A dog.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:58,520
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

7
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,720
 And back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
 I'm your host, Jason Garbender.

9
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,840
 I hope you guys had a really, really fun weekend.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,320
 We gotta get started with the first story, because I'm sure at least one of you is about

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,920
 to eat some leftover food.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,360
 It doesn't have to be Chinese food.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,200
 If you currently have a mouthful of leftover food, spit it out and wait until we get to

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,280
 the first segment.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,400
 But first off, let's go ahead and introduce in one of our longtime Patreon supporters

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,240
 and one of the moderators of the Patreon Discord.

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,080
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, Mason.

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,680
 Give a big round of applause for Mason.

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
 Woo!

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,680
 Shooting off fireworks, shooting off fireworks right where he's walking.

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,920
 He's like, "Ah, ah, ah."

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,240
 Mason, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,120
 You've been doing such a great job as a mod.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,920
 And just as a listener of the show, a long, long time listener of the show.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,920
 Mason, we're gonna go ahead and make you our pilot, our captain for this episode.

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,800
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 Which helps spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,360
 I want you right now to walk through where every year living.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,320
 And if you see someone about to eat leftover food, slap it out of their hand and goes,

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,360
 listen to Dead Rabbit Radio.

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
 Told me to do that.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,640
 Available anywhere you listen to podcasts.

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,120
 Mason, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,840
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,400
 We're gonna drive out to a local college campus.

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,960
 [imitates car horn]

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,760
 I saw this story the other day and I thought,

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,640
 "This is one of those stories I have to do right away."

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,600
 We talked about, like, if you listen to early, early episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio,

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,240
 there's one episode where I did something like this.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,240
 And the time is like episode seven or something like that.

44
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,800
 I found out that Kix cereal, you know that little disgusting cereal

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,880
 that parents tricked their kids into eating?

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,640
 It's just a little, like, corn balls.

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,320
 It had E. Coli on it.

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,000
 So I basically had to interrupt my podcasting schedule

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,440
 to very quickly tell you not to eat Kix or maybe it was Trix, maybe.

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,920
 Maybe it was some other cereal.

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,400
 Maybe it was Life Cereal.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,240
 People were dying, eating it or maybe just getting sick.

53
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,520
 I think a couple of people died.

54
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,560
 But this is another story like that.

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,600
 Like, as the number one science podcast in El Salvador,

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,440
 I have an obligation to get the facts right and to warn you guys about this.

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,160
 And honestly, this story scares me.

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,840
 Because I do this all the time.

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,600
 March 2021, the New England Journal of Medicine published this report.

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,840
 There was this college student.

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,800
 He's unnamed because it's a medical diary thing.

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,880
 It's like, "I see your diary.

63
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,680
 Today I treated the grossest patient in the world."

64
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,280
 But no, they don't give out the names for-- and this medical stuff.

65
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,960
 Otherwise, no one would go to the doctor for these bizarre things going wrong with their body.

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,200
 We'll get to that, too.

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,720
 But let's call this guy John, right?

68
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,680
 So John, he's 19 years old.

69
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,200
 And he's staying at this dude's house.

70
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,960
 Like, I think it was like admissions time.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,240
 It's like college is just getting started, kids.

72
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,600
 You got your whole life in front of you.

73
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,280
 And John's sitting there on Mark's-- that's the name of his roommate.

74
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
 What's it called, Mark?

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,480
 John's sitting on Mark's couch and is like, "Oh, dude, I'm super hungry.

76
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,280
 Do you have anything here to eat?"

77
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,680
 And Mark's like, "Yeah, dude, why don't you go over there?"

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,640
 And Mark points-- this was not all right.

79
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,120
 The description of how we ate the food was not in the doctor's journal.

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,560
 But anyways, the point is that Mark's like, "Yeah, I got some leftover Chinese food."

81
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,440
 It's like low-main and then some veggies and stuff like that.

82
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,560
 And I don't know, maybe there was a flat diet Pepsi as well just sitting there on the table.

83
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,240
 But I got some leftover Chinese food if you'd like it.

84
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
 Who doesn't like leftover Chinese food?

85
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
 I'd really say who doesn't like leftover food.

86
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,880
 Like, a lot of times I will buy a pizza and I will eat said pizza, but I don't eat all of it, right?

87
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,040
 In one sitting, I will eat an entire pizza within a day.

88
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,520
 But usually I eat part of it and I leave the rest just sitting there, like in the cardboard box.

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,320
 And then every show often I'll get up and I'll eat a piece.

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,440
 Um, num, num, num, num.

91
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,960
 Which is fine, right?

92
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,520
 But, you know, it's super dangerous because like I said, I don't eat it in one sitting.

93
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,120
 It may take me, I don't know, eight hours.

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,400
 My point is that sometimes I'll let a pizza sit out for like eight hours before I finish it.

95
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,200
 Sit out, not in the fridge or nothing like that, right?

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:25,200
 But apparently, this is obvious biology, Mr. Number One Science Podcast in El Salvador.

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,160
 That's dirty, bacteria gets on that.

98
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,840
 I wasn't really aware of that.

99
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,920
 I wasn't aware because I've left pizza, I've left pizza out overnight.

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,800
 And I didn't know that this could happen.

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,280
 So this guy was eating this old Chinese, "Dale, that's not even that long."

102
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,440
 He's eating this old Chinese food and then about 20 hours pass.

103
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,600
 He's like, "Oh man, I have the worst headache."

104
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,480
 John says, "Ugh, he looks over at Mark and still eating some of this Chinese food."

105
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
 Num, num, num, num.

106
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,920
 John's like, "Dude, I have a terrible headache."

107
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,600
 He also started to complain of neck stiffness and a stomach ache.

108
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,320
 "Ugh, I don't feel good.

109
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,480
 I don't feel good."

110
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,440
 I go to the doctor all the time.

111
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,840
 It's something that like, I see my doctor probably six times a year.

112
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,360
 And I didn't know that that's not normal either.

113
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,360
 You go to the doctor all the time because it takes you eight hours to eat a pizza and

114
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
 you leave it outside.

115
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,000
 I think I know a lot of people don't go to the doctor all the time and I don't understand

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 it.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,440
 I go to your co-pay and go in when you've got weird things going on with your body.

118
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,920
 I constantly see my doctor.

119
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,640
 Well, this dude, severe headache, neck stiffness, stomach ache, doesn't go to the doctor.

120
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,160
 And I can understand that.

121
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,800
 Then he begins uncontrollably vomiting red-brown fluids out of his body.

122
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
 He still doesn't go to the doctor.

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
 "Ugh!"

124
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
 Throwing up.

125
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,840
 At this point, his roommate's throwing up too.

126
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,480
 So you figure it must have been something we ate.

127
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,600
 Then the roommate just threw up a couple of times and was like, "Oh man, I'm not eating

128
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,080
 a day old lo mein anymore."

129
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,880
 But John here, he's vomiting it up red-brown liquids.

130
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,760
 Then he starts a complaint of chest pain.

131
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,800
 His vision goes blurry.

132
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,000
 It doesn't go to the doctor.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,360
 "Uh, now I would go to the doctor."

134
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,680
 Like chest pain, stuff like that.

135
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,840
 I would have been there already.

136
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,320
 Then John's skin starts to turn purple.

137
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
 Right.

138
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,760
 Now he wasn't getting ready for the big game.

139
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,800
 If this wasn't their college colors, he's painting himself purple.

140
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,200
 His skin starts to get blotchy and purple.

141
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,480
 He still doesn't go to the doctor.

142
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,200
 Chest pain, vomiting, what looks like blood.

143
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
 "You're purple!

144
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,720
 Go to the doctor!

145
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,440
 You're not supposed to be purple!"

146
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,440
 He waits five hours.

147
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,840
 Five hours before he goes.

148
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,720
 And here's the thing, maybe you don't have insurance, right?

149
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,720
 You go to the doctor, it's a thousand dollar medical bill.

150
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,520
 Yes, you set up payments.

151
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,920
 The alternative is you become purple.

152
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
 Right.

153
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,520
 Go to the doctor.

154
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,240
 So anyways, after five hours, he gets taken to the doctor.

155
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,280
 He's all purple and stuff like that.

156
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,720
 And then the doctor, the doctors are probably like, "Dude, you should have just come here

157
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
 earlier."

158
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,720
 He was diagnosed with Menoncaucle Purpura, full mean and disease.

159
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,080
 If you were able to pronounce that correctly, what that means is that his organs were shutting

160
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,480
 down, they were going into shock, and he was getting gangrene across points of his body.

161
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,280
 His liver had given out, his blood started clotting.

162
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,560
 He ended up, he's sitting there in the hospital and they're like, "Listen, we got bad news

163
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,840
 for you, we have terrible news for you.

164
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,960
 Bad news is we're going to have to put a pacemaker in because your heart is just beating uncontrollably.

165
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,800
 The worst news is we're going to have to take off parts of each of your fingers and we're

166
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,360
 taking off both of your legs below the knee.

167
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,760
 And all of this happened because he ate day old Chinese food.

168
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,240
 Apparently, you're not supposed to do that.

169
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,000
 If you eat day old food, bacteria is on it.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,240
 And they get into, the little bacteria is getting to you and then they're like, "Let's

171
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
 wreck this place."

172
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,680
 They have little crowbars and they're beating up your blood cells and the white blood cells

173
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,200
 can't compete.

174
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,400
 And they make you purple.

175
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,800
 How is this not more common news?

176
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,600
 I'm shocked that this is possible if you eat.

177
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,760
 Like Jason, again, this is common sense.

178
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
 Don't eat old food.

179
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,120
 Apparently, if you have food that's been left out overnight, you're supposed to cook it.

180
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,440
 So it's 165 degrees and that kills all the bacteria.

181
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,480
 They're like, "No, I don't have a meat thermometer.

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,680
 Actually I had one and it didn't work because for a while there I was trying to bake chicken

183
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,360
 and no matter how much I cooked the chicken, it never got hot enough.

184
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,880
 It never got to where it was in the safety range.

185
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,360
 I ate all the chicken.

186
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,280
 I did this for weeks and months.

187
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
 I ate the chicken anyways.

188
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,760
 I was like, "Well, the food thermometer should be 165 degrees, but this food thermometer

189
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,280
 is clearly broken because this chicken is well cooked and super dry."

190
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,160
 It has to be this degree and I ate it and I never got sick, right?

191
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,360
 But yeah, so I threw the meat thermometer away.

192
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,400
 So now I just cook and I look into it.

193
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,800
 It's not pink anymore and then I eat it.

194
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,680
 So I don't know if I'm just lucky.

195
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,720
 I don't know if I have an amazing immune system.

196
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,080
 I guess this guy was supposed to have some shots, some meningitis inoculations for college.

197
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,640
 He only got the first shot.

198
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,600
 He didn't get the second one and the booster with this meningitis thing.

199
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,560
 So I guess the moral of the story, the lesson that I learned that you may have already known

200
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,680
 is that if you have leftover food, you're supposed to one.

201
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,680
 Jason, one has an adult who prepares his own food.

202
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,840
 You should have a meat thermometer or a food thermometer or something.

203
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,520
 Like, yeah, if I'm putting pizza in the microwave to cook it, I'm supposed to cook it to 165 degrees

204
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,640
 if it's a day old and where would I put the meat thermometer into the pizza, right?

205
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,240
 Into the dough, into the cheese.

206
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
 I don't know.

207
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,880
 I just will assume that I'm going to just eat leftovers and maybe just cook them a bit, right?

208
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,320
 But apparently this can, it's almost killed the dude.

209
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,680
 If he had waited a little bit longer, he's like, "I want to see how this purple thing turns out."

210
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,840
 He'd be dead.

211
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,600
 He'd be dead.

212
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,480
 Horrible story.

213
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,840
 Do you know you're also not supposed to eat slugs?

214
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,440
 There was a story.

215
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,560
 Did I cover that on the show?

216
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,160
 There was the guy who was like, "Dude, I bet you I can eat that slug."

217
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,320
 I did cover that on the show.

218
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,880
 I did cover that on the show.

219
00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:00,360
 Where the guy ate the slug and then the slug had so many germs in it, it broke his brain.

220
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,360
 Like, he ate the slug and then like the next day he's like, "Oh, I feel super sick."

221
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,520
 And then like the day after that, he was in a wheelchair.

222
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,560
 And then he couldn't talk anymore.

223
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,240
 It actually might have taken more than two days, but the point, that story scared me.

224
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,120
 I mean, it's not like I was going around eating slugs or nothing like that.

225
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,520
 But it just shows like, if you don't know, if you're not aware that if you eat a slug,

226
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,280
 it can actually break your brain.

227
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,560
 Like, it was a horrible story.

228
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,040
 I read about it because he died.

229
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
 Like, he lived to be like, it was like 15, 20 years after he ate the slug.

230
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,400
 I mean, there's just photos of him in this wheelchair.

231
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,280
 And his family was like, "Oh, he was never the same after he ate that slug."

232
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,040
 And all of his friends are like, "Oh, we wish we hadn't bet him to eat that slug."

233
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
 I don't even think it was a bet.

234
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,760
 I think he just said, "Watch, I can eat that slug."

235
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,120
 I don't eat slugs personally, but I didn't know that.

236
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,440
 I didn't know that if you eat a slug, there's a chance you will end up in a wheelchair.

237
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,160
 And I definitely didn't know that if you didn't properly cook your food, you might lose your

238
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,360
 legs and your fingers or die.

239
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
 So I wanted to make sure that you knew that.

240
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,280
 You were like, "Jason, yes, yes."

241
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,640
 We all knew that.

242
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,840
 We all knew that.

243
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,880
 You were the only person, you and this poor guy in college were the only person who didn't

244
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,120
 think you needed to cook food before you ate it.

245
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,800
 But just in case you didn't, you learned it on Dead Rabbit Radio.

246
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,120
 Also go to the doctor.

247
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
 Go to the doctor.

248
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
 That's always my advice.

249
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
 Go to the doctor.

250
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,960
 If something is wrong with your body, if you are vomiting fluids that do not look like the

251
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,880
 fluids you ate, I often throw up chicken noodle soup because I'm eating chicken noodle soup

252
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,480
 or I've just eaten a bunch of del taco.

253
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,120
 And if I ate a bunch of del taco and I've been vomiting up McRibs, I've been vomiting

254
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,680
 up food I hadn't eaten in years, I'm going to the doctor.

255
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,320
 That means something is really, really wrong.

256
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,800
 Mason, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

257
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,760
 We're leaving behind this college campus.

258
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,920
 The guy will be fine, right?

259
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,920
 I mean, you can have a filling life with no legs and fingers, but it does make things more

260
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
 difficult.

261
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
 Mason, go ahead.

262
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
 We're going to toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

263
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,560
 We're leaving behind this college campus.

264
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560
 We're headed all the way out to Watts.

265
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:07,560
 [MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAKING THE MAK

266
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:25,240
 It's Mason's flying the carpenter copter.

267
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,120
 From the year 2021, but I cooked it.

268
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,160
 Let's go back to the year 1961.

269
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,360
 This is one of these stories that is so interesting.

270
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
 Let's just get into this.

271
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,800
 The year is 1961 and we have, even though we don't have a specific date, we have a neighborhood.

272
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,240
 We're headed to Watts, California.

273
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:54,800
 Specifically, this story starts on East 103rd Street and Grape Street.

274
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,240
 Now, Grape Street is well-known.

275
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,680
 It's the most delicious street in California.

276
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,200
 It's also known there was the Grape Street Crips.

277
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,040
 Apparently, I don't know if they still exist.

278
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,800
 I always thought it was very, very interesting that you could have these guys were actually

279
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
 quite feared.

280
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,120
 I'm kind of hoping they don't exist because they might come and kill me.

281
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,600
 The Grape Street Crips.

282
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,560
 That's not an intimidating name at all.

283
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,960
 I imagine you like a bunch of aruka salts like rolling down the street.

284
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,280
 Grape Street.

285
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,400
 Grape Street.

286
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,360
 It's delicious and I think you're super squishy and stuff.

287
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,560
 In Sacramento, we had a gang.

288
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,400
 They were on Creek Street or in this neighborhood that had a big creek.

289
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,240
 They would always come into house parties and stuff like that.

290
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
 You'd be there.

291
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,600
 You'd be dancing or whatever, getting drunk.

292
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,600
 These three or four dudes would crash the party and they'd go, "Creek mob, creek mob!"

293
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,120
 and they'd be throwing up signs and stuff like that.

294
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,240
 You would turn around and be like, "You guys are buffoons.

295
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,560
 You never see these guys were brutal.

296
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,280
 You would never say that to their face."

297
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
 They would shoot you.

298
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
 I think they have clocked the...

299
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,640
 Again, I don't know if these guys are around anymore either.

300
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,280
 We had a house party somewhere out in North Highlands.

301
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,040
 Creek mob, creek mob and these dudes would come in and you're like, "You would leave

302
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
 the house.

303
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,520
 You would not want to be around where these dudes were."

304
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,120
 But as you were leaving the house and you're getting in your car, you're like, "That is

305
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
 such a dumb name."

306
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,320
 You would think it's a bunch of Tom Sawyer dudes walking around and overalls and their

307
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,720
 pants are all rolled up.

308
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,240
 Creeks are not scary.

309
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,120
 Grapes are not scary.

310
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,600
 I never understood.

311
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,920
 I mean again, it's the game.

312
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,160
 I understand why they have that.

313
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,920
 That's where they live.

314
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,160
 As they're coming to kill me right now, I might as well make my peace with them, but I get

315
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,360
 why they chose that name.

316
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,720
 But it's a goofy name, right?

317
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,880
 Anyways, as I've now signed my own death horn, as I've made fun of two, these guys are actually

318
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
 quite brutal.

319
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,960
 The Grape Street, Crips and Creek Mob was not people that you want to publicly make fun

320
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,840
 of on a podcast.

321
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:16,480
 But anyways, Grape Street and East 103rd Street in Watts, California, it's 315 in the afternoon

322
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:24,080
 and the citizens of Watts see in broad daylight something that should not be seen.

323
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,600
 I gave it away in the intro.

324
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:34,080
 It is a dog with the head of a woman walking down the street.

325
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,800
 Now some accounts say it's just the face of a woman.

326
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,400
 That's not any less distressing than I'm imagining like a Doberman Pinscher.

327
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,120
 Remember those old Snoop Dog videos where Snoop Dog would morph into the dog?

328
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:56,440
 We used that 1993 morphing technology, Snoop Doggy, and he would turn into the Doberman

329
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,200
 Pinscher or whatever it was.

330
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,000
 I kind of imagine that mid-frame, like if you hit pause on MTV or the box when you're

331
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 watching it.

332
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,280
 But anyways, it's distressing either way.

333
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,480
 There's a dog with clearly a woman's face on it.

334
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,440
 Now it's not a dog with a smashed face.

335
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,520
 It's a dog with the face or head of a woman.

336
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,840
 I imagine the head would have long flowing hair.

337
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,000
 But you can imagine this abomination however you want.

338
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,840
 This dog is walking down the street with the head of a woman.

339
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
 I'm just going to keep saying that.

340
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,160
 Heave a woman.

341
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
 Just because it's a funnier visual.

342
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
 But anyways, you have this dog running down the street.

343
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,400
 It's not normal.

344
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,280
 And this was cited for hours.

345
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
 People are calling each other up.

346
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,520
 "Hey, go outside right now.

347
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
 Look!

348
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,120
 You're going to see something absolutely disturbing."

349
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,440
 And people are like, "I want to go outside!"

350
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
 It's a horrible way.

351
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,160
 I haven't talked to you in months and that's what you want me to do.

352
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,200
 You walk outside, you'll see a dog with the head of a woman walking down the street.

353
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
 What?

354
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,000
 This is interesting because that is kind of all the information that was out there.

355
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,400
 I didn't know this.

356
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,720
 This was a popular cryptid sighting in 1961 Watts.

357
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:08,560
 And when you look up the dog-faced woman of Watts, you'll find pretty much that information.

358
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,400
 There's an intrepid researcher who's actually done more work on this.

359
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:21,600
 And what's funny is I've called this guy out a lot for the murder of a Nevada state trooper.

360
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,800
 He's possibly a man who killed a police officer in the line of duty or in his mind he killed

361
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,040
 a member of the men in black.

362
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,920
 We don't know if the story's made up or if he has murdered a man whose bleached bones

363
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,020
 are out there right now.

364
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
 We don't know.

365
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,600
 Kevin Whiskey.

366
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,160
 Kevin Whiskey was a guy we profiled twice once when he fought a man in black.

367
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,800
 And then the second time, oh he told us what happened during Missy 911.

368
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,520
 It was an operation to build a new society.

369
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,120
 It's very, very interesting stuff.

370
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,240
 I went kind of hard on Kevin Whiskey the first episode, but honestly he's brought us some

371
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
 good stuff.

372
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:06,200
 So he's back and he actually has done more research into the dog woman of Watts.

373
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,860
 He had a friend who lived there.

374
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
 And he talked to him.

375
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,420
 And he's like, Jason isn't the same guy who you just said said that he beat up a member

376
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
 of the men in black.

377
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,140
 Like can we take this guy at face value?

378
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
 Well let's see.

379
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,540
 He said that he has, that means I don't know.

380
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,260
 That means I don't know but this is an interesting story.

381
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:30,220
 He says that he knows a guy named Clifton who lives in Watts and actually lived in Watts

382
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,780
 back then apparently.

383
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,140
 1961, it seems like it was so long ago but I guess it really wasn't.

384
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,360
 It was summertime.

385
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,800
 It was a Friday.

386
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,520
 So right there we already have more details about when this story took place.

387
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,480
 Clifton said, listen it was summertime and it was a Friday, it was 3.15.

388
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,680
 I remember the day exactly because it was the day I saw an eldricked abomination walking

389
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,320
 down the street.

390
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,480
 He goes, I was walking home from work and I see across the street a mom going, oh my

391
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
 god.

392
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,340
 And she's like holding her son and the son's like, oh my god.

393
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:15,860
 And he's like what is that woman and son freaking out about and he sees them pointing.

394
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,840
 Pointing at something on his side of the street.

395
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,540
 And he looks up and he sees a dog walking down the street.

396
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:32,200
 This dog he described had a messed up face.

397
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,160
 It didn't look like it was normal.

398
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:42,680
 He goes, it actually looked like a normal dog but its face looked like an ape's face.

399
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:50,600
 Now this is interesting because this actually lines up more to some sort of disfigured dog.

400
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,700
 The other stories of the dog face lady or the Jason version where it's a full head of

401
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,560
 a human on a dog.

402
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,520
 This dog had some sort of deformed face.

403
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,240
 Now again you're going to see dogs with messed up faces.

404
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,480
 They didn't be called bulldogs.

405
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,720
 But he says, not only am I looking at this dog with this messed up face that looks like

406
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,560
 an ape plastered onto where its normal snout should be.

407
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,720
 He goes, I felt an unnatural feeling of fear grip me.

408
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,580
 I knew what I was looking at was not natural.

409
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,260
 So that's an interesting clue because unfortunately we've all seen animals with birth defects.

410
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,180
 We've seen humans with birth defects.

411
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,460
 But when you look at them you may go, aww, that's sad.

412
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,900
 Or you may go, that's a curious arrangement.

413
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,940
 But when we talk about unnatural fears that's something that shouldn't exist.

414
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,160
 Yeah, a horse with two heads shouldn't exist.

415
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,120
 But they do and when we see it we go, oh they probably either died very shortly, a horse

416
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,080
 can't have two heads, or they're still alive and it's this magnificent beast.

417
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,360
 One side's eating hay and the other side is probably eating hay too because that's kind

418
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,200
 of all horses do.

419
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,760
 The point is that when you look at something and you're filled with that unnatural fear

420
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:16,000
 it's because it is what you're looking at should not exist.

421
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,180
 So he's looking at this thing and he crosses the street and he goes to where the mom and

422
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
 the kid are.

423
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,340
 And I think they're on like the other side of a fence and if I remember the story correctly

424
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,060
 he crawls over the fence or maybe just opens it up and walks in and he tells the mom and

425
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,980
 the kid he goes, hey thanks for warning me.

426
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
 What is that thing?

427
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:41,300
 And they all stood there and watched as this dog just slowly sauntered down the street.

428
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,000
 And if you saw a dog with a messed up face but otherwise it was acting normal would

429
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,720
 you be like warning people, look out look out that dog's super ugly?

430
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 No.

431
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,440
 But if it was giving you a sense of that thing should not exist that is not from our reality

432
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,600
 it would spark a different thing.

433
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,320
 And in this version where Clifton is giving more details he watches the dog walk down

434
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:11,160
 the street and some people watched it and they're following it and it gets to a well-known

435
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:17,660
 pimp who works in the area and the dog starts talking to the pimp and the pimp's like hey

436
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,660
 what's up dog?

437
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,580
 You want to make some money and the dog's like yeah sure I'd love to make some money.

438
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,300
 I actually don't need to say what their conversation was.

439
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:32,620
 The implication was that the dog was either working for the pimp or it was the pimp's

440
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,460
 dog but the pimp didn't seem shocked by it at all.

441
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,980
 He's having a conversation with this dog.

442
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,200
 And so people start to put two and two together.

443
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,200
 There's a pimp and there's this dog with this horribly disgusting face.

444
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,000
 I don't know how that went to become it looked like a lady.

445
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,320
 Like they're like this thing's horrible and then some guy's like hey that kind of looks

446
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
 like my wife.

447
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,280
 The lady-faced dog or disfigured dog is hanging out with this local pimp and people find this

448
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,920
 whole thing or this whole arrangement kind of spooky.

449
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,180
 So now it's not just a lady-faced dog, it's a dog that can hold a conversation.

450
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,100
 And the one person it talks to is a pimp.

451
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,300
 So people over here this pimp talking to them and now that I'm thinking about this who witnessed

452
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,300
 this right?

453
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
 They're like hey man let me hit that doobie.

454
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,820
 And he's dropping on this conversation.

455
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,500
 We joined a pimp and a dog.

456
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,460
 We don't know who actually witnessed this part of the story but apparently the pimp

457
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,780
 had a conversation with the lady-faced dog.

458
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,840
 And people thought that was weird, right?

459
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,040
 And then shortly afterwards, a matter of days, it was like 10 minutes later, a matter of

460
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,640
 days or weeks pass, the dog is no longer seen, it was only seen on that day, the pimp is

461
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,720
 stabbed to death.

462
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,680
 So the implications are kind of like this.

463
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,440
 The dog knew the pimp, the pimp knew the dog.

464
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,340
 Is the dog some sort of demon that was summoned by the pimp to get extra prostitutes or something?

465
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,580
 That he's like I'll sell my soul for three more skanks.

466
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,780
 And this was the dog coming to deliver on that?

467
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,380
 He's like you weren't specific.

468
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,980
 So I'm one of your skanks.

469
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,580
 This could have been some sort of escapy from a government lab underneath the streets of

470
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
 Watts.

471
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,540
 That is one of Kevin Whiskey's theories.

472
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,600
 He says that he's a super soldier and he believes that this...

473
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,760
 You can almost hear my eyes rolling my head as much as I love the dog-faced lady-starter,

474
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
 the lady-faced dog-starrer.

475
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,440
 I keep getting mixed up.

476
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,040
 Now we gotta go back to the super soldier.

477
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,040
 So anyways, Kevin Whiskey says that underneath the city of Watts, there may be a secret government

478
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,480
 labs and this dog got loose, right?

479
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,440
 And went to go talk to the pimp, right?

480
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,280
 Finally, I'm free.

481
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,980
 Now I wanna go have sex for the money and it goes and he talks to this pimp.

482
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,260
 It's possible, which here I'll say this, right?

483
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,900
 I can guarantee you like in the criminal underworld, right?

484
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,780
 Where you have pimps and you have like drug dealers and stuff like that.

485
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,180
 I would say, I don't wanna get shot in the face over this, but I would say maybe one

486
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,020
 out of ten of them and it might actually, that actually might be lowballing it, have

487
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,180
 connections to government agencies.

488
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:24,220
 So it would actually make sense if you escaped from a laboratory to go talk to a pimp.

489
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,920
 I'm okay, maybe it doesn't make sense when you say it like that.

490
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,040
 But if you were a government, if you were a work for the government, if you were on

491
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,240
 a clandestine mission, you were CIA or you're from doing running some sort of spy operation,

492
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,840
 you're not gonna have assets, you might, but your assets are a lot of times gonna be the

493
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,480
 underclass, right?

494
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,960
 So it would kind of make sense that a pimp would know about whether or not there's an

495
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
 integrated laboratory.

496
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,120
 I'm trying to make as much sense of this as I can.

497
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,380
 I keep saying absolutely insane things.

498
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,540
 The dog escaped from an underground laboratory and knew that the pimp could help it out.

499
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,660
 That's possibility one.

500
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:07,180
 Two, possibility two, is that this was some sort of demonic force sent to curse the pimp,

501
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,300
 because the pimp died so closely afterwards.

502
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,300
 Kevin Whiskey thinks that it might have been a voodoo revenge spell, specifically that

503
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:18,340
 was his example and it was making its way through the city of Watts to get to him and

504
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,020
 to pass on that curse.

505
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,480
 But here's the problem with that, getting stabbed to death and being a pimp, that's

506
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,880
 not an unusual ending for a criminal career.

507
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,040
 Like if the president of Budapest got stabbed to death, you might want to look into voodoo

508
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,720
 revenge spells, you might want to like if just one day someone went into his locked room

509
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,800
 and they finally were able to get in and he was horribly stabbed to death, that would

510
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,320
 be unusual.

511
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,400
 But a pimp getting stabbed to death, like that's weird, four gangbangers killed in a

512
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,760
 drive by, it must be supernatural.

513
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,620
 Like there are unfortunate side effects to being in the criminal industry, one of them

514
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,300
 is dying violently.

515
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:05,340
 So the ideas are escape lab, voodoo revenge spell, possible demonic, like the fact that

516
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,980
 it was causing this unnatural fear in people.

517
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,860
 But I have another conspiracy theory, we're going to wrap it up like this.

518
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:17,580
 I'm curious about this, how much money would you pay to have sex with a cryptid?

519
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:24,960
 Like if there was a pimp that could take you to a bordello and you're walking around and

520
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,800
 you can like look into each room and there's like one room there's like a sexy chupacabra.

521
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,680
 Okay let's back up here, would it even have to be sexy?

522
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,120
 Like imagine you could pay $10,000.

523
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,040
 Okay, I know everyone's already shut off the podcast.

524
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:46,720
 There is no one listening to this part, they're like nope, nope I'm going to come back tomorrow,

525
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,660
 I can't wait to see the algorithm I can actually see when people stop listening to the podcast,

526
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,600
 it's just going to buckle out right there, it's just going to hit the bottom.

527
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,780
 Imagine if you could pay money to have sex with like a chupacabra or a reptilian or like

528
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,460
 dude like if you and your friends, think about it, it's bachelor night and you can get some

529
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:10,060
 money together and pay some stripper to come out or you and your friends could gang bang

530
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,020
 the Loch Ness monster.

531
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,740
 What would you do?

532
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,780
 What would you do?

533
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:22,640
 I'm not saying I would have sex with any of these cryptids, just for legal reasons, just

534
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,120
 for legal reasons if I ever get caught trespassing in the middle of nowhere.

535
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:34,860
 No one can say I think he was on the land to try to find three legged lady and have sex

536
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,860
 with her.

537
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,800
 I wouldn't personally pay money to have sex with a cryptid but I bet you if someone could

538
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,200
 figure out a way to catch these guys you could do two things or three things, you could do

539
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
 a lot of things.

540
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,100
 Let's say you captured Bigfoot, you could train him to be in the military, you could

541
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:57,420
 put him in a circus sideshow or you could pimp him out and you could pimp out cryptids.

542
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,300
 Maybe that's the reason why we can't, that's the reason why we can never find him because

543
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,820
 some pimp has already caught all of them and has this giant bordello.

544
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,180
 You gotta admit, you gotta admit you would be curious.

545
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:17,680
 So if cryptids exist there has to be, scientifically there has to be somebody at some point, someone

546
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,600
 has tried to pimp out these cryptids.

547
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,040
 So you imagine there is somewhere, I'm not saying it's a franchise, I'm not saying they

548
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,000
 have these places everywhere in the world but you figure at some point someone must have

549
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,400
 built a bordello.

550
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,000
 You got all these cryptids in there and you of course are a big ol' pervert.

551
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,420
 I'm putting it on you, not me.

552
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,660
 You go to this bordello and you're like looking in and you're like looking through the doors

553
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,580
 and you're like oh dude, there's that dolphin man from Peru but I'm good and then you walk

554
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,940
 to the next door and you're like oh dude elves do exist but I'm fine, I don't want to ever

555
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,740
 want to bang one, I just want them to make presents for me and you keep going through

556
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,340
 this bordello and then you see, come on man, you know which one you want to bang, Bigfoot.

557
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,940
 Like that's the most popular one, right?

558
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:09,480
 Big giant hairy dude walking around, what's more sexy than a guy that doesn't exist and

559
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,040
 here's the thing, you got your money ready, you are ready to get down and dirty with Bigfoot

560
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,040
 but then you realize something.

561
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,920
 It's not about sex anymore, it's not about sex for money, this commercial exchange, you're

562
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:30,440
 actually starting to fall for the mysterious man who disappears in the woods.

563
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:40,240
 This isn't just about sex, I think you're falling in love.

564
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:50,180
 Sexy Sasquatch walking down the street, sexy Sasquatch, I got a fetish for feet, sexy Sasquatch.

565
00:32:50,180 --> 00:33:00,180
 They don't believe me, they think you're fake, the way you don't show up on tape.

566
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:05,680
 Blurry.

567
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:13,400
 Sexy Sasquatch, the world doesn't know, sexy Sasquatch, I want to suck your toes, sexy

568
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,680
 Sasquatch.

569
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:23,520
 Entire body is covered in hair, but do you shave down there?

570
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:32,260
 You're like please let this end, not yet.

571
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:41,460
 Sexy Sasquatch, stay with me, sexy Sasquatch you sexy beast, let me feast on your Toe Jam

572
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,700
 yeast, oh please.
