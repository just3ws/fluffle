1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
 A road in England has an unusual assailant.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,720
 And then what happens when bad journalism meets the paranormal?

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,800
 You get an interactive adventure today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:26,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
 I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,480
 Just a quick reminder, we do have our merch store up.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,040
 If you want to help support the show, support the channel, check out our merch store.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,840
 We got stickers and we should have a calendar, but we don't.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,520
 We have stickers and a t-shirt and posters.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,600
 Help us support the channel, wear the swag, get the word out.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,360
 It all is awesome and you will look good doing it unless the sticker.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
 I mean, you can't wear a sticker.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,240
 You put on something and then you look good holding that thing with the sticker on it.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,000
 Now, our first story is actually a request from Stuart Meatball on YouTube.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
 Now we were talking, I don't remember what the reference was.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,560
 We were talking recently about something from Britain.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
 Some British story.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,120
 Um, I don't, it might have been the Grinning Man.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,800
 I'm not for sure, but we were talking about something in Britain on the podcast that I

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,400
 can't remember, so I'm sure it was super memorable.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,320
 But Stuart says, "Have you ever heard of the hairy hands of Devon?"

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,560
 And it's also sometimes known as the hairy hands of Dartmoor.

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
 You know what?

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
 I don't get it about England.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,360
 Like they got to have 10 names for everything.

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,520
 So this story, this is my notes right here.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,280
 It says, "It takes place in England, in the county of Devon, on the road in Dartmoor in

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
 Postbridge."

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,240
 And then I have a little thing going town city.

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,120
 Like I don't know what is what over there.

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,600
 So again, I can never make heads or tails or where anything is at in Britain.

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,720
 So let's just assume this is two miles south of the Shire.

36
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,920
 And actually they call stuff Shires over there, so that joke actually isn't a joke.

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
 It's a fact.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,280
 So I'm just done trying to figure out stuff that happens in Britain.

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,840
 But before I completely give up on that entire country, let's talk about the hairy hands

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,680
 of the country of England and the county of Devon and the road in Dartmoor in Postbridge.

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,440
 So imagine you're driving day or night.

42
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,640
 It doesn't really matter with this phenomenon.

43
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,960
 You're driving down this road in, we'll say Dartmoor.

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,320
 You're driving down this road.

45
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,640
 You're like, Jason, I want to go there.

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,000
 I want to know where it's at.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,480
 You just can't rant about the geographical listings in England.

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
 But, but, but, okay.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
 Check out the show notes.

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,600
 You're driving down Dartmoor.

51
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,200
 Everything's going fine.

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,080
 Got your one hand on the wheel, the other hand on your honey, because you're Winnie the

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
 Pooh.

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,480
 That's a literal honey.

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,960
 And you're driving on the road.

56
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,720
 Get your head stuck in a beehive.

57
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,000
 You're driving on the road and you start to feel the car veer a little bit to the right.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,720
 You're like, oh, I better correct.

59
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 I better.

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
 Don't bother.

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
 Better correct.

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,880
 That might have been the worst Winnie the Pooh impression on record.

63
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,440
 Anyways, forget Winnie the Pooh.

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,120
 You're driving on the road and it starts to lean a little bit to the other side and you're

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,280
 like, oh, I better correct the other way.

66
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,360
 And this is going on.

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,680
 And then you see it.

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
 Materialize out of nothing.

69
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,060
 You see two hairy hands, two hirsuit hands.

70
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,160
 Grab your steering wheel and begin shaking it violently one way to the other.

71
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,520
 You lose control of your vehicle.

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,760
 It goes careening off the road.

73
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
 It's all tipped over.

74
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,160
 There's one tire still dramatically spinning.

75
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,960
 You see smoke coming out of the hood.

76
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,560
 And as you crawl out of your car, you see the hairy hands slowly disappear.

77
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,360
 Now that sounds like a ridiculous story.

78
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,440
 And it is, but a lot of people have experienced this thing.

79
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,560
 And what's on about it is that these are all fairly recent.

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,960
 England's been around, if you don't know much about England.

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,360
 England's been around for thousands of years.

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,400
 So a lot of the hauntings and stuff we see over there are like, oh yeah, King Henry's

83
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,280
 ghost is floating around with this head of Anne Boleyn or whatever.

84
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,760
 This didn't start until 1910.

85
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,960
 And it actually preceded automobiles.

86
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,840
 Originally, well, it had some automobiles, but a lot of it was bicyclists.

87
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,020
 People riding their bike down this street.

88
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,360
 It's the road between post bridge and two bridges.

89
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,600
 I got far enough down in my notes where I have that specified.

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,560
 People would be riding their bicycle and the bicycle would violently shift in one direction

91
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,480
 and they'd go tumbling off.

92
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,360
 Back then they would just kind of roll around on the ground and get back up, dust themselves

93
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,120
 off and be like, what was that weird phenomenon?

94
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,600
 But as obviously as automobiles became more prevalent, you begin having fatal accidents.

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,160
 People driving down this road 60 miles an hour.

96
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
 The car shifts to one side.

97
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
 People die.

98
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,000
 In 1921, there was a doctor who was riding his motorcycle and he had two little girls.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
 There weren't just random girls that he kidnapped.

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,800
 His two daughters were in a sidecar and the motorcycle completely veers off to one side

101
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,760
 of the road and he dies.

102
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
 They survive.

103
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
 But they didn't mention it.

104
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,120
 They didn't say, oh yeah, I saw these big hairy hands show up.

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,160
 Looked like an Italian jumped on the front of the motorcycle.

106
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
 They didn't notice anything.

107
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,480
 They just realized that he had lost control that they careened off.

108
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,120
 It was in August of 1921.

109
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,520
 It was actually just a couple months.

110
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,560
 That first one happened in June 1921, August 1921.

111
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,280
 There was an army captain driving down that same road and he was the first one to see

112
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,160
 the hairy hands appear out of nowhere.

113
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
 He had a fight for control of the vehicle.

114
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
 It crashed.

115
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,640
 He survived obviously so he could tell the story of the hairy hands.

116
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,160
 Then in 1924, oddly enough, there was a man and a woman in a caravan, which is an English

117
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,160
 word for a mobile home.

118
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,760
 They were just chilling, hanging out in their caravan in 1924, doing whatever people listen

119
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,560
 in a swing music, or just sitting there feeling depressed.

120
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,880
 Did they have the Great Depression in England or was that just an American thing?

121
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,920
 Did the English just go, ah whatever, stuff kind of cost a bit more?

122
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,520
 Was it not as bad over there?

123
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
 Anyway, they might have been living the high life then.

124
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,920
 They might have been way better often as Dust Bowl Americans, but they're sitting in their

125
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:11,000
 caravan and the woman notices there were disembodied hairy hands trying to bang on the window, trying

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,280
 to get in.

127
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,360
 So it's not just that you had to be driving around.

128
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,040
 They, these hands, one were intelligent.

129
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,320
 They could like try, like, they weren't doing like Sudoko or anything, but they were obviously

130
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,680
 smart enough to know which way to pull your car, which would make it crane, which I technically,

131
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,920
 I guess is any way you're not going will make you crash.

132
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,000
 But also to float around and try to break on windows and stuff.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,600
 I guess that's not a sign of intelligence because a monkey does that, but anyways, she

134
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,720
 made the sign of the cross, the hairy hands disappeared.

135
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,600
 So you started having all of these sightings of this hairy hand attack in Dartmoor.

136
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,360
 And then actually the latest hand sighting though was in around 1962.

137
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,960
 So we did have an end to it.

138
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
 This one again was particularly creepy.

139
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,280
 This person's driving to the road.

140
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,720
 They pull over to the side of the road.

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,320
 They need to check their map.

142
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
 Paper map.

143
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
 They didn't have map quest back then.

144
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,800
 Do they still even use map quest?

145
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,920
 They didn't have Google Maps back then.

146
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
 Imagine this.

147
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,280
 You're sitting in your car and you hold up your map and you're like, hmm, I'm going to

148
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,560
 go here, I'm going to go here, and then I go to this county and what?

149
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,040
 I just don't understand English geography.

150
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,800
 And then once you drop the map, like it's perfectly covering your view of the front

151
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
 windshield.

152
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,760
 Once you drop the map, there's hairy hands pressing on your front windshield.

153
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
 Try to get in.

154
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,440
 Perfect jump scare moment.

155
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,400
 Dude freaked out, hit the gas, drove away.

156
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
 Hairy hands didn't get in.

157
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,400
 But so people really started looking into this because there was a ton of sightings in this

158
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 area.

159
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,240
 And again, this is what I always find fascinating about these stories is when we have an answer.

160
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,360
 Apparently, the road has what's called a camber, where it's pointy in the middle and sloped

161
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,400
 on both sides in certain places, not an ideal situation for a road.

162
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,480
 And if you're going on a straightaway and the road will start to camber in certain points,

163
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,040
 guess what?

164
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,400
 Your car will veer to one side or the other.

165
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,120
 So there actually was a legitimate thing going on where people were getting into car accidents

166
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,360
 on this road more often than not.

167
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,240
 But it was because the actual shape of the road, you'd be driving straight and then

168
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,160
 it would start to whatever reason they designed it like that.

169
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,440
 Or it was just an accident over huge stretches of road, but the road would start to lift

170
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,200
 up in the middle and be sloped on the sides and you're going a straightaway.

171
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,720
 The road changes and you would just cream off on one side or the other.

172
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,760
 They fixed the road and the sightings of the hairy hands stopped.

173
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,520
 But we have a natural reason for why people would be getting in car accidents.

174
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,800
 Why were people seeing the hairy hands to begin with?

175
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,080
 Here's my hypothesis and I have no proof of this.

176
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,680
 What if the hairy hands weren't causing the accidents?

177
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,080
 What if the hairy hands were trying to stop the accidents?

178
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,120
 What if you were driving down this road and your car would start to careen and you would

179
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,000
 start to over correct, hands would appear from somewhere to try to correct you into

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,920
 the right angle and through panicking in your own power because you don't give up to the

181
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,440
 hairy hands, just give up to the hairy hands, they'll take care of you, because you fight

182
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,080
 it, you are causing the accident.

183
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,960
 I mean either the hairy hands don't exist at all, it was a total hallucination on the

184
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,920
 same stretch of road that people were getting into accidents on.

185
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,400
 Or the road was already flawed and the hairy hands wanted to make more accidents or the

186
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,760
 road was flawed, people were getting accidents and something was appearing to prevent them

187
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,560
 from getting in an accident.

188
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,840
 It's an interesting story but I'm thinking of stuff like the third man where people,

189
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,720
 we've talked about that on the past episode, when people would go on hikes and someone

190
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,080
 would appear and kind of guide them through the rest of their hike.

191
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,520
 Or maybe even a hairy guardian angel.

192
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,040
 I don't know, but hairy hands of dartmoor between post bridge and two bridges, maybe

193
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,160
 you're the good guy, maybe your hairy hands were sent from above to save the lives and

194
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,240
 we by over correcting were making you the bad guy.

195
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,440
 So hats off to you hairy hands, I have no other way in that.

196
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

197
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,040
 Now, let's talk about a little website called Backpackerverse.

198
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,240
 When I, we talked about backpackerverse yesterday and I thought backpackerverse was a website

199
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,400
 that talked about places to go hiking, hence the name backpackerverse.

200
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,360
 I found out recently that that's not the case, that may be what kind of what they do, but

201
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,720
 if you go to their website they have tons of stuff about psychics and astrology and ghosts

202
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,280
 and that makes what's about to come even more egregious because when I thought they were

203
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,200
 just a hiking website that every so often did a ghost article, I could understand how

204
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
 something like this slipped through quality control, but if they do this on the regular,

205
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,680
 they got some serious problems over there.

206
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,120
 So let's go ahead and take a look at what I'm talking about, but first I want you to

207
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,240
 pick a number.

208
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,080
 I want you to pick a number between one and five.

209
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,200
 Okay, you got it?

210
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,360
 We're going to go on a journey.

211
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,760
 They wrote an article called "The 10 Most Haunted Places in California That Will Make

212
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
 You Scream."

213
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
 Quite the mouthful.

214
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,240
 "10 Most Haunted Places in California That Will Make You Scream."

215
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,720
 Now there's a lot of competition.

216
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,360
 There's a lot of haunted places in California.

217
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,080
 But backpackerverse said, "Let's just make it up.

218
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,440
 Let's just make stuff up."

219
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,560
 Because people who are into ghosts and the paranormal, they don't care about facts, they

220
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,720
 don't care about cross-referencing anything, they just want to read ghosts in something.

221
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
 The word "haunted" and that's it.

222
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,960
 Now to be fair, I did click on this article so they got my eyeballs and the article is

223
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,880
 going to be below, so they may have your eyeballs.

224
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,520
 But we're going to go through five of these, the top five.

225
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,440
 And I want you to ask yourself two things.

226
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,040
 One, the number you picked will be the way that you die.

227
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:10,520
 And two, imagine a world where what I'm about to tell you is true.

228
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:16,080
 Imagine a world where the paranormal events I'm about to go through actually happen.

229
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
 Are verifiable.

230
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,360
 Because according to this article, these things are 100% true.

231
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,400
 Imagine how you would go about your daily life if you knew it was possible to die in

232
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,320
 one of these ways.

233
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,960
 First off, we're going to the Aqua-Manzas Cemetery in Colton, California.

234
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,320
 As far as I know, these places don't even exist.

235
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,200
 But we're going there.

236
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,840
 And here we are going to meet the Gang of Dark Souls.

237
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,480
 We're creeping through a cemetery, all spooky.

238
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,560
 Full, what's it about full moons being scary?

239
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,640
 Is it because everyone goes crazy?

240
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
 I think crescent moons are kind of creepy too.

241
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,520
 But anyways, let's make it a crescent moon.

242
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,040
 Let's not be stereotypical.

243
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,280
 Walking through the cemetery, crescent moon hangs in the sky.

244
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,480
 Fog rolls across the ground.

245
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,320
 100% true, if this story is 100% true.

246
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,960
 You're walking through the cemetery and you go, "Oh man, this place is creepy.

247
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,560
 I heard that bunch of celebrity ghosts died here.

248
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,480
 Good thing, good thing I'm just pick number two.

249
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,160
 I don't think anything will happen to me if I pick number two.

250
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,440
 But if you pick number two, you see a figure out in the distance.

251
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,200
 A woman in white.

252
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,920
 The world famous La Lorna Ghost.

253
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,960
 Recently had a movie made about her.

254
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,400
 The ghost who drowned her own children.

255
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,520
 And now she spends eternity wailing for her own crimes.

256
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
 She's there.

257
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,160
 According to this article, 100% true.

258
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,440
 She's no longer just roaming around Mexico.

259
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,160
 She's in the Agua Mansa Cemetery, but that's not all.

260
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,720
 Also there is one of the herbs.

261
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,520
 Now not the cool herb, not Wyatt herb, but his brother, Morgan herb.

262
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,200
 So he's still a celebrity, a brother of a celebrity, still a celebrity.

263
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,240
 You're walking through the cemetery, you see La Lorna, you want to get her autograph.

264
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,680
 But Morgan herb sneaks up behind you and he was hung by the neck, killed for whatever

265
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
 reason, for being a member of the law.

266
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,160
 Because weren't the herbs the good guys?

267
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,840
 Anyways, he was hung with a scratchy rope according to Backpacker Universe as opposed

268
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,880
 to the silk ones they use with everyone else.

269
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,080
 This rope was particularly scratchy because it says that he strangles you with the scratchy

270
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
 rope.

271
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,680
 "Morgan herb comes up behind you and says say hello to my brother for me, the more famous

272
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,840
 of us."

273
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,680
 And as he's strangling you with this rope number two, La Lorna comes to you and begins

274
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:50,520
 vomiting blood down your throat until you both drown and are strangled.

275
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,200
 According to Backpacker Universe, you have a very very possible shot of going into the

276
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,800
 cemetery and being killed by La Lorna and Morgan herb.

277
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,800
 This article is not parody, this article is not an April Fool's joke.

278
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,320
 This is listed as something that can actually happen to you if you go to this cemetery.

279
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,480
 It's Friday, I'm a little feisty.

280
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,720
 I find it odd that somebody even thought for one minute that this was believable, that

281
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,280
 somebody thought that if you go to a cemetery two celebrities will show up and kill you.

282
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,120
 Number one, La Lorna doesn't vomit blood.

283
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,000
 I don't think even in the most liberal retelling, and that's not political liberal, but I mean

284
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,160
 in the most fanciful way of telling the story of La Lorna, I don't think she vomits blood.

285
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,520
 Secondly, Morgan herb wasn't hung.

286
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,200
 He was shot to death.

287
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,720
 So scratchy rope or no, he would not strangle you with one.

288
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,040
 But if you pick number two, enjoy your fictional death and know that there are a lot of people

289
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,920
 out there who believe this story, and you proved it to be true.

290
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,400
 But let's go to De Forest Park in Long Beach.

291
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:12,640
 After Twilight, the sun has set, present moon in the sky, fog, it's the exact same environment

292
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,320
 except now it's in a forest and there's no gravestones, and La Lorna may or may not

293
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,400
 be there, but not in this version.

294
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:27,760
 You hear someone laughing in the dark, and you turn around and you look through the forest.

295
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:35,760
 You remember stories of a serial killer here who used to bring his victims out here and

296
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:43,680
 then bury them, hoping that their skin would rot underground and then he would dig them

297
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,960
 up and wear their skin.

298
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,120
 And serial killer you ask?

299
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,640
 Nobody knows, it was backpacker universe didn't tell us.

300
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,040
 When did he operate?

301
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,000
 How many victims did he have?

302
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,520
 Nobody knows, there's no references to who this supposed serial killer is, but you're

303
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:11,080
 walking through the forest and this fictional serial killer who supposedly 100% true still

304
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,320
 wants his skin.

305
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:20,200
 He jumps on you and digs sharp nails into your love handles and begins peeling you like

306
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,640
 a ripe banana in the summer sun.

307
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,280
 As he's lifting your skin off he whispers in your ear, "If you pick number four, you're

308
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,120
 the perfect fit."

309
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,640
 And then he just wears your skin around.

310
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,720
 Now again, I don't want to hammer this point home, but if this guy existed, there wouldn't

311
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,600
 be any ghost hunters left, they'd all be skinned alive.

312
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,880
 This stuff, again remember, haunted places that can make you scream, this stuff will happen

313
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,440
 to you if you go here.

314
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,120
 This stuff will happen to you.

315
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,120
 Now we're going to the Ortega Highway.

316
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,440
 They make delicious salsa, but they also make delicious death.

317
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,040
 Ortega Highway, this is in San Juan Capistrano.

318
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,040
 You're driving down the road, you know what, just for the sake of this stupid article, Jason

319
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:18,920
 Jalopy's back in action.

320
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,640
 It's back to its old, broken down self can barely get us around, but we love it.

321
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,880
 We love the Jason Jalopy and we are driving down the Ortega Highway.

322
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,120
 And in front of us, we see a bicycle riding.

323
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,080
 But not just any bicycle, a ghost bicycle, which has to be the most least threatening

324
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,880
 ghost vehicle possible.

325
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,080
 Ghost bicycle, ghost tricycle?

326
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,520
 Creepy.

327
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,760
 Ghost car?

328
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
 Terrifying.

329
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,640
 Even a ghost dirgeable would seem almost like an alien life form, but a ghost bicycle

330
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,840
 is ridiculous.

331
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,800
 There's nothing threatening about it at all.

332
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,200
 There's nothing even threatening about someone on a bicycle.

333
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,440
 They could have a machine gun and you're going to be like, "What are you going to do?

334
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
 You can't shoot me.

335
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,320
 You need both hands."

336
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,640
 But this bicyclist is riding in front of us.

337
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,760
 Now it's not just that.

338
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,960
 I push you out of the car and you go, "Why?"

339
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,880
 And I'm like, "Because you chose a number.

340
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,520
 Meet your fate."

341
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,520
 And now it's just you and the bicyclist in the middle of the road.

342
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,320
 And I'm just sitting safely in the newly repaired Jason Jalopy.

343
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,300
 Covered in Dead Rabbit Radio merch, Dead Rabbit Radio seat covers, Dead Rabbit Radio steering

344
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,760
 wheel column, Dead Rabbit Radio spinning rims, little Dead Rabbit logo spinning around.

345
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,480
 And you're out there in the middle of this hot summer heat with you and this ghost bicyclist.

346
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,960
 So how does he attack you?

347
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,200
 He doesn't drown you with blood.

348
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,480
 He doesn't choke you with an imaginary rope.

349
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,200
 He doesn't skin you.

350
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,680
 He takes his head off and rolls it across the ground.

351
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,640
 And as it's rolling towards you, the head goes, "If you pick number one, he bowls you

352
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
 over."

353
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
 That's it.

354
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,760
 Actually, you don't die from this one.

355
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,720
 This one, it just bowls you over.

356
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,760
 But this story has some quotes, has some great quotes.

357
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,920
 Here's a couple quotes from this story of people who actually saw this fictional thing

358
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,360
 that the author made up.

359
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,320
 The bizarre thing is that he uses his own head to bowl his victims over.

360
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
 Don't know how they verify that.

361
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
 Who are the victims?

362
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
 When did this happen?

363
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,840
 Has anyone ever seen this before?

364
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,240
 One witness said that he couldn't believe his eyes when he saw a bicycle helmet skating

365
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,680
 along the ground.

366
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,720
 If a bicycle helmet sliding across the ground makes you rub your eyes and go, "What?

367
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,000
 You live in a cave."

368
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,240
 That is such a mundane thing.

369
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,800
 Now, it's not something that you want to see, because it usually means that someone lost

370
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
 their helmet, but then you just pick it up and a guy goes, "Oh, that's where my helmet

371
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
 went."

372
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:51,080
 It's not unlikely or illogical to see a bicycle helmet moving across the ground.

373
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
 Odd?

374
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
 Maybe.

375
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,960
 But not, I couldn't believe my eyes.

376
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,800
 I'm surprised they didn't say, "I almost went up to Jesus when I saw the bicycle helmet

377
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,040
 fall across the ground."

378
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,760
 It's not shocking.

379
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,680
 It's not shocking at all.

380
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,160
 And apparently, this guy knocks you over.

381
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
 That's it.

382
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
 He doesn't kill you.

383
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,640
 He puts his head back on and gets back on his bicycle and walks away.

384
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,400
 Rides away, actually, unless he's pushing his bike uphill.

385
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,280
 Tell me again, you have a ghost bicycle.

386
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,620
 What is the least?

387
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,960
 You have ghosts who look like wraiths.

388
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,080
 They're like flying around with chains and rags.

389
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,000
 You have ghosts in Elizabethian clothing.

390
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,840
 You have slave ghosts in like ragged slave clothes.

391
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,000
 A ghost in biker shorts and a super tight t-shirt that has a racing logo on it?

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,560
 That's not a scary ghost.

393
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,920
 There's no way you can make that ghost scary.

394
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,000
 At all.

395
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,200
 A ghost on a bicycle.

396
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,480
 But we're not done with our tour.

397
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,880
 We're going to the Whaley House.

398
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,680
 We're going to San Diego.

399
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,720
 The Whaley House is an abandoned house.

400
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,920
 But you can break into it.

401
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
 Like any house, you can break into any house.

402
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,480
 The moon is quarter full, which actually I think is still a crescent.

403
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,080
 But anyways, you break into the Whaley House.

404
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,680
 You're walking around with your flashlight.

405
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,880
 Moving through the darkness.

406
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 Shining around.

407
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,960
 Flashlights don't make noise.

408
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,440
 Yours does.

409
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,040
 You smell the smell of burning wood.

410
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
 Sandalwood.

411
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
 It smells quite good, actually.

412
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,160
 You're like, "I need to pick up some incense on the way home."

413
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,920
 And then it turns to the smell of a woman's perfume.

414
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,080
 And right when your nose starts to get used to this new pleasant smell, you hear a baby

415
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
 crying.

416
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
 Whaaaaa.

417
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
 Whaaaaa.

418
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,560
 Now, you know the story of the Whaley House.

419
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,240
 At least, this fictional version of you does before you went into the house.

420
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,160
 You know that it's haunted by two ghosts.

421
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,880
 A baby, a little baby ghost, which is that terrifying.

422
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,960
 A baby ghost on a bicycle and bicycle shorts.

423
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,200
 That's scary.

424
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,160
 A baby ghost.

425
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:04,120
 And then the baby ghost's older sister, Violet, who tragically killed herself.

426
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:10,720
 And according to this website, is "still angry at the world, including the living."

427
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,640
 And what this woman does is as you're moving through the darkness of the house, looking

428
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
 for the crying baby.

429
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,320
 Because you don't know if it's real or not.

430
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,800
 Maybe the one time you go is the time a real baby shows up.

431
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,640
 It just happens to be, Parks' bike outside goes inside and gets lost.

432
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,040
 You're moving through the darkness of the house.

433
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,120
 And Violet is moving around the shadows behind you.

434
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,320
 You see, there is no baby.

435
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,960
 There is no baby ghost.

436
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,080
 Just Violet in the house.

437
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,040
 And she mimics the sound of the baby, the one sound that tugs at everyone's heartstrings.

438
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,240
 Or the one sound they hate the most.

439
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,800
 They'll do anything to stop the sound of a crying baby.

440
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,160
 Either one works.

441
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,840
 So as you're moving through the house looking for this baby, she's stalking you.

442
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:02,880
 And right before her icy hands pull you into her dark world, never to escape.

443
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:12,200
 You hear her whisper in your ear, "If you picked number three, your mind forever."

444
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,720
 Now we go to Stockton.

445
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,720
 And in Stockton is a place called Eight Mile Road.

446
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,400
 You're driving down Eight Mile Road and you see a woman dressed in all white standing

447
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,840
 on the side of the road.

448
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,080
 It's a full moon now.

449
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,840
 And she's completely lit up by the moon.

450
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,200
 And you know in your heart of hearts that this is one of the famed women in white.

451
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,800
 Maybe La Lorna, maybe she's traveling from the cemetery, but there's hundreds of stories

452
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,040
 about women in all white walking around the sides of roads.

453
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,200
 Either brides who got killed in accidents or just vengeful spirit or a phantom hitchhiker.

454
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,200
 They almost are always wearing white in these legends.

455
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,280
 And you see one and you think, "That's it.

456
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,640
 I'm a ghost hunter.

457
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,360
 I'm seeing a real life apparition.

458
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,920
 I want to meet this woman in white."

459
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
 Maybe it'll be a love connection.

460
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,440
 Maybe I'll turn that white dress a little, you know, maybe I'll do a little, I don't

461
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,320
 know what innuendo I'm going for.

462
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,920
 Maybe you'll bang the ghost and she won't be able to wear white at her wedding.

463
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,760
 It's what I'm trying to say in my bizarre Ronnie Dingerfield impression.

464
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,520
 So it was like more of a yogi bear.

465
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,240
 But anyways, "Hey boo boo, I'm going to take this woman's virginity."

466
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,800
 So you pull over to meet this woman in white.

467
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 Pop out with your camera.

468
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,240
 You're going to prove ghosts exist.

469
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,840
 Backpacker universe would never steer you wrong.

470
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,720
 This place is really haunted.

471
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
 You jump out of your car.

472
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,840
 And as you run up to the woman to take her photos, you notice something.

473
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,720
 She's laughing.

474
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,480
 But not just laughing.

475
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,760
 She's laughing at you.

476
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,200
 And that's when you see coming out of the bushes alongside of the road.

477
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,520
 Figures crawling on the ground like worms.

478
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,320
 They're just kind of pulling themselves along the ground.

479
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:09,240
 There's a ton of them. Dozens of people scooting around on their shoulders.

480
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
 Can't move their arms.

481
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,800
 Just kind of inching across the desert floor.

482
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 I don't know if it's in the desert.

483
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,200
 It's in Stockton, actually.

484
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,760
 They're inching across this barren road towards you.

485
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,960
 And oddly enough, you recognize these people as people who had gone missing on this same

486
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
 road.

487
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,800
 Fellow ghost hunters even.

488
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,600
 Looking up at you.

489
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,240
 Employing you to run, but they can't say anything.

490
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,680
 They can just inch across the dirt towards you.

491
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,840
 And that's when you feel a cold hand reach into your back.

492
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:49,320
 And with one swift tug, pull out your entire spinal cord, sub-zero style.

493
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,040
 And as you fall to the ground, completely immobile, except for the ability to kind of

494
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,040
 move your shoulders an inch along the ground like all the victims before them, you hear

495
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:06,600
 a voice go, "If you picked number five, it takes a big bite out of your spinal column.

496
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,480
 You're delicious."

497
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,240
 Now I want you to imagine that you've picked your numbers.

498
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,640
 You've died your ways that you died.

499
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,880
 I want you to imagine you're an editor for a website called Pack Packerverse.

500
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,080
 No matter what number you picked, you're an editor for this website.

501
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,080
 And a journalist who writes for you, you say, "Hey, I got an assignment for you."

502
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,680
 I just want you to go online, do some research, find the 10 most haunted places in California.

503
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,200
 We'll throw it on Winchester Mystery House, a couple other stuff, famous stuff, famous

504
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
 stuff.

505
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
 You can do the Procedio, whatever.

506
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,440
 Just go get me the 10 most haunted places in California.

507
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,520
 Bring me the article.

508
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,080
 You have until noon tomorrow, Parker.

509
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
 Get on it.

510
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,600
 And then you go about doing your business.

511
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,720
 And then the next day, a journalist brings to you an article and you're like, "10 most

512
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,520
 haunted places in California that'll make you scream.

513
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,280
 This is gold, Parker."

514
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,720
 And then you read those stories.

515
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,680
 100% made up.

516
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,520
 Like I started off with, I started off talking about the first, the Morgan Earp thing.

517
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,640
 I really just kind of shoot that one down.

518
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,880
 There is no place on earth where ghosts eat your spines or throw their heads at you.

519
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,320
 I've never heard of that stuff before.

520
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,920
 And this stuff, again, there's 10 of them.

521
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,080
 I left out five of them because it was just stuff like, you walk through a cemetery and

522
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,400
 a bunch of maggots show up.

523
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,000
 Of course, it's a cemetery.

524
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,160
 I'll give them credit for that one just because that's fairly logical.

525
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,600
 But one of them was in Sacramento, about the old tunnels under Sacramento.

526
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,920
 The old tunnels in Sacramento are haunted.

527
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:48,080
 There are sightings of a ghost in the buildings that were built over the tunnels.

528
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
 That's legit.

529
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,280
 Put that in your list.

530
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,680
 They said if you go under those tunnels of Sacramento, a bunch of rats show up and then

531
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:02,080
 a giant morphine dude like T2 comes out of the ground and will kill you.

532
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,400
 And it states only one person's ever left the tunnels alive.

533
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
 That's not true.

534
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 That's not true at all.

535
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,440
 People go down there all the time.

536
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,800
 That's where all the junkies live.

537
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,560
 I'll say this, I wouldn't recommend going down there because the junkies may kill you,

538
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,600
 but people go down there.

539
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,240
 100% fictional.

540
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,160
 100% fake.

541
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,800
 I'm beside myself when I was reading this article.

542
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:33,160
 Now listen, I don't want to go too much on like, you don't have to take this stuff seriously,

543
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
 but you don't have to make stuff up.

544
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,800
 I would have loved to have been sitting there as this author turned in this article.

545
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,160
 Because it's either this guy that believes these things are true or it's 100% made up.

546
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:51,400
 And if it's 100% made up, he convinced someone it was true, which I think is absolutely hilarious.

547
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,600
 I think we've gotten to a point where you can basically say anything that involves ghosts

548
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,480
 or demons or something and someone will believe it.

549
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,840
 Rip in someone's spine out.

550
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,640
 Can you imagine living in a world where that happened?

551
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,960
 Can you imagine the news report?

552
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,200
 Can you imagine watching the news and being like, there's another death on 8 Mile Road

553
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
 today.

554
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,920
 We don't know what happened to him, but his spine appears to be eaten out.

555
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,000
 But the funny thing is, is like, part of me wants to live in that world.

556
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,600
 Like, no, I don't want to get my spine eaten out.

557
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,840
 And I will say the one of the Waley House actually was a creepy short ghost story.

558
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,400
 They could have said 10 creepy made up stories we made.

559
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,600
 But it's this weird thing because on the one hand I read this and I go, this is completely

560
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
 fictional.

561
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
 I can't believe this.

562
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,320
 This seems like it should be in the onion making fun of ghost hunters.

563
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,880
 This stuff's totally made up.

564
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,160
 Rolling heads after people.

565
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,160
 Come on.

566
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,160
 That's totally fake.

567
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,680
 But on the other hand I'm thinking, wouldn't it be cool?

568
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:52,600
 Wouldn't it be awesome if there was that level of a threat, that level of a paranormal threat

569
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
 out there.

570
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
 And that's why I also wanted to highlight this.

571
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,920
 One I thought it was funny that people actually could put this and people believe this.

572
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,680
 I'm sure there are a lot of people who've read this website uncritically and go, oh,

573
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,640
 better not go to the Waley House.

574
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,920
 Someone might imitate a baby and pull me in another dimension.

575
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,800
 But like I said at the beginning, I want you to imagine living in a world like this.

576
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,920
 Could you imagine living in a world where the Bermuda Triangle was real and you knew

577
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,520
 if you flew across it there was a chance you would go back in time.

578
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,840
 Or that if you went out to this graveyard La Lorna would vomit blood down your mouth.

579
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,080
 It's funny because you want it to be true.

580
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,760
 You want this stuff to be true.

581
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,280
 That's what I find so fascinating about this stuff.

582
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,400
 This is the world that I want.

583
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,680
 That doesn't mean it's cool to write about.

584
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,480
 That doesn't mean that you should lie to people.

585
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,560
 But this is the world I think we all want to live in.

586
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,240
 The world where conspiracies are real.

587
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,860
 The world where ghosts are everywhere and they can hurt you.

588
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,120
 You can communicate with them.

589
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,080
 You can make deals with the devil.

590
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,560
 You can make deals with the angels.

591
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:08,640
 You can experience the reality that is above reality.

592
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:15,480
 A world where the paranormal posed a real threat would be a terrifying world.

593
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,640
 It would be an exciting world.

594
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,880
 It would be a world where everything was questioned and nothing was taken for granted.

595
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,120
 When your child tells you there's a monster under your bed, you would call the police.

596
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,400
 Life in that world to paraphrase a great man would be terrifying, brutal and short.

597
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:58,920
 But it would be one hell of a ride.
