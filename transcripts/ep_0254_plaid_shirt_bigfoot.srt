1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
 A young man is given a warning from aliens, and it's time to spread the message by any means necessary.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,880
 And then we take a look at an unusual set of stones that are being found throughout Europe,

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,760
 warning of a possible catastrophe.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,320
 And finally, we take another look at the legendary Bigfoot.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
 But we're not looking at a Bigfoot, there's big ol' smelly hairy guy walking around in the woods.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,200
 No, no, no.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,760
 We're looking at the Bigfoot, the big ol' smelly guy walking around in the woods.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,040
 Wearing clothes.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:43,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,240
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,200
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so we're gonna jump right into it.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,840
 But on your jumping shoes and follow me down the jumping place.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,800
 And now it didn't really work, but anyways, there is a jumping place and we both jump into it.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,000
 And we land in the year 2014.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,920
 And there we need a man named David Oxenreiter.

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,320
 Now regardless of whatever else happens over the course of this story that's alleged,

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,160
 this is an ongoing criminal trial.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,000
 Alleged, alleged.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
 I have to keep saying that.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,720
 Well, I won't keep saying it, but there you go.

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,040
 Despite what happens with this guy, you gotta give him credit for having the last name of Oxenreiter.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
 That's a pretty dope name.

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,760
 That's a pretty dope name.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,080
 Definitely sounds like a Lord of the Rings character.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
 I guess they wouldn't call him Oxes.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
 They'd call him something cooler over there, but Oxenreiter, it reminds me of like Oakenshield.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,520
 It reminds me of something.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,720
 You know, I've always had my own personal conspiracy theory.

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
 Women marry men.

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
 So funny.

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
 Because the other day I was saying not only 10% of my audience is women.

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,080
 I was telling Lana that and she goes, "That's statistically impossible."

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,120
 I was like, "Yeah, I know.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,120
 There's towns in Alaska that have a higher percentage of women than who listen to this show."

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,720
 And she goes, "Do you say anything bad about women?"

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,680
 And I stood there and thought for a second and I was like, "No, not really."

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,360
 That being said, I have my own personal conspiracy theory about this.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,960
 I think women choose people with good last names.

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,680
 And you may go, "That's not a super controversial conspiracy theory."

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,400
 I mean, and maybe it isn't, but I think that a woman can meet the man of her dreams,

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,600
 but if his last name is Fartknocker, she's not going to marry that.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,000
 This dude's not getting married.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
 This guy's not getting married anytime soon, allegedly,

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,880
 which is unfortunate that there won't be more oxen riders in the gene pool.

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,080
 But yeah, I wonder if women actually are like, "I love you, honey, but your last name sucks."

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,760
 It literally sucks and I'm not going to be known as a Sarah sucks for the rest of my life.

50
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,200
 So anyways, back to the point of the story.

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
 David oxen rider in 2014.

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,920
 Aliens visit him.

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,320
 And the aliens deliver this message to him.

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,880
 They say, "David oxen rider."

55
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,400
 Alien noises in the background.

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,880
 "David, humanity is going to kill themselves.

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,400
 They have to start being good people."

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,680
 And he's like, "Well, how am I supposed to tell people that?

59
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,960
 The aliens are like, "Silence!

60
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,760
 You've been chosen as a messenger.

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,320
 You have to figure out a way to spread our message."

62
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,160
 And David goes, "Well, what if I can't tell people to start being nice to each other?

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,360
 What if I can't tell people to stop heading down this destructive path?"

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,320
 And the alien goes, "Simple, Mr. Oxen Rider, we will destroy you with a quote,

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
 nuclear laser beam."

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,520
 Unquote.

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,280
 David goes, "That's weird.

68
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
 Why don't you quote unquote your own phrase?"

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
 Aliens like, "Silence!

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,080
 Go tell people we're going to blow them up with the nuclear laser beam unless they start

71
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,960
 being good to each other."

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,120
 And they drop them back up.

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,520
 Now the details to his actual visitation are pretty limited right now.

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,880
 We're not getting a lot of information of like where the aliens abducted him or if he

75
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,400
 was on their ship or if he was like just sitting in a Starbucks and they walked in and just sat

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,240
 down at a table and they had this conversation while they were waiting for their lattes.

77
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,320
 Anyways, he goes around telling people that the aliens told him that if we don't start

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,200
 being excellent to each other, they are going to destroy us and people start telling him he's crazy.

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,680
 And he goes, allegedly, "You think I'm crazy?

80
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,920
 I'll show you who's crazy.

81
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,800
 Not me.

82
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,480
 You're crazy for being evil.

83
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,960
 I'm trying to save you from the aliens."

84
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,280
 And everyone's just like, "Bro, calm down."

85
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
 He's like, "You want me to calm down?

86
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,400
 I'll show you calm down."

87
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
 And they're like, "Just start leaving at that point."

88
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
 Writing their oxen away from him.

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,760
 He's like, "No, that's my name sake.

90
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,440
 You want me to show you oxen writing?

91
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,160
 I'll show you."

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,960
 Anyways, so David fast forward to June 23rd, 2019.

93
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,160
 Five years later, from that first story, but only a couple weeks previous to today,

94
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,720
 we're in the town of Myers Town, Pennsylvania, which isn't where he's from.

95
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
 He traveled to Myers Town, Pennsylvania to do this, allegedly.

96
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
 And that's the last time I'm going to say allegedly.

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,320
 The rest of the stuff is all a legend.

98
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
 He's 29 years old.

99
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,480
 He goes to the Byers House Hotel, which is like a hotel and a restaurant.

100
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,760
 It was kind of complicated.

101
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,360
 I don't know why you would name a hotel a house, but anyways, Byers House Hotel in

102
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,640
 Myers Town, Pennsylvania.

103
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,200
 David Oxen Rider gets a room and he goes to the hotel.

104
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,760
 At some point, he walks up to the hotel manager.

105
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,920
 He's having a casual conversation with this hotel manager and he says,

106
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,320
 "Hey, I really like this place.

107
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,800
 It's great.

108
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,760
 I really love the decor.

109
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,200
 There's lots of room for my ox."

110
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,360
 He points out and there's nothing out there.

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,040
 Hotel manager's like, "Oh, this guy's a little weird."

112
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,360
 And David keeps talking to the hotel manager and he's like, "Oh, you know,

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
 I didn't notice something, but there's a bomb in my room."

114
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,000
 "Oh, but I shouldn't have brought it up because I built the bomb."

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,600
 So it wasn't there from the previous person.

116
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
 And then I was wondering if I could get some more of those little tiny soaps.

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,240
 I actually collect those from hotels.

118
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,440
 I collect those little tiny soap.

119
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,680
 And the hotel manager's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.

120
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,520
 Did you say there was a bomb in your room that you built a bomb?"

121
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,280
 And David goes, "Yeah.

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,040
 Yeah, is that a problem?

123
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,400
 I'm like, I need it.

124
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,160
 I need the bomb to warn people that aliens are going to come and blow us up with a laser beam."

125
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
 Now the hotel manager, and there are certain people who have jobs

126
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,880
 and their main concern is that job.

127
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,040
 Like, that's all they care about.

128
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,640
 So this hotel manager looks at him and says, "Get the bomb out of the building."

129
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,080
 Like, he's not immediately like, "Oh, okay, sir."

130
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
 Turns around and calls the cops.

131
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,520
 He's not immediately like running from the building.

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,120
 His first concern is the management of the hotel.

133
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,960
 That is why he's a hotel manager.

134
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,200
 His first thing is, "Please get the bomb out of the building.

135
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,720
 Not defuse it.

136
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
 Not turn yourself in.

137
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
 Get it out of my building."

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,400
 I imagine him like an uptight hotel manager from like the sweet life of Zack and Cody.

139
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,680
 So anyways, he does.

140
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
 David's like, "Oh, oh yeah, I'll take it.

141
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,160
 Yeah, that's cool, man."

142
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
 I didn't see a no bomb sign outside of your hotel.

143
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,960
 I didn't smoke.

144
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,680
 The hotel manager's like, "Just get it out of here."

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,600
 And there's a bunch of twins running around on skateboards on third floor.

146
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,160
 So be careful.

147
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,680
 They'll probably knock the bomb out of your hand.

148
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,920
 So David goes upstairs and he navigates Zack and Cody.

149
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,040
 And he gets the bomb and he walks through the lobby.

150
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,160
 The hotel manager's watching this guy do this with his homemade bomb.

151
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
 He goes and he just goes outside and sets it next to a dumpster outside the hotel.

152
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,200
 And then walks back into the hotel.

153
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,160
 He's like, "Hey."

154
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
 Kind of like waves to the hotel manager like, "It's cool, man.

155
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,520
 It's cool.

156
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,040
 You should get a no bomb sign out there.

157
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,920
 Sorry, through the confusion."

158
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,640
 He goes upstairs.

159
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,920
 The hotel manager at this point is like, "Okay.

160
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,280
 I have managed that part of the problem.

161
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,480
 Now it's time to call the cops."

162
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,920
 So he calls the cops and the cops show up and they kind of split up.

163
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,120
 Some of them go to the dumpster.

164
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
 They, it's a real active bomb.

165
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,880
 Wasn't a dud.

166
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,400
 And they start disarming it.

167
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
 And the other cops go into the hotel and arrest David Oxtonrider.

168
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,160
 And they ask, "Is that your bomb out there?"

169
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,120
 He's like, "Oh, yeah.

170
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,400
 You're not supposed to put bombs out there.

171
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,000
 I didn't see a no bomb sign by the dumpster."

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,960
 I thought, "Cops are like, "Okay, sir, turn around."

173
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,880
 And they ask him over the course of interrogation, "Why did you build the bomb?"

174
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,960
 And he goes, "Oh, I'm so glad you asked.

175
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,240
 I'm so glad you asked."

176
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,280
 Aliens are going to blow us up with a nuclear laser beam, blah, blah, blah.

177
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,320
 So he, he's been arrested now.

178
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,560
 And he's being charged with multiple crimes.

179
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,480
 But the most serious one is construction of a weapon of mass destruction.

180
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,040
 That alone in the state of Pennsylvania is a first degree felony.

181
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,480
 So he's facing just on that charge 10 to 20 years in prison for building a bomb.

182
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,800
 Because aliens, well, technically to be fair, the aliens didn't tell him to build a bomb.

183
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,560
 You imagine those aliens are just like, "Oh my God, we have to find another messenger."

184
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
 Could it be you?

185
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,000
 Is there a point at you?

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 There's a point directly at you, right at the camera.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
 Could you be the next one the aliens are going to visit to give you a stupid plan?

188
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,440
 I think the story is interesting for a couple of reasons.

189
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,200
 One involves aliens and bombs.

190
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
 I mean, that's about as interesting as things can get.

191
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,680
 But two, imagine if aliens came down to you right now.

192
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,240
 They did point directly at you and you're like, "Me?"

193
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,880
 They're like, "Yes."

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,440
 And they told you to spread this message that you're the message giver.

195
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,160
 You're the messenger.

196
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
 That's the word I'm looking for.

197
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,920
 That you have to warn the world that if they don't start being nice, they're going to get destroyed.

198
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,480
 You would feel completely helpless unless you were a famous celebrity, unless you were Gordon Ramsay

199
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
 or Tom Hanks or something like that.

200
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,800
 You would feel quite helpless.

201
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,520
 Because how are you going to let 7 billion plus people know the aliens' message?

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,320
 In an odd way, he was successful because we know of this now.

203
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,800
 So his message did get out.

204
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,160
 He might be a little self-satisfied that he got it across.

205
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,280
 But no one was hurt over the course of the story except for him.

206
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,400
 And it was most likely a delusion.

207
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,680
 Most likely aliens didn't visit him and give him this warning.

208
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,120
 But if they did and you had a set amount of time to tell the story, he didn't.

209
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,880
 It took him five years to even build the bomb.

210
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,480
 But if aliens had come to you and say, "You have to change the course of humanity,"

211
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,760
 how would you go about it?

212
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,880
 How would you go about it?

213
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,720
 I think it was kind of messed up for the aliens to put him in that position in the first place.

214
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,680
 But now, if he's found guilty of these charges, he's facing 10 years minimum in prison because of it.

215
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,080
 So, nice job, alien overlords.

216
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,400
 You got your messenger thrown in prison.

217
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,760
 Well, I guess it could be worse.

218
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,880
 The last time someone sent a messenger to planet, he got crucified.

219
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,240
 So, I guess the aliens are a bit better off than the last guy who tried to save humanity.

220
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,760
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

221
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,280
 Now, our next story is an interesting one.

222
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,600
 It's kind of a short one, but I find it pretty fascinating.

223
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,040
 What's happening is in Central Europe and all these countries in Central Europe,

224
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,200
 you're seeing them in Germany, you're seeing them in Czechia, Čestkija.

225
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,560
 It's not Čekosovakija.

226
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,200
 It might have been like they broke in half because that's only half the name, but Čekčija.

227
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
 And it follows the LB River, and I know I can already hear the people typing that I'm mispronouncing

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 LB River, but anyways, the LB River running through Central Europe, they're starting to find these

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
 stones, these big, giant stones.

230
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,120
 Now, what's happening, it's not like they're just stumbling across these 500-year-old stones

231
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,520
 that are like magically appearing because these things were previously underwater.

232
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,760
 But as the water level has been dropping in Central Europe, these stones are starting to

233
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,040
 become visible.

234
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,520
 One of them says, "If you see me, weep."

235
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,720
 People are like, "That's pretty ominous.

236
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,120
 I'm just out on a fun Sunday stroll on the beach with my family, and I see this rock.

237
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,480
 If you see me, weep."

238
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,240
 There's another one that says, "If you will see this stone, so you will weep."

239
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
 So shallow the water was in the year 1417.

240
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,880
 And another one, "We cried, we cry,

241
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,200
 and you will cry."

242
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
 Dun dun dun!

243
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
 And what happened to this?

244
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,480
 I'm not making fun of these people suffering, but that's a little edgelord, really.

245
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,040
 Who wrote this?

246
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,720
 Like, is this the equivalent of medieval hot topic, emo teens?

247
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,920
 They're like, "Yes, Father, I will water the crops, but then I'm going out to the river to write my

248
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,040
 poetry on rocks."

249
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,360
 And that rhymed too, and the Father's like, "Just go do something, you loser!"

250
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,280
 It wasn't "emo teen," medieval emo teens writing these, great band name, but it was...

251
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,400
 Back when the river was really, really low, people were inscribing on...

252
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,160
 But basically, they were water markers, because when the water was that low before,

253
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,040
 they're having problems with watering their crops and fishing and all sorts of stuff.

254
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,640
 Boats were constantly running around.

255
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,480
 I don't know if that last part's true, but the fact is there was less water in the river

256
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,840
 that it caused hardship for all the communities along the river.

257
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,400
 So they basically did that, like, when the water was that low, they carved in this rock,

258
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,640
 and with the hope that they would eventually be covered up and society would return to normal.

259
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,400
 And it did.

260
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,160
 But as the water levels have dropped again, these rocks, they're known as hunger stones,

261
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,520
 are beginning to become visible again throughout Central Europe.

262
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,760
 But never one to pass up a good...

263
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,120
 What's the saying?

264
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
 Never let a good crisis go to waste?

265
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
 Here's one of these hunger stones.

266
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,960
 This was my favorite one.

267
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,080
 The "we cried, we cry, and you will cry" is pretty dope.

268
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,600
 That should be like a movie tagline.

269
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,520
 But this one I love.

270
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,040
 There's a rock amid all these other hunger stones spread throughout Europe.

271
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,480
 There's this one rock that says this.

272
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,640
 Don't cry, girl.

273
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,360
 Don't fret.

274
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,800
 When it's dry, just spray your field wet.

275
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,280
 And people are like, "What?"

276
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:39,120
 Now, from years, from watching porkies, watching...

277
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,800
 Watching risque stuff, Ronnie Dangerfield movies,

278
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,760
 there's something oddly sexual about that one.

279
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,480
 It could just be the fact that the word "wet" isn't it?

280
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
 And my mind is that broken.

281
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,840
 But this particular rock isn't a sexual joke.

282
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,200
 It's not like I get no respect.

283
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,440
 The water level's so low, can't catch fish,

284
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,280
 but my wife can still catch gonorrhea.

285
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,440
 Oh!

286
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,640
 What a...

287
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,600
 What a...

288
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,000
 World!

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
 Anyways.

290
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,400
 Anyways.

291
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,680
 I don't like it just because it reminds me of those jokes.

292
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,520
 I like this stone because they know,

293
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,280
 they have an idea of who wrote this one.

294
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,480
 A dude most likely made that one who was actually like,

295
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
 ran a pump company.

296
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,400
 And he was trying to sell more water pumps.

297
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
 That's the theory behind that one.

298
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,920
 That one was some guy had manufactured a plumbing set or something

299
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
 that could pipe water in from the river to your farm.

300
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,000
 And that he made that saying, "Ah, don't worry about it.

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,800
 Just spray it.

302
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,080
 Spray it at Uncle Luz.

303
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,440
 Crazy spray and pour him.

304
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,520
 Just a picture of a hot chick with a wet t-shirt."

305
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
 What if they had a wet t-shirt contest back then?

306
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,760
 They have like the blouses, right?

307
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,920
 They all wore those white black things.

308
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,880
 They had more important things to worry about.

309
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
 Their economy was dying.

310
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,800
 But you figure even when,

311
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,480
 that would make you even more likely you want to see a girl totally wet.

312
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,320
 Because you don't see water every day now.

313
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,280
 The river's lower.

314
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,680
 So you would want water like,

315
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,360
 I guess again you wouldn't waste it.

316
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,680
 But you can invite all the women to your farm

317
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,960
 and throw water on them.

318
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,480
 Win-win.

319
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,280
 The water that doesn't go on their clothes lands in the crops.

320
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,040
 That they're sanding and kicking all your seeds over.

321
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,920
 You get a sexy, sexy showcase and your crops get watered.

322
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,360
 And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I only have 10% female listenership.

323
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story of the episode.

324
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,080
 Now this story was sent to us by our resident Bigfoot expert.

325
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,840
 The man who loves Bigfoot even more than Bigfoot's mama loves him.

326
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
 Him being the Bigfoot.

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,880
 Not this guy.

328
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,600
 Bennett.

329
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,000
 Bennett.

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,320
 Now you'll remember Bennett actually recommended a bunch of Bigfoot stories last season.

331
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,640
 And he emailed me again and he goes,

332
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,680
 "Hey man, I don't know why I emailed you all those Bigfoot stories.

333
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,480
 Because I don't really like Bigfoot that much."

334
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
 But I just ran into all of them at the same time.

335
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 You don't have to lie to us Bennett.

336
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
 Everyone has a passion in life.

337
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,280
 I have a passion for medieval wet t-shirt contests.

338
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,440
 You have a passion for Bigfoot.

339
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,360
 So just be you Bennett.

340
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,640
 But no, joking, joking.

341
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,720
 He does, he did recommend this other Bigfoot story

342
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,120
 and I always appreciate these recommendations.

343
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,400
 This is an interesting one.

344
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,960
 We know about Bigfoot's for the most part.

345
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,920
 They're probably the most well-known cryptid out there.

346
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,440
 Vampires, werewolves probably above it.

347
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,560
 So technically they're not, but they're in the top five biggest cryptids of all time.

348
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,720
 You'd have werewolves, vampires, Bigfoot's.

349
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,680
 Aliens, I think kind of counts as a cryptid.

350
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,000
 And then, I don't know, something else, something else.

351
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,480
 So we got the top four, top four big cryptids out there

352
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,520
 and Bigfoot's one of them.

353
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,040
 So we know who Bigfoot is.

354
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,800
 We don't need a huge introduction to him.

355
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,880
 But there's a particular subset of Bigfoot

356
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,240
 that has people really questioning the origins of the phenomenon.

357
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,600
 Has me questioning the origins of the phenomenon, definitely.

358
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 Let's go to Northwestern America.

359
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,280
 My area, where I live.

360
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,040
 But we're going way, way, way back in time.

361
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,040
 And the natives had stories of a creature up here known as the Nakani,

362
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,640
 which was by all accounts a Bigfoot-esque creature.

363
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,120
 Tall, covered with hair.

364
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,320
 Red or yellow eyes, those are very noticeable.

365
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,040
 A black face, like a, well you guys know what the words black in face mean,

366
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,640
 but he had a black face, had red or yellow eyes.

367
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,240
 Long arms, clawed hands.

368
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,360
 Those are pretty generic descriptors of a Bigfoot-type creature.

369
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,520
 High-pitched whistle or loud noise when it's like yelling

370
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,920
 makes these loud noises that kind of echo through the forest.

371
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,080
 Smells disgusting, very, very common.

372
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,280
 They can hypnotize you and kidnap women and children.

373
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,640
 Those are all, if I didn't tell you that was something called the Nakani,

374
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,680
 you would just say that's a Bigfoot that I'm talking about.

375
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,240
 But the interesting thing about the Nakani, and it is a Bigfoot,

376
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,160
 that is a Bigfoot, it's just a regional version of it,

377
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,400
 an older version before the name Bigfoot showed up.

378
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,360
 But the reason why I wanted to highlight this particular name to one

379
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,520
 is because the natives had these stories that,

380
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,840
 sure he does all the stuff a typical Bigfoot does,

381
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,480
 but this one doesn't leave Bigfoot prints when it walks.

382
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,120
 It leaves Big Shoe prints.

383
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,520
 See the Nakani is known for wearing footwear.

384
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,840
 Very fashionable.

385
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,520
 War scarves a lot of times.

386
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,320
 War moose skin, they'd kill moose,

387
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,680
 and skin them, drape them over their shoulders.

388
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,400
 They usually also wielded clubs or threw rocks as weapons.

389
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,920
 So you could say it was basically,

390
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,760
 Bigfoot's are kind of seen as like a big old dumb type of predator

391
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,040
 that can kind of turn invisible.

392
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,280
 Maybe they're kind of thoughtful like herring the hindersons,

393
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,840
 but if you gave them a fork and put them near an outlet,

394
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,880
 they're going to kill themselves.

395
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,560
 Like they're kind of stupid.

396
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,760
 They're like monkey dumb.

397
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,000
 These ones were far more civilized.

398
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,840
 And we've seen stories of civilized Bigfoot type creatures around the world.

399
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,200
 Bigfoot's kind of the dummy.

400
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,080
 Bigfoot's kind of the inbred cousin of the Bigfoot world.

401
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
 But to its credit, it hasn't been caught.

402
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,960
 So it's either a little bit smarter than I'm giving it credit for,

403
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,920
 or it doesn't exist at all.

404
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,080
 But anyway, so let's go back to this.

405
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,280
 So they had in the Native Americans up in the Northwest,

406
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,240
 you'd see these stories of the Nakani.

407
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,120
 So it was a Bigfoot creature, but it also wore clothes.

408
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,160
 And throughout the 1960s and 70s,

409
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,320
 you would occasionally hear stories of people running into a police station.

410
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,960
 Be like, oh my God, officer, you won't believe what just happened.

411
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,720
 Me and my girlfriend were up in the woods,

412
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,040
 and he's like, police officer's like, tell me more.

413
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,720
 And he's like, no, no, no, nothing sexy happened.

414
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,840
 But anyways, anyways, we were running.

415
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,000
 We were like up there doing wood stuff up in the woods.

416
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,520
 And the officer's like, tell me more.

417
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,280
 He's like, just listen to my story, dammit.

418
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
 We're up in the woods.

419
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,920
 We're just running around.

420
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,680
 And this creature came out of the woods,

421
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,000
 and it was wearing a plaid shirt and like ripped jeans.

422
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,200
 And the officer's like, that's stupid.

423
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,280
 We all know that Bigfoot doesn't wear clothes.

424
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,480
 But you would see these stories pop up from time to time in the 1960s and 1970s,

425
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,480
 which is interesting because that's when the Bigfoot myth was really first

426
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,720
 catching the consciousness of America.

427
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,560
 And one thing I've learned from doing the show,

428
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,640
 or just researching this stuff in general,

429
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,120
 if you want the really interesting stories of cryptids and alien encounters,

430
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,120
 the farther you look back, the weirder they are.

431
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,240
 Because nowadays, people know what a Bigfoot is and how it acts for the most part.

432
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,680
 So if someone says I walked into the woods and I didn't know,

433
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,840
 and I heard a noise behind me and I turned and I saw like this giant black shadow moving behind me,

434
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:43,360
 growling at me and I took a step back and heard a branch break and I smelled the worst smell ever.

435
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,040
 And then it went off in another direction.

436
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,120
 A Bigfoot researcher or people who are like into the phenomenon will be like,

437
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,480
 "That was a Bigfoot."

438
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,320
 "That was a Bigfoot because that confirms to everything we know about Bigfoot."

439
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
 But if that same person said I was sitting there,

440
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,800
 they saw this big shadow and then it came around the corner and it was wearing a

441
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,040
 flannel shirt and pants and it was a big hairy guy and I looked right in his eyes and I could tell

442
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,400
 he was eight feet tall.

443
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,760
 Most of the time people are going to go,

444
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,800
 "That doesn't conform to what we know about Bigfoot."

445
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,680
 So when we look at early stories of this stuff,

446
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,600
 they tend to be more bizarre because even the person who experiences it or

447
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,680
 make again just making it up will conform to the knowing instances of it being told before.

448
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,280
 So we don't hear of Bigfoot's wearing clothes anymore.

449
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,080
 But back when the phenomenon was first starting,

450
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,720
 people were basically telling these experiences and they were all getting lumped in together with

451
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,560
 every other quote unquote reputable Bigfoot experience.

452
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,240
 Because as of today when you tell people that Bigfoot's are wearing clothes,

453
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,480
 I'll get you to the answer that pops up.

454
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,000
 One of the Bigfoot researchers has an answer for what's going on.

455
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,120
 But throughout the 1960s and 70s these things were being seen.

456
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,880
 We even have one in the 1980s.

457
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
 We have a Bigfoot sighting in Colorado.

458
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,040
 There was a couple in Navajo territory in Colorado and they said a large hairy humanoid

459
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,880
 jumped on the top of their car and it was wearing a blue checkered shirt like a lumberjack shirt,

460
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,360
 plaid and long pants, long torn pants.

461
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,840
 1950s and the 1950s this one anonymous girl, so again take it or leave it,

462
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,080
 this story may be made up or not, but there was a girl anonymous girl

463
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,520
 and she was telling the story to a noted Bigfoot authority,

464
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,680
 Ivan T. Sanderson.

465
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,400
 So she says she was, again we don't have an age for this and it just takes place in California,

466
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,640
 it's quite vague, but this little girl says she was walking through a meadow with her family.

467
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,800
 They're on a camping trip and she heard someone behind her, right?

468
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,160
 And I looked ahead at my notes and I think this detail is so funny,

469
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,960
 but this girl is walking through the brush and she hears someone behind her and she turns around,

470
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,880
 she thinks it's her brother behind her and as she's turning around she goes,

471
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
 "All right, stinker, I know you're there."

472
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,520
 And when I read that I was like, "Oh, so I knew what was coming, I figured a Bigfoot was behind her."

473
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,040
 But I saw when's the last time you heard someone call someone else a stinker?

474
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,200
 That's such an adorable insult, but to a little kid that's like super,

475
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,000
 they're like, "Oh mom, she called me a stinker and I don't stink, do I?"

476
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And the mom's like, "No, you don't stink, honey."

477
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,120
 And I'm not trying to breathe through her mouth,

478
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,640
 but I just love that, a little kid calling another kid a stinker.

479
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,920
 Anyways, she turns around, was in her brother, what she describes as a seven to eight foot tall

480
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,680
 creature, all of the hallmarks of a Bigfoot like I described earlier, but this one was wearing clothes.

481
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,000
 The clothes were barely covering it, they were really tattered off of this thing,

482
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,720
 but it was definitely had clothes on at some point.

483
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:45,280
 Ripped shirt, remnants of pants, and then she runs back to the campground and she tells everyone

484
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,480
 to the campground what she saw, and then she goes on to say that no one believed her and they

485
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,880
 finished the camping trip, which I, again, I find hilarious, because you have this little girl who

486
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,040
 saw this giant monster in the woods and she runs back, she's like, "Mom, dad, stinker, there was a

487
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,400
 giant monster in the woods and he was wearing this tattered clothing, totally freaked out, let's leave,

488
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,800
 let's leave," and they basically made her stay the whole weekend as I imagine she was petrified in

489
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,160
 her tent the whole time, afraid that this creature would come back. But so, there are these two

490
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,600
 Bigfoot experts, and this is, I was reading this, an article about these things, and there are these

491
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,840
 two Bigfoot experts, and this was their, this was their reasoning why these stories exist,

492
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,680
 because again, it's not typical Bigfoot stuff, so you have to figure out a reason why all the

493
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,080
 other Bigfoot stories are real, but these stories that are aberrations, you have to explain, even

494
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,400
 though technically none of it should really be able to be explained, because it's unexplained,

495
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,240
 that's why it's interesting and weird, but anyways, it doesn't conform to your Bigfoot experience,

496
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,360
 so we have to come up with a reason why it's real. So, they either have to figure out a way to make

497
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,920
 it conform to existing Bigfoot stories or dismiss them out of hand, and this is their logic behind

498
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:03,200
 that. This is a quote here, the only, this is what they say, the only explanation that occurs to us

499
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,720
 is that this was a freak sighting, which technically all Bigfoot are freak sightings,

500
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,120
 because they're freaks, but again, they're saying this one, they're talking specifically about the

501
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,880
 little girl in California, was a quote freak sighting, that the Bigfoot had found the old

502
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,560
 clothes somewhere, and having seen humans dressed in clothes, decided to copy them. The fact that

503
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,200
 the clothes barely covered him does suggest that they once had a smaller human owner,

504
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,440
 so because it doesn't conform to your idea of how a Bigfoot should act, you have to say,

505
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,360
 well this is the only reason why, this is the only explanation, but it's not the only explanation,

506
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,320
 it's not, there's another explanation, and I touched on this briefly on episode 181,

507
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,000
 which was, are aliens turning humans into Bigfoot's? So you know where I'm going with this.

508
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,360
 If you were a human wearing lumberjack clothes, and you were shifted, you were turned into an

509
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,400
 eight foot tall creature, guess what? You're barely gonna have any clothes left on you.

510
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:11,600
 So what is a more rational explanation for this utter nonsensical story? That a human was transformed

511
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,880
 into a Bigfoot, and as he's getting taller, as he's getting more muscular and beastly,

512
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,280
 his clothes are starting to shred and rip and tear, and then just throughout his time in the

513
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,920
 wilderness walking around scaring kids, they're just gonna rot away just like clothes do when you

514
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:35,200
 don't wash them. Or that an eight foot tall monster saw a six foot tall dude's jacket laying in the

515
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:44,000
 ground and goes, me like, me fit into this rip, oh no try other arm rip, oh so snug, better put

516
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 on these pants, this might work better. What's more, it's Occam's razor for a ridiculous scenario.

517
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,320
 If you accept the idea that the girl's telling the truth or that any of the stories of these

518
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,520
 creatures wearing clothes are true, either someone turned into a Bigfoot with their existing clothes

519
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,600
 on, or a Bigfoot saw tiny people clothes, tried putting them on, put on enough successfully that

520
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,480
 they were recognizable on a form, it wasn't like he just had the shirt draped over his shoulder,

521
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,520
 had his both arms in it, what's more likely? The Bigfoot phenomenon is fascinating to me,

522
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,560
 because it's one of those things that people are so entrenched in. You see it a little bit with

523
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,320
 ghosts and a little bit with aliens, but generally if someone says, I believe in ghosts, but I've

524
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,400
 never seen one, I've just felt their presence, so I don't know if they can actually walk down

525
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,280
 the hallway wearing clothes and stuff like that. Another ghost person, not a physical ghost, but

526
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,440
 another ghost expert will say, well there is a thing that's called a poltergeist, or there are

527
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,600
 people who never really see a ghost, but they feel like the emotional energy from them, stuff like

528
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,000
 that. There's a lot of wiggle room with ghosts. Same thing with aliens, you're gonna have two people,

529
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,880
 one person say, I saw a gray alien, and the other person say, I saw a reptile alien, and they're

530
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,880
 both gonna be able to discuss their experiences together. Some people seeing aliens zipping around

531
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,840
 in the sky, some people have been abducted, some people believe that they're here to bring peace to

532
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,600
 earth. All those people can have conversations about them, because the idea is that there's

533
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,720
 multiple alien races out there. There's very few people who say there's only one alien race,

534
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,240
 and it's this kind, and everything else is made up. For the most part, everyone can kind of go back

535
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,720
 and forth and say, whoa yeah, the Gray's are real, but I saw a reptilian. Reptilians are more warlike,

536
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,160
 and this Pleiadians are more peaceful, so the narrative is very malleable. Bigfoot stories

537
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,960
 are not. Bigfoot stories, for as ridiculous as the idea sounds, that in the year 2019,

538
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:50,800
 a physical beast can exist, that is an actual biological entity that has never been found,

539
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,120
 that has never, in none other skeletons have been found, that's the narrative you're going with.

540
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,400
 Because you do have a hard break in the Bigfoot community. Most Bigfoot enthusiasts believe

541
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,960
 that it is a biological creature that humans have never found. And then you have a small subset of

542
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,240
 people who go, well it's probably more of like a nature spirit, or some sort of interdimensional

543
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,720
 creature. And they'll be like, nah, he just has like camouflage abilities, and they're smart enough

544
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,640
 to cover up their dead, but they're not smart enough to keep leaving footprints everywhere.

545
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,320
 So the biological group of them really have a hard time explaining away

546
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,440
 why we never find their bones, but we find quote-unquote supposed evidence of them all the time.

547
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,720
 While the ones who believe that it's some sort of paranormal-esque entity, or alien type entity,

548
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,920
 they're not getting the Bigfoot shows, they're not getting the shows on TLC or Discovery Channel,

549
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,320
 whoever makes that garbage, they're not getting those shows where they're like, oh, we're gonna go

550
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,000
 wrestle us up some Bigfoot, we're gonna shoot them in the brains, and bring them back. We're gonna do

551
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,520
 it live on television, not this season, or next season, probably not before the show's over, but

552
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,480
 we're gonna do it eventually. So you don't hear that side of it. I don't know, people always

553
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,160
 ask, Bigfoot is the question I get asked the most from doing the show, they go, do you believe in

554
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,520
 Bigfoot? My answer is always the same, I kind of shrug and go, if they found him, I wouldn't be

555
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,080
 shocked, but I'm not gonna go out looking for him. That's always my answer for the Bigfoot story,

556
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,800
 it's not one of those things that I dismiss out of hand, but I'm not super, like, into it either,

557
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,440
 but I do dismiss the fact that it being a biological entity, like, for the most part, out of hand.

558
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,800
 I don't think it's a creature that has like a mating cycle and a life cycle, and just like a

559
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,600
 normal animal on the planet Earth, I don't believe that for a second. I believe if they're, if they

560
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:55,200
 are out there, there's another supernatural component to them. And my theory is, is that

561
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,320
 Bigfoot's, the reason why they are quite hard to find, the reason why they're relatively rare,

562
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,120
 is I believe that Bigfoot's actually used to be humans that were transformed into Bigfoot's.

563
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,920
 And you're like, Jason, that's super stupid, and I'm like, it is. It's just as dumb though as

564
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:20,560
 any other Bigfoot theory out there. And the fact is, is that we've had multiple accounts of

565
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,600
 Bigfoot's wearing clothes. They're not super popular because they don't fit the normal narrative.

566
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,960
 Doesn't fit the normal narrative, you push it out of the mainstream. And in that episode, episode 181,

567
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,000
 are aliens turning big people into Bigfoot's? There was a man who was like shot by an alien

568
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,160
 beam or something like that, and he started going crazy and started ripping at his clothes and running

569
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:46,000
 around going, "Ah, ah, turning into a monster." And he said, "When I got hit with a beam, I saw

570
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,840
 visions of the end of the world, and it was driving him mad, and he was trying to run into

571
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,120
 the forest, and his friends kind of held him down. Is it possible that humans are being transformed

572
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:02,480
 into Bigfoot's? It's as possible as there being a Bigfoot to begin with. It's really as possible.

573
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,480
 It would explain a lot of details about it. And the thing is at the end of the day, Bigfoot

574
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,600
 isn't scary, which I think is a big minus for him as a legend, as like a legend over time.

575
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,920
 Werewolves and vampires and aliens are scary, because we just know they're so powerful. There's

576
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,920
 something terrifying about that. Ghosts are scary because they're unexplained and they're us when

577
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,720
 we're dead, but even if they're not, they're like interfering with our lives. Bigfoot's are just kind

578
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,440
 of lame in general. They're not very scary creatures. They just kind of pop up and you smell them and

579
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,640
 you run away. But the idea that these creatures walking through the wilderness around the world

580
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:47,520
 used to be humans that were shape-shifted against their will by some otherworldly force,

581
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:53,360
 that's terrifying. It's something creepy about the fact that every time they find a Bigfoot

582
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,320
 print in the middle of the woods, or a little girl turns around and she sees a giant monster

583
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:07,200
 standing behind her, that that's actually a human that is trapped. That's actually a formally

584
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:15,520
 civilized person that's slowly growing more monstrous every single day. It's being a prisoner

585
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,520
 inside of a body that is not your own. So when you hear those loud growls late at night when

586
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,040
 you're camping with your buddies, and people start talking about Bigfoot stories or stuff they saw on

587
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,120
 TLC, how they know how to go "squatchin'" is that what it's called? Just imagine that that noise

588
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,040
 out in the woods could not be coming from a mythical beast or a cryptid that's never been caught,

589
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:47,840
 but it could be coming from a human in the throes of change. As bones break and grow longer,

590
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:55,600
 as skin grows tight against new muscle, and fangs replace the teeth they were born with,

591
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:03,040
 those noises echoing through the forest at night, could be from somebody who was just like you

592
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:12,160
 a few days earlier, with hopes and dreams, friends and family. But now they're simply a beast,

593
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:19,200
 destined to roam the woods forever. And the only thing that gives you a clue that they used to be

594
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:28,800
 human is the few scraps of rotted clothing still clinging to their fur. Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com
