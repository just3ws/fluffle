1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Is a political serial killer about to wage war on America?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,600
 And then we travel to an unnamed national park somewhere in Colorado.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:22,300
 As we go face to face with half human, half bear, demonic entities today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:29,800
 *Music*

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,800
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter, I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,300
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend. Maybe you had a little Easter Agon?

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:46,300
 Maybe, maybe you didn't. Maybe you are an adult and you don't go foraging through the backyard for pink eggs.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,300
 But either or, hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
 Let's go ahead and get today's episode started. First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,300
 is one of our newest Patreon supporters walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,300
 Give it up for Captain Jacks.

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,300
 Everyone salute him and clap at the same time. You can do it. You guys got three arms, right?

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,300
 Captain, you're gonna be our captain this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. It really is.

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,300
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:23,300
 And I want to make this announcement, this quick announcement right now, the weekend of May 13th and 14th, I will be at the McMinnville Organ,

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,300
 the McMinnville UFO Festival in McMinnville, Oregon.

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,300
 You're like, "Whoa, Jason, you're doing a presentation? Did they get you to speak?"

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:39,300
 No, I did buy a vendors table. I'm getting a vendors table and I will be there to hand out bookmarks is what we're gonna do.

20
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,300
 And we're gonna get the name Dead Rabbit Radio out there in the flesh.

21
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,300
 I'm also gonna bring along some haunted items. I'm gonna have them on a table.

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,300
 Sabine says it's gonna look like a garage sale. Jason, you're just gonna have this vendors table with these dolls.

23
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,300
 Just like two or three dolls. Don't do that. Ah, what does she know?

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,300
 We're gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. And maybe you'll swing by and check it out.

25
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,300
 Captain Jack, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:11,300
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're driving all the way out to New York City.

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,300
 [imitates gunfire]

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,300
 We have political mass shootings. Unfortunately, that happens.

29
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:23,300
 These people do these things. They're trying to make a statement either against women or against a particular race or particular religion.

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,300
 We see that stuff. We see political mass killings.

31
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,300
 But is it possible that we're about to see, if it hasn't already started, a political serial killer,

32
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,300
 which I think may be relatively new?

33
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,300
 A couple years ago, this would have been back in 2016.

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,300
 You had, there's a, you guys are, I'm sure, familiar with the website, 4chan.

35
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:53,300
 There is a board on 4chan called "Politically Incorrect," and that is, no holds barred, anything goes,

36
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,300
 quote-unquote, "political discourse." It's a lot of people just being racist,

37
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:05,300
 which is to be expected when people can be anonymous. A lot of it's trolling, a lot of people are trolling other people,

38
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,300
 and they don't actually believe this stuff, but some of them do. Some of them do.

39
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:17,300
 On the "Politically Incorrect" board, there was a movement called, or they were always talking about this thing called a right-wing death squad.

40
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,300
 And they were comparing themselves to the death squads of South America that were killing communists.

41
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:32,300
 What happened though in 2016 was there was that horrible fire, there was that horrible fire at a place called the ghost ship.

42
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,300
 It was in Oakland, it was December 2nd, 2016, there was this warehouse that was turned into an art collective,

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,300
 and a bunch of people were living there, and they basically were plugging everything into one outlet, and they had all these people living here.

44
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,300
 There was a huge fire, 36 people burned to death. It was awful.

45
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:55,300
 On December 7th, on the 4-chan board "Politically Incorrect", someone posted a thing saying, "Yeah, forget about the right-wing death squads.

46
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:04,300
 What if we set up a right-wing safety squad?" Because this art collective is a very progressive group of people, right?

47
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:13,300
 Very left in their politics. What if we know this isn't the only one in the United States, and now all the attention is turned towards these fire hazards?

48
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:21,300
 What if we started calling up fire marshals across the United States and reporting these art collectives for safety violations?

49
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:32,300
 The city would be forced to shut them down. Even if the city was very friendly to the politics coming out of the warehouse, they would be forced to shut them down.

50
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:40,300
 And so they did. They put this plan into action where lists were provided of all of the...

51
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,300
 Because a lot of times these art collectives, they'd put their information out online, they'd want people to come and visit them and be part of the experience.

52
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,300
 And then sometimes people would go actually visit these places and take photographs and then send them to the fire marshal,

53
00:04:52,300 --> 00:05:00,300
 or sometimes you could just pick one off a list and call in and say, "Hey, there's a couple code violations here in Minneapolis in this art collective,

54
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:09,300
 and the fire marshal would go there." And shock of shockers, there would be violations, because you have a bunch of people spending a ton of time in this warehouse,

55
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,300
 or this abandoned building, or whatever it was, and it wasn't up to code, and all of a sudden people were getting kicked out of these places.

56
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:29,300
 These art collectives were getting shut down. And it was so effective. It was so effective that 4chan had to ban the talk of the right wing safety squads.

57
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,300
 You couldn't post about it anymore. You would get banned.

58
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:43,300
 And it's interesting because you have to wonder, was it because fire marshals were tired of getting these phone calls, or being trolled,

59
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,300
 or who knows how many pizzas got delivered to the fire marshal if he didn't shut the place down soon enough. Who knows, right?

60
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:57,300
 Who knows how that all turned out? And it was too effective. It was causing too much disruption across the United States.

61
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,300
 Because you could say, "Hey man, we're just making sure these people don't burn. We don't want these people to die like they did in the ghost ship."

62
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:12,300
 But everyone knew the real reason was you had right wingers attacking left wingers using the mechanisms of public safety.

63
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,300
 Super effective, right? And it started with a meme. It started with some guy saying, "Hey, why don't we do this?"

64
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:27,300
 It started with an image on an image board, but that is that saga. But what I saw recently, this is a while back, maybe like two or three weeks,

65
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:35,300
 I'm going to read it to you because I don't feel comfortable reposting it. I think if I reposted it on my image or my Reddit or whatever,

66
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:42,300
 it'll get shut down because this is pretty inflammatory. Let me read this to you here. I know reading a comic strip isn't the funnest thing on the podcast,

67
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:51,300
 but check this out. It's a two panel comic on one side. It's a picture of what they call an NPC. It's just like a white outline.

68
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:59,300
 It's like an invisible man or however you want to put it. He represents the left wing. He represents left wing politics.

69
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:07,300
 They're a cartoonish version of this. "You have to accept everyone, but you have to hate these people,

70
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,300
 and you have to worry about climate change and change your diet and your behavior and expectations,

71
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,300
 and you have to reject your traditions and identity unless you're in one of these groups,

72
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,300
 and you have to praise them for it, and you also have to wear a mask and take these shots so we can go back to normal unless it doesn't work.

73
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:34,300
 Then you need another shot until they tell us it is safe again." So that's the left wingy cartoon guy, right?

74
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:44,300
 And then you have on the right hand side a blonde haired dude with a beard. I think he's supposed to be like a Nordic, like a Swedish dude or something.

75
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:53,300
 And with him, there's just the quote. This is where we're getting to the story. "You are at war with our society.

76
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,300
 Under just war theory, it's not a sin to kill you.

77
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:08,300
 I noticed you leave your soda unattended. Here, have some fentanyl. I put into a little spray.

78
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:18,300
 So cheap, but so potent. Like $3 worth on the dark web is fatal. Enjoy." And that's it.

79
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:25,300
 It was a meme on an image board. The page disappeared, right? Who knows how many posts it got.

80
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:34,300
 200 posts, who knows. But it's gone. But is it? The thing with the right wing safety squad is it popped up and disappeared.

81
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:41,300
 No one really paid attention to it. And then it came back. A couple days, about a week or two later, took off.

82
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:48,300
 Fentanyl is so dangerous. What happens when someone is able to aerosolize it?

83
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,300
 Put it into some sort of device that you just roll into a subway car.

84
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:07,300
 Pfft. The average ambulance would not carry enough Narcan to resuscitate an entire subway car full of people. They just couldn't.

85
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:17,300
 Could you imagine what type of chaos that would cause if there was a mass casualty event and when the EMTs get there, you have 20 people with blue lips?

86
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:30,300
 It would change things. It really would. People would be terrified. A silent weapon. I mean, guns don't get me wrong. Super spooky, right? I've been shot at. It is not a fun experience.

87
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:39,300
 But I also understand how physics works. I also understand if I don't believe the volts can hit me, I can dodge them like Neo.

88
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:49,300
 But being in an enclosed location and someone just rolling in some fentanyl. And that may be too sci-fi. People could probably say, "Well, you can't aerosolize it because of the way it is."

89
00:09:49,300 --> 00:10:03,300
 But this guy is just walking around spraying it on your soda. And what's so interesting is on the one hand, he can, this guy, could specifically target either communities, right?

90
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:12,300
 If he believes that this group of people is actually waging war against his society. We all live in a society, but this is his.

91
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:19,300
 He can go to an area, an art collective, for example, and spray it there. Pretend he's their friend.

92
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:27,300
 He could target people individually because everyone posts their politics on Facebook nowadays and on Twitter and all that stuff.

93
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:36,300
 So you could just scroll. I'm not giving people advice. I'm not trying to give people advice here. I'm saying this is terrifying.

94
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:44,300
 Now, he might have just thought about this. A lot of stuff on the internet is just jokes. Even maniacal things like this can be just jokes.

95
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:52,300
 But if one person was like, "Hey, that is a good idea." Crazy. Absolutely crazy thing. I can't think.

96
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:59,300
 You guys might be able to help me with this, but I can't think of a politically motivated serial killer.

97
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:09,300
 You definitely could argue a lot of the serial killers who only target women. There could be some sort of political issue there where they believe women have too many rights and stuff like that.

98
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:18,300
 That's possible. But someone who's actually a serial killer whose targets are of an opposing viewpoint.

99
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:32,300
 I don't know. I can't really think of one off the top of my head, but terrifying. If the one guy who made the meme, he may have put it out there to see if other people would join him in his war.

100
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:39,300
 And sometimes the worst thing is if they think they're alone. Because now they have to act.

101
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,300
 If they think there are other people out there, maybe he'll just sit around and talk about it all day long and not do anything.

102
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:54,300
 But if he puts it out there and no one agrees with him, then he goes, "Well, then everyone is an enemy." Everyone.

103
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:01,300
 And I have to do something because I'm the only one left to fight. Absolutely insane. I hope I'm wrong about this.

104
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,300
 I hope that this was just some weird joke, but absolutely insane if it's not.

105
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:16,300
 A politically motivated serial killer walking around America killing people with an undetectable, very cheap drug.

106
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,300
 Crazy. Crazy stuff.

107
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:30,300
 Captain Jacks, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the carbonicopter. We are leaving behind this maniac's hideout wherever it is, if it exists at all.

108
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:38,300
 Fly us all the way out to Mount Roosevelt Park in Colorado. Maybe.

109
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,300
 [imitates car engine]

110
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:50,300
 This story is nuts. This story is absolutely nuts. And I'm gonna be fully-- I'm gonna put all my cards on the table.

111
00:12:50,300 --> 00:13:02,300
 When I first started looking into this, I go, "Awesome." An old man who barely knows how to use YouTube is talking about a ridiculous subject. Let's go.

112
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,300
 This is gonna be great.

113
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:18,300
 When I got done watching the video, 'cause I gotta watch it a couple times, right, to make sure my notes are right, I started thinking, "Hmm... maybe... maybe."

114
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,300
 'Cause when we deal with the world of paranormal, we do have to have that "maybe" in our head, right?

115
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:32,300
 But by all account, like, when I started looking at this guy's channel, I was like, "This guy is just another dude on YouTube talking about weirdo stuff."

116
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:40,300
 First off, the name of his channel-- it took me by surprise. Like, I didn't look at the name of the channel when the video-- I don't remember even how I found the video.

117
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,300
 I don't know if it was on the export, I don't know if it was on Reddit or wherever, but when it popped up, I saw the headline of the video.

118
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:55,300
 It was called "Military Deployed National Parks." It's not grammatically correct, again. I was like, "Mwah! This is gonna be awesome!"

119
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:05,300
 And when I started watching the video, which I kinda had a bit of a context, again, I don't know where I found this Reddit or the export, they said this had to do with Missing 4-1-1.

120
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,300
 So I was like, "Okay, Missing 4-1-1, Military Deployed National Parks is gonna be great."

121
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:18,300
 And the video started and he announced the name of his channel and I had to do a double take, and then look, I was like, "This can't be real."

122
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,300
 His name of his channel is "Israeli News Live."

123
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:30,300
 Now, he's just-- he's some old dude sitting here in America, and I was like, "Israeli News Live? What is going on?" Apparently--

124
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,300
 He also says his name, he doesn't say it every video.

125
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:44,300
 I had to find a video where he said his name. He said it super fast. It's Steven Bernou, maybe? Something, "Dernu?"

126
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:51,300
 Steven is his first name. His description for his video or for his YouTube channel is just a block of text.

127
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,300
 I mean, again, it's like all the hallmarks of nuts.

128
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,300
 But I was able to-- I was able to just take the first sentence. I think it'll set it up.

129
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,300
 "At Israeli News Live, we examine world headlines and their relevancy to biblical prophecy."

130
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:13,300
 I was like, "Okay, so that makes a little bit sense." It's not actually coming out of Israel. This isn't a state-sponsored thing.

131
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,300
 It's about the end of the world. I mean, that makes a ton of sense either way.

132
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,300
 "Israeli News Live." But what's so fascinating about this? So I was looking at this guy.

133
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,300
 I was like, "Okay, this guy doesn't even know how to do a YouTube video."

134
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,300
 At one point, he was live streaming while he was driving. He's like looking at the comments as he's driving down the road.

135
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,300
 I was like, "Oh my God, this is hilarious."

136
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 All of his videos-- he's been around since 2011. He's racked up 80 million views across 3,000 different videos.

137
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:57,300
 I would say 98% of his videos are about real-life events, geopolitical conflicts, and how they relate to the book of Revelation.

138
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:08,300
 He's talking about when Russia invaded Ukraine back in like 2011 when they took Crimea, or was that 2014?

139
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:16,300
 But when Russia came into Crimea, he's putting out a ton of videos about super obscure Israeli politicians.

140
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:24,300
 There's not many famous ones. Netanyahu, I know him because he's just been around for so long, but I don't even think he's still there.

141
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:30,300
 But yeah, I'm looking through his YouTube channel and they're like, "Israeli Senator so-and-so said this?"

142
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,300
 I don't know who this person is, but anyways, so he has all these videos.

143
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,300
 Thousands of videos about real-life geopolitical events and how they relate to the book of Revelation.

144
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:48,300
 And then, two weeks ago, he put out a video called "Military Deployed National Parks."

145
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:56,300
 And again, I'm being fully honest with you. When the first time I was watching this, I was openly chuckling as I was writing my notes.

146
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
 I'm like, "Ha ha ha, yeah, sure buddy."

147
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,300
 And then I'm not-- wait, let me be clear. I'm not saying I fully agree with this guy either.

148
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:12,300
 But I'm just saying, as I kept watching it and as I started going through all of his other videos, and I go, "Whoa, this is the outlier."

149
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:19,300
 Like, I thought they were all gonna be like this. I was hoping I came across a treasure trove where this guy was gonna be talking about all this crazy stuff.

150
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:28,300
 Now, he might mention crazy stuff in his other videos, but they're way too boring for me to watch. I don't want to watch about geopolitical stuff from the year 2014.

151
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,300
 So, I don't know, man. This is weird. So, let's get into it. I've given you enough background. Let's get into it.

152
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,300
 The beginning of April is what we're talking about. This is just happening two weeks ago.

153
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:44,300
 What's been going on is the military-- the military deployed to national parks.

154
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:53,300
 And Stephen goes, "Listen, I gotta be honest with you. I don't know if it's special forces specifically, or if it's just small batches of regular army troops.

155
00:17:53,300 --> 00:18:08,300
 But what I'm hearing from my sources is that the military is being deployed to an unnamed Colorado National Park because of events linked to Missing 411."

156
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,300
 And that's all the information he'll give about that event.

157
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:20,300
 And then, in a bizarre move that again shows this guy does not know how to YouTube, even though he-- hey, hats off to you, dude. 80 million views, that's dope.

158
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:28,300
 But he then glosses over these earth-shattering events because he goes, "Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to get this news about Colorado. I don't know.

159
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:34,300
 It might be Mount Roosevelt Park. I'm trying to figure that out." But there are troops there.

160
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,300
 And then he'll go on for two, three minutes about some crazy stuff like this.

161
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:46,300
 He goes, "You know, we have these troops in Colorado. I'll try to get you the information, guys. Sorry, I'm trying to get the exact name, but they're being really--

162
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:54,300
 they really not want to give that information out." You know, in Washington State at Mount Rainier, these giants have been killing people.

163
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:02,300
 I'm like, "What? That's a crazy shift." He goes, "Yeah, it turns out that these satellites detected some mineral deposits in Mount Rainier.

164
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:11,300
 And people were showing up and they got attacked by giants. And then the military showed up and they started fighting these giants.

165
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,300
 And luckily, they killed one. They didn't lose any US forces.

166
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,300
 But when we look at Colorado, I'm still trying to figure out this unnamed--

167
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,300
 I was like, "Tell me more about Mount Rainier." He mentioned it twice across two different videos.

168
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,300
 There's two different videos. He talks about this specifically.

169
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,300
 The other video, it has one of the best-- one of the best titles I've seen in a long time.

170
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,300
 I'll get to that in a second. I'm gonna do what he does. I want to give you a little taste and then take it away.

171
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,300
 He's going back to this stuff about this unnamed park and these troops going there.

172
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:49,300
 He doesn't know what they're there for. But he tells us that there's currently US military forces fighting giants in Mount Rainier.

173
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,300
 And he connects it to the giant of Kandahar story, which we covered a long time ago.

174
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,300
 I'll put that in the show notes, but basically these--

175
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,300
 I don't know how else I have to describe them. They're giants fighting US troops.

176
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:08,300
 Make that your channel. Dude, I don't want to hear about some Russian boat floating around the Crimea in 2014.

177
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,300
 It's boring. Just keep doing giant stuff. Anyways.

178
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:19,300
 Then he goes on and on about the Colorado thing again and he's like, you know, this is kind of related to Yellowstone.

179
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:25,300
 When all those park rangers got murdered. Like, what? Where? What is going on?

180
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,300
 And then this is the bread and butter. I don't know why this isn't just what his video was about.

181
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:37,300
 Maybe because he is a breaking news guy and he doesn't know how he buries the lead is what we call in journalism.

182
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:44,300
 He doesn't know that, yes, the breaking news may be military and unnamed to park in Colorado somewhere.

183
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:51,300
 This is the story. Apparently, park rangers were getting murdered in Yellowstone National Park.

184
00:20:51,300 --> 00:21:01,300
 I'm laughing just because I imagine like the dude from Yogi Bear just has guts everywhere and it's all steamy because of the geysers and stuff.

185
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,300
 Park rangers are getting ripped to pieces in Yellowstone Park.

186
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,300
 And the park rangers are complaining about it. Obviously, that's an unsafe workplace.

187
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,300
 You're like, oh, I already got to worry about falling into all of these geysers.

188
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,300
 Now Chuck over there got ripped to pieces by something. I don't even know what it was.

189
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:25,300
 They're filing complaints with the government and the government sends out the men in black.

190
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,300
 And they show up and they say, you guys need to stop complaining. You guys need to stop complaining about this murder business.

191
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,300
 Come on, guys. You signed up for the National Park Service. You knew what you were getting it to.

192
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,300
 They're like, no, he didn't. We just really love trees.

193
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,300
 Well, don't tell anyone else about this. And then the men in black leave.

194
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:49,300
 But later, there must have been a changeover in Washington. Later, I'm talking about this like it's 100% true.

195
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,300
 I'm like, well, I did read that policy paper that said that they were going to do this.

196
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,300
 Later, the US military sent troops out to Yellowstone because they were like, okay, we're running out of park rangers.

197
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,300
 We need more of these guys. And this is apparently all tied into missing 411 as well.

198
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:13,300
 When we get to this headline, Americans ritualistically killed in US national parks.

199
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,300
 Because when the military gets out here, they realize this isn't just some beast.

200
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:22,300
 I kind of gave it away in the opening, right? It's a man human, half man, half human.

201
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,300
 Wait, no, that's normal. That's me. It's a half bear, half human.

202
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,300
 But if you thought that was it, and I'm sure all the man bear pig jokes are coming into the comments,

203
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,300
 if you thought that was it, that's not even the big shocker.

204
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,300
 Half man, half bear, that's normal. That's in a dead-earth radio.

205
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:45,300
 The US military comes out because they believe that these park rangers are not just being murdered for sport or for food.

206
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,300
 They believe it's a ritualistic sacrifice. So what they've discovered is somewhere in Yellowstone,

207
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:56,300
 and they don't know the exact location or it hasn't been revealed yet, but somewhere in Yellowstone,

208
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,300
 they found a giant pentagram tattooed into the earth.

209
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,300
 That was the only way he could describe it. It was tattooed into the earth.

210
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,300
 The witnesses were saying that it didn't look like it was, like a trench was dug or it was painted.

211
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,300
 It was tattooed into the earth of Yellowstone.

212
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,300
 The military goes out there, they're investigating this, and what happens is they find out

213
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:23,300
 that underneath Yellowstone National Park is not a super volcano, which is what a lot of people believe,

214
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,300
 because it's factually accurate, but it's not true. It is not a super volcano.

215
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,300
 It is actually a series of tunnels that connect across the nation to other national parks.

216
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,300
 Now that is very common in the Missing 411 conspiracy theories as well.

217
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:43,300
 And what lives in this cave is the aforementioned half bear, half human.

218
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,300
 And Stephen says, "A lot of people mistake these guys for Sasquatches, which is a separate entity."

219
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:53,300
 It's a Sasquatch. They look like Sasquatches because they're tall and they're furry.

220
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,300
 They live in the woods, right? Obviously you'd think it was Sasquatch.

221
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:03,300
 But he goes, "Most people who see these close up, right, know that it's not a Sasquatch.

222
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,300
 It looks more like a giant human bear figure coming at them."

223
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,300
 And they do come at you. They're viciously violent creatures.

224
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:19,300
 Apparently these things are as close to the Nephilim as we could ever get.

225
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,300
 And that's interesting, because Stephen said that on his YouTube channel. That was an exact quote.

226
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,300
 "The giant of Kanahar was always considered an offshoot of the Nephilim."

227
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:34,300
 The Nephilim is basically an if an angel and a human woman had a child,

228
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,300
 it's generally regarded as a giant, either physically or through their abilities.

229
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
 The feats they can do are magnificent.

230
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:47,300
 Nephilim. But he's saying the giants of Kanahar and the giants of Mount Rainier aren't really Nephilim.

231
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,300
 This is. And that is why they are not only drawing pentagrams in the...

232
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,300
 These are satanic creatures. They're drawing pentagrams or tattooing pentagrams into the earth.

233
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,300
 They live underneath Yellowstone. I don't know why that makes them satanic.

234
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,300
 I just figured it's super hot down there.

235
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,300
 He says these creatures are also multi-dimensional.

236
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:12,300
 And that's what makes them so hard to defeat, because bullets go right through them.

237
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:18,300
 Apparently some way that they're shifting or phasing into our world, a bullet can't kill them.

238
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:25,300
 But in some odd detail, a knife or sword or any sort of blade can harm them, can kill them.

239
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,300
 I would then make just little knife bullets. I would like carve my bullets into knives.

240
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,300
 You're like Jason, you... you... there's a whole host of problems.

241
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,300
 First off, carving a bullet's not that easy, but couldn't you make little bullet knives?

242
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,300
 I'm sure... I'm sure the minds at the Pentagon have tried thinking this, but that's the first thing I thought.

243
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:49,300
 And so these tunnels underneath the earth, they have these glowing crystals in them that illuminate the caves.

244
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,300
 And in these caves live these manbears.

245
00:25:53,300 --> 00:26:00,300
 And they're popping up every so often and murdering people and sacrificing humans to Lucifer?

246
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,300
 I would assume. He doesn't explicitly state that.

247
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,300
 The pentagram's a pretty big clue.

248
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,300
 Now the military's been going in there and trying to flesh these guys out.

249
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,300
 Oh, and another interesting detail. This is what I find so fascinating about this, right?

250
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,300
 Again, I went in and this guy was a kook, and he very well may be.

251
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,300
 But the attention to detail. I read real raw news all the time.

252
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:28,300
 I don't torture you guys with as much of it as I read, but I read stuff that I know is false all the time.

253
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,300
 What's it guys name? Dr. Fauci, Anthony Fauci, is not currently at Guantanamo Bay.

254
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:41,300
 He did not admit that his wife is a man. He's not yelling for Obama. Save me, Obama. That's not happening.

255
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,300
 That's not happening, though. That was an article the other day in real raw news, and it didn't happen.

256
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,300
 I read fake stuff all the time. And a lot of times it is the...

257
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:57,300
 Sometimes it's the lack of detail that makes it sound believable, and sometimes it's the attention to detail that makes things believable.

258
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,300
 It's this thing you have to kind of slide through. What's interesting, so we have these man bears living in these...

259
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:07,300
 Which is ridiculous, right? Which automatically makes you think of the South Park episode.

260
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,300
 I'm not gonna gloss over that. I know I kind of did earlier, but...

261
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,300
 But anyways, you have these man bears living in these underground caves with the glowing crystals, that light...

262
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,300
 Which we've come across that before in other underground society stories.

263
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,300
 They'll try to find the one from Arizona that had the glowing...

264
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,300
 The walls glowed, I think is how they describe that.

265
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:33,300
 These creatures, these satanic creatures that live underneath Yellowstone, and really, assumedly, underneath the United States at large.

266
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,300
 Really, the whole place, and they pop up and they grab people.

267
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,300
 Covered in hair, I'm assuming they have big, scary bear faces.

268
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,300
 That would make them the most bear. It was a bear body in a human head.

269
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,300
 That's way less threatening than a human body in a bear head.

270
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,300
 But they have... I thought this was an interesting detail.

271
00:27:52,300 --> 00:28:01,300
 The creatures that when they're able to fight these, or they get close enough to observe them, they have blue tattoos.

272
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,300
 Like what? That's such a bizarre detail.

273
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,300
 What? The tattoo of what? Who knows. It doesn't go into detail, right?

274
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,300
 It's just blue, or bluish tattoos.

275
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:20,300
 And I thought that is such a bizarre detail, again, to just throw into the middle of this narrative.

276
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:28,300
 I don't know what to think of this. The paranormal side of me, and the guy who loves this type of stuff, right?

277
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:34,300
 That'd be awesome if this was real. I mean, it wouldn't be too cool if one of these things were ripping your guts out in the middle of a national park.

278
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:41,300
 But, I mean, to think that there's this ongoing war between the military and these demonic interdimensional entities that are bulletproof.

279
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:49,300
 Like, I love that type of stuff, right? I really do love that type of stuff, and I'm always disappointed when it's not true.

280
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:55,300
 But then on the other hand, like, it seems super ridiculous, right?

281
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,300
 But again, the Warlord Paranormal, we cover ridiculous stuff on the show all the time.

282
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:04,300
 So that's not the main reason why I was dismissing the story in the beginning, because I was like, "Dude, this guy seems like he just doesn't know what he's doing."

283
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,300
 But when I come across the detail, it has a bluish mark.

284
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,300
 Like, again, that's an interesting detail that I don't think a liar necessarily would have put in there.

285
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:24,300
 Or the liar would have went full force and said, "Oh, it was this interdimensional pentagram tattoo, and Satan's face could come out of it and give him orders."

286
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,300
 "Stop getting stabbed, you buffoons! Retreat!"

287
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,300
 Satan just turns out to be Megatron. He's the most inefficient leader ever.

288
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:41,300
 Just an interesting detail. Am I saying this story is true? Am I backing this up 100%? No, but it's super fascinating because of the source.

289
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:46,300
 And it's so funny because if I had read this on a website, I probably would have approached it differently.

290
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,300
 I would have been like, "Oh, here's some news coming out of this website talking about this."

291
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:57,300
 But when I saw this guy putting out YouTube videos and he's just sitting in his living room and he can't title an episode with actual grammar,

292
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,300
 I'm like, "This is going to be awesome."

293
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,300
 But I thought it was going to be awesome because I thought I was going to make fun of this dude.

294
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,300
 This story is actually really dope!

295
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:10,300
 He connects it to... I've never heard this before. This is really interesting.

296
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,300
 He connects Missing411 to the Dyatlov Pass mystery.

297
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,300
 I don't think anyone's connected Dyatlov Pass specifically to Missing411.

298
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,300
 So I was like, "That's really, really interesting stuff, Steven, whatever your last name is."

299
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,300
 And then, in just total high strangeness ways, he goes...

300
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:39,300
 Missing411 is actually... It's so funny because in the two videos that I watched specifically for this, he was kind of like begging his listeners.

301
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:48,300
 There was like 391,000 subscribers. He was begging them to get ahold of David Paulideus, who's the guy who is the main force behind Missing411,

302
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,300
 and get it... Like, "Hey man, have them talk to me. I really got a lot of questions for them."

303
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,300
 Dude, you're doing some really good work without this guy.

304
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,300
 He goes, "Listen, Missing411 is actually two separate phenomenons."

305
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,300
 He goes, "If they're missing, it's aliens."

306
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:11,300
 And aliens choose national parks because they're devoid of so much witnesses.

307
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:17,300
 And it makes sense. You can't really put high-tech security cameras in national parks.

308
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:23,300
 I mean, I'm sure they have trail cams and stuff like that, but you couldn't have, like, CCTV hookups.

309
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,300
 That's the point of a national park. So he goes, "Aliens are choosing national parks because there's no one around."

310
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:37,300
 He goes, "If they go missing, it's aliens. If they're found dead, it's these guys. It's these bare people."

311
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,300
 And I actually love that. I think that's a big problem in the paranormal community.

312
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,300
 You go, "We have this event. We have Missing411. What's causing it?"

313
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,300
 And people go, "I think it's the government and predator shoots."

314
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
 Or, "I think it's Bigfoot." Or, "I think it's aliens."

315
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,300
 And they have a singular answer, and he goes, "No, there's two answers."

316
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,300
 And that totally makes sense. If you're walking down the street and you get mugged, you can't always say,

317
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,300
 "Oh, it was the 82nd Bloods. It was that one gang."

318
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,300
 Because there's a city in New York City. It's a rife with gang violence.

319
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
 And some lunatics shooting up a subway.

320
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,300
 So you couldn't always say it was one thing. He goes, "It's not. It's two different things.

321
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,300
 If they disappear and they're never found again, that's aliens. These creatures, they kill you

322
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,300
 and then leave you back on earth or take you back to earth. That's not their MO to kidnap you."

323
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:31,300
 Fascinating. Fascinating stuff. It's so funny. I came into this thinking I was going to find a weirdo.

324
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:38,300
 And I did find a weirdo, right? This belief is insane. But is it true?

325
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:44,300
 In the world of paranormal, who knows? And this guy, his page, is rife with current events

326
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:51,300
 and new stuff and things that would be a schnorefest if I ever watched any of his other videos.

327
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,300
 And then these two are just, and that again adds some weird legitimacy to it.

328
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,300
 It's almost like he did get the inside scoop. And someone's like,

329
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,300
 "Hey, Steven, I know I always talk to you about that stuff that is verifiable.

330
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:09,300
 There's something in the news and you can use clips from CNN and stuff. But how about this?"

331
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,300
 And I tried looking up where their military training exercises in National Park,

332
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:18,300
 they couldn't find anything to verify any of this. But it was so weird how he goes,

333
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:24,300
 "But I know, I know the yellows." The story I just told you, he spread across two videos

334
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,300
 in 20 minutes and when I say spread across, he kept interrupting himself and going,

335
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,300
 "But I'm trying to find more information about Colorado." And then he would go,

336
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:37,300
 "Oh, by the way, these things... By the way, these things killed a bunch of park rangers."

337
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,300
 But when that Colorado information comes there, it was weird. Absolutely weird.

338
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:48,300
 Is the US military currently waging an underground war against an interdimensional race of half-human,

339
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:54,300
 half-bear, demon-worshipping entities?

340
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,300
 That might be one of the best sentences I've ever said on this show.
