00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Today we go back to the conspiracy iceberg to take a look at what was in the laundry room.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we travel to Berkshire, Massachusetts for an interactive adventure. Can you survive the Husak Tunnel today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. This episode's a little different. This episode, I'm wearing a hat. You can't see it, but I have it on my head.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Bjorn S. Bjorn, thank you so much for supporting the show.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Delayed clap there, but thank you so much for supporting the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Now if you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 We also have a merch store. And guys, if you're a Patreon supporter, I'm still sending out stickers.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 So if I haven't got your address yet, send it to me via Patreon or Gmail or Instagram.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 However you guys want to get it to me, send me your email. I will send you out a sticker. The stickers are really cool.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I'm starting to get emails from people and photos from people. You guys seem to really like them. So I'm glad I was able to share that with you guys.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Bjorn, we're going to toss you the keys of the carbonicopter. You'll be getting your sticker soon enough.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But right now you just have to settle for these keys. Catch them in your hand.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Bjorn, we are headed out to Bremerton, Washington. We're flying over the wooded area, normally called forest, holding onto my hat.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Gotta keep this hat on. It's a straw fedora. I think it's a fedora. I don't know.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 We're flying, holding onto my hat. We're flying to Bremerton, Washington. Now this is actually from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Now, this is why the conspiracy theory iceberg, 90% of it is stuff like this. When people see the conspiracy theory iceberg, they normally think of stuff like golf rumors or ageless travel.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Most of the stories are just very, very unknown phenomenon.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 We're landing in Bremerton, Washington. And it's a good thing I wore this hat because it's actually the year 1948. We're walking through the streets of Bremerton, Washington. It's 1948.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And we walk up to a house and we're looking through the window, like a bunch of crepes, like a bunch of perverts.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And inside the basement washroom, we see Virginia staples.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Now, Virginia lives in this old apartment building. Super old. And actually it's where the apartment building is.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 There's a bunch of other apartment buildings, like close to it. It's almost like just nothing but buildings. Nothing but buildings.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Like a city, normally described as a city. But she's in there. She's in the washroom. She's doing her laundry. Now it's 1948, so we're not talking...

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 What noise is that? You just hire people to stand in the corner going...

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 It's supposed to be a dryer or washer. It doesn't matter. They don't exist at this time period.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 When she's doing her washing, she actually has a tub of water and like a washboard.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 That's her scrubbing something on the washboard. And a clothesline up in the washroom. It's basically where you go to do your wash.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So she's washing stuff in the basement. Now in the basement, there are these like holes, like where it's starting to crumble.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 This is not the Hilton, right? This isn't even a Motel 6. This is just an old-timey 1948 apartment complex with big giant holes.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Big giant holes in the basement. The last place you want holes, the structural integrity is all jacked up.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Now we're staring through this window. We're watching Virginia. She's rubbing stuff together. She's doing laundry, right?

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And she gets the feeling that someone's watching her, other than us, who actually are watching her.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 She's washing her clothes and she feels something staring at her. She's rubbing her clothes.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 She can't knock the feeling. That's something staring at her and she slowly turns around.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And in the whole of the building, where there's a bunch of bricks knocked down and stuff like that, she sees a giant monster dude.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Like, "Uhhh, it's not making any noise though. It's just standing there looking at her."

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And she's freaking out and then the monster starts walking towards her and she screams and she runs upstairs and she packs all of her stuff and she moves it.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Now she has no idea what she saw. She described it as five feet tall, which is how tall she was.

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 It was bright orange in color, had thin legs like a spider and had antennae on its head.

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 She's like, "What?" She runs away. It wouldn't matter if it was dark blue in color and normal sized arms. It's still a monster, right?

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 But anyways, that's how she described it and she couldn't sleep. She couldn't figure out what it was that night.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 "Uhhh, I can't sleep. My clothes are still dirty. I need to finish doing clothes, but I'm so afraid."

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Now she eventually kind of realizes that she's not down in the basement anymore. So she doesn't have to be super scared.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 She thinks about what she saw and she goes, "It was huge. It looked like a marine creature. It looked like a sea creature."

46
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Now where Bremerton, Washington, where these buildings were, the landlord said, "Yeah, those tunnels. They go out. They go out far. You actually get sea access."

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Like I said earlier, right? Landlords like Sorry, I'm showing up later in the narrative, but those tunnels that, you know, the bricks are falling apart and the buildings,

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 how much to take care of that? Not me. I'm just the landlord. But those tunnels, they go out to the sea.

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 She really should have said that detail earlier. You walks away.

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 So she's thinking, "It looked like a sea creature. I found out retroactively that these tunnels go to the sea."

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 So she goes to the aquarium to see if she sees anything that is relatable. She's like, "If I go there and I see five foot tall monsters floating around, then either I've gone to the wrong aquarium.

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I'm in an alternate universe, or maybe there really are five foot sea monsters floating around and I was dumb for being panicked."

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 She goes and she's looking at all the stuff in the aquarium and she's like, "Not you. Not you. Not you." And then she sees it.

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 But it was tiny. It was a little shrimp floating by. A little shrimpy man.

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 That's the sound of a shrimp.

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Floats away. Now, that's that story, right? Now, that is from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It's known as the giant shrimp in the laundry room. It's an interesting story. It's a very short, interesting story,

58
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 because eventually she goes back to the area. She was like, "I'm never going back there, but you know, never's a long time."

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 After a couple years, she goes back to that area. Building is gone. That area is now part of a naval base.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 This story was reported in Strange Magazine. It was published in Strange Issue #6.

61
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 They seem to be defunct now. I think they still have a web presence, but they don't have their old print magazines.

62
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Or their print magazines, you can order back copies of it. They seem to be pretty expensive.

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 But it definitely predates the conspiracy theory iceberg, and that's where this story comes from.

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 It's just an obscure story of a weird cryptid. But because it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg,

65
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 it may have another hidden meaning, but it does seem to be just a one-off cryptid sighting.

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 It's a giant shrimp that's walking around laundry rooms, and it is an interesting detail that eventually the naval base expanded to include that building.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 It was knocked down, and now she can't go there. So was a cryptid really spotted there? Was it a naval experiment gone wrong?

68
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Was it the newest seaman? Was it a new recruit? Private shrimp? Wait, they don't call them privates over there.

69
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 What do they call starter sailor men? It doesn't matter. Sailor man shrimp.

70
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Maybe he was working for the navy. Maybe he was an experiment.

71
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Maybe he was a new life form, and the navy took over his property, his home, so they could contain him.

72
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Maybe they ate him. I don't know. Maybe all of the above.

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 But maybe he was the first shrimp to enter the US Navy, and he was eaten. Who knows?

74
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 But beyond, let's wave goodbye to the shrimp or give him a high five. He seems pretty cool.

75
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 He didn't actually do enough, and he's just walking through tunnels.

76
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Bye shrimp. We're seeing you later. I'm sure my neighbors just hear me yell out "bye shrimp."

77
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I'm sure they hear me yell out a lot of stuff, but today I'm doing it in a hat.

78
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Beyond, let's hop in that carbonicopter. We're leaving behind Brummerton, Washington.

79
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 We are headed out to Berkshire, Massachusetts. Now this is a recommendation from Lerpato. Lerpato from YouTube.

80
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I recently did a story about the Phantom Bugler, and I said it's very, very rare to come across stories where ghosts who kill.

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 I said I think I could probably only think of two or three off the top of my head, and Lerpato goes, "Oh, I have one."

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Some people believe that ghosts kill people in the Husak Tunnel, and I go, "Huh?"

83
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I hadn't heard of this story, so I appreciate it, so I tip a hat to you, Lerpato.

84
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 We're headed out to the Husak Tunnel in Berkshire, Massachusetts.

85
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Now, pick a number between one and six. They're back, baby. We're doing another interactive adventure.

86
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Pick a number between one and six, and while you're picking that number, let's do a little bit of background here.

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Husak is supposedly the Mohawk word for "forbidden." That was a native tribe in the area.

88
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 They hated this mountain. They're like, "Thumbs down. This mountain totally sucks. Don't go there."

89
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So, of course, not a lot of people went there, but when they were laying down railroad tracks, you used to have to take a railroad all around.

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Do a bunch of stuff. So, someone goes, "Tell you what, you know that tunnel that supposedly cursed?

91
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 That people who have lived here longer than we've ever been around told us to stay away from?"

92
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Let's put a hole through it. Let's cut a four-mile-long hole through it so we can open up Massachusetts.

93
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 First off, we have to make sure we're able to renounce that, but then we're going to open up that state to the west.

94
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 This will be one of our most traveled tunnels.

95
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 The very first time nitroglycerin was ever used in America was in this tunnel.

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 If you're ever on Jeopardy!, there you go. There's that one.

97
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 It was over four miles long. They started building in 1851, and in the end, 180 men would lose their lives in the construction of this building.

98
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Do you have your number between one and six?

99
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Bjorn, bring us down low in that helicopter.

100
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Now we're going to repel out, because we've never done that yet, have we? We're going to hop out on ropes.

101
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 We're going to land it now. We're hanging out on this railroad track.

102
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 March 20th, 1865. There's three explosive experts getting ready to do what they do best.

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Blow stuff up.

104
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Ned Brinkman, Billy Nash, and Ringo Jelly. These are real people, by the way.

105
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 These are not three made-up names.

106
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 No, Ned Brinkman, Billy Nash, and Ringo Jelly. They're walking into the tunnel, and they're like, "Okay, we're about two miles in, boys.

107
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 This is where we're going to put this bomb."

108
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I don't think they had a spy versus spy bomb with a little fuse.

109
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 But anyways, they put an explosive device down there, and they're like, "Okay, this is what we're going to do.

110
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 We're going to set the charge, and then we're going to run super far back into this bunker, and then wait for it to blow up."

111
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 The other two people are like, "Why did you explain it? We do this all the time."

112
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 He's like, "Yeah, I just have a feeling someone in a hat might be listening to me."

113
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 So they put the charges down. They're like, "Okay, squeeze them in there."

114
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And then they start running back to the bunker. Now, they've just placed the charges. They haven't activated them yet.

115
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But for whatever reason, Ringo-- Wait, sorry.

116
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 His name wasn't Ringo Jelly. It was Ringo Kelly.

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So that was a made-up name. Ringo Kelly's his real name.

118
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Ringo Kelly, his doppelganger, his twin brother is setting the charges.

119
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Ringo Kelly gets to the control panel first, while Ned and Billy are still running down the tunnel.

120
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 For whatever reason, boop, boop, pfft, sets off the explosion.

121
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 He wanted to kill-- He was jelly of his brother. He wanted to kill him, too.

122
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 So Ringo Kelly accidentally kills Ned Brinkman and Billy Nash.

123
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 So if you pick the number five, if you pick the number five, you are Ringo Jelly.

124
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 You are a fictional character who was created. What? I don't have any memory before this event.

125
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 What am I doing here? And you're in the middle of a pitch black tunnel, and you see Ned and Billy start running.

126
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And you're like, "What? What?" And then you're running.

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And then you feel explosion behind you. You turn around. You're like, "Ahh!"

128
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And then you're like in a big old fireball.

129
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So you died. If you pick number five, you were a guy with a typoed name.

130
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 You had no family. It didn't exist until this very moment. You blew up in a fireball.

131
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Shut the podcast off now. I'll see you tomorrow. That's the new rule. If you die, you gotta stop listening to it.

132
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 But you're not dead yet, actually. So I hope you didn't shut it off, because what happens is Ringo--

133
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 real Ringo, Ringo Kelly, if you pick number one, you're Ringo Kelly. So Ringo Kelly is like, "Uh-oh."

134
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 That wasn't supposed to do that. Body parts are raining down on him.

135
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 So if you pick number one, you're kind of dusting off your shoulder, getting rid of some body parts, and you're like,

136
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 "I'm gonna go home. I think I deserve the rest of the day off."

137
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Thank you, gentlemen. You tip your hat to them, you go home.

138
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Now, shortly afterwards, you go missing, because on March 30th, 1865, he'd been missing for a couple days.

139
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Construction workers are going into the tunnel. They still gotta keep working on stuff, just 'cause a couple people blew.

140
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 180 people died working. I don't think it was the first time people died.

141
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 It might have been the first time they blew up, but they're going in and they find Ringo in the tunnel, two miles into the tunnel,

142
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 near the point where Ned and Billy died. They found Ringo strangled.

143
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 "Ahhhh!" His body lay in there in the pitch darkness.

144
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 For how long? Who knows?

145
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 But if you pick number one, let's say Ringo was out dancing to the honky-tonk.

146
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 He's like, "That's how I dance my blues away?" I blew up a couple people.

147
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Now I've got to blow up dance floor and he's dancing. He's doing the boot scoot and boogie and all that stuff.

148
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Then he sees this hot girl, sees these two hot girls at the bar and they're making kissy faces at him.

149
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 He thinks it's a little weird, 'cause they seem to be wearing wigs and they seem slightly translucent,

150
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 but their clothes seem normal, right? He's like, "Man, just the way I love my women."

151
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Curvy and see-through. He's walking up to him and he's like, "Hey girls, what's up?"

152
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And they're like, "Hi, I'm Ned Dean and this is Billy. How would you like to go back to our place?"

153
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And Ringo's like, "Oh dude, that sounds awesome." And he goes back and their place is two miles into Hoosack Tunnel.

154
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 He's walking through the tunnel. It's super dark and he's like, "Man, these girls are super fine."

155
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And it's kind of weird how their feet don't touch the ground and they're floating.

156
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And then he's making out with Ned Dean and Billy's like, "No, we're supposed to kill him."

157
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Ned Dean's like, "Oh yeah, I forgot. I forgot." And they strangle him.

158
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 So if you're number one, you get killed by ghosts, which again is incredibly rare.

159
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 So you can kind of consider that a treat.

160
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I mean, everyone has to die sometime, but you actually get killed by ghosts, so that's super rare.

161
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 And if you pick number five, Ringo Jelly. If you wore Ringo Jelly, you got to watch the whole thing.

162
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 You're just kind of floating there like a little Casper ghost being like, "Yeah, get revenge."

163
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And then you fade away. So now you guys have to shut off the podcast.

164
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Now, so that happened in 1865. In 1868, they have to build...

165
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I learned more about tunnels. I didn't retain any of the information.

166
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 You have to build a vent into a tunnel because it's a train tunnel.

167
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So otherwise, it's full of fumes whenever someone would be like, "Well, on a train, it's a four-mile-long tunnel."

168
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 You know when everyone fall asleep? Carbon monoxide poisoning through the tunnel.

169
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 So they had to drill a vent in it. And they had like water pumps and all sorts of stuff.

170
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 They're drilling into this mountain. And these dudes are like floating around.

171
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 They're not ghosts yet, but they're like hanging down and they're like on like work platforms and stuff like that.

172
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 In 1868, they're building this giant hole to vent the tunnel.

173
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So if you pick number three, you're doing an honest day's work, right?

174
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I'm just a minor man doing whatever a minor can.

175
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 I like to take a pickaxe and put it in a rock.

176
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And then I go do something that rhymes with the rock.

177
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 That's the theme song. You didn't know that? I learned that when I was researching tunnels, too.

178
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Boom! Boom! There's a massive explosion.

179
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 But if you pick number three, you hear the explosion. You're in like this big giant tunnel.

180
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 You're in this big giant shaft. It's a straight down hole.

181
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 You hear the explosion. You look around. You think you're blowing up, right?

182
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And then you see like a piece of wood.

183
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And then you look up and you realize where the explosion came from. It was above you.

184
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 So when you're in a giant shaft, there's two terrible places and an explosion can happen.

185
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 The bottom of the shaft or above you.

186
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 So there was like a big gas. There was a pumping station. There was all this stuff up above.

187
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And there was a gas leak and it annihilated this platform above these workers.

188
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 You just had tons of stuff falling down. Just squishing dudes, right?

189
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 You're like, "Ah, you're dodging. You're able to dodge a couple things. Trust me.

190
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 You're going to wish you got squished if you pick number three."

191
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 The pumping station breaks and giant boulders are falling on you, too.

192
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 So you're like, "Ah, ah, ah." And you're able to dodge everything. You're straight up Neo down here.

193
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 But what happens is, because there's no... The pumping station was pumping out the water that kept filling the hole.

194
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Well, now the hole is slowly filling up with water and it's sealed at the top with all this debris.

195
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 The people on the top are like, "Uh-oh. This is not... This wasn't supposed to happen until Sunday.

196
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 This happened before. I had a schedule." So they start sending rescue crews down.

197
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Then they put a dude in a bucket. Tell me if this isn't a garbage job. This isn't a number.

198
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I should have made this a number. If you pick number seven, you're in the bucket.

199
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 They put a guy in a bucket and they're like, "Okay, we're going to lower you down just to see what's going on down there."

200
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And they lower him down. They lower him down. He's down there for a while.

201
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And then they're like, "Okay, let's bring him back up and see what he has to say."

202
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 He's all unconscious. He's all, "Uhhh." And they bring him up and they're like slapping him on the face.

203
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 What happened? What happened? He's like, "Dude, there's no..." He goes, "You dropped me down there.

204
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I was down there for like 45 seconds. I passed out." There is no hope getting these dudes out.

205
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 They had water rising and they had bricks laying over them, like a bunch of debris over them.

206
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 So if you pick number three, I hope you're not claustrophobic, because you survived the downpour and water's pumping in.

207
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 This one's grim. I should probably shouldn't have included this one as a number.

208
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 What they found afterwards was that people did whatever they could to survive.

209
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 So you and a couple of the other survivors, water's rising, the ceilings collapsed on you, you're running out of oxygen,

210
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 but your hope is stay alive long enough you'll get rescued.

211
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 So you build a raft out of all this debris that's rained down.

212
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 You're like lifting it off of your friends who are dead and you're strapping it together.

213
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 You're using their shoelaces to make rafts. You're going through their pockets.

214
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 You're like, "Oh, dude, I love beef jerky." You're eating all their stuff.

215
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 You're like, "I'm not dead yet. I'm one of the guys on the raft." You're like, "You push them off, take your shoelaces."

216
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You make the raft. You get on the raft. The raft is floating up. The water's getting up.

217
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 The roof's getting closer. It's pitch black in there. It's super hot.

218
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 That guy still complaining about you taking his shoelaces and then you reach the top and you're floating in the darkness on this raft.

219
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Over the next year, bodies would float to the surface. The whole thing ended up filling full of water.

220
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Bodies would end up floating to the surface. 13 people died in this accident. Bodies would float to the surface.

221
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And then in the end, they did end up... because they had to finish the vent.

222
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 They did end up moving those bricks away. And that's when they found some people had built a raft to stay above the water,

223
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 but they just died of oxygen deprivation. So, pick number three.

224
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 You did not have a good afternoon, but you did become a ghost because what was interesting was in this vent area,

225
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 people would see ghosts walking around being like, "Oh, this sucks, dude. I totally wish I wasn't a ghost."

226
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And if I wasn't a ghost, I wish I had died in a casino or someplace cool. This sucks!

227
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Once the 13th body was uncovered, once all the bodies were pulled out of the vent, the ghost sightings went away.

228
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 They found peace. So, if you pick number three, at least you found peace. It's October 16th, 1874.

229
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And if you pick number two, you are a man named Frank Webster. Hunter, today, my hunting has taken me towards Husak Tunnel.

230
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Now, at this point, everyone in the area kind of knows the ghost stories.

231
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 It's not a place you want to go. Trains are going through it. It's not a huge issue.

232
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 But, I mean, just because trains go through it at 60 miles an hour, one, doesn't mean that you should hang out there.

233
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 You probably shouldn't. Two, it also doesn't mean that it's not super spooky,

234
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 because trains can be going by and there could be like ghosts trying to catch up, ghost hobos, gobos.

235
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 But you don't have to worry about them. You're in a train and you probably have a ghost ticket taker who's like pushing them off the train.

236
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 But if you're walking around with a gun, probably not a good idea to hang out at the no one haunted tunnel.

237
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Anyways, if you pick number two, you don't have a lot of street smarts or tunnel smarts in this case.

238
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 A couple days later, Frank Webster is walking around this river and he's like, "Ahhh! Ahhh!"

239
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 He's not a ghost yet. He's not a ghost. But he's making ghost noises. He's falling down.

240
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He seems to be in a state of shock and some other hunters are like, "Yo, Frankie, what's going on?"

241
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 He's like, "Ahhh! Ahhh!" And so they take him back to civilization. They take him to the nearest town and they're like,

242
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 "Frank, what's going on? What happened to you?" And he goes, "You won't believe what happened."

243
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 I was walking, I picked number two, and I was walking by Husak Tunnel and I heard a voice.

244
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Frankie, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank

245
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 He goes in there, he feels compelled, "Come into the tunnel, Frank." And he walks in, he's in the pitch dark of the tunnel, and then his gun floats away from him.

246
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 I imagine the gun is on a fishing line from a Don Knott's horror movie. He's like, "What? What's going on?"

247
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And the rifle is floating around him in the darkness. He's trying to grab onto it.

248
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And then he can't grab onto the rifle. It's just kind of floating away. It's slowly bobbing away. Again, like a fishing line.

249
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And then the rifle spins around and starts beating him up. It doesn't grow arms since punching him.

250
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Like someone's hitting him with the rifle. He's like, "Ahhh! This was unexpected!" And he gets totally beat up by the rifle.

251
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And then, next thing you know, he's walking by the river. So the cops realize two things.

252
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 One, the dude was beat up, and two, his rifle was missing. So if you pick number two, that's all that happened to you.

253
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 You should feel lucky. All you did was get tricked into going into a dark tunnel and got beat up by a rifle from Special Effects from an old '50s movie.

254
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 So that's pretty good, right? You got out good on that one. Unless your fear is being beaten up by rifles then, I'm sorry.

255
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Now let's jump to the fall of 1875. There's a guy named Harlan Mulvaney. He's a fire tender.

256
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 So that's a dude who like, brings wood in and sets it on fire or something like that. He brings fuel, maybe? I don't know.

257
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I could have looked it up. I neglected too. Now I'm looking at my notes. He's a fire tender. You guys know what that is.

258
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 I shouldn't have to explain it to you. I mean, come on guys, you know what that is. Disappointed that you would even ask.

259
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 We're gonna have this episode, by the way. Harlan Mulvaney, fire tender. If you pick number four, you're this dude.

260
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 So you're riding your cart in and he has a load of wood on his cart. And there's a bunch of horses and stuff.

261
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 And he's like walking into the tunnel and all that stuff. And he's like, "I'm about to do my highly detailed, very important job without me.

262
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 The rail system wouldn't even exist." And anyway, so everyone is outside of the tunnel. They're still like breaking rocks and doing stuff.

263
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And all of a sudden, that's not an old lady laughing.

264
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 That's a bunch of horses. That's not even more like an old lady laughing.

265
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Anyways, bunch of horses naeing. Now the cart is running out of the tunnel. He didn't even go that far in. He didn't hit the two mile mark.

266
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 The people working the construction outside of the tunnel, all of a sudden, see these horses? The crib keepers there as well now.

267
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 See these horses run out of the tunnel and Harlan's holding on to the reins. He's super scared, dude.

268
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 They can tell that the horse is probably super scared because of those spooky noises that he just heard that definitely weren't horse noises.

269
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 That's probably the first thing that scared him. Second thing that scared him was he's leaving a tunnel at high speed.

270
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 The third thing, the construction workers were like, "That weird. He looks scared about three things."

271
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 The two I mentioned and the fact that he's seen something in that tunnel. The horses run off into the woods, cart attached.

272
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 The whole cart goes off into the woods and people start chasing the cart. And then a few days later, because they get bored, they have your loose track and they're like, "Oh, he'll come back."

273
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Either he's having a bad day or he got possessed by ghosts, either or he'll come back.

274
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 A couple days later, they find the cart deep in the woods. He is never seen again.

275
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 So if you pick number four, we're going to have to do a little more detail here.

276
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 If you pick number four, you walk into the... Dude, this is actually trippy. I just thought of this.

277
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 What if you're in the cart and you're walking into the tunnel and then all of a sudden you are like, "Oh, it's super dark in here and I'm kind of spooked."

278
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 You're going to jump off of the cart. So now you're walking around in the darkness and you're like, "What? It's a super weird nerve in the tunnel before. I didn't expect these places to get so black."

279
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And so if you pick number four, you're walking around in the dark and you see a ghostly figure in front of you and you're like, "What? Must be one of them ghosts I heard so much about in this tunnel."

280
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And you notice he's kind of standing there and then you're like, "Uh-oh. He has a rifle. I better take that from him before he ghost shoots me."

281
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 So you grab the rifle and then the ghost turns around. He looks all weird and stuff and he's like, "Oh, give me back my rifle."

282
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And you get scared and you start beating the ghost with the rifle. Right? You see where I'm going with this?

283
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And the way you're holding it looks like fishing line for some weird reason too. You're like making it float and then you beat him up and then you take the rifle because you're super scared and you get on your fire tender cart and you run out.

284
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Like the implication was you were the dude who took the gun from number two. Because even though that took place a year earlier, maybe, even though the story's all about ghosts, maybe there's some sort of time dimension thing, right?

285
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 So if you pick number four, you actually beat up number two and then you took the rifle and then he just kind of evaporated, right?

286
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Your story's over. Like you just kind of disappear. I wonder if they found the horses. That would be weirder too. They just found the cart. No horses, no guy.

287
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 So if you pick number four, you beat up number two. Now all of this, there's another ghost story about this guy that I am given a number.

288
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I'm acting like I didn't do it on purpose but I forgot to give it a number. There was this guy named Joseph. If you picked any number, if you didn't pick a number, this is you.

289
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 There's a guy named Joseph in Poco. He believed in the ghosts. He believed in all that stuff. And one day he was breaking ice off the tracks and he hears a voice going, "Run, Joe, run!"

290
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 He's like, "What?" And he looks up and there's a train coming right at him and he jumps out of the way. Oh my God, the ghost saved my life.

291
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Which when I read that I thought, "You didn't hear the train? Did you hear the ghost?" But you didn't hear the train in the tunnel? But whatever. That's the story, right?

292
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 But then that's not all. Because six weeks later he's working on the tracks. This time he has to break one of the freight cars that's frozen to the tracks.

293
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Which makes me realize he didn't do his job the first time. The first time he was trying to break ice off the tracks. Obviously now, if there was enough ice that a rail car freezes to the track, he didn't do your job, dude.

294
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 But anyways, he's now breaking ice off the tracks and he hears a voice in his head warning him.

295
00:28:46,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 First off, how strong is this man that they hire him to pry a rail car loose with a crowbar? The freight cars frozen on the tracks, they give him a crowbar to then help get the rail car free.

296
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 So who is this Joseph in Poco? But somehow they got him to do the job.

297
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Now, he's about to get electrocuted. So a voice is warning him of this and in the nick of time he doesn't get electrocuted.

298
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But I'm giving away the ending here because what the ghost says to him seems like he's wasting precious seconds.

299
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Let's say that you see a dude about to get electrocuted. What would you say? I want you to say it out loud so your neighbors hear it.

300
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 If you see someone about to get electrocuted, you see a good friend, not someone you don't like. It's not Cobra Commander about to get electrocuted.

301
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 But you see someone who you like about to get electrocuted by using a crowbar on a train track. You're going to go, "Drop it! Look out! Look out! It's a little vague, right?"

302
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Because then they're like, "Oh, is there a baseball coming? Is someone hitting a golf ball? Drop it, works! Drop it! Utterity!"

303
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So I guess now you're just naming off elements. Magnetism! But you would warn them in the quickest... They're fighting something that's literally going the speed of light, right?

304
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Electricity is lightning fast. The ghost voice goes, "Joe! Joe! Drop it, Joe!"

305
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And he immediately lets go of the crowbar and the crowbar flies away because the electrical arc would zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

306
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 I want a number. So, but we do have number six here. Number six brings us to the present day. So if you pick number six, you are intrepid journalist Steve Jaco, who adds a new wrinkle to this story.

307
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 We have all of these hauntings, all these old timey hauntings, but Steve Jaco is a journalist who wrote an article, a freelance article for the website Medium.com.

308
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And in it, he actually interviews this woman named Jeannie, who's talking about history of the Housaq tunnel. And we have this interesting interaction.

309
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 So if you're number six, you're sitting down with this woman named Jeannie, and you're doing this interview. So you, number six says, "Now tell me about the video you took. What was that noise in the background?"

310
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Jeannie shifts uncomfortably in her chair. She's like, "What are you talking about?" Her actual answer is, "What video?" You furrow your brow. You're like, "What? I know I saw a video."

311
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Quote, "The video I found on YouTube. You went into the tunnel on Wednesday, right? The video was posted around 6pm."

312
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Jeannie, her eyes dart from side to side. I'm giving her suspicious intent. Her eyes dart from side to side. She goes, "Quote, oh no, Steve. I went in at nine. I couldn't go until the girls were in bed."

313
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 So Steve Jaco pulls up on YouTube. Click, click, click, click. Pulls up a video.

314
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Here's this quote, "I showed her the video and she hadn't seen it. I have no idea where it came from, but I'm attaching it to this article in the hopes that one of you knows where it came from."

315
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Thank you so much to Jeannie for meeting with me, and thank you to everyone for reading. I'll never stop reporting on the stories that matter to this community.

316
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 This was the only article he had written on Medium.com. So, if you pick number six, let me play this video for you, this video he's referencing.

317
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 If you pick number six, you have a real life consequence to that number. You are intrepid journalist Steve Jaco trying to share the stories that matter to the community.

318
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 If you pick number six, I'm going to play this audio clip for you guys, but if you pick number six, are you going to listen to this audio clip at 3am?

319
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Now, technically, if you want, you can say 3am Eastern Standard Time and listen to it in the middle afternoon. That's up to you.

320
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 But, if you pick number six, you should find the spookiest time to listen to this. Trust me, the video itself is spooky enough if you're listening to this right now in broad daylight.

321
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Time to clench your butthole, because this might be cursed.

322
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 You are the most kind saboteur.

323
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Now, you are the clockwork of the viewers of Shrew's Walkout.

324
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 [Buzzing]

325
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 [Buzzing]

326
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 It's interesting. It is a clip on YouTube. It sounds like it's from three different sources. The first one has that weird muttering.

327
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 And then there's like a bizarre tone, and then it sounds like it's supposed to be in a tunnel and you're hearing ghostly voices.

328
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 The link will obviously be in the show notes if you want to watch the video, but that's a disturbing little sound clip.

329
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 And Steve Jaco has not written an article since. Well, at least for Medium.com, not that I could tell.

330
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 So it's possible that if you pick number six, you did listen to that late at night. Maybe you took it into a HUSAC tunnel yourself.

331
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Sat down with a pair of headphones, turned on this podcast, fast forwarded to that very moment.

332
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And in the darkness of HUSAC tunnel, illuminated only by the blue light of your phone,

333
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 the specters of all that passed away creep up behind you, ready to add a new member

334
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 to the body count of the bloody pit.

335
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Did I mention earlier in the episode the nickname of the place was Bloody Pit?

336
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Well, if I didn't, I just did.

337
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 And now, you're in the bloody pit that I should have mentioned earlier. You're there. You're one of these ghosts.

338
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Dead Wrap of Radio.gmail.com is going to be your email address. The landlord shows up and goes,

339
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 "Oh, I forgot to tell you, this place, it's called the Bloody Pit. Should have mentioned that. Should have mentioned that much earlier."

340
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Totally forgot.

341
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 DeadWrapOfRadio.gmail.com is going to be your email address. You can also hit us up at facebook.com/DeadWrapOfRadio.
