1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 The worst marketing gimmick that is possible. A bizarre ghost slash cryptid

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,140
 that only appeared once in the most unlikely of places. And then we end the

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:23,280
 story of Sherry Schreiner. Is it possible that by littering you can defeat aliens

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,680
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:36,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
 Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. This

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
 episode will probably be shorter and the first two stories are definitely just

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
 little tidbits, little tasty little appetizers, bites of stories that I

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,600
 think are interesting but not like full fleshed out segments. So we're gonna kind

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,880
 of bounce around here. The first one, okay, and I actually discovered this product

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,560
 when I was researching the Sherry Schreiner stuff. So this is fitting that

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,760
 it's in this episode, the last Sherry Schreiner episode, I hope. She talked about

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,520
 this product called Thieves Oil. It's a product that you can get that like helps

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,520
 build up your immune system from the draconians or some nonsense like that.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,240
 But because that's not important. Why she was recommending it isn't important. But I

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,720
 did have to find out what this stuff is. Thieves Oil. It's a real thing. It's like

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,720
 eucalyptus and lime, not lime, but it's like eucalyptus and like oils and stuff

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,240
 like that you rub on you. It smells really good. Actually you know what? I will let

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,960
 the website tell you exactly what it is. This is from the website Secret of the

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,080
 Thieves. Sorry, no, Secret of Thieves. So if you tried Google Secret of the

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,200
 Thieves, you're probably gonna find out how to steal stuff. Secret of Thieves is

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,520
 the website for Thieves Oil. This is their gimmick. Okay. Thieves Essential Oil is a

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,080
 powerful... they actually have Thieves as a registered trademark which is kind of

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,400
 weird. Because I mean it's just an occupation. I can't trademark Carpenter, but

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,120
 Thieves Essential Oil is a powerful combination of essential oils for an

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,480
 aromatic, aromatic blend that fills any space with a rich, spicy aroma.

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,440
 Inspired by the legend of Four Thieves Vinegar, this blend is one of Young

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,160
 Living's most popular products. You're like, "Oh, okay Jason, it's this oil that

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,040
 you can put on you. It smells really good. You can also put it in like your

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,920
 dish soap or your toothpaste." That's what they're saying, not me. It's just like a

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,520
 yummy, yummy oil, right? So they go on to say that what it does is it's like good

32
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,760
 for cleaning. It's like a... smells good. You can put it in all these different

33
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,000
 products. It's based on this stuff called Thieves Vinegar. Now on their website,

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,400
 on their website, they have that little description and a little more going into

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,440
 detail like what it can be put into. And then in that same block of text, so you

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,400
 have a little image of a little bottle of Thieves Oil, you have the stuff that's

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,360
 written underneath it in the text right above it. It's isn't hidden somewhere on

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,200
 the site. This isn't there in their frequently asked questions. This product,

39
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,480
 quote, "Based on the legend of thieves," so that's how they get their name,

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,920
 Thieves. Thieves, this is based on some sort of thief legend. I'm enthralled.

41
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,040
 Healthy Living. What are you guys called? Young Living. I'm enthralled

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,800
 Young Living Company. "Based on the legend of thieves who covered themselves with

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,960
 mixtures of herbs and spices." Ooh, okay, so these are yummy smelling thieves. Maybe

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,040
 they're trying to break into places where people have bad senses of smell.

45
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,040
 Actually, that doesn't make sense because then they would detect you. So you're

46
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,680
 like, hmm, interesting. Let's start over. "Based on the legend of thieves who covered

47
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:02,040
 themselves with mixtures of herbs and spices before robbing plague victims." What?

48
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,520
 You, your product is based, your product is based on a thing that people rubbed on

49
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,720
 themselves so they could go into black plague infested areas of Europe and rob

50
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,640
 the dead and the dying. And this is a real thing. So I had to go, I was like, what?

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,640
 Why would you make that product? Okay, it's one thing to make that product. It's

52
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,080
 another thing to put it in your selling points, to have it visible on your front

53
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,680
 page. So apparently, back when everyone was dying of pestilence as boils were

54
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,480
 erupting from their body and exploding onto the vicar who's like trying to give

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,480
 them prayers, all of a sudden they're covered in black goo. I'm one of you now!

56
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,840
 Now, look, they get blisters. They pop all over the place. That's how I imagine it

57
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,600
 to be. I imagine streets filled with ankle deep pus everywhere. You couldn't

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,640
 even find your cat. It was just covered in pus. Must have smelled disgusting. Must

59
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,040
 have smelled like sweaty socks that had fish stuck in them just sitting out in

60
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,800
 the summer heat. That was all of Europe for about 400 years. Sorry for that

61
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,160
 description. Sorry if you were eating fish and/or socks while watching this

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,280
 episode. Anyways, there was this thing that, I guess they've done some studies

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,880
 that like French doctors would chew garlic and they actually had less and

64
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,120
 they would rub garlic on them so the French people smelled a little bit

65
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,720
 better. That's such a stereotypical French joke. Okay, but it's sorry

66
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,960
 French listeners. But anyways, they would rub garlic on their skin. They would chew

67
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,680
 garlic and French doctors actually had lower rates of getting the bubonic plague

68
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,440
 than their English counterparts. And there was a story of these thieves

69
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,560
 that did do like this Ocean's Eleven-style heist of plague victims and

70
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,880
 they covered themselves in these scented oils and were able to walk

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,880
 un molested through the bubonic plague towns and just rob people. Now, there's

72
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,800
 been some pushback to whether or not the four thieves is actually a real story.

73
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,120
 They think it might have actually been based on a guy named Four Thave who

74
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,320
 invented this little oil that was like, "Hey, take this and you won't get the

75
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,360
 plague as he's hiding pustules all over his body." He's like, "Look at me, I'm

76
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,120
 totally fine." They're like, "Take your shirt off." And he's like, "No, I'm shy." But

77
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,520
 buy this stuff. You won't get, "Oh, oh," and then just puss, puss starts coming out

78
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,680
 of his shirt. He's like, "Oh, that's an unrelated disease. You can buy my oil." All

79
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,800
 of that aside, whether or not it's based on Four Thave, a guy who sold bubonic

80
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,880
 medicine, or a group of thieves who preyed on on these dying humans full of

81
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,640
 mucus coming out of their body, don't put that in your marketing slogan. The last

82
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,480
 thing I want to be reminded of when I'm buying a product to put on or in my

83
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:06,280
 body is the black plague. Whether or not it protected them from it is irrelevant

84
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,160
 because I'm not facing the black plague today. But when you tell me that this was

85
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,280
 used by thieves to rob plague victims and then you list all the products it's in,

86
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:25,960
 cough drops, dental floss, toothpaste, mints, and wipes, the last thing I, if my

87
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,240
 butt hurts and I need a wipe, I don't want to think about plague victims. I

88
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,360
 definitely don't want to think about them while I'm flossing my teeth. Such a

89
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,400
 bizarre marketing. It's almost like I don't understand why they thought it

90
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,600
 was a selling point. They could have just said, "Hey, this is called Thieves Oil. It

91
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:50,760
 was based on some old thing that thieves did." Don't look it up. Just put it in

92
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,080
 your mouth and on your body. The last thing I want to do before I buy a product

93
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,800
 is to be reminded of, what was it, like one-third of Europe's population dying?

94
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,440
 Terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible. I don't think there's many

95
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,000
 concrete companies walking around touting their product as made from

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,680
 recycled 9/11 rubble. You just don't want to do that. Even if it is, even if they

97
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,280
 had the best rubble possible, no one's putting that in their in their marketing

98
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,560
 campaign. But these guys did. So the next story we're going to talk about is super

99
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,840
 short. It was almost one of those things that I was like, it's bizarre because it's

100
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,040
 only one, only one person ever saw it. It's only happened one time. My notes are

101
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:44,480
 literally five sentences. But it's kind of bizarre and creepy in its own way. This

102
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,080
 was in the book Weird New Jersey, which we've had issues with the weird books in

103
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,840
 the past. One in particular. I can't count for all of them. I should actually start

104
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,080
 buying them and reading them because I think they're really kind of like gold

105
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,440
 mines for this type of stuff. And when I say this kind of stuff, I don't mean

106
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,560
 weird stuff. I mean poorly sourced stuff. They'll pretty much put anything in

107
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,800
 there. If you wrote in one of these books and said I was walking on the street and

108
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,280
 I stubbed my toe and I turned around, there wasn't a rock there, it would

109
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,960
 probably end up in one of their books. Weird Oregon, Ghost Rock, page 78. So this

110
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,680
 is a story from Weird New Jersey. There's a bunch of kids. Okay, let me set the stage

111
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:31,240
 here first. There is no explanation for why this group of people are at this

112
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,480
 location. It just is someone telling a story, someone wrote in a story to

113
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,360
 Weird New Jersey and it's printed as being like, isn't this weird? But the weird

114
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,320
 part is how the people end up at the location. It's a group of kids at a

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,800
 nudist camp. No explanation given. And you're thinking, oh teenagers, you know,

116
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,000
 porkey style poking through the grass. No, the guy's nine. Nine-year-old. Now I'm

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,080
 going to assume for the sake of my sanity that the nudist camp is closed and

118
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,440
 abandoned and stopped operation a hundred years before these kids are running

119
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,040
 around. But anyways, this kid known as R.E. Baker, sorry, R.E. Barker, sorry

120
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,120
 fictional pseudonym, sorry that I got it wrong because I doubt this is his real

121
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,080
 name. Anyways, Mr. Barker as a young boy is hanging out with his friends at a

122
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,640
 long abandoned, no longer an operation, nudist colony, nudist camp, whatever it is.

123
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,000
 Anyways, there's an abandoned barn at the desolate nudist colony and the kids

124
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,360
 start basically daring each other to go up into the barn and Mr. Barker, young

125
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,800
 Mr. Barker goes up into the barn and when he gets into the loft, the one thing

126
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,480
 you don't expect to see at a nudist colony, whether or not it's an operation

127
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,920
 anymore, is close. So he climbs up and he looks into the loft and is not standing

128
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,240
 there but floating there a couple feet off the ground is a pair of fresh, brand

129
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,720
 new, fruit-of-the-loom underwear, tidy whiteies dancing around in the middle of

130
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,960
 the sky, like in the middle of the loft. So like if someone was wearing them but

131
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,360
 the person isn't there, he just sees them moving and he totally freaks out, he

132
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,200
 jumps out of the loft, he runs away, and that was it. That's the end of the story.

133
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,040
 That's all that appears in that part of Weird New Jersey and you're thinking

134
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,920
 Jason, that was a waste of your time. But it wasn't because think about it. If the

135
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,640
 story is true, it probably isn't. Well let's assume it's true just to dissect it.

136
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,000
 One, anything moving out of the ordinary. We talked about this with the

137
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,240
 grinning man. Actually you know it's funny, as I was looking at my notes, his name was

138
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,720
 more like the "girning man". It was used interchangeably but "girning" is a

139
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,760
 different facial expression. But a couple episodes back I did an episode about

140
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,400
 "girning man". It's creepy when things do stuff that's unexpected. Like a mummy

141
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,880
 holding his arms out walking down a hallway going "Uhhh" towards you is creepy.

142
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,760
 But if he wasn't walking towards you, if he was like crawling towards you,

143
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,040
 like a cat, that would be even creepier. Because you'd be like, your brain's

144
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,640
 trying to recognize two things. One, an ancient living dust monster coming at

145
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,720
 you. And two, it's not acting in any sort of way a human acts. So the floating

146
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,880
 underwear is actually kind of a creepy image because that's not something that

147
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,760
 you would ever expect to see. A pie floating. I remember there's a lot of

148
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,160
 stories of cabbages flying around, ghosts throwing cabbages at people. And I

149
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,440
 always thought it was so fascinating because you never hear about it. I hear

150
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,760
 about it all the time. I've heard it not all the time. I've heard about it a

151
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,120
 couple times but I've always like cabbages. That's weird. Like what's the

152
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,360
 connection between ghosts and cabbages? So I always look for that type of stuff.

153
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,160
 But so the underwear dancing around is bizarre by itself. But I think the fact

154
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,880
 that the underwear is at a nudist colony is just again that is like not

155
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,400
 supposed to be. It's the one place where underwear shouldn't be at a nudist colony.

156
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,080
 So was the underwear always dancing up there? Like is the underwear still in

157
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,560
 that barn now still dancing? Or is it only dancing when somebody observes it?

158
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,400
 Have we discovered Schrodinger's tidy white eats? Like is this something... It's

159
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,640
 weird to think that if that boy had never gone up in that barn just silently

160
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,280
 underwear's moving around in that barn it's abandoned no one ever goes there.

161
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,040
 All day all night there's just a pair of underwear kind of floating. To me

162
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,100
 that's creepy. Like observing it you're able to go "hey look at that's out of the

163
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,840
 ordinary" but to think that there's just a desolate place somewhere out in the

164
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,920
 middle of nowhere and there's just this underwear hovering in midair moving

165
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,160
 around. I don't know man that's actually creepier than your standard ghost walking

166
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,000
 through a hallway. But rock on underwear I don't think you exist and I don't

167
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,840
 think Ari Barker is real but still is an interesting story. But we talked. We

168
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,080
 talked about the underwear we talked about Thieves' Oil. Let's go back one more

169
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,200
 time to the vault of Sherry Schreiner. Again Gary opened up this whole can of

170
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,920
 worms by sending me an email. Quick overview on Monday we did an episode

171
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,880
 about a murder that was related to her cult. Second episode on Tuesday we did a

172
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,960
 story about the life of Sherry Schreiner in her own words which is quite

173
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,840
 interesting. Yesterday's episode was her frequently asked questions and magical

174
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,000
 prayers you can do to fight aliens and then you're like "Jason I'm not a

175
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,080
 religious person. I don't pray." Fair enough. You want the witch doctors to get

176
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,400
 you? That's your business. But you're a man of science or a woman. You are a person

177
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,280
 of science. You want to take the fight to the aliens directly. Well you know what

178
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,440
 Sherry has an answer for you. Sherry has a device that you can actually but not a

179
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,600
 device. A collection of materials that you can scrape up off the ground assuming

180
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,340
 your ground is a home depot but you can get these materials and you can take the

181
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:05,600
 fight directly to the aliens by littering with these materials. Let's go back in

182
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,320
 time. Let's go back in time for a bit. We're going back to the year 1939. We're

183
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,120
 gonna meet this guy in 1939 named William Reich. Now he was like this

184
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,280
 socialist dude who's like a Marxist and he was watching this political protest

185
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,400
 one day and he saw like all these people like "Oh yeah I go into government. I don't

186
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,880
 know what country this is so I'm just gonna do a variety of accents but yeah

187
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,740
 oh yeah yeah the government's like totally horrible and they're awful and

188
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,900
 the masses said but as they were protesting the government they weren't

189
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,220
 walking on the grass because there are signs saying keep off the grass and

190
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,820
 William Reich goes hmm that's an interesting thing like these people are

191
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,380
 out here protesting and rebelling but they won't do a simple rebellious act

192
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,700
 is walk on the grass. He came to the conclusion that the reason why the

193
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,560
 working classes were limited politically was because they didn't have

194
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,120
 good orgasms in their life. If they had better orgasms it would enlighten them

195
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,480
 to the struggle of all mankind. Now I don't know about that politically but I

196
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,760
 do agree everyone should have better orgasms. That I think is fine. That's

197
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,340
 totally good. But his views are so wacky other political activists were like "Hey

198
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,720
 Willie, why don't you not come to our next meeting? Keep telling everyone to

199
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,180
 masturbate?" He's like "What not man? I'm telling everyone to practice free love."

200
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,060
 They're like "However you want to put it but okay he didn't actually start

201
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,460
 telling people to masturbate in meetings. I should make a difference between a

202
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:41,060
 joke and the historical fact." But he was basically other other political groups

203
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,700
 are like "This guy's a little too wacky for us." Now he was a scientist he wasn't

204
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,340
 just some bum hanging out which I mean some scientists are but he was he was

205
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,760
 also into the belief that life could appear spontaneously. So you would have

206
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,040
 he would get like soil and he'd be like looking at it and he goes "I know amoebas

207
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,960
 are just gonna show up here one day." And through the course of his experiments he

208
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,440
 ended up getting some different type of dirt than he normally does and he saw

209
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,520
 like this blue outline around the dirt under his microscope and he said that he

210
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,520
 had discovered the force. Now he didn't use that word because it wasn't

211
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,940
 the exist fact then but that's basically what it is. It's the binding life cycle

212
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,400
 that travels throughout the universe like everything comes from this stuff and

213
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,180
 he found it in a sample of sand that is devoid of life and technically

214
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,660
 everything should have and he starts like writing all these papers and he names

215
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:41,860
 it "Orgon" or "Orgon" based on orgasms. Again he's still thinking about busting

216
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:47,020
 in that the whole time he discovers a new source of life he names it after getting

217
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:53,040
 off. So after his miraculous discovery he starts pushing all these papers on

218
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,160
 "Orgon" or I'm gonna call it "Orgon" I think it's "Orgon" but I I'll just call it

219
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,480
 "Orgon" okay? "Orgon" it just sounds weird. He starts writing all these papers on

220
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,640
 "Orgon" and there he's turning them into scientific journals there why the page is

221
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,580
 so sticky and he's like "uh sorry" but he was they can only read like the first

222
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,580
 three pages the rest of it is glued together. So he believed that

223
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,980
 "Orgon" held the universe together and it was also the key to having more

224
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,660
 powerful orgasm so again like he was selling it as a curel and a sexual

225
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:34,980
 fix. He also said if you're around enough "Orgon" your hips will start thrusting

226
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,920
 back and forth and I'm doing it right now so you want to imagine me doing that you

227
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,880
 probably even hear my chair rocking. If you're around a good supply of "Orgon"

228
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,320
 you can't control your hips going back and forth it's basically like this

229
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,520
 action that's going on this physical action that you can't control unconscious

230
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,680
 action you can't control. So if you're ever walking on the street and you see

231
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,040
 some weirdo just kind of swaying their hips back and forth you're like man

232
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,880
 that guy is really in touch with the universe. He ended up building these huge

233
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,300
 cabinets called like they were "Orgon containers" "Orgon containers" that wasn't

234
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,100
 the actual it's like an "Orgon box" it was a box that you'd sit inside it had a

235
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,860
 metal wall like metal lining on the inside and on the outside was all

236
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,220
 natural wood and what the way it was set up was that the wood would attract the

237
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:27,580
 "Orgon" to the box to the case it's a human size you'd sit in it in a chair I

238
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,600
 think you know where we're going with this the maybe don't the the natural wood

239
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,160
 on the outside would attract the "Orgon" moving through the universe it would

240
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,680
 soak through it and then the metal inside would keep it trapped in there so

241
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,560
 you're just getting all this "Orgon" right into your bloodstream right into your

242
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,520
 brain right into every cell of your skin and you'd sit and people swore by these

243
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,200
 things they were like these great medical devices people had and people were

244
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,780
 buying them people were just jacking off in them I can almost guarantee that that

245
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,540
 was just something I could I know that the people were just buying them to

246
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,620
 masturbate in and being like is it think about it it's sold to give you good

247
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,600
 orgasm and to cure some other stuff but people are only focused on that the man

248
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,420
 of the house is like hey I'm gonna go recharge my "Orgon" kids see you later

249
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,660
 mom will take care of you and then he just goes in there sits in there for five

250
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,560
 minutes comes out that's what people are using them for it was basically a

251
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,800
 private room for you to masturbate in now that's not a story that people won't

252
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,440
 admit to that historically but come on come on that's what you're using them

253
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,720
 for but other people said that it was actually this great medical device that

254
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,520
 really helped him out and made him feel young and all that stuff but

255
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,000
 masturbation does that too so a side note before I end that up he was selling it as

256
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,100
 a as a cure all the FDA the Food and Drug Administration of America said none of

257
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,660
 your claims are real you gotta stop doing that and he kind of did like he would

258
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,100
 only do it in his lab you could then go to his place and rent and you could rent

259
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,580
 an "Orgon" chamber at his lab which is gross because now he probably has like

260
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,540
 five of them and there's probably like glory holes drilled in the side and all

261
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,140
 sorts of gross stuff just manner showing up every day they're like hey do you got

262
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,820
 room in the chamber they're bringing magazines with them he's like oh yeah

263
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,760
 you can use chamber C but the FDA said you got to stop selling them and someone

264
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,240
 else took one of his and sold it and the FDA actually threw him in jail for not

265
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,360
 following their orders and they went to his laboratory destroyed all of his

266
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,360
 research and all of his equipment and he ended up dying in jail a couple years

267
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,520
 later of like a heart attack not enough "Orgon" in jail apparently that's the

268
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,160
 story of William Reich and you go what is that any of that have to do with

269
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,680
 Sherry Schreiner well that is what he's the one who discovered and kind of came

270
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,820
 up with what "Orgon" is from that from that Sherry Schreiner and many many many

271
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,340
 other people believe this as well that "Orgon" is not simply an element to cure

272
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,860
 your rheumatoid arthritis that you got from masturbating all the time for the

273
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,100
 better orgasms you got from the "Orgon" it's a vicious vicious cycle you can

274
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:12,220
 actually use it to destroy UFOs aliens are allergic deadly allergic

275
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:18,920
 anaphylactic levels of allergic to "Orgon" and their UFOs can burst into flames

276
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,880
 among the presence of too much "Orgon" now again we just told you that it's all

277
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,200
 throughout the universe the guy who discovered it it's all throughout the

278
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,160
 universe it's for curing people it's for letting you get off harder here comes

279
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,600
 been five minutes in my box and I'll show you how well it can work for you

280
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,280
 Sherry Schreiner's turned it into a super weapon which would be the equivalent

281
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,100
 of turning a fleshlight into Iron Man's arc reactor but it somehow she's able to

282
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:50,180
 turn this sex toy slash quackery medical device into a weapon she's created

283
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,860
 these things called "Orgon" I'm just gonna call it "Orgon" from here on out I'm sorry

284
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,380
 you guys are getting frustrated but it just flows better for me "Orgon Blasters"

285
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,260
 no I said it the other way whatever okay she made these things called "Orgon

286
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,740
 Blasters" and they're actually she has that term trademarked because only she

287
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,320
 can call it that not only can you make "Orgon Blasters" but you can infuse water

288
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,200
 with "Orgon" just drop a couple of these things in here and I'll tell you how to

289
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,040
 make it get a super soaker and then just start spraying aliens with "Orgon"

290
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,080
 infused water catches them on fire generally the opposite of what water

291
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,160
 does but you have that option now if you're ever fighting aliens and you have

292
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,800
 to use one hand to carry a super soaker in the other hand to carry a bucket of

293
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,560
 water you're probably not gonna last very long so she gives you more options

294
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,700
 first she's gonna teach you how to make them so you take a muffin pan you know

295
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,700
 the one with those little muffin slots in it so we're obviously talking about

296
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,700
 high-tech sci-fi level technology you take a muffin pan you take some like

297
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,700
 silicone resin type stuff you take metal shavings when she said you can cut up

298
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,700
 aluminum like baking sheets but she goes that takes forever I'm sure she spent

299
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,660
 weeks cutting these things up she goes go to a hardware store get some aluminum

300
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:08,120
 shavings get your silicone get a copper swire and then you twist it clockwise not

301
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,280
 counterclockwise but I don't understand that because if you flip it over won't

302
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,160
 it be the opposite of whatever it is you put the spring in there you put the

303
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,240
 metal shavings in there into the muffin can throw some pennies in there but they

304
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,120
 have to be pre 1983 pennies because they have the most copper you fill a full of

305
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,760
 resin and now you have this gross-looking mold that is full of a bunch of metal

306
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,780
 copper and aluminum how do you fight aliens with that you litter she gives

307
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,300
 you advice throw them out of your car as you're driving down the road you can

308
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,020
 hide them in bushes you can actually keep one in your car it'll have lower gas

309
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,580
 mileage you can put one under your electrical box at your house your

310
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,540
 energy bill will go down it will go down because the meter reader won't come

311
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,740
 around your house anymore because they'll think you're a lunatic because you

312
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,780
 got all this weird metal stuff hanging outside around your house but throw them

313
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,300
 outside your car while you're driving down the street hide them behind trees

314
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,560
 hide them in trees bury them put them everywhere you're going to create a

315
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:07,200
 circle a penetrable force field if you will around your house where the aliens

316
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,440
 will be like something feels weird here but I don't know what it is maybe it's

317
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,720
 all that copper and they run away that's not enough though she also tells you how

318
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,320
 to make ones where you use a metal bucket and you put a giant steel rod in it I

319
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,840
 don't know where the steel is coming from and then you do the rest of the stuff

320
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,300
 the copper and all that stuff she recommends you take these five foot

321
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,580
 tall monstrosities of metal and resin and to drop them in lakes rivers streams

322
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,860
 and the ocean she even says this is a quote from her we have found that the

323
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,620
 Oregon we are distributing and using across the country is defeating them

324
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,260
 them being the reptilian alien demon overlords we need warriors who will make

325
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,780
 or buy or go and distribute it around their areas you can throw it in ditches

326
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,000
 trees bushes lakes ponds deserts who lives by a desert and that's a big thing

327
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,680
 you just put like you just roll one of these out and you're like all done lakes

328
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,040
 ponds deserts anywhere won't easily be found you can even bury it she wants to

329
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,440
 litter the place the whole planet with these materials with these disgusting

330
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,240
 litter and that'll make the aliens not come around so again Sherry Shreiner not

331
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,080
 just the leader of this bizarre cult but actively encouraging people to litter

332
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:31,920
 and pollute the oceans to defeat an invisible menace her beliefs indirectly

333
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,800
 or directly depending how you feel about it ended up in a murder her beliefs

334
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:46,340
 seem to have kind of set her life off course her beliefs have helped create a

335
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:52,800
 delusional group of people who believe that they are ready and destined to fight

336
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:00,220
 in a war against these alien demons to the point where they're donating tons of

337
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:06,840
 money to her her beliefs have also led to a whole gaggle of followers who are

338
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,920
 believe this stuff and are becoming more and more delusional the more of her

339
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:18,300
 writings they read because it's not true none of it's true and now you could say

340
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,140
 ah you know she didn't have anything to do with the murder what she does with

341
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,260
 her own life is fine what other people do with their own lives are fine but now

342
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:28,420
 she's actively encouraged people to destroy the environment to fight a group

343
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:33,820
 of things these alien demon overlords controlled by Lucifer and actively

344
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:39,060
 destroying the environment to fight this phantom menace if you will she's

345
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,760
 hitting us on all points like there's almost there's no group of people she

346
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,880
 hasn't offended she hasn't come after dog lovers yet but that might just be

347
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,240
 down the pipe but here's the thing and we'll wrap it up like this here's my

348
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,120
 conspiracy theory in the future the environment is completely destroyed

349
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,160
 there's this weird magnetic energy coursing through the atmosphere and

350
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,520
 future scientists cannot figure out what is going on they're like for some

351
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:13,700
 reason everything seems to have aluminum in it and copper and not just copper and

352
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,260
 not just any copper copper from pre 1983 pennies and the scientists are like what

353
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:25,460
 could cause our rivers and our oceans and our deserts bushes to become infused

354
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,380
 with aluminum and copper and scientists are like we have no idea but look look

355
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,380
 outside the window desolate landscape everything tastes like wet pennies it's

356
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,480
 completely destroyed the food sources it's completely destroyed the water

357
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,400
 supply it's just a hellish landscape but we have this time machine and the other

358
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,800
 scientists are like hey where'd that come from and he's like I went to the

359
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,440
 future and got it they're like oh that makes sense we got this time machine we

360
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,680
 don't know where this pollution is coming from but we know how to

361
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,280
 counteract it first we're gonna go back in time to when we believe the pollution

362
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:06,820
 started then I have a plan it's called chemtrails I believe chemtrails can

363
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:12,020
 counteract whatever this pollution was and they go why why'd your voice sound

364
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,340
 differently now and he's like ah cuz I had to fix something in editing it

365
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,060
 doesn't matter the plane still valid I've come up with this thing that I want to

366
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,580
 call chemtrails we're gonna put it in planes and we're gonna fly around the

367
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,500
 earth no one's gonna know we're doing it we're gonna be super stealthy about it

368
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,520
 won't ever be caught on video or YouTube and by releasing chemicals into the air

369
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,120
 it will actually counteract all of this horrible horrible pollution that's been

370
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,160
 mysteriously done a hundred years ago and other scientists are like yeah it's a

371
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,320
 great idea and as they're discussing it they look out their window and the

372
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,080
 world starts to bloom and get better and the trees come back and some guys

373
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,880
 eating chicken and goes this tastes like chicken scientists are like yay just

374
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,520
 by talking about time travel we made it happen now obviously that's a facetious

375
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,620
 theory but maybe not when you're dealing with such bizarre things as witch

376
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,340
 doctors laser beams coming through your windows alien demons being directed by

377
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,740
 Lucifer and an unemployed single mom in Ohio realizing that the Bible is

378
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,540
 telling her that she is one of the prophets who will help protect the

379
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,380
 universe from Lucifer when all of those other bizarre things are in play

380
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:34,320
 anything you can make up is just as valid and that is a scary world to live in
