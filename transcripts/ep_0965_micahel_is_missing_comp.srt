1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
 When a group of ghost hunters descend upon a haunted, abandoned hospital, they have no

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,540
 idea their investigation is about to go from the world of the paranormal into the realm

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,960
 of true crime.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,840
 Now we take a look at the bizarre conspiracy that there is a secret government program

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:38,040
 that has one goal to stop the law of attraction today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,600
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680

 Hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,080
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,000
 First off walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is our final member of the Christmas

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 livestream.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,720
 Yes Christmas of 2021.

00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,400

 Now honestly I might have already given you props for your donation but I wasn't for

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,080
 sure.

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,040
 I saw your name on a pad that I'd written all this stuff down and I was like let's

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,600
 I'd rather err on the side of caution.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,680
 Sega Metzi you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
 the show financially I totally understand I really do.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,760
 Just helps spread the word about the show that really really really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,880
 Now Sega Metzi I'm gonna go ahead and start off by tossing you the hair hang glider.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,320
 Grab that in your little hands.

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,800
 We are jumping off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command and glide us all the way out

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,080
 too.

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:52,640
 Vicksburg Mississippi.

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,760
 This is a very interesting story not just for the story itself but I found it by accident

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,840
 and I was actually trying to verify yesterday's story about the kids or kid.

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,920
 We still don't know how many kids disappeared in the bathroom in Colorado Springs Colorado

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
 and I was trying to I always try to verify these ghost stories.

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,600
 I tried to verify if any kid actually did magically disappear in the bathroom.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,680
 This popped up and I was like wow I hadn't heard of this story this story is a different

35
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,760
 type of ghost story.

36
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,920
 This is a boots on the ground type ghost story not haunted boots that'd be hilarious though

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,000
 they're doing a little dance.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,640
 It's June 28th 2015 we're in Vicksburg Mississippi.

39
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,880
 We're standing outside the Coon Memorial State Hospital.

40
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,920
 This place has been investigated by a lot of paranormal investigators and we can understand

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,560
 why we're standing outside this hospital it's late at night it's abandoned and you just

42
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,560
 see like an owl sitting on top of the building.

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,440
 Hanging out up there and we're like oh that's kind of spooky.

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,520
 We're not owl investigators though we have to go inside and look for ghosts we got our

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,920
 EVP recorders we got our temperature gauges we're walking around flashlights.

46
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,440
 Looking for ghosts.

47
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,640
 This is actually considered by a lot of ghost hunting groups as one of the most haunted

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,360
 places in all of Mississippi.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,720
 I'll try to put some of the stuff in the show notes but there's been articles written

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:24,280
 about this place videos EVPs but we're actually not here for the ghostly activity itself.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,800
 We're here to take a look at another group of ghost hunters who were also at Coon Memorial

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
 State Hospital on June 28th 2015.

53
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,440
 This group of ghost hunters they head out here because again this is a standard ghost

54
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,600
 hunting location.

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,400
 They're walking around the abandoned hospital late one night.

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,560
 Walking through it shining their flashlights holding out their little tape recorder is

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
 anyone here?

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,920
 We'll play back later to see if we picked up anything.

59
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,360
 Let's just keep walking around this hospital to see what we can find and what happens is

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,360
 they get to where there's the staircase leading up to the second floor.

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
 And despite the eerie reputation for this place it is a huge abandoned hospital so of

62
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,800
 course you know there's going to be vagrants there.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,800
 There's going to be probably wild animals stuff like that.

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,560
 So you might run into a living person you might run into a living pack of dogs that

65
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,600
 was always my biggest worry when I was ghost hunting these type of places.

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,160
 But what this group finds is far more worrisome.

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,600
 When they get to the staircase that leads up to the second floor they see dripping down

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
 the stairs.

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
 Fresh blood.

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:47,000
 When I say dripping it's not just like a little Halloween effect it clearly looks like someone

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,240
 dragged something large and bloody down the stairs.

72
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,520
 Not too long ago either.

73
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,880
 They're shining their flashlights and they actually see this blood trail kind of smear

74
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,840
 across the floor right in front of them and they see it lead out of one of the exits of

75
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
 the building.

76
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,520
 So the ghost hunters are like okay this is definitely gone from zero to sixty really

77
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
 quickly.

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,600
 They begin to follow this blood trail out of the building and it rounds this little corner

79
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:31,600
 and there under the light of the Mississippi moon they see a dead woman.

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,960
 They rush to the local police department and they say hey listen, oh it's an abandoned

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,520
 hospital we know we're not supposed to be there that's why we went late at night around

82
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,200
 this ghost expedition.

83
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,320
 However you can arrest this for trespassing but there's something far more important going

84
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,520
 on there.

85
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,760
 They found the body of this dead lady.

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,080
 Around the same time like within a matter of hours of this happening there is a traffic

87
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,480
 stop.

88
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,800
 There is a police officer driving on the road and he sees a car that he has suspicions about

89
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
 and he pulls them over.

90
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,000
 And sitting in the car is Akeem McLeod he's a twenty year old man and Raphael McLeod thirty

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,640
 three years old.

92
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
 They were related.

93
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,240
 He pulls it over and when the cops is running the plates and checking the license and registration

94
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,760
 all that stuff he realizes that Akeem and Raphael are driving a stolen car and they have

95
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,320
 a weapon in the vehicle.

96
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,440
 The police radio is at in and says hey I have this stolen car I have this firearm.

97
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,080
 You guys might want to check on who this car actually belongs to because I think something

98
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,200
 bad might have happened.

99
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,040
 So then the police go to they follow the registration.

100
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,680
 They go to the house of Sharon Wilson this sixty nine year old woman.

101
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,320
 She's not home.

102
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,560
 The police are kind of linking all of these three things together.

103
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,960
 We have a stolen car we have a woman that's missing and we're also getting the report

104
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,800
 of this body out in the middle of this abandoned hospital and they are able to ID that woman

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,680
 as Sharon.

106
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
 She had been murdered at the hospital.

107
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,480
 Akeem and Raphael are arrested like this is all happening in just a very short amount

108
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
 of time.

109
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,480
 They're arrested for the murder of Sharon about a week they're both being held about

110
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,720
 a week later Akeem is released in the murder of Sharon.

111
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,600
 They don't think he had anything to do with it.

112
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
 Actually that's not true.

113
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,840
 They said we can't prove it.

114
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,920
 We can't prove he had anything to do with this.

115
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,920
 So Raphael is held for Sharon's murder.

116
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,560
 Now what's really interesting is I came across this thing on accident.

117
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,920
 It's from 2015 and I read that article and I was like wow that's really creepy haunted

118
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,320
 locations are usually haunted where people don't want to go there.

119
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,360
 They're usually in the middle of nowhere and other than the occasional ghost hunting group

120
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,960
 who would have thought that if you had disposed of a body at this hospital anybody would have

121
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
 found it.

122
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,560
 Or in any real matter of time.

123
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,200
 It wasn't like they left her on the front porch.

124
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,400
 They took her to the hospital.

125
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,120
 I read this story and I go okay that's really cool.

126
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,200
 I mean that's not cool for Sharon or her family or anything like that but I thought ghost hunters

127
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,600
 run into this and then I'm like well it's 2015.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,640
 I wonder how this story's played out.

129
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:31,480
 It's always neat to look back and read these different articles to see how the story ended.

130
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:39,200
 But it turns out that Raphael, what the charges were was that he did murder her right or he

131
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,040
 allegedly murdered Sharon and the way that it was set up was like this.

132
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,280
 He was stalking her.

133
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,880
 He was stalking her.

134
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,480
 Her husband had died just about I think it was three years ago like in 2012 and they were

135
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 both residents of New Orleans and they left because of Hurricane Katrina.

136
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
 So they ended up in Mississippi, start life over again.

137
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,640
 She loses her husband.

138
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,880
 She's living alone and then this creep is outside in his car and he watches her where

139
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,760
 she has a hidden key underneath a rock.

140
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,920
 One day he sees her lift the rock up, take the key open the door and go in.

141
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,040
 So he decides to do that as well.

142
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
 He gets the key.

143
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,200
 He lets himself into her house.

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,080
 He attacks her.

145
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,280
 He rapes her and then kidnaps her.

146
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:47,120
 He forces her into her own car, drives out to Coon Memorial Hospital and executes her.

147
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,880
 Then he came back to her house and he tried to burn.

148
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,160
 He figured he probably left some evidence there so he tried to burn it down.

149
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,480
 So he was getting charged with rape, kidnapping, stalking because he was kind of lying and

150
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,840
 waiting and watching to see what her patterns were and murder.

151
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
 And Arson.

152
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
 Did I say Arson?

153
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,160
 Anyways he was charged with all of these different things.

154
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,080
 The question, it was weird.

155
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,000
 The articles didn't ask this question so much.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,120
 I did because you know I'm thinking like paranormal spooky stuff but I can understand

157
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,000
 him dumping the body in the middle of nowhere but why did he take her up to the second story

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,720
 of this haunted hospital?

159
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,280
 Killer just to have to drag her back down the stairs because that's how they found her

160
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
 body.

161
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:41,480
 If he had shot her and just thrown her in the bushes around the same hospital they wouldn't

162
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,920
 have found it.

163
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,800
 At least not in that sequence of events.

164
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,680
 Now again they did get pulled over in the car and Sharon was missing and all that stuff

165
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,120
 but they wouldn't have been able to prove that she was dead for quite a while.

166
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,440
 But he took her upstairs, he shot her and then dragged her back down the stairs so a

167
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
 weird detail.

168
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
 He is a murderer.

169
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
 I mean he is a rapist and a murderer.

170
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,800
 He's not the most sane person on the planet but I thought it was weird.

171
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,880
 What was that part of it?

172
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,040
 So I read that article and I was like wow that's really interesting so because times

173
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,840
 past we can actually see more about the information it's not a breaking news true crime story.

174
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,640
 And then the story gets even crazier.

175
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,960
 Because then I find out what happens next.

176
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,480
 Let's jump ahead to March 2nd 2016.

177
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,480
 So less than a year later.

178
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,920
 Raphael is being held in Warren County jail.

179
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,560
 The trial is going through the process.

180
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,840
 I don't even know if it's gone to trial at this point but you know lawyers are talking

181
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,520
 and prosecutors are talking and stuff like that.

182
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,920
 March 2nd 2016 Raphael who's being held in the Warren County jail gets a shiv, overpowers

183
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,480
 a guard and escapes from the county jail.

184
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,280
 This man who murdered a 69 year old woman is now loose in the city with nothing to lose

185
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,840
 because he's facing horrifying charges.

186
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,280
 There is a massive manhunt for him.

187
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,480
 March 10th 2016, 8 days later.

188
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,400
 There's a guy, this is still in the Vicksburg area, this guy comes out of his house to get

189
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:33,240
 in his car and all of a sudden Raphael runs up to him, puts a shiv to him and says we're

190
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
 going inside.

191
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,080
 And the man's like this is not how I expected my morning to start off.

192
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:46,080
 Raphael leads the man inside of the house where this dude also has his wife and his 5 year

193
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,960
 old son.

194
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:55,440
 Raphael ties up the dad, ties up the mom, throws them in the bathroom.

195
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,840
 At some point the mom gets permission to leave the bathroom.

196
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,960
 I don't know exactly why he did it.

197
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,480
 I'm glad that he did considering how this story turns out it does have an ending.

198
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,160
 But he allows the woman to leave the bathroom and she leaves and he's still in there with

199
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,960
 the dad, the husband.

200
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,600
 And Raphael, because he's a lunatic, begins stabbing the dude.

201
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,000
 He's tied up, he's tied up still.

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,840
 He begins stabbing the dude, stabs him in the shoulder.

203
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,400
 The mom, they don't reveal these people's names in the newspaper, but the mom comes

204
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,800
 in holding a firearm she went.

205
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,600
 I don't know what excuse she used to leave the bathroom, but I'm glad that she was able

206
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 to.

207
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,040
 She comes in with a gun, begins shooting at Raphael.

208
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,120
 And they're in this really small bathroom, but she misses him.

209
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,320
 But she shoots at Raphael.

210
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,600
 She frees her husband.

211
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,000
 She hands the gun to her husband.

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,280
 And he executes Raphael in the bathroom.

213
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,360
 Crazy, crazy story.

214
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,320
 I mean again I use the word execute.

215
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,400
 That's pretty much self defense at that point.

216
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,520
 You've been stabbed.

217
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,840
 This guy's a lunatic, he's already killed one woman.

218
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,960
 I don't even know if they knew who he was, right?

219
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,880
 He just comes in with the homemade knife and is like, "Get in your house, get in your

220
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
 house."

221
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,440
 The dad shoots him to death in the bathroom.

222
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,800
 End of story.

223
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,280
 What a fa- I mean that's just insane story.

224
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,840
 That guy truly was a menace.

225
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,880
 He's running around committing these horrific crimes.

226
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,360
 He's taking family sausages.

227
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,320
 He kidnaps this woman and rapes and kills her.

228
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
 Horrible.

229
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,400
 And it's interesting because this memorial hospital, this haunted hospital stood there

230
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,560
 for years and years and years.

231
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
 Empty.

232
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,880
 Ghost hunters are showing up.

233
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,080
 Like I said, it's considered one of the most haunted locations in Missouri.

234
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,040
 In 2019 they demolished it.

235
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,160
 They knocked it down.

236
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,400
 They said, "We're not going to let this lot go to waste.

237
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
 We're going to build something else here."

238
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,320
 A lot of times you have these haunted locations knocked down for economic reasons.

239
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,320
 But I think this was also partially this legacy, right?

240
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,920
 You had this guy who committed this heinous crime at this location and that probably did

241
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,600
 speed things up because it was empty for so long.

242
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,480
 And you just had, you know, every so often you have a security crew sweep it or something

243
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,960
 like that and you'd appear in all these ghost hunter shows and YouTube channels and stuff

244
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,600
 like that.

245
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,160
 And yeah, they ended up demolishing it in 2019.

246
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
 They smashed it down.

247
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,320
 I don't know if there's anything there in that location right now.

248
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
 What a crazy story.

249
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,320
 It does suck.

250
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,720
 I mean, outside of the true crime element, when you have a place that is regarded as

251
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,160
 extremely haunted, improvably haunted, you can get all these EVPs and all of these weird

252
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,320
 photographs and video footage and stuff like that.

253
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,400
 And it's demolished, right?

254
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,280
 In a paranormal world, that's the equivalent of, you know, finding a burial site of a long

255
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,880
 lost group of people.

256
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,320
 Just smashing the bones and putting up a tract house.

257
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,960
 Like I understand why, obviously.

258
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,560
 You need to build stuff there that people are going to use.

259
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,880
 You can't have a building there just for ghost hunters.

260
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,400
 But you know what?

261
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,600
 Maybe if there is a building right now, it's haunted by the ghosts of insane patients of

262
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,360
 a hospital that's all we can hope for.

263
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,080
 Sega, Metzi, Mogomotzi, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter we

264
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
 are leaving behind Mississippi.

265
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,080
 Fly us all the way out.

266
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,720
 To a basketball court.

267
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,520
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

268
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,400
 And at this basketball court, we don't have this guy's name, so we're going to go ahead

269
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,900
 and call him Michael.

270
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,440
 Michael is sitting there and he's dribbling a ball and he's looking at the hoop and he

271
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
 throws it up.

272
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,600
 I can't do a sound effect for a ball in a hoop.

273
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,600
 And we're like, "Hey bro, you want to play some one on one?"

274
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
 He's like, "Yeah, sure."

275
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,320
 And I'm like, "I'm not going to basketball either now, all of a sudden you're playing."

276
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,400
 I'm like, "I have $100 going on you buddy, keep playing."

277
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
 You're all sweaty and stuff.

278
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,840
 You're like, "Dude, I'm wearing slacks right now trying to make all these shots."

279
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:07,280
 And as I'm enjoying your discomfort, Michael, you notice as he's playing the game, he seems

280
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,760
 decent, or I use decent basketball player, but you notice like every so often he goes

281
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,080
 up for a shot and you're like, "That's weird."

282
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,600
 I could have sworn he was shorter.

283
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,840
 A couple minutes ago.

284
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,800
 And he gives you a little wink and then he does like this cool double back basketball

285
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,920
 move on you and he makes another shot and you're like, "Wow, dude, this guy's totally

286
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
 tongueing on me.

287
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,560
 I hope Jason didn't really bet any money on me."

288
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,640
 And you see him, he's like, "Oh dude, yeah, you want to keep going, you want to keep

289
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
 going."

290
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,800
 You realize, "Wow, I'm looking right at this dude and I swear, I don't know how this is

291
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 impossible, he's taller mid-sense."

292
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,560
 Like as I'm looking at this guy, he's growing at least an inch or two.

293
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,720
 And I'm walking down from the stands and I go, "That is why we're here.

294
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
 That is why we're here."

295
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:04,200
 You see Michael over there has unlocked the secret to growing taller.

296
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,240
 Now Michael says, "Listen, I have a lot of body issues.

297
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,120
 I have a lot of issues with my parents and things like that, but the one thing that people

298
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,880
 who know me very closely know that I'm the most self-conscious about is my height.

299
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,920
 I've always been self-conscious about my height."

300
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,840
 And what I did, I tried everything right.

301
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,040
 You do all the spine stretching exercises, you do the yoga, you do maybe you're looking

302
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,560
 into the medical treatment where they're breaking your legs.

303
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,120
 You're like, "Okay, no, I look too far, I don't want to go that far."

304
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,080
 But I want to be taller and I'm looking at all this stuff that I could positively do.

305
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,800
 Michael then stumbles across YouTube videos and things like that about using hypnosis

306
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,400
 to become taller.

307
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,600
 And that takes him down the path of the law of attraction.

308
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,120
 He goes, "Can you actually, if you can law of attraction a more successful life, if

309
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,320
 you can law of attraction a suitable partner, you can law of attraction a better job, but

310
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,200
 could you law of attraction growing taller?"

311
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,640
 And he starts to find case after case after case after case after case of people who claim

312
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,960
 that they can do this.

313
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,280
 He starts to find these stories about people who are using the law of attraction to physically

314
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,760
 change their bodies.

315
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,840
 And not just their height, like that's what he's concerned about, right?

316
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,520
 He just wants to be taller.

317
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:43,560
 But he starts to find reports of people growing bigger breasts or bigger penis.

318
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,680
 Skin is clearer than it used to be.

319
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,280
 Their nose is smaller.

320
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:58,640
 Some people say they've even been able to use it to beat back baldness and even regenerate

321
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,360
 body parts.

322
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,560
 Now it's funny, if I told you that, right?

323
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,000
 If I told you the law of attraction was capable of doing these things, they do get more and

324
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,240
 more incredulous, right?

325
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,480
 I think there's a big difference between enhancing your boobs through the law of attraction, getting

326
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,720
 a bigger dick, versus growing back a finger.

327
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,280
 And that opens up a whole question about what the law of attraction is capable of.

328
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:36,240
 If you are in prison, can you law of attraction yourself out of the prison?

329
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,400
 The idea of the law of attraction is to see what is real in front of you and not to believe

330
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,120
 it.

331
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,480
 To create a mental image that is more powerful than reality.

332
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,680
 So I think it would be hard to be in prison.

333
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
 It wouldn't be impossible.

334
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,000
 I mean, short answer to this.

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,640
 It wouldn't be impossible.

336
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:01,320
 You would have to believe you are out of prison so truly that you are now out of prison.

337
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,560
 But you're having your scheduled lunch, right?

338
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,320
 Everyone has to go into the mess hall to eat.

339
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,440
 And then you have your work time.

340
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,920
 Slave labor really is what it is.

341
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,400
 But you go in there and you work for 14 cents an hour.

342
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,760
 And then you have like checks, bed checks.

343
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,160
 And then you have head counts.

344
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,960
 And it's 10 p.m. and the lights are off and everyone goes to sleep and all this stuff.

345
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,400
 And so it's so regimented that even if you were able to convince yourself you were no

346
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,320
 longer in prison, eeeh, that alarm goes off and then everyone has to get up out of their

347
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,080
 cots and stand up as the guards come through.

348
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,400
 It's so heavily regulated, it would be hard.

349
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:44,320
 It's almost like there was a constant reminder that you are in prison.

350
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,000
 It's almost like you are not given enough time to truly concentrate on the idea that

351
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 you're not in prison.

352
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,360
 Now, those things are there to keep some sense of order in these institutions.

353
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:04,480
 But is it possible that these types of constant reminders that you are locked up may be a

354
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,960
 way to defeat something like the law of attraction?

355
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,120
 To make sure people don't just believe themselves out of prison.

356
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,120
 You know Jason, that's ridiculous.

357
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,320
 Obviously those things are the afternoon head counts, otherwise people are escaping.

358
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,640
 Just a story about a guy who escaped.

359
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,560
 So let's look at the guy who's missing two fingers.

360
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
 Simple thing, right?

361
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
 You're missing two fingers.

362
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
 You can still game.

363
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
 You're good, right?

364
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,920
 As long as I'm only losing my pinky and my ring finger, I can hold a controller, I can

365
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
 lose them on both hands.

366
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
 I'm totally fine.

367
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
 I can still play video games.

368
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
 I'm good.

369
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,320
 But let's say I was self-conscious about it.

370
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:50,640
 Could I be able to look at my hand and believe that those two fingers are actually there?

371
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,320
 Could I regrow those fingers?

372
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,800
 You would have to believe more than anything that they were there.

373
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 Could you do it?

374
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,120
 Because you're constantly seeing that they're not, and you're constantly getting the sensation

375
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,320
 that they're not there.

376
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,080
 Or lack of sensation, really.

377
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,680
 At the same time, I'm a huge believer in the law of attraction when it comes to exercise

378
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
 and weightlifting.

379
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,840
 That is something that every bodybuilder will, to every bodybuilder, will tell you you have

380
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
 to visualize.

381
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,000
 You have to eat right, and you have to work out, and you have to do these other things.

382
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,480
 But if you do the other things and you don't visualize yourself in that perfect form, it

383
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,240
 will not work.

384
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,880
 That's bodybuilding, where you can build up to it.

385
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
 Can you regenerate body parts?

386
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,800
 Can you make your nose smaller?

387
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,680
 Can you make your penis bigger?

388
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
 Interesting question, right?

389
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
 Interesting question.

390
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,760
 Michael, like I said, though, is really, really concerned about his height.

391
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,720
 And he says, "Listen, I've been self-conscious about it since I was a teenager, and he was

392
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,120
 willing to do the weirdo leg-breaking stuff."

393
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,520
 He goes, "I was willing to pay any price to be taller."

394
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
 He's reading all this stuff.

395
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
 He's doing all this research.

396
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,280
 He's collecting reports.

397
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,040
 Because now he believes, "Wow, this is actually possible, and not only do I want to try it,

398
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,000
 I want to help other people try it too."

399
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,120
 In 2011, he meets a 25-year-old woman who went by the internet name Zexia.

400
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:30,520
 And she said, using meditation and breathing practices, she was able to grow four inches.

401
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,520
 That's exactly what he was looking for.

402
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
 He's finally finding...

403
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,680
 I mean, yeah, he's walking around with a bigger penis and a smaller nose, but he really wants

404
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,840
 that height.

405
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,280
 He finally finds someone who's talking about becoming taller.

406
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,360
 And he continues to collect these reports.

407
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,560
 He's really digging into the law of attraction culture.

408
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,600
 He's a part of all of these Facebook groups that deal with the secret and the law of attraction

409
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,200
 and all of this.

410
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,800
 He meets another guy who got taller, four inches, four inches taller, using the law of attraction

411
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,160
 and nofap.

412
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,520
 He just stopped masturbating.

413
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,480
 And he believed that he could channel his sexual energy into height.

414
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,720
 It's a very interesting thing.

415
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,600
 You see this a lot in the law of attraction communities.

416
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
 The question...

417
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
 You see this question...

418
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,960
 So, I love the law of attraction.

419
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,320
 Like, whether or not it's a thought experiment or it actually works, which I believe it does

420
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
 work.

421
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,040
 It's very, very interesting.

422
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,560
 I save it so often and I really, I save it so often.

423
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,400
 Every day, every day when I'm looking at these law of attraction communities, somebody will

424
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:45,160
 ask the question, "Does masturbating affect me manifesting?

425
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,800
 Does masturbation or any sort of sexual activity negatively affect my ability to use law of

426
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
 attraction?"

427
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,440
 And every day I see the exact same answer.

428
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,800
 It does if you believe it will.

429
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,480
 If you believe that masturbation and law of attraction are completely opposite things,

430
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,520
 then they will have no effect on each other.

431
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,920
 But if you do believe there's a connection, then they will affect each other because you're

432
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,600
 manifesting that connection.

433
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,560
 It's very, very interesting philosophy.

434
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:22,720
 But anyways, for this guy, this guy here, his name, his internet name was Lightning Coq.

435
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,360
 The Lightning must have been shut off for a while because he got four inches taller by

436
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,080
 using law of attraction and nofap.

437
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,720
 These are two of the standout people that he talked about.

438
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,200
 He listed quite a few others and he has taken all of the reports he's assembled over the

439
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,560
 years and he's put them in a drop box.

440
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,440
 I'll actually put all these links in the show notes.

441
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,320
 You can take a look at this if you're more interested in seeing on how to use the law

442
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,320
 of attraction to reshape your body.

443
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,720
 He's been collecting this because he's like, "If this can help me, then I want to be able

444
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,960
 to help others as well."

445
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,920
 And I'm looking at all these reports and these people are saying that it helped them.

446
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,840
 So maybe there is something to this.

447
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,440
 And Michael started to realize he's seen a very disturbing pattern.

448
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,640
 When people go online and talk about them using the law of attraction to modify their

449
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:14,880
 bodies, they disappear.

450
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,240
 Zixia and Michael spoke for a while and then she completely cut off all communication with

451
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,160
 him, went radio silent.

452
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:29,120
 A lot of these other people, according to Michael, after they had posted their results,

453
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,040
 disappeared from the internet.

454
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:39,560
 We've been robbed of the future knowledge that Lightning Cock could have given us.

455
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,280
 Michael begins to notice this and he can't, he doesn't really think anything.

456
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,240
 People leave the internet all the time.

457
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,160
 People stop going to Reddit because they've recovered from their brain injury and they

458
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,840
 realize it's a garbage website.

459
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,360
 People disappear from the internet all the time, whether they just stop responding to

460
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
 emails.

461
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,860
 That's the most worrisome, right, when someone stops responding to emails.

462
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,240
 But when someone just stops updating their Facebook, I mean, then they've just stopped

463
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
 updating their Facebook.

464
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,560
 They're doing something more important.

465
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,760
 But Michael realized this was an issue.

466
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,840
 Again, at first couple times you go, "Oh, you know, people just leave the internet."

467
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,480
 And he had seen this girl, this Russian girl talking about how she had used the law of

468
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,280
 attraction to make her nose smaller.

469
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,480
 And she posted photos of her nose.

470
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,720
 He saved the photos because at this point he's collecting, he has this huge repository

471
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,880
 of stuff.

472
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,040
 He saves these photos.

473
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,640
 And then she also disappears.

474
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,520
 She stops posting anything online.

475
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,720
 She's not responding to any communications.

476
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
 She's gone.

477
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,880
 Michael's like, "What could this possibly be?

478
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,280
 Why are these people just leaving?"

479
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,960
 Like they're in a group that's dedicated towards this practice.

480
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,400
 And it's not a huge thing, right?

481
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
 This is a pretty niche thing.

482
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,480
 It's not like they're like, "I'm gonna go over to the other law of attraction group."

483
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,280
 I mean, there's more than one.

484
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
 But you know what I mean?

485
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,200
 It's not a super common group.

486
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,040
 Especially, you know, there's a lot of people who believe in it and they can't manifest

487
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,120
 anything and they quit.

488
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,080
 These are people who are actually having success stories and they're sharing success

489
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,000
 stories with other people who are having success stories.

490
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,080
 She posts the photos.

491
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,560
 She stops popping up online.

492
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,840
 Michael saved the photos and then a couple weeks later posted them in a Facebook group

493
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,000
 dedicated to law of attraction.

494
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,320
 He goes, "Hey, you know, there is this girl from Rache.

495
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,160
 She said she used this to make her nose smaller.

496
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,000
 Look at this."

497
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,440
 He said two days after I posted those photos, that Russian girl popped back online specifically

498
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,040
 to message me.

499
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,760
 She contacted him and said, "Take the photos down.

500
00:29:52,760 --> 00:30:03,200
 I don't want them up and don't ever, ever share them with anyone ever again."

501
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,480
 And then she just disappears again.

502
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
 He did take the photos down.

503
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
 They're not in the drop box.

504
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,840
 That's not any of the stuff he posted online after the fact.

505
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,520
 He told her he would take them down and he did.

506
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,120
 So he goes, "I don't know what's happening."

507
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,160
 He posted this online back on January 19th, 2020.

508
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,440
 He goes, "I don't know what's happening.

509
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,960
 This is so weird and I don't know what to make of it."

510
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,160
 He posted this in the Neville Goddard subreddit.

511
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,480
 Neville Goddard is a big proponent.

512
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,080
 One of the major figures of the new law of attraction.

513
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,840
 He was in the '40s, '50s era.

514
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,960
 I'm more of the old school 1890s to 1920s manifestation stuff.

515
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,320
 I'm a hipster when it comes to the law of attraction.

516
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,360
 I'm not a huge fan of Goddard specifically, but in the Neville Goddard subreddit.

517
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,560
 And he posted it as, "I'm sharing all my success reports about height increase and changing

518
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,200
 physical appearance."

519
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,360
 He posted this drop box link and he's talking about all the stuff.

520
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,160
 And then he mentions in it, "This is a weird aside.

521
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,440
 It wasn't his main reason for talking about it in the first place."

522
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,960
 He goes, "But it is weird that everyone who talks about this disappears."

523
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
 But here you go.

524
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,560
 These are all the resources I found.

525
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,920
 He does have a couple theories of what could actually be happening.

526
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,280
 He goes, "On the one hand, you could have..."

527
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,400
 These are both super valid theories.

528
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,920
 I'm not saying that they're true, but they're both...

529
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,560
 I can see either one happening.

530
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,280
 One, reality is a collective experience.

531
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,000
 Everyone is experiencing what we consider to be reality at the same time.

532
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,840
 And it's very tenuous what reality actually is, but there's this what he calls the collective

533
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,000
 unconscious.

534
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,080
 And if you have people spark out of it, right?

535
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,640
 The law of attraction that you use to get a better job, to find a better partner for

536
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,360
 you, to get a newer car, to get what you need.

537
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,960
 But most of the time, these are fairly relatively small requests in the grand scale of the universe.

538
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,160
 So it would be growing back your fingers and having bigger boobs, but it could be such a

539
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,560
 shock to the system because we expect people over time to get better jobs and to find people

540
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,600
 who are suited towards them, to have loving partners.

541
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,960
 We expect these things to happen.

542
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,680
 We hope they happen.

543
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:36,040
 And if Joey from Work Showed up one day and he has an arm, he didn't have an arm Tuesday,

544
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:42,920
 that's a huge shock to the system, to the unconscious reality that we've all created.

545
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:50,160
 So it was impossible that if you law of attraction in your body in an incredibly radical way,

546
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:58,160
 that the collective unconscious of the universe affects you.

547
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,160
 It makes you in a way that makes you either...

548
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
 Well, so it's...

549
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
 I don't even...

550
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,840
 Because the thing is, is like we have the example with the Russian girl, she disappeared

551
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,240
 but she came back.

552
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,680
 So we can't necessarily say that these people blink out of existence.

553
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,640
 And you can get bigger boobs with a boob job.

554
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:22,240
 You can fix balding with implants, with toupees, or not just shaving it like Jason Statham,

555
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
 right?

556
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
 You can...

557
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,960
 We can make these modifications to your body.

558
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,160
 Other than, you know, regrowing limbs, that's like the most radical change.

559
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,840
 But you could take the theory that if I walked into work one day and I was four inches taller

560
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,960
 and everyone at work couldn't understand how I wasn't that height the day before.

561
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,720
 These are generally gradual changes.

562
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
 I'm...

563
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,040
 This is kind of a strawman argument.

564
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,960
 Zixia, she grew four inches over the course of about a year and a half, which would be

565
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,440
 hard to see.

566
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,720
 But let's say that you didn't notice it and then one day I walked in and you're like,

567
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,880
 "Dude, how are you four inches taller?"

568
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,200
 It's like, "Oh, well, over the past year and a half I stopped masturbating and here

569
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,600
 I am."

570
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
 Is it such a shock to the collective unconscious that you actually...

571
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,480
 I don't want to say get blinked out of reality, but you're a star that's shining so bright

572
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,000
 the universe has to dole it somehow.

573
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,840
 Because otherwise it's just drawing too much attention to it.

574
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,840
 But then again, we have people who do do radical body transformations.

575
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,560
 You can modify your body and all certs away within a 24 hour period.

576
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,440
 Walk in with a full face tattoo and you don't just disappear in front of everybody.

577
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,400
 And then the idea with bodybuilders and stuff like that.

578
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:39,960
 But again, imagine if your coworker walked in tomorrow and he was a full on 1980s oiled

579
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,200
 up bodybuilder.

580
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,600
 Like just raw muscle, like 2% body fat.

581
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,920
 You're like, "Bro, what happened?

582
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,840
 He's like a lob attraction."

583
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:53,240
 It would be unreal.

584
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,840
 You wouldn't be able to process it.

585
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,320
 Mindfuls, he goes floating in your building.

586
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,080
 So we have that theory.

587
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,680
 We have that theory, but even like that theory, like how does it end?

588
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,360
 Because these people don't disappear.

589
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,760
 The Russian girl popped back up and she said, "Take the photos down.

590
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,440
 Don't ever share them with anyone again."

591
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,680
 And then disappeared again.

592
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,840
 Which makes us say that they're not actually physically leaving.

593
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,040
 They're not being imprisoned in some sort of way.

594
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:24,040
 But maybe they're being threatened.

595
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,720
 Maybe they're being threatened to be silent.

596
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,240
 And that gives us the second scenario, which is what I talked about in the intro of the

597
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,440
 show and most likely titled the episode along the same lines.

598
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,680
 Is there a secret government group that monitors this?

599
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,920
 And really it's for the same reason as the collective unconscious theory, right?

600
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,000
 If you knew for a fact.

601
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,720
 Let's say that we'll give it a year and a half.

602
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:56,400
 Your coworker walks in and he is four inches taller than he was last year.

603
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,040
 He's not in middle school, right?

604
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,960
 You're not working out of middle school.

605
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,480
 He's four inches taller.

606
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,240
 Your guys are all working investment banking.

607
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,400
 And you go, "Dude, how in the world did you grow four inches?"

608
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,480
 And you're checking his shoes.

609
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,680
 You're making him strip down, checking him for scars on his legs.

610
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,120
 He goes, "I swear, please let me put my clothes back on.

611
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,800
 I swear I used the law of attraction to do this.

612
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:24,440
 I believed that I was taller and I refused all information to the contrary.

613
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,080
 I want to hold all the carnival rides I wanted to and nobody could tell me that that seatbelt

614
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
 wouldn't hold me.

615
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:37,200
 I believed that I was taller and whenever I came across any sort of information, any

616
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,520
 sort of real world scenario where I should have realized I wasn't six foot three or whatever,

617
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,200
 I ignored it.

618
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
 Totally ignored it.

619
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,320
 I believed that I was six foot three when I was really five foot eleven and now I'm six

620
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,120
 foot three."

621
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,280
 You know for a fact this isn't Fruit of the Loom, Cornucopia.

622
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,240
 You and him took photos next to all these yardsticks one day.

623
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,200
 It's a weird place you work for, a weird investment banking firm.

624
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,180
 You know for a fact that a year and a half ago he was four inches shorter.

625
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:19,480
 You know that for a fact and now you're looking at him and he's four inches taller.

626
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,640
 What would that do to you?

627
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,120
 And then Betty comes in, her nose is smaller, you're like, "Did you get a nose job?"

628
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,780
 She's like, "No, law of attraction."

629
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:33,840
 You would be seeing physical proof that through thought alone, not just really thought, you're

630
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:43,020
 believing what is opposite of the real that you can change everything.

631
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,840
 It would be incredibly dangerous.

632
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:55,480
 Imagine if you had a major world religion that was scientifically provable, observably

633
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,080
 true.

634
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,560
 Just one.

635
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,320
 And every other religion talked about faith and talked about, well, we'll get our rewards

636
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,880
 in the afterlife and stuff like that.

637
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:16,220
 But there was one religion, worldwide religion that was absolutely identifiably true.

638
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:21,480
 You could take the most ardent atheist and say, "Remember that statue?

639
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
 Remember that statue?

640
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,600
 It was only five foot nine a year ago.

641
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
 We didn't modify it.

642
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,680
 Now look how big that statue is."

643
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,520
 And if that's what it is, and that would be what would be happening, if we have dozens

644
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,620
 of reports of these people changing their bodies, what if there were evidence of hundreds

645
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,320
 of people, of thousands, of millions of people using something as simple as a law of attraction

646
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,920
 that is really not that simple?

647
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,040
 Because again, you have to look at reality and discard it and then substitute your own

648
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,280
 on top of it, which is really hard.

649
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,280
 It's really hard to walk into your own dirty bathroom and go, "I live in a mansion."

650
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,320
 And then you have to do it constantly.

651
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:15,480
 But if you can achieve it, you can be taller, richer, more powerful, more good looking, whatever

652
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,920
 you wanted.

653
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:24,520
 And the governments of the world don't want you to be those things.

654
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:30,360
 Now I'm not going to, so let me back up because the way I stated that was pretty, I don't know

655
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,880
 if this conspiracy theory is true, right?

656
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,840
 I'm just like putting ourselves in the shoes of Michael.

657
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,160
 I could, one, I could see a government doing something like this.

658
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,040
 Governments don't work if everyone is in the top 1%.

659
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,760
 It's unfortunate, but governments have to have the downtrodden.

660
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,280
 I'm not a borderline anarchist.

661
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,640
 I'm trying not to go off on a rant.

662
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
 But you know what I mean?

663
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,600
 You do have to have, and it's a horrible part, and I wish we lived in a Star Trek utopia.

664
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
 I really do.

665
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,720
 And maybe someday we'll get there through the law of attraction.

666
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,560
 But you can't have everyone driving the nicest cars and eating the...

667
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,400
 Again, I'm saying this stuff.

668
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
 I'm not defending it.

669
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,720
 I wish we could, but a government wouldn't allow that.

670
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,680
 A government needs to have the downtrodden.

671
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,360
 A government needs to have the other, the people that you hate.

672
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,560
 The government needs to have all these things to function.

673
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,600
 And if you just had someone go, "Hey, did you pay your taxes this year?"

674
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,640
 You're like, "No, I love attraction, then."

675
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,200
 They don't even know, they don't even know that I work at this company anymore.

676
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
 And you're like, "What are you talking about?"

677
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,440
 You're like, "Love attraction, bro."

678
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,200
 In the IRS, they're sitting at their office and they're like, "They literally don't have

679
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
 the paperwork for this guy."

680
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:52,120
 If the law of attraction is being used at such a level where people are just disobeying

681
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,640
 laws and they're like, "Well, sure.

682
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
 Sure, your honor.

683
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
 I killed all those people.

684
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,840
 I did kill all those people.

685
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
 Or did I?"

686
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
 And the judge is like, "Oh, no.

687
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,640
 Are you one of those law of attraction guys?

688
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,400
 They're worse than sovereign citizens."

689
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,480
 The deeper you would get into the system, the harder it would be, obviously.

690
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,840
 We know that we have to pay taxes.

691
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,160
 We know that if we kill a bunch of people, we go to jail or at least go to court.

692
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,800
 You'll get off.

693
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,000
 But it would make sense for there to be a secret government group that was shutting

694
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,320
 down evidence of this.

695
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,600
 I think honestly, if a religion popped up all of a sudden and you had a Messiah who was

696
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,960
 working miracles, and I don't think this is a stretch.

697
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,520
 I think most people would agree with me.

698
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,160
 But all of a sudden, in the middle of the Yucatan, you had this dude show up and he starts performing

699
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,200
 these miracles and he's bringing people back from the dead and he's assembling this congregation

700
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:51,320
 and that dude is deader than a doornail eight months after he starts doing all this stuff.

701
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,240
 Somebody, someone high up is going to take that dude out.

702
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,320
 If you had a miracle worker who's actually performing miracles, they are not long for

703
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,520
 the world.

704
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,280
 They also better be a psychic because some CIA goon is going to be dispatched to put

705
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,760
 a bullet in his head.

706
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,360
 So I could honestly see that the government would be trying to shut this stuff down.

707
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,720
 I don't know, right?

708
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,760
 We're just, we're basing this off of Michael's information and it's interesting because these

709
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,920
 people, as far as we can tell, aren't being executed.

710
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,360
 If anything, they're just being told, "Take the stuff down."

711
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,680
 Or we will execute you.

712
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,040
 There's a little laser beam on them whenever they log into a messenger.

713
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,440
 They're like, "Huh?"

714
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,480
 I don't know if this conspiracy theory is true.

715
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
 I think it's awesome.

716
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,160
 Not awesome if it's true, but I'm really digging this conspiracy theory.

717
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,200
 There's a secret government group that's silencing people who have proof that the law

718
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,400
 of attraction works.

719
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,600
 When Katy Perry's like, "Yeah, I always knew I was going to be a big singer when I grew

720
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,920
 up," or Eminem's like, "Yeah, I cut out all the pages of Source Magazine.

721
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,120
 I had them up all over my room and every night before I went to bed, I knew I was going to

722
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
 be a huge rapper."

723
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,480
 And then he's a huge rapper.

724
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,840
 That's so abstract because we also know that these guys sweated and they worked their way

725
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
 up.

726
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,160
 A lot of people think Katy Perry's the same worshiper, but you know what I mean?

727
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,680
 They did use law of attraction.

728
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,960
 Most of the people you see in the media, whether on purpose or on accidentally, I don't think

729
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,040
 when Marshall Mathers was sitting down every night before he went to bed looking at all

730
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,560
 these pages of the Source Magazine, that is the law of attraction.

731
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,680
 The most powerful part of law of attraction is actually doing it right before you go to

732
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,760
 sleep.

733
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,160
 He manifested that.

734
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,000
 I honestly believe that, but that's so abstract.

735
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,960
 It's not like someone's going to take him out because it also included a lot of hard

736
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,960
 work.

737
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,280
 And again, you could go, "Well, yeah, you know, someone's got to be a rapper," right?

738
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,920
 So it makes sense.

739
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,680
 And it could be, again, like going to that prison example, it's so regulated to keep

740
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,640
 knocking you back into reality.

741
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,240
 So you don't have a chance to manifest yourself out of prison.

742
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,960
 And I don't mean physically like you're in jail cell one day and the next day you're

743
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,960
 standing outside.

744
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,040
 Like you're like, "Woohoo!

745
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,520
 You can manifest it."

746
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,880
 So take the prison example and then we're going to wrap it up.

747
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,320
 Let's say you're in prison for killing somebody and you don't believe you're in prison.

748
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,720
 You 100% don't believe you're in prison.

749
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,400
 You would manifest the reality where your lawyer found out that one of the jurors hated

750
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
 you.

751
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,480
 Like, it was your bully from elementary school.

752
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,240
 You didn't recognize him because he beat you so badly.

753
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,360
 And then the lawyer's like, "Oh my God, we can do a retrial on this."

754
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,440
 And then at this point, 10 years, 15 years have passed since the crime.

755
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,640
 The prosecutor's like, "Okay, you know, we did murder somebody, but..."

756
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,200
 And then you're out.

757
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,240
 There is a mechanism behind it.

758
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,320
 It wouldn't be that you just appear outside prison because then you're just an escaped

759
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
 convict.

760
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,640
 They're just going to get you again.

761
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,800
 But you could just believe you're not in prison and then the universe takes care of

762
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,480
 everything else.

763
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,320
 Law of attraction I find absolutely fascinating.

764
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,240
 This conspiracy theory is badass.

765
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,240
 I think this is dope.

766
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,800
 I mean, I guess I shouldn't say that as much as I talk about law of attraction and how

767
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,600
 much it works.

768
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,000
 But I love this conspiracy theory.

769
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,280
 Is the government taking out people who have physical proof that the law of attraction

770
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:23,400
 works because they need to maintain the "reality" that gives them power?

771
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,280
 That's an awesome conspiracy theory.

772
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,720
 I've never heard of it before until Michael posted it.

773
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,800
 I would love to see if Michael's dug up some more information on this stuff.

774
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,840
 I'd love to talk to Michael just even through email to see what other information he's pulled

775
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,040
 up not just from the conspiracy side, but other people who have used the law of attraction

776
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,600
 to physically change their body.

777
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,560
 I'd really like to read about the guy who re-grew body parts.

778
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,160
 I'd love to find out more.

779
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,080
 But guess what?

780
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:21,920
 Michael is missing.

781
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,920
 He's missing.

782
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:35,240
 He's missing.

783
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:42,160
 He's missing.

784
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:50,080
 He's missing.

785
00:46:50,080 --> 00:47:00,080
