1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
 When a young woman steps on a human tooth while walking through her living room, she's

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,680
 forced to ask herself the question, "What in the world?

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,560
 How did this get here?

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,840
 Whose tooth is this?

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,520
 This is a grown adult's tooth."

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,040
 And that leads us on a bizarre journey into the world of the paranormal and perverted

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,040
 dentists.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,960
 And then we meet a young man who stumbles across an illegal video on a porn site.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,480
 And doing what any good citizen should do, he reported it to law enforcement.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,200
 But when the psychic spies and the black helicopters began to follow him home, he realized he made

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,360
 a grave mistake.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:55,520
 And today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,840
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
 day too.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,760
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun, I hope you guys don't have a problem hearing

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,960
 stories about human teeth and teeth falling out.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,960
 Because if you do, this first segment is not for you.

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,240
 So before we even get started, longtime supporters of the show probably not anymore since they're

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,120
 part of the Notorious Teeth episode, Walking Into Dead Rabbit Command, generous, generous

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,920
 contributors during the Thanksgiving livestream.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,960
 Everybody give it up for Nick Buston and Helena.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
 Woohoo!

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,000
 Yeah, come on into Dead Rabbit Command.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Helena?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,520
 One of the two.

27
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
 I'm pretty sure it's Helena.

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
 I get it wrong every single time.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,920
 Anyways, Nick Buston and Helena, you guys are going to be our captains, our pilot this

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
 episode.

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,760
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,560
 Just helps her out the word about Dead Rabbit Radio, that really, really helps out so much.

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,280
 So Nick and Helena, let's go ahead and toss you guys the, oh here's a new one, the rabbit

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,040
 water skis.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,160
 Helena and Nick, we're going to strap into these rabbit water skis.

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,120
 We're going to go on a journey out of Dead Rabbit Command.

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,320
 Ski us all the way out too.

38
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,040
 An old house in the middle of the field.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
 Wee!

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
 Wee!

41
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
 Wee!

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,120
 Think of another sound effect for skis, right?

43
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,560
 I don't know what skis sound like, I've never been skiing.

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,040
 We get out there to this old field.

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,800
 This is a story that I found online, so we don't have the real name, we don't have an

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 exact location.

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,560
 We do have some exact dates though, which is pretty cool.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,120
 It was posted online by someone going by the handle Scary News 314, which we're going to

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
 call her Pamela.

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,520
 She says, so where she lives, there is a field that a long time ago her grandpa built this

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,680
 house in the middle of this field on this plot of land.

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,960
 And the house burned down in 2018.

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,920
 House is gone, but now the family lives in a double wide trailer on this property.

54
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,080
 So this is the location of this story.

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,120
 It's May 1st, 2021.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,520
 Pamela, who I believe is a teenager, late teenager, is walking through her living room and all

57
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,000
 of a sudden, ow!

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 What?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,280
 I just stepped on something in my living room.

60
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,520
 She looks down and she sees underneath her bare foot a human tooth.

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,600
 She picks it up, she's looking at it.

62
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,680
 And this is a large tooth.

63
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,480
 She said it looked like a molar and it was an adult tooth.

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,480
 Now her and her sister, they've already lost all their teeth.

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,960
 They're way too old to be losing baby teeth.

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,720
 And the mom and the dad are definitely too old to be losing baby teeth.

67
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,960
 She's sitting there and she's looking at this molar and she's like, where did this come

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
 from?

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
 So she asks around.

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,080
 Mom, dad, did you guys lose any teeth today?

71
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,120
 Well, look at this.

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,240
 I found a tooth in the middle of the carpet.

73
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,440
 And none of the parents, the sister, nobody lost the tooth that day or any of the previous

74
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
 days.

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,320
 This large adult tooth just appeared out of nowhere.

76
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,720
 That would be a mystery in and of itself.

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,240
 That would be one of the most shocking, oh okay, maybe that's happened enough too much.

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,160
 This is the most amazing story ever on this podcast.

79
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,040
 If I was walking around and I stepped on a human tooth in my apartment, there would be

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,000
 no logical reason.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,360
 I couldn't even think of something of why there would be a human tooth sitting in the

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,200
 middle of my apartment.

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,400
 My first thing I would think of would be a ghost.

84
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,680
 Be a ghost.

85
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,160
 Drop this tooth off.

86
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,440
 But that's not the end of the story.

87
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,640
 Pamela thought it was, her whole family thought it was.

88
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
 They just thought it was a bizarre.

89
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
 How actually not?

90
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
 How would you sleep at night?

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,520
 How would you even be able to sleep calmly or soundly at night if there was a human tooth

92
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,040
 found in the middle of your house?

93
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,080
 I remember once I said a long time ago on the podcast, what's spookier if you came home

94
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,920
 and let's say you have your throw pillows on your couch.

95
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
 I have two throw pillows on my couch.

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,960
 I go, "What would be creepier if I came home and one of my throw pillows was missing?"

97
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,600
 Or, "If I came home and there was a brand new throw pillow on my couch."

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,240
 What would be creepier?

99
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,840
 I go, "I think it's even."

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,520
 No, it's the second one.

101
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,880
 Because the first one, if something's missing, you can always go, "I must have lost it."

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,240
 It'd be kind of hard to lose a pillow, but I must have lost it.

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,080
 But if there's a new item in your house you know isn't supposed to be there, then that's

104
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,960
 proof that somebody else is walking around in your house.

105
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
 This is that.

106
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
 It's also a toot.

107
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,720
 It's also a living or piece of a living person is now in your house.

108
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,880
 Anyway, somehow these people didn't immediately set fire to their double wide and leave the

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,160
 area.

110
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,120
 They kept living there probably because they don't overreact to finding things.

111
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,520
 Anyway, so they find this human tooth in their living room on May 1st, 2021.

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,280
 Let's fast forward a year and 21 days.

113
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,880
 Oddly enough, we're in May 22nd, 2022.

114
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
 Pamela's dad has taken a shower.

115
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
 He's washing up.

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,440
 Oh yeah, rubbing the soap on his body.

117
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,000
 Yeah, this is how you take a shower, man.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Super relaxing.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's hot.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,920
 Yes, this is the life.

121
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:51,960
 And then, ow, and he looks down.

122
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,400
 He looks down in the shower.

123
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:04,120
 He's just stepped on a tooth, a large adult human tooth in his shower.

124
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,240
 At this point, Pamela's going online.

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,000
 Pamela first posted this on May 22nd was like, "Hey listen, a year ago we found the

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 tooth.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,160
 We kind of just brushed it off."

128
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,040
 No pun intended.

129
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
 But now we found another tooth.

130
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,480
 Like the first one, the first one you could probably excuse, maybe, well you know what

131
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,880
 a lot of people said, maybe rat brought it in.

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,040
 That appears to be a common thing in the middle of nowhere.

133
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,480
 Rats carrying human teeth and depositing them.

134
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,240
 A lot of people said maybe rats are carrying them in, but you know, you might be able to

135
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,000
 write off finding one human tooth in your house that shouldn't be there.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 But now she's found, or the family has found, two human teeth.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,160
 Two human teeth.

138
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,280
 She posts online that day.

139
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,520
 She goes, "I don't know what it is.

140
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,680
 I don't know what's causing this."

141
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,960
 And really, she posted this back on May 22nd, 2022.

142
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,120
 There's been no other posts about it.

143
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,920
 She went back to her normal posting history.

144
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
 So I don't think it's a lark.

145
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,240
 I don't think it's anything like that in ARG.

146
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
 Could be though, right?

147
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,000
 But it's interesting because I was reading that and I think I'm like most people, teeth,

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,240
 anything that has to do with teeth.

149
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,040
 It doesn't gross me out, but I don't like it.

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,240
 Like horror movies where people are getting like their teeth chiseled out or...

151
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
 I'm not going to keep describing.

152
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,440
 I'm not going to keep describing horror movies I've seen where people get their teeth damaged.

153
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,280
 Although the dentist too was pretty good.

154
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,480
 I'm not a big fan of teeth torture.

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,520
 I don't like seeing teeth get pulled out in movies.

156
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,400
 I'm not a fan of teeth being pulled out in real life.

157
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,280
 I just have that as well as like, "Oh, but if I'm there, get those flyers ready."

158
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
 No, I don't like seeing.

159
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
 I think that's pretty normal.

160
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,960
 I think most people don't like teeth destruction.

161
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
 But I read that obviously.

162
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,480
 So this story was like, "Oh, this is gross.

163
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,640
 I want to talk about it on my podcast."

164
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
 But I'm reading the comments.

165
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,280
 I wanted to read what other people were saying about what this could be because I could only

166
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,200
 think paranormal, right?

167
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,280
 I didn't even know rats carried around teeth.

168
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,360
 The Timberlton, the rat has a little necklace of human teeth.

169
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,680
 He drops off every now and then.

170
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,800
 People did say rats carrying in teeth.

171
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
 Maybe they do.

172
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
 Maybe it's in a field, right?

173
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,000
 Their house, their double white is in the middle of a field.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,120
 So that could be.

175
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,080
 Some people said paranormal.

176
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,760
 One person posted a story about they were sitting on the toilet one day and they heard

177
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,200
 a clickety-clack noise.

178
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,760
 Like someone had dropped something.

179
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,440
 And first she thought it was her earring that had fallen off.

180
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,000
 And she looked down and there was a tooth laying there in the middle of the bathroom.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,560
 So it could be a paranormal thing.

182
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,640
 She said they started to see like, "Oh, are they starting to hear a little boy in the

183
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,760
 middle of the night go, 'Boo!'"

184
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,840
 While they were trying to fall asleep.

185
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
 Could be, right?

186
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,320
 That could possibly be it.

187
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,640
 You also had people saying maybe there's like a hobo.

188
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,400
 Maybe there's a bum hiding in the attic.

189
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,440
 And when he walks around in the middle of the night while you're all sleeping, he loses

190
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
 a tooth.

191
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
 He loses a tooth.

192
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,840
 Now they didn't know it was a double white.

193
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,760
 She added that detail later through comments of her own.

194
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,440
 Double white don't have attics.

195
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
 That would actually be, I think, creepier than paranormal.

196
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,720
 I'd rather have a little boy whispering my ear, "Boo!" every now and then to know that

197
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,760
 there's some, to know there's some meth head just feet above my head.

198
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,040
 And in the middle of the night he sneaks out and he's like, "Ah, I eat a piece of food.

199
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,920
 I leave a tooth."

200
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,800
 That is the bum's code.

201
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,400
 That is our currency.

202
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
 We call it Bitcoin.

203
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
 So anyways, anyways.

204
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:45,120
 I was reading all this stuff.

205
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,480
 And then as I'm reading through this stuff, people go, "Maybe it's rat."

206
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,720
 There's a lot of rats that rat-related stuff, honestly.

207
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,000
 Someone goes, "Maybe it's rats carrying the teeth out of the walls and there is this

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 link."

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,040
 I never heard of this.

210
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,760
 Apparently this was a fairly big story.

211
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,880
 This happened back in 20--okay, maybe not a fairly big story.

212
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,000
 There's a lot of stuff going on in 2018.

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,520
 Nick and Helena, let's go ahead and fire up the Jason Jalopy.

214
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,480
 Drive us all the way out to Val Dosta, Georgia.

215
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,920
 It's October 2018.

216
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,640
 These construction workers, they're renovating the TB Converse Building.

217
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,440
 It's a building built in 1900.

218
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,280
 And the first occupant of the building was a dentist named Dr. Clarence Whittington.

219
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,880
 But he's long dead, right?

220
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
 He was working there back in 1900.

221
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
 He's dead.

222
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,160
 The building's getting renovated and these construction workers are like, "Bring the

223
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,120
 Sledgehammer over, Barney.

224
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,880
 Let's take down this wall."

225
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,840
 And on the second floor of this building, they're knocking down a wall and they find--it's an

226
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,140
 estimate, right?

227
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:59,440
 I don't think they sat and counted the amount, but an estimated 1,000 human teeth hidden

228
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,280
 in the wall.

229
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,560
 The construction workers are like, "What in the world is this?

230
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,520
 Like, there are other construction workers.

231
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,880
 They find gold coins in the wall or stacks of cash.

232
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,920
 We found almost 1,000 human teeth coming out of this wall."

233
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,360
 And what's interesting about this--there's so many interesting things about this.

234
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,940
 One, this isn't the first time this has happened in Georgia.

235
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,380
 There are two other cities, Greensboro, Georgia, and Carlton, Georgia, that also have the same

236
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
 thing happened.

237
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,860
 They were historic buildings.

238
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,860
 That long ago, the previous occupant was a dentist.

239
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,540
 And in modern times, when they were renovating them, when they smashed the wall in, they

240
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,220
 found a lot of teeth.

241
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,220
 A lot of teeth.

242
00:12:50,220 --> 00:13:00,420
 And I wasn't able to find--every article that talks about the Valdosta teeth find, they

243
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,940
 always mention--they all mention Greensboro and Carlton, but I wasn't able to find an

244
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,560
 article that predated the Valdosta find, right?

245
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
 All these teeth.

246
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
 It's very interesting.

247
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,940
 They're like, "Oh, this isn't the first time it's happened.

248
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,240
 It happened in these two other cities."

249
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,200
 But I wasn't able to find any articles.

250
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,620
 I wasn't even able to find some exact numbers of how many teeth were found in those walls.

251
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,560
 But then the question is, why are dentists putting teeth in walls?

252
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
 Like is that a thing?

253
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,380
 It's not, by the way, I Googled it.

254
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,160
 It's not like some ancient tradition.

255
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,000
 It's not like a barber has to keep his first lack of hair.

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 No.

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
 It's just some pervert.

258
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,800
 Some pervert was doing this.

259
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,840
 And I also have to ask, a thousand teeth?

260
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:52,040
 I would argue that most modern dentists throughout their career don't pull a thousand teeth.

261
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,960
 I doubt they even see a thousand patients over their career.

262
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,680
 What is a dentist see?

263
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,200
 Three to five people a day.

264
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,800
 So let's say 25 people a week.

265
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,400
 How many of those are getting their teeth pulled?

266
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
 You do the math.

267
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
 You do the math.

268
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,360
 I'm not gonna math.

269
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,040
 I don't know how--and it's old-timey dentist, right?

270
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,200
 So you could go there and be like, "Ah, I got some beef jerky stuck in my teeth."

271
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
 He's like, "Time for a pullin'.

272
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,800
 I'm gonna pull some teeth."

273
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,040
 Like, back in the 1900s, they probably were pulling a lot of teeth, but a thousand of

274
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,280
 them and they're stuffing them in the walls.

275
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,120
 It sounds like some weirdo sex thing.

276
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,320
 It sounds like some serial killer type of thing.

277
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,080
 Anyways, there's three buildings in total in Georgia where they found teeth hidden in

278
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,760
 the walls by a previous dentist.

279
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,520
 So it could just be some weirdo Georgia sex dental cult going on.

280
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,080
 Could be everywhere.

281
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
 Could be everywhere.

282
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,480
 There could be a secret society of dentists that are pulling people's teeth out and putting

283
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,760
 them in the wall.

284
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,000
 So of course, this story took way longer for me to research than I thought it would.

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,120
 I thought I was just gonna read about a girl finding two teeth in her house and how to

286
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,200
 serving that was.

287
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,400
 Of course, I had to type in, "Is there a fetish for teeth?"

288
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,840
 And of course there is.

289
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,880
 Of course there is.

290
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,880
 It's called odontophilia, which makes sense, right?

291
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,680
 Orthodontics, odontophilia.

292
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,320
 And if you ask somebody, like, "You never asked someone this in public?"

293
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,920
 You'd be like, "Hey, what would you think a fetish for teeth would be?"

294
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,200
 And I'm gonna tell you something.

295
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,760
 When I saw this, I never knew this existed, but I'm sure that it did.

296
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,200
 I go, "Fetish for teeth."

297
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,120
 Now it's probably something that I wouldn't expect.

298
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,800
 It's probably because I don't find teeth particularly sexy.

299
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,200
 And no matter what, I remember thinking this as I was typing into Google, I go, "No matter

300
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,760
 what I find, no matter how many BuzzFeed articles or whatever try to sugarcoat this

301
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,920
 and make it seem like it's totally natural, it will involve pulling people's teeth out.

302
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,840
 The 100% will be destructive."

303
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,480
 So I'm Google searching this.

304
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,760
 I find this term odontophilia.

305
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,280
 Sure enough, actually it wasn't BuzzFeed, surprisingly.

306
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,840
 It was minthealth.com did a big interview with someone who has a tooth fetish and they're

307
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,040
 like, "Yeah, dude, pulling them out.

308
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,600
 Pulling out people's teeth gets me off."

309
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,920
 What is that so insane?

310
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,520
 Because you can only do, you have a fetish that really you can only do about 32 times

311
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,480
 and then you're done with the person.

312
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,480
 All their teeth are gone.

313
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,880
 I've never understood destructive fetishes.

314
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,520
 Fetishes are just weird anyways, but those destructive ones where they're like, "I want

315
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,720
 to be eaten alive."

316
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,880
 I was like, "Okay, but we can only do this one time.

317
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
 You're not coming back from this."

318
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:03,120
 Is it possible that you had some crazy fetish sex cult in Georgia of these old-timey dentists

319
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,120
 with the handlebar mustaches and the little dapper hats and they're really just walking

320
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,840
 around being like, "Free dentistry.

321
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
 Free dentistry.

322
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
 Come to my place.

323
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,400
 I mean, it's free, but I will pull all your teeth out."

324
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
 They're like, "What?

325
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,160
 I don't like that last part."

326
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,760
 And they were hiding these teeth on the wall.

327
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,080
 I can't think of another reason why you'd be hiding nearly a thousand teeth in your

328
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
 wall.

329
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,640
 Fascinating story.

330
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,320
 Maybe a couple of you have a tooth fetish.

331
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,000
 Maybe this was your "I want to get reviews" most erotic episode ever.

332
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Creepy story too.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,440
 Fascinating and creepy.

334
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,600
 Where are the teeth coming from in this young girl's house?

335
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
 We may never know.

336
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,800
 I guess the best answer is, I guess the best answer is rats are carrying them in from somewhere.

337
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,120
 But who knows?

338
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,920
 Maybe they'll end up posting again.

339
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,420
 Nick and Helena.

340
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,280
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter.

341
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,240
 We are leaving behind Georgia.

342
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,800
 We each have full jewelry of human teeth now.

343
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,120
 Even if you don't want it, I'm like, "Here you go.

344
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,280
 You got to wear this to keep listening to the podcast."

345
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,160
 We're leaving behind Georgia.

346
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:16,360
 Take us all the way out to a suburban neighborhood.

347
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
 This is another story I came across online.

348
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,640
 I got this one from the Expo.

349
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,300
 So it does have the same limitations.

350
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
 We don't have the exact name.

351
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,060
 Which I understand people not using their exact name.

352
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
 I do get that.

353
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,580
 I understand people not revealing their location.

354
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,060
 But we're going to go ahead and call this guy Phil.

355
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,980
 Live somewhere in the United States.

356
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,740
 A sleepy suburban neighborhood possibly.

357
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,860
 It's November 2019.

358
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,580
 And Phil is on Xvideos.

359
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,540
 Xvideos is a porn website.

360
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,900
 You can watch free pornography.

361
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,600
 Xvideos is one of those websites where anyone can upload stuff.

362
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,440
 And he says, "I was on this porn site and I came across a video of an underage girl

363
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,120
 being sexually assaulted and then murdered on video."

364
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
 You shocked them.

365
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,400
 You shocked anyone, right?

366
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,600
 And so he reports it to the FBI.

367
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,680
 Sends the video link over to the FBI hoping they can at least take the video down.

368
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:27,900
 At the very least and at the very most bring the perpetrators to justice.

369
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,940
 But Phil goes, "I don't know why I did this.

370
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,060
 I don't know why I did this.

371
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,420
 I sent it to the FBI.

372
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,460
 This is definitely an FBI issue.

373
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:41,540
 They have an entire team dedicated to taking down this type of pornography and obviously

374
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,820
 murderers as well."

375
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,180
 He goes, "I also sent it to the CIA."

376
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,520
 He goes, "I don't know why I did that, but that was my mistake.

377
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,840
 I never should have sent it to the CIA."

378
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,680
 Shortly afterwards, shortly after reporting this video, Phil begins to hear voices in

379
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,240
 his head.

380
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,040
 He said these voices were telling me that I was a pedophile.

381
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,400
 He's hearing these voices in his head calling him a pedophile and the voices are telling

382
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:20,700
 them the only way will go away is if you got off your prime and I don't know if it's super

383
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,900
 spooky or if it's just a voice going like, "Hey, you're a pedophile."

384
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,180
 The voices, I don't know if it's a sing song, the voices said, "The only way we will stop

385
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,180
 we are going to keep talking in your head.

386
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:39,260
 The only way we'll stop is if you go to the local mental hospital, voluntarily check yourself

387
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:45,960
 in and then tell a psychologist that you are a pedophile because you are one.

388
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,160
 And if you don't do that, we're going to just keep telling you you're a pedophile anyways

389
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,400
 until you do what we say.

390
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,040
 So let's just cut to the chase, do what we say, go to the hospital, check yourself in,

391
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,480
 admit you're a pedophile."

392
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,840
 And Phil is hearing these voices for months.

393
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,740
 You're basically taking over his life.

394
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,260
 He's trying to go about his daily business.

395
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,220
 You're at the grocery store trying to buy some watermelon, put it on the scale and all

396
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,020
 of a sudden, "Hey dude, you're a pedophile.

397
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,140
 Pedophiles don't get watermelon.

398
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,180
 Go to the mental hospital, check yourself in, tell people you're a pedophile and we'll

399
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,460
 leave you alone.

400
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
 Just do it."

401
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,260
 He's playing tennis.

402
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,860
 It's a very, very competitive match.

403
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,660
 Hey, I know you're thinking about tennis right now, but guess what, dude?

404
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
 You're a pedophile.

405
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,800
 Pedophiles don't get to play tennis, but down your racket, I don't know if they were that

406
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
 specific either.

407
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,560
 I don't know if they were tailored to the activity, but anyways, the point is, is that

408
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,360
 he was getting this constant harassment.

409
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 He was a pedophile.

410
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,480
 He's hearing the voices in his head.

411
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,840
 And this becomes so bad that he's having a hard time maintaining a job.

412
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
 He's in college.

413
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,640
 He's having a hard time getting through his classes.

414
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,140
 His psychic harassment keeps going on and on and on.

415
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:12,540
 And at first, I don't know if he makes the connection that this is related to the CIA,

416
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,620
 but he does start to realize that the reason why he's getting harassed is because he's

417
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,180
 sent to the CIA because now he's seeing black helicopters fly around his house.

418
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,820
 He also will see suspicious vehicles parked across the street.

419
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,220
 Phil, at this point, he's lost his job.

420
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,700
 He's kicked out of college.

421
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,620
 He's lost all of his money, he says.

422
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,000
 I don't know.

423
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,760
 Maybe he was just buying watermelons, buying all the watermelons.

424
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
 The voices can't tell me what to do.

425
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,960
 And I'm going to invest in that tennis academy that I've always wanted to go to.

426
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,120
 So he has no money.

427
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,680
 He moves back in with his parents.

428
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,280
 His sister, I'm patching this together, obviously.

429
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,880
 I'm taking this thing that he posted on the export and trying to make some sort of sense

430
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,760
 because his writing starts to become a little more incoherent.

431
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,060
 If you can believe that, the writing becomes a little more incoherent as the responses

432
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
 go on.

433
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,260
 But he says, I don't know if his sister lives with him or his sister was just visiting.

434
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,740
 But he says, my sister, she was actually preparing to be a teacher.

435
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,420
 She was preparing to be a teacher.

436
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:28,540
 But instead, she's been turned into a psychic weapon against me.

437
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:35,100
 Still goes, I'll be sitting there and I can actually feel her stress level from across

438
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
 the room.

439
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,060
 I can feel the anxiety build up in her head.

440
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:48,140
 I can sense the pressure inside of her getting stronger and stronger and stronger.

441
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,660
 And it's actually tuning itself.

442
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:57,240
 All of this psychic anguish that she's going through is tuning itself into some sort of

443
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:05,260
 beam or some sort of force that is directed at him.

444
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:11,460
 He says, it's either going to kill me or make me kill myself or make me go psychotic.

445
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,580
 Because I'm clearly not psychotic now.

446
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:21,660
 He also mentions that his sister will begin to imitate him, which is absolutely fascinating.

447
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,380
 Again, if we're talking about a delusion, delusions can come in all shapes and forms.

448
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:36,160
 But if she's imitating him, now we're looking at something like a shared delusion, an inherited

449
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,480
 madness, folly adieu.

450
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,160
 But yeah, I think he's probably just hallucinating this.

451
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:50,200
 But he's sitting there and when she does something that's similar to him, he's seeing that as

452
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,720
 her being fine-tuned as this psychic weapon.

453
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,620
 It's interesting too where he says she was preparing to be a teacher.

454
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,860
 The guy obviously stopped posting at a certain point and he's never returned as far as we

455
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,620
 know to the export.

456
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,260
 It's interesting to note that she also dropped out of college.

457
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,020
 Was he causing so much chaos in the household that she also had to come back home?

458
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,180
 Or is she also having this madness?

459
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,180
 We don't know.

460
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,340
 It's an interesting detail.

461
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,100
 She was preparing to be a teacher, but it could also just be a grammatical thing.

462
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:30,840
 He mentions that his sister as a weapon is different than the Screamies.

463
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,440
 That's in quote the Screamies.

464
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,200
 Never tells us what a Screamie is.

465
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,360
 But I kind of want to know more of the lore.

466
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,960
 It's probably just some delusion, something that he's made up.

467
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,320
 Now here's the thing.

468
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,220
 We talk a lot about gangstalking on this show.

469
00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:03,100
 Phil takes the extra step where he gets so enraged at the psychic warfare that the CIA

470
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
 is directing at him.

471
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,740
 And at this point he 100% believes it's the CIA that he writes a letter or probably an

472
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,740
 email.

473
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,740
 It doesn't really matter.

474
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,900
 It's illegal either way.

475
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:20,120
 Earlier this year, earlier in 2022, he sent a death threat to Avril Haines.

476
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,080
 Madam Avril Haines, she's the director of national intelligence.

477
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,940
 She basically, it's a cabinet level position that oversees all of the military intelligence

478
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,760
 groups like naval intelligence, space force intelligence, stuff like that.

479
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,400
 He sent her a death threat.

480
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,280
 Which I'll be honest, I would probably pay money to read.

481
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,300
 I would find it absolutely fascinating to see what he said in that letter.

482
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,540
 I'm not condoning it obviously, but I'm so curious because I'm really having to take

483
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:57,140
 this whole story off of maybe five paragraphs he wrote online and I would like to see more

484
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,540
 about this delusional state.

485
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,080
 And because he did that, he got arrested.

486
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,800
 He was arrested, he was thrown in a mental hospital for about a week.

487
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,260
 He got arrested and then he was thrown in a mental hospital, which was where the voices

488
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,080
 were telling him to go in the first place.

489
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:21,760
 They put him on antipsychotics, but he said the voices never went away.

490
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,360
 Even with the medication, they never went away.

491
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,360
 He was only held in the mental hospital for a week and then he was returned back to the

492
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,160
 care of his parents.

493
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,280
 In the hospital, they were giving him the antipsychotics.

494
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,760
 I don't know if he's still in the antipsychotics today.

495
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,100
 I mean, based on the fact that he was posting this online, it's unlikely he goes, but it

496
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
 doesn't matter.

497
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,860
 Even when I was on the antipsychotics, I still heard the voices.

498
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,820
 I was in the mental hospital and the voices were just as clear as they ever were and they

499
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,100
 said, "The only way we're going to leave you alone, dude.

500
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,380
 The only way we've been telling you this all this time."

501
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:06,960
 From 2019 to today, check yourself in a mental hospital voluntarily.

502
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,320
 Tell a psychologist there you're a pedophile.

503
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,800
 That's all you need to do.

504
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,600
 And we will stop.

505
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,240
 We will leave you alone.

506
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,760
 He ends his initial post by saying, "I'm not a pedophile."

507
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,380
 Also never report crimes to the CIA.

508
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,380
 It's interesting.

509
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:39,640
 Obviously, it's scary and sad that he could just be having a schizophrenic episode.

510
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,300
 In the world of paranormal, it could be some sort of covert CIA operation, but the thing

511
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,740
 is, it's like they had him.

512
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,140
 They had when he wrote a letter to the director of national intelligence, they could have

513
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:56,840
 buried him under eight layers of antipsychotics and strapped down to a bed and had all this

514
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,280
 paperwork ready to go and he could still be in the mental hospital to this day.

515
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,800
 If the CIA was truly behind it, they wouldn't need him to admit it.

516
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,760
 Him breaking the law by writing that letter would be enough to have him thrown into the

517
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,000
 system.

518
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,160
 You couldn't say you were going to be in the system for the rest of your life because you

519
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,000
 wrote this letter, but once they're in the system, you could have had a CIA agent posed

520
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,500
 as a doctor saying, "We need to keep him here for so long."

521
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
 They could have kept him there.

522
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 They had him, right?

523
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,740
 What's interesting, and I had not thought about this.

524
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,100
 I thought this was a really even more creepy, even more depressing story.

525
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,180
 Like, obviously, the most depressing is that he's having a psychotic break because that

526
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,700
 can take years and years to help and it's hard to convince somebody that they're insane

527
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
 and then they need medical help.

528
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,700
 Maybe call him insane, but that they need medical help when they believe the medical

529
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,680
 establishment is part of the problem.

530
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,520
 That's the saddest one, because we see it all the time.

531
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,480
 I was thinking the idea of the CIA would actually be behind this would be the creepiest one,

532
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,480
 but reading a couple of the different responses to this guy, someone posted one that's actually

533
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,000
 way creepier.

534
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Way creepier.

535
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,200
 And it goes back to what we talked about during the Thanksgiving Life's Room Special.

536
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:18,180
 Rico and Ocopoco wanted to know more about info hazards.

537
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,420
 Are you going to do more episodes about info hazards?

538
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,060
 In info hazards, we've done a couple before.

539
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,340
 Like the despair code is an info hazard.

540
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:35,500
 It's basically information, whether it be a sentence or just a word, or it's a video,

541
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,980
 or a phone call, or I'll try to put some of those episodes in the show notes.

542
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,320
 The one with the phone call, that was a really creepy, creepy story, but info hazards.

543
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,480
 We see them in popular culture like the Ring video.

544
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,060
 If you get this information, it causes you to go psychotic.

545
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,400
 It causes you to snap and start murdering everyone around you.

546
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,480
 It just causes you to die.

547
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,360
 Info hazards is the term.

548
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,680
 Very very popular subgenre of the paranormal world.

549
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
 Super rare.

550
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
 Super rare.

551
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,620
 The legitimate ones are incredibly rare.

552
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,420
 I think they're probably rare for two reasons.

553
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,620
 Assuming that they're real, right?

554
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,220
 I think there probably are things that we could quantify as info hazards.

555
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,060
 I think they're pretty rare because they're probably very hard to survive.

556
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:29,020
 If you come across that, all of the paranormal stories we've ever heard are told from survivors

557
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,940
 or witnesses who saw this type of thing.

558
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,260
 And so it gives us a skewed world view of the paranormal.

559
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,080
 We never heard of stories of the person who got ripped to shreds by a cryptid that's

560
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,800
 never been seen because everyone who sees it dies.

561
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,600
 And so info hazards may have a super high mortality rate.

562
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,640
 Or even just to drive you mad.

563
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,600
 A lot of HP Lovecraft stuff kind of dealt with info hazards.

564
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,880
 So looking at this one, I was looking at some of the responses for this story.

565
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
 I found this one.

566
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
 It was super interesting.

567
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:14,880
 And the guy goes, "It's possible by viewing this video you gained a psychic link with

568
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,400
 the murderer."

569
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:26,820
 Watching the video itself created, it's such a shocking, it's so inhumane that it does

570
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,100
 completely just reset your brain.

571
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,220
 You're watching something that shouldn't exist.

572
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,240
 You're watching something that should not be.

573
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,880
 Shouldn't happen at all, let alone on video.

574
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,600
 You're watching this video and basically a psychic link was created between Phil and

575
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,400
 the murderer in the video.

576
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:56,400
 And what Phil is experiencing is the guilt and self-loathing of the man in the video.

577
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:04,460
 He's basically projecting all of his sins and all of his self-hatred out into the people

578
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,660
 who are watching the video.

579
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,900
 Now in the world of paranormal, that's something that is possible.

580
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,980
 You would wonder, was the guy doing it on accident?

581
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,660
 I mean obviously he wasn't committing the act on accident, but was he sending out this

582
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:23,040
 psychic blast accidentally?

583
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:30,620
 Or does the video itself act as some sort of spell, some sort of way to cleanse him

584
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:37,780
 of guilt that the video itself actually has?

585
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:43,140
 The properties, he does this on video, he never feels bad about it because he's actually

586
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:48,140
 projecting all of his guilt onto everyone who's watching it.

587
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,980
 You have to wonder, like if the CIA is not involved in this, this guy's not having a

588
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,280
 psychotic episode.

589
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,320
 If a thousand people watch this video, are they also experiencing the same thing that

590
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
 Phil is?

591
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:06,060
 Are they actually getting the feelings of guilt and self-hatred that was coming from the

592
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,920
 murderer in that video?

593
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,280
 Basically a psychic landmine.

594
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,000
 And so all of that thing, saying just go to the mental hospital, check yourself in and

595
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,480
 admit that you're a pedophile, that's what the killer's thinking.

596
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,000
 Get help dude, get help.

597
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,180
 You're just a monster, get help.

598
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,180
 But he's projecting that out and other people are picking up on it and they're being haunted

599
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,380
 by it.

600
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,980
 The big question would be, is it on purpose?

601
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:37,180
 Is the video itself some sort of incantation, some sort of ritual to spread this so he can

602
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:44,340
 continue to go on this evil path and feel no guilt?

603
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,060
 And then the other option that this poster put forward is that he could actually, we

604
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:54,720
 could be talking about the spirit of the girl in the video haunting him.

605
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,000
 Because while Phil says he didn't mean to click on this, he wasn't searching for this

606
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,720
 material, you can come across it on websites like X-Video, you just unfortunately just

607
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,040
 one click away from these types of, you can go from something that's legitimate to something

608
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,360
 like this and a click on one of these websites.

609
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,920
 He says he didn't mean to do it, but if you had the girls, it sounds tacky talking about

610
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
 it.

611
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,140
 Well we don't know if it's real, like a real life crime, but it probably is unfortunately.

612
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:28,300
 It's kind of tacky, but I'm going to keep talking about it because it's just from paranormal

613
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,300
 levels.

614
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:35,260
 It's fascinating if this girl's spirit, she doesn't know why anyone's watching the video.

615
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,340
 Right?

616
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,060
 She doesn't know.

617
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:43,260
 She just knows the video's being watched and it's not the killer's psyche that's being

618
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,380
 spread out to everyone who watches the video.

619
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:54,240
 But the girls, the girl who is going her death triggered this nuclear explosion of pure raw

620
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,960
 psychic vengeful energy and anyone who watches the video is now cursed.

621
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,440
 Until they do what the voices say, they will hear them.

622
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,640
 They will hear them for the rest of their lives until they do what the voices say and

623
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,600
 that is the girl's judgment.

624
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,100
 She doesn't care if he accidentally clicked on it.

625
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,380
 She doesn't care if it's the 10th time you watched it that day.

626
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,980
 All are guilty.

627
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,260
 All will be purged.

628
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,540
 Either one's possible.

629
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,580
 The kid also could be having a psychotic episode.

630
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,620
 The CIA may be involved.

631
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,860
 It's a terrifying story.

632
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,620
 It's a terrifying story.

633
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:42,500
 Whatever the origin of it is, Phil is faced with a choice.

634
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:49,840
 He can do what the voices say or the torment continues.

635
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,340
 And that's a tough choice.

636
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,180
 That really is a tough choice.

637
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,640
 In his case, the voices aren't telling him to hurt anybody or kill anyone or walk into

638
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,280
 supermarket and start shooting people or anything like that.

639
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,840
 But they're telling him to admit to something that he says he is not.

640
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
 He's 100%.

641
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,160
 He says he is not a pedophile and the voices are saying to admit to it and not just to

642
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,880
 admit to it, not just to yell it out loud from a rooftop, which would be bad enough,

643
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,420
 to go to a psychologist and admit to it, to check yourself in a mental hospital.

644
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,520
 Voluntarily, I think it's so interesting that they don't want them to just be admitted.

645
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,420
 They want them to voluntarily do it and then say, "I'm a pedophile."

646
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,080
 Because that will change the course of his life.

647
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,400
 And he says that he's not one, that he accidentally came across this video and he's not one.

648
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
 He's not one.

649
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,560
 But the voices tell him this is the only way we'll stop.

650
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,680
 And this has gone on for three years at this point.

651
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,120
 A terrifying story.

652
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,800
 It's a terrifying story of what's out there, not only on the outskirts of the internet,

653
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,280
 but on some of the biggest websites, when it's some of the most highly trafficked websites

654
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
 in the world.

655
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,600
 You have this type of garbage out there.

656
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,400
 Plus the danger of info hazards.

657
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:21,120
 Those pieces of media that are out there that can, just by viewing it a single time, completely

658
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,760
 ruin your life.

659
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:35,200
 Not just because of the content, but because of the psychic energy connected to it.

660
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,360
 I think in a way Phil may hope that the CIA is behind this.

661
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,400
 That may be the only thing he can really hold onto as far as some sort of life preserver

662
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
 of sanity.

663
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,320
 Because if the CIA is behind this, there's a reason for it.

664
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,480
 There's a logic behind it.

665
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,920
 The CIA is after him because he reported this and they had some hidden hand in this industry.

666
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,800
 And maybe they'll come to admire his gumption.

667
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,920
 Maybe they'll come to look at him and say, "Well, he never broke.

668
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,880
 We gave him three years of torture and he never ever admitted to it.

669
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:19,040
 Let's go ahead and shut down that program and let Phil be Phil."

670
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:27,360
 Because if he is truly cursed by the vengeful spirit of a young child killed in the most

671
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:35,680
 inhumane way, there is no release from that.

672
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:44,000
 It will haunt him until the day he dies or until he does what the voices say.

673
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,320
 But the problem with giving in and doing what the voices say is there is no guarantee that

674
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:55,360
 once you do that, they will live up to their end of the bargain.

675
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:02,600
 Once the voices know you can crack under pressure, they may have even more dreadful and gruesome

676
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:14,480
 requests the next time you hear them in your head.

 You don't have to listen to it every day.

 I'm glad you listened to it today.
