1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
 English cryptid moves to America and our movies television and music really

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,660
 conditioning us for a bleak future. Warning, both these subjects give me

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,820
 headaches to talk about so prepare for a Surly Jason today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,320
 [Music]

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,260
 host Jason Garbner. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,020
 The sound you may or may not be hearing is the sound of me getting some Tylenol

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,780
 and some ibuprofen. I do have a headache and I know that this episode is just

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,480
 going to compound that. Originally these stories were, I think they're

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,620
 interesting stories and originally I was gonna split them up throughout the week

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,860
 because I was like oh man they give me headaches and I was like you know what I'd

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,500
 rather deal with one massive headache at the end of one episode than have to be

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,780
 like oh great I have to record that episode coming up. Now again they're

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,380
 both interesting stories but man they just drove me up the wall. One one is

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,140
 driven me up the wall for years but the other one I just found out about. Now

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,300
 one of them was a request. It was actually a request from a YouTube user

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,580
 named Zurglejerk and I appreciate the request. I'll go ahead and tell you the

18
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,940
 story. Well we'll see how we get through this. Okay so his request, I was

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,020
 talking about cryptids. I've been doing a lot of cryptid episodes lately and he

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,740
 said on YouTube he goes I bet you haven't heard of the story of bloody bones

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,340
 in Texas. I was like oh I'm intrigued that's a cool name it's a you know

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,900
 cryptid I've never heard of before. I'm sure it's really spooky. Oh my god I

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,180
 gave me I was oh my god I had the worst headache. Now who is bloody bones? That is

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,900
 the question right? So to learn that let's go to Texas. Where is Zurglejerk?

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,700
 Zurglejerk thank you for the recommendation. The fact that he gave me

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,400
 headache had nothing to do with you. It has to do more with the tail itself. So

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,700
 let's hop in the Jason Jalopy, drive on down to Texas and find the bloody bones.

28
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,380
 Find this cryptid that I've never heard of and when we get there we are told oh

29
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,540
 yeah you really want to know about bloody bones. Yeah we kind of have a version

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,460
 of him here but you probably want to go to the source. You probably want to

31
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,860
 figure out like where bloody bones came from and we're like oh okay where's that?

32
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,020
 Is that like Dallas or Fort Worth? They're like no England in the 1500s. Okay

33
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,220
 great so now we got to go back to Oregon. We get in the carpentry copter. Go

34
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:41,180
 through a time portal. We are now in England the year is 1548. We are out on

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,900
 a search for the cryptid no one has bloody bones. More like a demon or a ghost

36
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,700
 is probably a better qualifier for it. It's old timey England. We go we're

37
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,460
 walking around the villages towns kind of at this point in the 1500s. We're

38
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,940
 walking around. Actually that was quite far back. I think they were still suffering

39
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,140
 from the black plague then. I don't think there were chimney sweep stants in

40
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,860
 around 1548 was quite old. Soon it was 1548 is the year we're in England. We

41
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,340
 find in this old crone living in a shack. We found her on Tinder and we go hey

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,820
 this woman's super old and gross. She has to know somebody named

43
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,420
 Bloody Bones. I'm sure they run in the same circle. We go in the old

44
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,420
 crone's house. We go hey we are here to investigate the mystery of Bloody Bones.

45
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:34,060
 She goes Bloody Bones huh? Bloody Bones you mean raw head and Bloody Bones don't

46
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,620
 you? We're like what? No we just we don't care about raw head. I don't know who that

47
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,540
 guy is you just mentioned to me. I just want to know who Bloody Bones is. I got a

48
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,380
 time limit. I got a daily podcast to do. Just tell me about Bloody Bones. She's

49
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,700
 just stirring her cauldron. She's like ah the tail of raw head and Bloody Bones

50
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:58,140
 starts like this. So it's a creature. There's no one to hide in the darkness.

51
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:07,100
 Sometimes it hides under your stairs that lead into your basement. And there's

52
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,460
 little openings in between each stair where I can see your ankles coming down

53
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,220
 your little eight-year-old ankles walking in front of it. It'll grab you. It'll

54
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,540
 grab you. It'll break you. It'll take you away like

55
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,940
 Calgon. I don't know how I know that reference I just do.

56
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:34,540
 Stairs are pot a little more. Sometimes the creature hides in a cupboard.

57
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,180
 And if it's halfway opened and you look inside and you see it

58
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:48,060
 it gets you. Stirring the cauldron a little more. Or the creature also

59
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,620
 lives in bogs and deep pools of water and snatches kids.

60
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:01,740
 Takes them down to Bone Town. Bone Town UK. We're like that is an

61
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,140
 interesting story. So is that the story of Bloody Bones?

62
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,340
 Which goes no no no no sorry that's the story of

63
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,820
 Rawhead and Bloody Bones. So wait wait wait so

64
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,940
 are they are I'm getting confused there are there two

65
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,740
 different monsters? Well yeah there's Rawhead

66
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,260
 who's a monster who has a raw head and then there's Bloody Bones who's a

67
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,460
 skeleton who dances. Okay well which one is the one you just

68
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,020
 told me those spooky stories about? Rawhead and Bloody Bones.

69
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,860
 Which so at this point this is how I felt researching this.

70
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,420
 Article after article after article would tell this creepy story.

71
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,860
 What I did versions I told you were different versions. In Britain the

72
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,820
 original version was that this or them a creature lived in a bog.

73
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,980
 And it was again a lot of these cryptids are teaching kids lessons. Stay away

74
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,900
 from deep water because Rawhead and Bloody Bones will get you both of

75
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,660
 them apparently and has to be a pretty wide pit

76
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,140
 for two monsters to pop out of. I have no idea why these guys are so closely

77
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,540
 connected. So Rawhead I have in my notes maybe about

78
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,700
 three lines down same creature question mark because I can't

79
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,060
 figure it out and people may say no no no Rawhead

80
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,580
 is different than Bloody Bones and I get that.

81
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,060
 But they're always a crew these guys are like

82
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,420
 teammates but they never differentiate them. We know that Rawhead

83
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,180
 he has a skull that's been stripped he's like a

84
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,980
 has a head of a boar that's been stripped to the bone and he bites you

85
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,460
 or sometimes it's just like a skeleton dude like who's had all of his skin

86
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,420
 ripped off. But Bloody Bones is always a bloody skeleton

87
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,420
 and he just dances that's it is that the thing like who

88
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,180
 okay who's grabbing you when you're coming down your stairs because I don't

89
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,780
 care you there's not two monsters under your stairs

90
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,460
 there's not two of them that's not scary. If I was walking downstairs in the

91
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,740
 middle of the night the idea of a bloody skeleton

92
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,620
 hiding underneath my stairs to grab my ankles would terrify me.

93
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,340
 But the idea of a bloody skeleton and then a hulking guy with a boar head

94
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,140
 both being able to fit under my stairs at the same time

95
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,900
 would is laughable. It's absolutely laughable.

96
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,740
 All of these all references to these characters for the most part at least in

97
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,420
 the research and again local like Zergljerk his local legend may have

98
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,340
 just been about Bloody Bones. But when you look this stuff up

99
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,620
 they're always a team they're always a crew.

100
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,780
 It's it was driving me up the wall and then

101
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,900
 this is their nursery rhyme raw head and Bloody Bones both of them again they

102
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,500
 raw head and Bloody Bones steals naughty children from their homes

103
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,100
 takes them to his dirty din and they are never seen again.

104
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,780
 It says his in the poem takes them to his or which one is doing this stuff.

105
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,980
 Is Bloody Bones just like a voyeuristic skeleton?

106
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,100
 There's no explanation the weirdest thing is is that

107
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,660
 none of the articles were like yeah we can't make heads or tails of this

108
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,740
 either. I I've never been so confounded by a cryptid

109
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,340
 before. If Bigfoot walked into my living room right now and sat on my lap I

110
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,540
 would be less confused than I would be reading these articles.

111
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,180
 And then in my pursuit to find out more information about who is actually the

112
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,460
 villain in this story I found out there's

113
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:36,060
 Bloody Bones and Goo Goo Eyes in Africa. So that is the story of Bloody Bones and

114
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,340
 Rawhead Rex or Rawhead Rex and Bloody Bones.

115
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,540
 They're just like a crew who like bumbles around and kidnaps kids and like

116
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,300
 eats them or dances with them or turns them into bones

117
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,980
 or something. You don't live if you run into these guys

118
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,940
 but again super inefficient to if you are a stealth based monster to have

119
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,820
 skeletons are the loudest thing that can chase you. They don't even have any

120
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,420
 cushioning on their feet. Their bones make noise.

121
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,260
 So the Rawhead can't like sneak up on people because

122
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,180
 Bloody Bones sounds like a xylophone every time he takes a step.

123
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,060
 And then Bloody Bones can't do his thing because he's standing next to a

124
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,740
 guy who has the body of Kevin Nash with the head of a bloody boarhead.

125
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,380
 That guy is pretty noticeable. A giant boar monster. At least a skeleton can

126
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,980
 like sneak around a house put on a trench coat and a hat. Get on the subway.

127
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,740
 You wouldn't know unless you looked right at him or his ankles or you heard all

128
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,420
 that xylophone music as he was getting on. But then he's standing next to this

129
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,180
 giant monster man. So but let's go ahead and norm...

130
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,260
 I'll have to end this like I normally do. Is it possible that a creature like

131
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,100
 Bloody Bones... What is it? Is it possible that let's

132
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,860
 him forget Rawhead for a second? Forget he exists?

133
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,380
 Is it possible for a creature like Bloody Bones to exist?

134
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,540
 Yeah I mean sure if you... That sounds like...

135
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,300
 It's possible. I mean obviously if you had any sort of dark or demonic

136
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,020
 entity there's really nothing scarier than a skeleton. Why does it need to hang

137
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,780
 off the board? Is the skeleton scary enough? There's another really

138
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,660
 scene of animated skeleton is is almost scarier than a zombie.

139
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,380
 Because at least with a zombie you could rationalize like maybe it's some sort of

140
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,660
 virus or plague or something like that. But an animated skeleton you would go

141
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,580
 that's impossible. Like what I'm seeing can never happen.

142
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:33,340
 As no musculature, as no tendons, it can't move. So to wake up and see a

143
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,460
 skeleton standing over your bed would be scarier I think than waking up and

144
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,980
 especially seeing a guy with a boar head. I would just be like go back to bed Larry.

145
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,780
 Like I mean a skeleton moving is so impossible

146
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,940
 by any stretch of the imagination that if I was some sort of dark entity and I

147
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,220
 wanted to take a form that would absolutely strike fear into the hearts

148
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,260
 of children or adults or anybody I would be a bloody skeleton. I mean you

149
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,060
 can't beat that. Walking down the stairs in your basement

150
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,820
 is quite creepy and the idea of something hiding it's almost like

151
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:12,620
 Schrodinger's cat where there's nothing in your cupboard unless the doors just

152
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,380
 partially open and you look in it. If your cupboard's completely closed there's

153
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,500
 nothing in there. If it's slightly open and you don't look

154
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,420
 into it there's nothing in there but when you do look into it there's a bloody

155
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,460
 skeleton. That's pretty creepy. However you knew

156
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,260
 not to look into the cupboard because the giant guy with the skin boar head was

157
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,540
 riffling through your fridge and goes "hey do you have any cheese?" like

158
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,940
 "break up guys" is what I'm saying. Bloody bones you are the Paul Simon of this

159
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,300
 group. Go solo and you can take your act to the

160
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,020
 stars. Okay so that was a salvage. That was an absolute salvage of I don't know

161
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,020
 how much I edited out of that segment but I think I brought it home. I think I

162
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,100
 actually got something out of it. Now I took I put my pills out when I

163
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,220
 started recording. Now I gotta take them hold on. You guys have it. Oh dude you

164
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,820
 know while I'm taking these pills man I'm not I just gotta do have you guys

165
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,060
 seen that Joker trailer? Eww Christ that that would dope.

166
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,620
 That was awesome trailer. It's not gonna be a little brother about it. I said that

167
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,620
 could almost just be a movie. Like if they never released a movie if they just

168
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,580
 released that trailer and it was just like a trailer for the character the

169
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,300
 essence of Joker I was like it's perfect. It's great if you haven't seen it yet.

170
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,700
 Let's go ahead and move on to another conspiracy that honestly is one of the

171
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,780
 most aggravating conspiracies. My microphone is vibrating I don't know if

172
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,260
 that picked it up but let's go ahead and move on to conspiracy now that

173
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,820
 honestly to me is one of the most aggravating conspiracies that I have

174
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,700
 to discuss. We've talked about stuff like monkeys

175
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,580
 aren't real and nuclear bombs aren't real and stuff like that and those

176
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,460
 conspiracy theories are just stupid to me like they're

177
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,060
 funny to make fun of but predictive programming and I've

178
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,500
 mentioned it quite a few times over the course of the show but predictive

179
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,300
 programming is one that really really irritates me because I don't

180
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,420
 it's not it's not a very well thought out conspiracy theory

181
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,660
 and it's incredibly popular. So what is predictive programming? Predictive

182
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,140
 programming is the idea that this that in movies and music and brief

183
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,500
 overview you can read whole websites on this stuff but the brief

184
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,180
 the brief overview is predictive programming is the idea

185
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,540
 that within movies and television and music there are

186
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,620
 things that are put in there to desensitize us to the coming changes. So

187
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,060
 for example the government wants to have robot armies so they want to

188
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,820
 desensitize people to the idea of robots fighting in the

189
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,540
 military. So the the illuminati or the powers

190
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,580
 that be or the government or whatever they back the movie The Terminator

191
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,500
 because it shows how effective a robot would be in combat.

192
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,300
 Now I know what you're thinking we'll get to that in a second.

193
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,980
 We'll get to that in a second. But another very very popular example

194
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,620
 Alex Jones said this was one of the like most blatant forms of predictive

195
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,740
 programming or most like extreme form of predictive

196
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,020
 program and I remember the exact quote but he went off in this movie he hadn't

197
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,540
 seen it or read the book but he'd been told about it and that was the hunger

198
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,700
 games. So you know Alex Jones really has a

199
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:25,180
 hard on for like a dystopian society, New World Order, Agenda 21 I think it's

200
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,940
 called and you know all this stuff the coming global order and all that.

201
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,860
 And so the hunger games really because it was aimed at a young audience

202
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,100
 what does it show? It shows a world where one government controls everything

203
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,380
 and obviously we don't know what happens outside the borders of the United States

204
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,540
 but in within the United States you had one government that had control over

205
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,940
 the entire United States and people were put into abject poverty

206
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,940
 and their only job was to produce goods for this rich society the elites, the

207
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,900
 elites in Washington they made stuff just for them

208
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,180
 and the poor people were poor and even Alex Jones was like when the New World

209
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,740
 Order comes gladiator games are going to come back.

210
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,500
 And so the hunger games by watching the hunger games and having little girls

211
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 read these books that starts that desensitization, the cut that starts that

212
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,620
 I forgot the word already my head is frowning

213
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,900
 it starts to desensitize these young girls so when in their lifetime when

214
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,540
 they're daughters so we figured 20 30 years past after the mother reads the

215
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,380
 book she has kids and the changes start to come where America starts to

216
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,700
 consolidate power in one city and she starts to see like all the economic

217
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,740
 resources get drained from her community and as her daughter is getting

218
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,660
 prepared for her first gladiator combat she goes ah this is fine because i read

219
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,900
 it in the hunger games like i'm used to this now now there are other and we'll

220
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,700
 get to i know there's a lot of problems with that one too we'll get to that one

221
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,300
 in a second and sometimes there's things called specific

222
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,460
 it's not technically called specific predictor programming but

223
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,180
 you will see that this is predictive programming but they're just able to tie

224
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,460
 it into an event into a particular event so in 2010 i think it's pretty common

225
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,460
 knowledge maybe not but the simpsons has been connected to doing

226
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,860
 predictive programming for 9/11 they had an episode where Homer went to the twin

227
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,020
 towers right so that means they're gonna blow up and

228
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,540
 Bart was holding up a in that episode Bart had a magazine that was a

229
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,900
 an advertisement for a trip to new york a bus ride to new york or something

230
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,500
 like that and it was only nine dollars and he holds the magazine up

231
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,940
 and it has the number nine on it for the nine dollars and then the two twin

232
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:52,140
 towers so it says 9/11 and then he's waving money in his hand so you

233
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,100
 out that's from alex jones you go see he's waving the money in our face all

234
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,620
 the money that the global elite's going to make from the attacks in 2010 of the

235
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,540
 simpsons there was an episode called to surveil with love this was an episode

236
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,580
 where basically um Homer puts a bunch of radioactive material in a gym bag

237
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,300
 which is later described to contain enough radioactive waste to create 17

238
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,260
 hulks and one spider-man and the cops think it's a bomb and they blow it up

239
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,140
 they release radiation all over springfield and then they have to enact

240
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,300
 a police state in springfield they set up security cameras in everyone's homes

241
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,860
 and stuff like that but this is from a website that is saying that this

242
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,340
 episode actually accurately predicts the next terror attack because it already

243
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,500
 predicted 9/11 it's all about looking for the clues so we have the big scale

244
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,140
 predictive programming that's just basically showing like if you show a

245
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,780
 future where there is strict government control and the people fall into line

246
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,620
 you put that in enough movies it'll desensitize the population

247
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,780
 so when there is a strict government and the population falls in line we will

248
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,900
 accept that because we've already seen it hundreds and hundreds of times

249
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,300
 one thing obviously about being desensitized someone who works at a farm

250
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,140
 who sees cows heads get chopped off all the time since they were a kid

251
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,820
 it doesn't faze them if i saw cows head get chopped off

252
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,260
 it would totally freak me out because i'm not desensitized to that it would

253
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,540
 it would a live cow just walking and then it's head falling off well that would

254
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,220
 worry anybody but you know what i mean like cow guts spilling out i'm just not

255
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:27,020
 used to seeing that stuff so desensitization i can't say that word

256
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,420
 desensitizing people is an accurate thing but anyways

257
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,820
 that's neither here nor there in the simpsons it's too surveilled with love

258
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,900
 when the dirty bomb goes off the clock tower i've got my

259
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,060
 heads pounding the clock tower blows into the sky

260
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,780
 lands next to Homer Simpson a joke right it's a joke

261
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,460
 i'm not particularly funny one but the clock falls down next to him now the

262
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,620
 clock hands point to 555 so that's the time it's 555

263
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,140
 but did you know did you know if you turn that clock upside down actually if

264
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,420
 you turn the picture upside down it's actually pointing to

265
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,420
 drumroll 9/11 and you see Homer is looking at the number 10

266
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,660
 there's a cloud above the number 12 so we have 10 i should have brought fronds

267
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,820
 onto this but my headache was just out of control

268
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:28,460
 so according to this website we have 10 plus 10 plus 2

269
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,980
 because Homer's looking at the 10 and then there's the cloud over the 12

270
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,820
 but then for some reason they make that a 10 so 10 plus 10 plus see what i mean

271
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:44,540
 dude a splitting headache splitting splitting headache right now

272
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:51,180
 a 10 plus a 10 plus a 2 is 22 the 6 is at the bottom my vision

273
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,460
 starting to blur right now the 6 is at the bottom

274
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:04,940
 so we have 22/6 or 6/22 meaning the date of the next terror attack is going to

275
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:11,740
 be on june 22nd 2012 see

276
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,020
 obviously that's the problem this was from an episode from 2010 this

277
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:22,940
 blog came out in early 2012 obviously there was no massive terror attack on

278
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,220
 june 22nd 2012 so you're like jason why does this

279
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,420
 stuff irritate you so much well here's the thing like i said it's super

280
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,820
 well known it's really hard to argue with because once you start to break apart

281
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,060
 one i've done it before where i've started like i used to argue about this

282
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,060
 stuff more in real life and online and once you start to break apart one they

283
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,900
 just move to a different movie and then you got to be like oh wait did i see

284
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,020
 that move gattaca yeah i guess it's like it was okay like and then you're

285
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,060
 starting to think oh where's he going with this gattaca thing but let's really

286
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,980
 go back to the original things if the goal is to desensitize people to live

287
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:03,900
 in a future like that you can you name me a movie where a single state a

288
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:10,140
 single government entity ruled every facet of somebody's life and they were

289
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,180
 the good guys all of those movies hunger games

290
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:23,100
 equilibrium logans run thx 1138 or two one of those

291
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,820
 all of these movies are about people rebelling against the distilled all

292
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,780
 movies that feature a one world government all movies that feature even

293
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:38,780
 starship troopers they are a total like lunatic fringe militaristic i love that

294
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,900
 movie but you know they're not really made out to be the good guys they're made

295
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,060
 out to completely depersonalize the enemy and break down these young men and

296
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,220
 women's lives and all this stuff there aren't and that's probably the closest

297
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,060
 i've seen of a movie where there is a one world government where it

298
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,980
 it has a happy ending with them not overthrowing the government

299
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,380
 if these movies are desensitizing you to to do anything it's desensitizing you

300
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,780
 to resistance so it teaches you to resist these

301
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,980
 faceless entities hunger games does not glamorize the games and it

302
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,740
 definitely doesn't glamorize the capital they're the bad guys

303
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,140
 terminator okay if terminator movie never came out we would already have

304
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,380
 robot in in war i firmly believe that i think movies

305
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,300
 like the terminator made you go i don't ever want that to happen terminator

306
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,060
 really set up the idea of the ai taking oh and i know it was in science fiction

307
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,740
 before that like novels and stuff like that but as far as like mass consumed

308
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,100
 stuff terminator basically cock blocked two

309
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,220
 different things ai and robots in war because it made both those things look

310
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,500
 like absolutely horrible decisions 100 percent that if your

311
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,660
 goal was to get robots into the battlefield destroy the movie

312
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,340
 terminator don't let everyone ever see it because it makes it look like a

313
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,940
 horrifying future so that's the thing when we look at this

314
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,620
 oh my god i have such a headache i don't remember if i had a third example

315
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,620
 no i think it was just those two so that's the thing with predictive

316
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,860
 programming now like i said you can argue this stuff

317
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,020
 but there's this thing called the glp effect and i got to talk about this

318
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,500
 real brief because my head's throbbing right now and i really

319
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,220
 breathe you guys have listened to this episode this long i appreciate it

320
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,220
 the glp effect is no and this is just this is just

321
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,620
 absolutely bonkers it's glp is this there's a website called godlike

322
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,420
 productions it's one of the main forums for conspiracy theory paranormal

323
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,500
 stuff i spent probably two or three years on glp forums

324
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,900
 that's really back when i was super serious about this stuff

325
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,500
 when i was like an 11 true through i believed on all sorts of nonsense i

326
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,940
 believed like an illuminati messages and music and all that

327
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,100
 i used to believe all this stuff i don't i and i'm pretty open about that i

328
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,060
 don't come out and be like oh no i'm so smart i'm like the best skeptic in the

329
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,500
 world i used to be fooled by all this stuff glp

330
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,780
 effect is this on godlike productions someone would make a prediction

331
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,140
 much like this simpsons episode thing they'd say like hey i saw this episode of

332
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,580
 the simpsons it had this clock with the numbers and if you do all this you do

333
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,500
 all this the next terror attack is going to be on

334
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,420
 june 22nd one of the most famous things that they said was that there was going

335
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,740
 to be an alien attack at the london olympics and they would show

336
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,540
 all of this proof that the london olympics was going to be attacked by

337
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,340
 aliens now i remember at that point i was kind of starting to

338
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,460
 get out of that i was trying to get starting to get out of godlike productions

339
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,340
 and i was like maybe this maybe this is too weird

340
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,540
 but the other side of me was thinking maybe they're right

341
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,060
 look at all this stuff i mean i was an idiot so anyways

342
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,540
 i uh anyways the obviously we all remember the great alien attack

343
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,980
 that didn't happen in london for the olympic games

344
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,580
 and this is what the whole website did they're like

345
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,380
 we stopped it boys we stopped it see we want wrong

346
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,140
 deciphering the symbols oh no it was the glp effect

347
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,260
 see they put the symbols out there the illuminati the new world order puts

348
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,140
 these symbols out there because it's part of their spiritual law they have to

349
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,980
 warn us it's part something they have to do no there's no proof of any of that

350
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,980
 either but anyways that's what they have to do and then we decoded it though

351
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,260
 before the act see the simpsons was afterwards that didn't help but we were

352
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,340
 able to decode the time and date of the next attack and those

353
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:42,140
 evil illuminati went dang it he got us again we got it we got to shut it down

354
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:49,020
 if we launch the attack now these armchair researchers will expose our

355
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,540
 long-term goals shut it down call the aliens off

356
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:58,300
 shut down blue beam it's over now let's hide some messages in arthur and then

357
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,740
 you got to watch a bunch of episodes at arthur and hopefully

358
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,980
 decode that that art what is he like an art farc or something he has that weird

359
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,300
 looking nose i don't know if he's a doll or whatever but

360
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,780
 anyways that weird looking dude and that that fat weird looking dude are like

361
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,060
 shaking hands but it kind of looks masonic and then and then godlike

362
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,180
 productions is digging into it trying to go obviously that is circular logic

363
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,740
 obviously that is completely ridiculous you predict something's going to

364
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,980
 happen it doesn't happen your prediction was so right it stopped it from

365
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,780
 happening glp effect to this and that was back and like i said i was more into

366
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,420
 that back like in 20 probably from like it was probably longer than two years

367
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,940
 it was probably from like 2009 to 2012 i i i i don't know about the mayan

368
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,060
 awakening but i definitely had a awakening

369
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,780
 in the year 2012 i remember thinking this is absolute garbage

370
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,140
 all of this stuff is just absolute garbage still get a lot of entertainment

371
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,540
 value out of it but when i say i used to be like a 9/11 truth or

372
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,540
 it was i was i would have irritated myself back then

373
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,860
 and i definitely was wholeheartedly i wholeheartedly believed in

374
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,020
 most conspiracies except for lame ones like jfk in the moon landing

375
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,860
 anyways so i've been in the trenches with the people who believe in predictive

376
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,380
 programming i believe in predictive programming and then when i got back out

377
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,740
 i'm thinking like come on boys there's a world of knowledge out there that we

378
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,020
 can discuss without all this nonsense and i turn around and the trenches are

379
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,900
 still full they still got their helmets on and they're like

380
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,740
 no we're gonna stay in this trench it's safe in this little bubble

381
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,260
 so you have these people who really believe this las vegas carnivore actually

382
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,100
 he watches the show on youtube las vegas carnivore's comment was this and i'm

383
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,700
 paraphrasing the spiritual law thing is dumb

384
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,820
 the spiritual law thing is stupid where they have to warn us before they do the

385
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,220
 action but it's possible that they're using these

386
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,060
 messages in movies as some sort of hypercigill to almost force

387
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:02,860
 reality into their view and i said oh now that is

388
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,740
 interesting i hadn't heard that theory i hadn't heard that take on predictive

389
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,100
 programming before i've heard of the stories that

390
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,860
 iluminati put the codes in there to warn the other members of the iluminati

391
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,940
 stay out of london for the olympics alias are coming

392
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,460
 i've heard that they use it to desensitize us to the coming changes i've heard

393
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,140
 that they use it because it's part of their spiritual law they have to warn us

394
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,740
 but i've never heard that it's almost like brute force magic and then what's

395
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,940
 scary to that to the people who believe in predictive programming is that it

396
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,460
 once again removes the power from them one of the reasons why i think predictive

397
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,300
 programming is so popular is because it basically gives

398
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,340
 the average person the ability to warn others of upcoming attacks so you have

399
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,700
 the hidden knowledge component and it gives you the

400
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,260
 power to fight back against the faceless iluminati and that's the glp effect

401
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,460
 so it's a very attractive conspiracy theory

402
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,060
 las vegas carnivores take on it completely removes that power

403
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,140
 whether or not you decode the messages at all

404
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,700
 it's going to happen because it's basically the secret

405
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,220
 but instead of you living the secret or you having positive thinking or you

406
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,300
 doing hyperstitial working it's every member of the audience doing

407
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:22,300
 that towards this other goal great theory great theory

408
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,380
 it's interesting to think that movies might not just be a form of entertainment

409
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,300
 there could be i don't subscribe to the theory currently that there's a single

410
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,340
 iluminati i believe that there's multiple groups

411
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,260
 some name some unnamed that are vying for control

412
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,460
 of the planet or large swaths of it i do believe there's people in power who are

413
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,060
 trying to enact their goals over the whole population i absolutely believe

414
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,620
 that i just don't think it's one faceless

415
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,300
 organization and they're all connected because it just doesn't make sense

416
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,100
 i believe there's this group here and this group there and this group there

417
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:01,340
 and what if the war that's going on between those groups

418
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:08,140
 used to involve spies and armies and assassins between these groups that

419
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,860
 have existed for hundreds of years hidden from the general population

420
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,780
 and the little wars they waged that eventually sometimes would flare up

421
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:25,580
 into full-blown wars but then all those wars just kind of started to die down

422
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,860
 the global wars ended really in the 1940s

423
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,220
 and then the bush wars went on for a while but they

424
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,980
 they got a little bit less than the 80s you had like south america flare up and

425
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:44,380
 you but it was no longer this huge these huge conflicts

426
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,420
 maybe they weren't needed anymore because we had world war one and we had

427
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,020
 world war two but weaving its way through both of those was the

428
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:59,740
 technology of film and radio and what if these groups

429
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,820
 wised up and they thought you know what we don't need to fight this war with

430
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:10,380
 guns or bombs anymore we can reshape reality itself

431
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,100
 we can go in and make these movies and not just have a movie with a gay

432
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,980
 character in it and then 20 years later people are fine with their neighbor

433
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,380
 being gay i'm talking huge societal changes

434
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:28,940
 massive some of them sure maybe dystopian future to them it would be good but to

435
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,580
 us it would be dystopian other ones maybe a future that focused on

436
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,580
 technology and the great things it can provide

437
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,620
 maybe another group just wants a future where every man looks like matthew

438
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,180
 mccanae and he always gets dumped within 10 days

439
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,820
 these groups decided to stop fighting in the battlefields

440
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,980
 and begin fighting on the silver screen

441
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,380
 it's nothing you can predict it's nothing you can decode

442
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,780
 there's no real secret message there

443
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:09,980
 but it gives real meaning to the term the magic of the cinema

444
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,420
 dead rabbit radio at gmail.com is going to be your email address you can also hit
