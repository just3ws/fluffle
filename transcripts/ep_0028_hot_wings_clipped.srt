1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 Humanity prepares to touch the sun.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,640
 And when Hollywood gossip becomes true crime,

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,240
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,820
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back for another episode

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,680
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,080
 It's a Monday, it's 103 here in Hood River.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,000
 I'm actually recording a little bit earlier in the day.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,480
 I normally do this at night, but you know,

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,320
 I had some free time.

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,920
 I had the day off, so I figured I'd see what it's like,

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
 recording during the day.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,280
 There's a couple cars,

15
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,800
 there's a little more traffic outside than normal,

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,680
 but we'll see how it goes.

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,000
 Also this week, we're gonna do something

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,840
 a little bit different.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,280
 Every day we are going to feature a food-based story.

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,120
 Food-based conspiracy, weird stories about food,

21
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,540
 'cause I actually found a bunch of them

22
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,600
 when I was just looking.

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,560
 Because I actually found a bunch of them

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,520
 when I was just kinda looking at conspiracies this week.

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,160
 The first thing that I have to say right away,

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,600
 we actually bumped this up.

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,160
 The story, originally I had slated for Tuesday,

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,140
 but it's so important.

29
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,040
 You need to know it now.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,440
 And then we'll get into the intro and everything,

31
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,400
 just in case.

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,580
 I have to tell you this, just in case,

33
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,000
 you have a spoonful right now.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,440
 The CDC is telling people, do not eat honey smacks.

35
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,000
 The delicious, supposedly delicious cereal,

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,360
 I've never eaten it before,

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,080
 but the delicious cereal with the wrap-in hip-hop frog

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,920
 honey smacks has been linked

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,120
 to a multi-state salmonella outbreak,

40
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,880
 which is second to at least two people in Oregon.

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,800
 And I'm from Oregon,

42
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
 a lot of the listeners here are from Oregon.

43
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,000
 Since July 12th, 12th, however you say that,

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,480
 100 people since March, that doesn't make sense.

45
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,760
 Okay, since March, 100 people have gotten sick

46
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,720
 after eating honey smacks.

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
 Apparently there's some sort of salmonella outbreak.

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,880
 So, first off, I just stumbled across this story.

49
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,680
 Again, I was kind of looking up conspiracies,

50
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,480
 and this was just an alert on some website about Oregon.

51
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,280
 Oh, I was looking up Oregon employment laws,

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,120
 what I was doing, and I saw this story.

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,680
 This story should be everywhere.

54
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,200
 It's, can you imagine buying a box of honey smacks

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,760
 and you're like, gotta dig 'em honey smacks?

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
 Gotta dig 'em, I'm ribbit the rabbit,

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,520
 whatever his name was.

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,520
 Anyways, some little 10 year old has this bowl of honey smacks.

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,520
 He's getting ready to watch some slug-tara on Netflix,

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,400
 and he's just digging in, digging into that stuff.

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,360
 The next thing you know, they have to chop his hands off.

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,280
 Salmonella's actually like, paralyze you.

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
 It can get really, really bad.

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
 So I got a couple questions about this.

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,120
 One, why isn't this bigger news?

66
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,400
 I mean, I guess they probably sell,

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,880
 hundreds of thousands of boxes

68
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,440
 and only 100 people have gotten sick,

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,280
 but you would still think that a story of something

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,360
 that appeals to children is making people sick.

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,400
 Actually, now think about it.

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
 It says 100 people were sick.

73
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,160
 How many of those people were children?

74
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,980
 Are a bunch of adults eating honey smacks?

75
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,080
 I don't know, I don't know.

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,320
 I don't eat cereal, I don't, well, okay.

77
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,120
 First off, I don't eat anything for breathics in general.

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
 I'm not, I don't eat stuff when I wake up.

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,440
 But I'm not a big cereal guy, even.

80
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,200
 I have a couple boxes of cereal here

81
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
 that are at least five years old.

82
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,000
 I just never bought 'em and never ate 'em.

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
 I actually have a box of microwave popcorn bags

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,160
 and that's about six years old

85
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,680
 'cause I never eat that either.

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,920
 And I don't throw it away.

87
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,400
 I think it'd be funny if someone came over

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,880
 and it had some.

89
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,600
 I wake up and there's someone in my kitchen

90
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,760
 making some cereal and I will not say anything

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,120
 as she sits there and eats it and then leaves.

92
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,040
 I guess that's kinda cruel.

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,080
 But anyways, they'll probably get salmonella.

94
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,360
 My point, my second question is how does cereal,

95
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,640
 what in cereal can cause salmonella?

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,680
 I thought that was like eggs or cilantro.

97
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,320
 I thought that had to be some sort of produce.

98
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
 Isn't that just kind of like dried corn

99
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,280
 with like a honey glaze on it?

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,760
 It's kinda crazy how susceptible our food supply

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,680
 is to illnesses.

102
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,480
 You would think that something this basic,

103
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,200
 just basically like corn starch

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
 and high fructose corn syrup

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,320
 and whatever would be relatively free

106
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,420
 of any sort of like virus or bacterial infection.

107
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,200
 But who knows, it's apparently out there.

108
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,640
 If you're eating the honey smacks

109
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,600
 and I just caught it in time, you can thank me later.

110
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,440
 Send me an email telling me that you now owe me a life debt.

111
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,680
 A la Chewbacca and Han Solo or Brady Bunch.

112
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,600
 Pick your nerd culture.

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
 And then as I was looking at that,

114
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,200
 I came across a bunch of other food-based conspiracy season.

115
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,320
 We're actually gonna talk about another one of those

116
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,600
 in just a second.

117
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,040
 But first, I thought this story was interesting.

118
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,120
 I came across it a couple days ago.

119
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,040
 And it's just one of those kind of really cool science,

120
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,000
 the advancement of humanity,

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,280
 just the way that we're going

122
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,040
 and the way that we're exploring things.

123
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,480
 And of course, the whole idea of it

124
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,480
 is this amazing leap in human technology,

125
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,960
 this great step forward.

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,960
 And the journalist makes a joke in the headline.

127
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,880
 Which again, like I said, I appreciate that.

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,520
 I was a journalism major, my degrees in journalism.

129
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,560
 And I love it when there's a little bit of like,

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,040
 smarmy-ness or there's a joke in the lead

131
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,440
 or something like that.

132
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,160
 But it's always, it sticks out more

133
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,420
 when it's such a serious subject.

134
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,920
 So here's the headline.

135
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,720
 This is on CNET.com, links below, links in the notes.

136
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,880
 Headline is NASA Ready's probe to touch the sun

137
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,920
 with cutting edge heat shield.

138
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,740
 So they're gonna build this probe

139
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,360
 that's gonna get closer to the sun

140
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,560
 than anything humanity has ever built before.

141
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,840
 And they've come up with this amazing heat shield.

142
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,980
 It's gonna get within 29 million miles of the sun.

143
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,160
 Wait, no, take that off.

144
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,120
 So this probe is going to get

145
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,480
 within four million miles of the sun.

146
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,740
 Mercury is around 29 million miles away from the sun.

147
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,940
 And that place is a hellhole.

148
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,620
 I mean, I've always been told

149
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,860
 if you landed anything there or just melt immediately,

150
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,140
 it's super just like, it's just blasted by heat all the time.

151
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,480
 It's a horrible, horrible place to be.

152
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,600
 Not like Venus that is capable of having life on it.

153
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,340
 But this ship will get within four million miles.

154
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,820
 So it'll be closer than the planet Mercury.

155
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,260
 We're gonna get all this amazing readings

156
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,980
 and this amazing technology.

157
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,660
 So the headline, like I said, NASA ready probe

158
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,560
 to touch the sun with cutting edge heat shield.

159
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,640
 And then the sub headline is it's getting hot in here.

160
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,900
 So protect all your probes.

161
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:53,020
 Now, I appreciate the pun.

162
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,800
 I think it's definitely a generational pun.

163
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,500
 And if you don't get it, that's that Nelly song, "Hot In Here."

164
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,340
 It's getting hot in here.

165
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,060
 So take off all your clothes.

166
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,400
 I am getting so hot.

167
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,580
 It's getting hot in here.

168
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,260
 So protect all your probes.

169
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,700
 It's a very clever, it's a very clever.

170
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
 So Jackson Ryan, the writer, you know,

171
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,520
 sometimes writers don't come up with their own headlines.

172
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,940
 Sometimes it's the editor staff.

173
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,940
 That song is so catchy.

174
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,900
 That song is so catchy.

175
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,940
 And again, it's a generational thing.

176
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,180
 I never, I'm not gonna tell that story.

177
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,860
 Let's move on to the NASA story.

178
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,340
 So this probe is gonna come

179
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,940
 within four million miles of the sun.

180
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,220
 It's never been visited before by manmade spacecraft.

181
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,680
 I'd probably say by any spacecraft really, you know, generally.

182
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,940
 So this doesn't necessarily go into how the shield works.

183
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,660
 And even if it did, I probably wouldn't understand it.

184
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,780
 But what's amazing is they're saying that

185
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,220
 outside of the shield,

186
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,540
 it's gonna be exposed by 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

187
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,020
 2,500, yeah, 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

188
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,020
 Just blasting this manmade piece of metal

189
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,620
 floating through space.

190
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,220
 On the other side of the heat shield.

191
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,300
 So it will protect all of the gears

192
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,500
 and all of the reading, all of the instruments

193
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,480
 and the engine and all that stuff, 85 degrees.

194
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,380
 That's, I mean, and the thing is this,

195
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,760
 like if we're to this level of technology in 2018

196
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,900
 that we can fly this close, if this works,

197
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,180
 we can fly this close to the sun

198
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,140
 and it's that comfortable inside.

199
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,960
 We, this is completely breaking new bounds.

200
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,180
 All of these things about going to these planets

201
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,020
 in our solar system that we're gonna be more hostile

202
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,260
 to us, if we can get this close to the sun,

203
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,220
 we can put a base anywhere.

204
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,660
 We can put a base on a, you know,

205
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,020
 a one of the asteroids orbiting Saturn,

206
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,220
 or we can put a base on the dark side of the moon.

207
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,940
 If we can control the climate this close to the sun,

208
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,960
 then I don't foresee us having any trouble

209
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
 doing it the other way.

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,420
 This probe is most likely disposable.

211
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,660
 I don't think we're getting it back.

212
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,060
 I think we'll probably just get the readings,

213
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,020
 but there's just an amazing advancement

214
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,140
 in human technology.

215
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
 So that story is relatively short,

216
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,140
 but again, I mean, I just like the idea of it.

217
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,780
 You know, who hasn't wanted to get that close to the sun?

218
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,140
 My little brother, he has an interesting thought experiment.

219
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,500
 He said it to me once.

220
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,500
 He said, "Close your eyes and picture the sun.

221
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,140
 "As close to the sun as you can get."

222
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,380
 No, we'll do this, we'll do this exercise now.

223
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,800
 "Close your eyes and picture yourself

224
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,760
 "as close to the sun as you can get."

225
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,800
 What is going on?

226
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,160
 And it's funny because my answer was different

227
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,660
 than most people's answers.

228
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,080
 I'm kind of, I really like reading stuff about the sun,

229
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
 but so my little brother, he'd done this

230
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
 to multiple friends of his,

231
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,960
 and when he asked him to describe what was going on,

232
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,120
 they all said it was too bright to look at.

233
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,500
 And it's funny because it's your imagination.

234
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,680
 Your imagination, technically, you can imagine anything.

235
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,340
 If you imagine staring at the sun,

236
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,620
 you should be able to stare at the sun

237
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,940
 for an unlimited amount of time.

238
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,580
 There's no actual light rays coming into your eyeballs,

239
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,180
 but if people imagine staring at the sun,

240
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,380
 sometimes they'll imagine it that it's too bright

241
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,220
 to look at, even though it's simply in their imagination,

242
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,860
 'cause our brains have been trained so much

243
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,160
 to not look into the sun.

244
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,000
 It's funny, one thing,

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,320
 I've always been able to look into the sun.

246
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,280
 Ever since I was a little kid, I can look right at the sun.

247
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,240
 I don't do it for long, but other people are like,

248
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,280
 "Oh no, don't look at the sun."

249
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,960
 I don't know if you're not supposed to look at the sun

250
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,000
 at all, or if you're not supposed to look at the sun

251
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,040
 for a long amount of time,

252
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,880
 but I look at the sun all the time.

253
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,680
 When I did that experiment, my little brother goes,

254
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,920
 "What's going on?"

255
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,360
 I told him, "I could be close to the sun.

256
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,200
 "The brightness wasn't the issue, but the noise."

257
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,500
 Like if I really got into my imagination,

258
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,060
 the noise was deafening.

259
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,940
 So it was the same thing, like it's my imagination.

260
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,420
 I should be able to control it on any level,

261
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,700
 but the sun is just millions of,

262
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,620
 I just imagine millions of nuclear bombs going off

263
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,260
 every minute, just the noise that it must create

264
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,220
 if you're close enough to the sun that you can hear it.

265
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,020
 So a little thought experiment, it's interesting

266
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,340
 because yeah, our imagination,

267
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,140
 technically we should be able to be like,

268
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,020
 "Oh yeah, I'm walking on the sun and it's totally fine."

269
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,840
 Do, do, do, do, do, but there's a human walking on the sun.

270
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,000
 It's one thing 'cause we can't do that,

271
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,340
 but we have heard really loud explosions

272
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,960
 and we have looked at really bright lights.

273
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,200
 And if you imagine yourself looking at a bright light,

274
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,360
 you may find yourself flinching to that,

275
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,600
 even in your imagination, kind of holding your hands up

276
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,120
 'cause you're looking at a light that's so bright.

277
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,840
 Now, there's a website.

278
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,280
 This is gonna be moving on to our next story.

279
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
 And this is also food related.

280
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,240
 This is very interesting.

281
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,460
 So I go to this website.

282
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,140
 I'm a celebrity gossip geek.

283
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,900
 Like, I always read, and I don't read like

284
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,260
 Kylie Jenner's new boyfriend bought her a purse,

285
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,620
 but it was China Black's.

286
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,400
 I can't believe I even know the character's names,

287
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,740
 but no, it was China Black's brand.

288
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,980
 So Kylie got all mad because they don't like China Black

289
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,580
 and so on and so forth.

290
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,220
 They don't really follow gossip like that.

291
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,060
 I like the more kind of sinister dark Hollywood gossip.

292
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,580
 And there's actually a lot of websites like that.

293
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,260
 I'll link to one below.

294
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,040
 AGC Web Pages is the website.

295
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,780
 It kind of coalesce other Hollywood gossip

296
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,100
 into one easy to read page.

297
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,720
 And it's funny 'cause the page looks like it was made

298
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,800
 in like 1992.

299
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,840
 It's just very simple to read.

300
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,980
 Tons of information.

301
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,140
 So in the month of June, these two pieces of gossip popped up.

302
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,140
 Now, the way that these, these are called blind items.

303
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,540
 The way that this gossip is structured is that it gives you

304
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,000
 a brief description, not really using names

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,060
 of the people involved because it's gossip.

306
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,020
 They don't want to get sued.

307
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,900
 And then other people can try to figure out the names.

308
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,740
 And you know, you can credit it or discredit it

309
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,580
 as much as you want.

310
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,020
 That's fair.

311
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,380
 But so in June, these two blind items popped up.

312
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,140
 And then today I woke up and on Drudge Report

313
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,780
 was a very, very interesting article.

314
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,100
 So I'm gonna read the first blind item here.

315
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,700
 It was from June 8th of this year.

316
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,640
 She didn't, she didn't go.

317
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,280
 It was supposed to look like a murder suicide.

318
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,520
 That had been the plan all along.

319
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,240
 The plan that had been in place since March.

320
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,440
 Then as she began to get more and more attention

321
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,240
 and the claim, suddenly her schedule was too busy

322
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,760
 and she couldn't make it.

323
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,200
 What to do, what to do.

324
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,640
 Improvise, do what they always do.

325
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,560
 Make it look like all the rest they have done

326
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,140
 but also make sure they send a message to her.

327
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,420
 Apparently they sent her a picture with no words.

328
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,200
 Just the picture.

329
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,540
 I'm guessing she got the message.

330
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,700
 In the next few weeks, we will see if she ignores the message

331
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,840
 or continues to be brave and fight the good fight.

332
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:07,300
 Then on June 24th, so about two weeks later,

333
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,660
 here's another blind item.

334
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,540
 This gives a little bit of clues to who it is

335
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,260
 and I'll reveal who people think it is too.

336
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,340
 But this was the one from June 24th.

337
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,720
 This foreign born, illiterate celebrity

338
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,960
 has been taking no chances.

339
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,520
 She sleeps in a different place each night

340
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,440
 and makes sure she is always with at least one person

341
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,320
 if not two or three.

342
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,240
 She might get that new guy in her life killed

343
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,560
 if she doesn't get this thing settled once and for all.

344
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,680
 They are still out there until they are called off.

345
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,380
 So those two blind items specifically refer

346
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,920
 to Asia Argento and Anthony Bourdain.

347
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,060
 The first one is basically insinuating

348
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,140
 that Anthony Bourdain was murdered,

349
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,540
 that she was sent a photograph most likely of his body

350
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,100
 before anyone knew about it.

351
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,380
 And the reason why they've been targeted

352
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,340
 is the Me Too movement.

353
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,980
 And Anthony Bourdain, I've also heard conspiracy theory

354
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,440
 before today about Anthony Bourdain

355
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,560
 having issues with the Clintons, Bill and Hillary Clinton,

356
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,840
 which they're really tied into the Me Too movement.

357
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,320
 Obviously Hillary Clinton's had was best buddies

358
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,640
 with Harvey Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein,

359
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,440
 he was one of her top campaign donors.

360
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,360
 Bill Clinton goes without saying,

361
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,640
 raped and sexually assaulted multiple women.

362
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,120
 I'm not trying to get political here,

363
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,960
 but these are the very least he sexually harassed women.

364
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,720
 And then there's allegations that he's raped

365
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,120
 and sexually assaulted women as well.

366
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,200
 There was another story that just came out last year

367
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,560
 that Hillary Clinton's faith advisor,

368
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,120
 kind of her minister in her campaign

369
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,680
 was caught sexually harassing one of her female staffers.

370
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,280
 They moved the staffer, but kept the faith-based

371
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,940
 advisor for her.

372
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,340
 After the campaign, he went to another group,

373
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,040
 I think it was Chair Blue or something like that,

374
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,740
 where he sexually harassed a third person,

375
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,720
 he was fired on the spot,

376
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,180
 and that's when the new story came from.

377
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,560
 So she's been really linked to these issues

378
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,960
 with sexual, harass your sexual assaulters.

379
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,480
 Like I'm not saying that Trump is 100% innocent

380
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,120
 and I'm not trying to get into that.

381
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,640
 That's a totally different story.

382
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,000
 But in this particular story,

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,280
 these are things that have been allocated or proven.

384
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,560
 Like the faith-based guy,

385
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,160
 that's no one's disputing that story.

386
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,480
 Even Hillary Clinton has come out and said,

387
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
 "Yeah, I knew about it, but blah, blah, blah."

388
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,840
 And you can, I'll see if I can find the links for that.

389
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,520
 That was pretty much mainstream news.

390
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,460
 So not getting political.

391
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,580
 But so I remember reading those blind items.

392
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,420
 And I was like, you know, it's always,

393
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,600
 suicide is always tragic.

394
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,380
 Generally when people commit suicide,

395
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,460
 people are always looking for answers.

396
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,620
 I've heard, what's interesting, so all that being said,

397
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,860
 so Asia Argento is a big critic,

398
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,260
 a big outspoken advocate,

399
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,460
 I guess I should say of the Me Too movement.

400
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,300
 Anthony Bourdain has had run-ins with the Clintons before,

401
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,100
 but again, I was, I'd see that stuff and I was like,

402
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,860
 "Yeah, you know, it's tragic that he killed himself,

403
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,520
 but I don't think it's necessarily part

404
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,760
 of this Clinton murder machine."

405
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,000
 You, I saw these two blind items and they're like,

406
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,840
 these people were killed to cover up a bigger crime.

407
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,360
 So his last interview with the journalist,

408
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,080
 he's trashing on Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton,

409
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,880
 calls Bill Clinton rapey,

410
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,560
 goes on to say that Hillary had a part

411
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,200
 in destroying women, destroying sexual assault victims.

412
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,360
 And he just laid it out.

413
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,920
 And he called the former president a piece of shit

414
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,460
 entitled rapey, gropey, grabby, disgusting.

415
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,340
 He condemned Hillary saying that she destroyed these women

416
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,020
 when they came forth through the allegations.

417
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,620
 Here's a quote from him.

418
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,780
 He is a very speaking of Bill Clinton.

419
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,340
 This is Anthony Bourdain on Bill Clinton.

420
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,820
 He is a very charming man.

421
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,780
 I met him, he's fucking magnetic.

422
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,060
 As is Hillary.

423
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,220
 When you're in the room, you think,

424
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,100
 wow, she's really warm and nice and funny,

425
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,980
 but the way they efficiently dismantled, destroyed,

426
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,120
 and shamelessly discredited these women

427
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,160
 for speaking the truth.

428
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,000
 So basically like these victims had came forward

429
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,080
 and both Bill and Hillary just decimated them.

430
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,800
 And then he goes on to talk about how

431
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,840
 when Harvey Weinstein was first caught,

432
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,360
 when he first came out, Hillary tweeted,

433
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,840
 basically if Hillary's tweet at the time was,

434
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,880
 it was something, or Hillary said at the time,

435
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,040
 it was something that was intolerable in every way.

436
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,380
 And you know, like so many other people,

437
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,620
 so many people who've come forward and spoken out,

438
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,660
 this was a different side of a person who I

439
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,500
 and many others had known in the past.

440
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,420
 So basically Hillary saying, I didn't know anything.

441
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,580
 This is totally something that I didn't expect.

442
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,900
 And then Anthony Bourdain tweets that she,

443
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,240
 that her response was shameful in its deflection

444
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,260
 and its disingenuanness.

445
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,860
 So he doesn't believe what she's saying at all.

446
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,420
 He, here's the thing, she probably knew.

447
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,140
 He, Hillary Clinton was surrounded

448
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,900
 by secret service agents.

449
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,900
 From 1992 till today, she always had security.

450
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,360
 And you can't tell me that those security agents

451
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
 hadn't done massive background checks

452
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,480
 on anyone in her circle.

453
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,920
 And you can't tell me the secret service

454
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,680
 didn't know that was going on.

455
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,600
 And she was completely unaware.

456
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,760
 People will tend to make excuses for access and power.

457
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,240
 And I believe that's what she did, honestly.

458
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,720
 So anyways, he tweets that.

459
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,120
 And then he gets slammed.

460
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,080
 And this is his quote, which kind of goes

461
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,680
 into this whole conspiracy.

462
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,280
 "I will tell you that as frightening as that was

463
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,300
 at times," talking about the backlash

464
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,680
 when he called Hillary disingenuous.

465
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,880
 "I will tell you that as frightening as that was

466
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,840
 at times when I sat there with Asia

467
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,360
 and she texted her sisters,

468
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,400
 watching the Clinton apology on Weinstein

469
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
 and watching Asia watching that statement,

470
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
 there was a lot of anticipation.

471
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,760
 People were really hoping she'd come out with a,

472
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,720
 I don't know, let's just say with something different.

473
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,080
 I immediately tweeted my disappointment,

474
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,360
 very much shaped by what I saw around me.

475
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,520
 And I will tell you, that was really fucking frightening."

476
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,640
 The reaction to that.

477
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,380
 You know, I voted for her.

478
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,520
 So what happened behind the scenes?

479
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,280
 So that's a very telling comment.

480
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,080
 So Asia Argento was one of the young ladies

481
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,840
 who first accused Harvey Weinstein of rape.

482
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,040
 She's the daughter of Dairy Argento.

483
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,560
 She was in Land of the Dead.

484
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,360
 That was the first movie I've seen her in,

485
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,640
 but I knew her as the daughter of Dairy Argento.

486
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,640
 He's a big Italian zombie, filmmaker, zombie or movie maker.

487
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,960
 So anyways, he's saying that he's getting ready

488
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,280
 to watch Hillary Clinton make comments

489
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,160
 on Harvey Weinstein.

490
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,320
 She comes out with that, "Oh, I just didn't know.

491
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,960
 We all don't know who people really are

492
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
 in their private lives."

493
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,600
 He responds to that.

494
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,180
 And the reaction that he gets,

495
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,760
 he describes as fucking frightening.

496
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,720
 And then he says, "You know, I voted for her."

497
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,480
 So he's a supporter of Hillary Clinton.

498
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,200
 He doesn't have a dog in this race,

499
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,040
 but he was frightened by the response.

500
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,280
 He got back from her camp.

501
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,040
 So it was interesting.

502
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,920
 He then goes on to say that basically it was turned on him

503
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,160
 like he was defending Harvey Weinstein

504
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,760
 or he was accusing her of being in league

505
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,880
 and all this sort of stuff.

506
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,280
 And he goes in the interview.

507
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,760
 He totally calls out Jared Kushner as a snitch

508
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,680
 and basically says that he'll never

509
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,880
 be able to keep his mouth shut about any sort of crimes he's

510
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,360
 committed with the Trumps or the collusion.

511
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,360
 So again, this isn't a political hack job.

512
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,760
 You can tell he's not really happy with anything.

513
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,480
 And then he goes on to say that his dream is to watch

514
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,800
 Harvey Weinstein have a stroke and then fall into a bathtub.

515
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,160
 And as he's drowning, trying to figure out which

516
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,120
 of his friends to call.

517
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,880
 And he realized he doesn't have any friends

518
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
 and so on and so forth.

519
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,200
 So very angry because his girlfriend-- he was dating

520
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,960
 Asia Argento.

521
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,600
 His girlfriend had to go through all this.

522
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,640
 Then it was all brought back up into the public eye.

523
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,640
 So did the Clintons or somebody else

524
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,400
 involved with the cover up of the Me Too movement

525
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,240
 have Anthony Bourdain killed?

526
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,880
 Was he really that big of a critic

527
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,400
 of this group of men and women who have protected sexual

528
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,640
 assaulters in Hollywood and around the world?

529
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,080
 [SIGHS]

530
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:25,280
 You know, the sad fact is that he's either way he's dead.

531
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
 So there's no changing that.

532
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,280
 Obviously the best version-- I mean,

533
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,960
 I've watched this show once or twice.

534
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,360
 I can't-- he was kind of just a figure that I knew of.

535
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,640
 The tragic thing is that he's passed away now.

536
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,520
 The noble story.

537
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,000
 The story-- he's dead.

538
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,800
 We can't change that.

539
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,520
 So the story that makes everything makes sense.

540
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,800
 The story that gives us some sort of hope

541
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,040
 is the story that he was murdered.

542
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,120
 And I think that's sometimes what conspiracies do.

543
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,560
 You can get the facts together, and you can connect one, two,

544
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,440
 three, four, and you go, OK, I don't have five and six,

545
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,640
 but I can assume what seven and eight are going to be based

546
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,360
 on the pattern before that.

547
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,160
 So I don't think that he killed himself.

548
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,280
 I think that he was murdered by operatives,

549
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,080
 and Asia Argento is on the run now

550
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,360
 because she'll be next.

551
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:24,680
 That story is nice because it doesn't involve a depressed

552
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,400
 and lonely man taking his own life.

553
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:34,360
 Do I think it's possible that he was killed?

554
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,400
 It's possible.

555
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,880
 Technically anything's possible.

556
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,280
 Unfortunately, I don't necessarily think it's likely.

557
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,440
 And I think that's the same thing.

558
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,920
 It's funny, as I was doing this episode,

559
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,160
 I was like, I probably won't do the Chester Bennington.

560
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,760
 I hate that I don't remember his name,

561
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,480
 but the Chester and the Chris Cornell story,

562
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,320
 because I think it's kind of the same thing.

563
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,520
 You want to believe that these young men, these young people,

564
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,680
 didn't warrant just at the end of their no pun intended rope

565
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,120
 and took their own life because they were just so depressed

566
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,040
 and so distraught, or just had some sort of chemical imbalance,

567
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,280
 or just had a day that was off and they couldn't

568
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,720
 get it together.

569
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,640
 It's better to believe that these were soldiers.

570
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,880
 These were martyrs for a greater fight

571
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,560
 against a shadowy conspiracy.

572
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,120
 But is it likely?

573
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,160
 No.

574
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,520
 No.

575
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,880
 I think it's an interesting article.

576
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,560
 I think it's an interesting theory.

577
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,680
 But I think when we look at those conspiracy theories

578
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:46,560
 like this, we minimize talking about suicide in and of itself.

579
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,280
 So I could talk about this conspiracy theory

580
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,120
 and say, yes, he didn't kill himself.

581
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,160
 This is an ongoing war between the forces of light

582
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,280
 and the forces of dark and so on and so forth.

583
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,320
 But really, the discussion we need to have is no more suicides.

584
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,240
 How can we as a society and we as individuals

585
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,800
 not promote that, not hide it, to talk about it as an actual thing?

586
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,480
 Again, there's always a lot of options out there.

587
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,800
 If you are having those thoughts, there's always options out there.

588
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,520
 Talk to a friend.

589
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,640
 Talk to a stranger if you have to.

590
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,400
 There's always the suicide prevention hotline 1-800-273-8255.

591
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,280
 They even have an online chat option.

592
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,160
 I'll put that in the show notes.

593
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,680
 So I think that's an important--

594
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,320
 I think that's honestly more important than the conspiracy

595
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,840
 itself.

596
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,640
 Maybe I'm wrong.

597
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,240
 Maybe it will come out that he was actually

598
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,360
 killed by this shadowy conspiracy and Aja Argento is next.

599
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,400
 Or maybe it's something people made up to make sense of the world

600
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,840
 because they knew him.

601
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,240
 And it's easier to believe that your friend or your role

602
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,240
 model or your television show host that you watched every week

603
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,880
 and you bought all of his shows on DVD

604
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,840
 and he was your friend.

605
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,400
 He was your virtual friend.

606
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,920
 It's easier to believe that he was murdered

607
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,240
 than that that man took his life just like it's hard

608
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,880
 to imagine any of your friends or family taking their lives.

609
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,400
 And so a little bit of a depressing ending,

610
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:36,480
 but don't let it be because there's always hope.

611
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,720
 There's always hope.

612
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,120
 And we can always reach out to the people who need our help.

613
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,720
 And if you need someone's help, there's

614
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,120
 always going to be someone out there for you.

615
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,640
 It may not feel like it, but it could just

616
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,480
 be someone you meet online.

617
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,120
 It doesn't have to be this amazing thing.

618
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,760
 It's going to be something that you never even

619
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,880
 really know their real name.

620
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,360
 You're just talking to them.

621
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,520
 Reach out.

622
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,120
 Reach out.

623
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,760
 And here's another reason why.

624
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,200
 This is what I always say.

625
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,920
 Think of your favorite television show,

626
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,480
 your favorite movie series.

627
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,080
 Whenever you're really depressed and you're--

628
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,800
 I mean, you're not just having the occasional thought

629
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,400
 about suicide.

630
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,200
 You're planning it out.

631
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,880
 I've run into people like this online.

632
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,200
 They're ready to go.

633
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,640
 I'll ask, what's your favorite television show?

634
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,200
 The guy said, it's always Sunday in Philadelphia.

635
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,640
 And I said, you know what?

636
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,800
 Why don't you just wait until the run of the show is over?

637
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,560
 Wait till the show's canceled or they quit making episodes.

638
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,960
 Because that's your favorite show.

639
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,440
 And that's one of my favorite shows, too.

640
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,160
 I've watched it multiple times, the whole season through.

641
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,080
 You're going to miss all those episodes if you kill yourself.

642
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,840
 And sometimes little things can have big meanings.

643
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,320
 Someone is a huge Star Wars fan.

644
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,000
 I can't imagine why nowadays.

645
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,800
 Let's say someone is a huge Avengers fan.

646
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,400
 And they're just ready to indents.

647
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,480
 They say, well, give it a couple-- give it two more movies.

648
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,560
 Let's buy some time.

649
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,160
 Let's watch those movies.

650
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,600
 We'll talk about them.

651
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
 Oh, OK.

652
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,760
 Doesn't work for everybody.

653
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,960
 But when you throw out general stuff like, oh,

654
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,880
 you have so much to live for, people go, no, not really.

655
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,480
 Tomorrow, you know, just be happy.

656
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,840
 That doesn't work.

657
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,920
 That doesn't work.

658
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,440
 On a side note, they actually say, if you're being mugged

659
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,640
 or someone has a gun on you, don't say.

660
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,160
 I have a kid and a wife at home.

661
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,120
 This is actually old police advice.

662
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,680
 If someone ever pulls a gun on you,

663
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,440
 don't talk about your family.

664
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,640
 Because it's possible that that person doesn't

665
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,320
 have any sort of family connection,

666
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,760
 or you may remind them of their crappy family,

667
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,000
 their crappy childhood.

668
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,040
 I have a kid at home.

669
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,840
 And that may actually make them matter.

670
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,320
 So if they had a horrible family life,

671
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,280
 or they don't have kids, or they're in a horrible place,

672
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,240
 and they have a gun on someone who they perceive

673
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,240
 has a better life than them, don't say anything.

674
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,400
 You really should not try to engage

675
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,480
 with a armed criminal at all.

676
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,080
 My wallet, here's my wallet.

677
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,880
 Oh no, I have a wife and kids at home.

678
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,640
 That person may go, you know, I don't have a home.

679
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,720
 I'm living in an alley.

680
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,560
 Pop!

681
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,680
 Yeah.

682
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,080
 So anyways, that's kind of a bit of a tangent.

683
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,480
 But hopefully that saves your life too.

684
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,760
 Also, another piece of advice, never get in the car.

685
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,200
 Anyone ever wants you to get in the car?

686
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,840
 They have a gun on you, they have a bazooka on you,

687
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
 they have a flamethrower?

688
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,040
 Don't get in the car, because guess what?

689
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,080
 Well, gunner probably, if they, right there,

690
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,920
 they'll shoot you or set you on fire,

691
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,080
 and you're in the middle of a neighborhood.

692
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,840
 Or people will know you're walking along that trail,

693
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,920
 or whatever, and they'll be able to get you.

694
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,320
 If you're shot in a neighborhood,

695
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,440
 you'll start to bleed out, and someone will come out.

696
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,680
 If you get in that car,

697
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,640
 you're going to someone's torture dungeon.

698
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
 Don't ever get in the car.

699
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,960
 Take the bullet, take the flamethrower,

700
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,600
 take the bucket of acid in your face,

701
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,040
 because trust me, it's going to get 10 times worse

702
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,560
 if you get in that car.

703
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,600
 I guess that's going to do it

704
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,520
 for this episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

705
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,160
 You got a little bit of life advice in the ending.

706
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,480
 I think the Anthony Bourdain conspiracy

707
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,880
 is really interesting.

708
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,040
 Obviously, I'm going to keep following it

709
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,160
 because there's a lot of info on it.

710
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,320
 And if anything changes, I'll let you guys know.

711
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,800
 But right now, I think we just need to think about

712
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,200
 his life, his legacy, and how we can prevent

713
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,920
 that from happening with other people again.

714
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,520
 I think that's kind of the more important story

715
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,000
 than the conspiracy theory.

716
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,040
 So I hope you guys had a great time listening.

717
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,800
 Dead Rabbit Radio is our website.

718
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,800
 We have the fastest growing podcast in Wasco County.

719
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,240
 It's pretty good.

720
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,080
 It's pretty good.

721
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,360
 It's a pretty big size county up in Hood River.

722
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,480
 @jasonocarpenter is my Twitter.

723
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,000
 We have our email address, that's deadrabbitradio@gmail.com.

724
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,840
 We now have a Facebook that is facebook.com/deadrabbitradio.

725
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,880
 And that is going to be it for tonight.

726
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,440
 Actually, I think we did a pretty good job

727
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,800
 recording the afternoon.

728
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,320
 We got our kind of depressing story out of the way.

729
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,640
 I think most of the stories are going to be more lively

730
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
 for the rest of the week.

731
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,560
 They're all going to have a food.

732
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,520
 Every day, we're going to talk about a new food conspiracy

733
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,920
 building up to one of the most bizarre

734
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:12,000
 and hard to find conspiracies that I've spent

735
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,720
 time looking for in the past 30 days.

736
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,120
 I found some stuff on hard stuff,

737
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,280
 but I've really been looking out this conspiracy theory.

738
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,320
 I don't want to build it up too much,

739
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,000
 but on Friday, we are going to touch one

740
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,280
 of the main conspiracy theories on our conspiracy theory list.

741
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,600
 It is related to food.

742
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,760
 So get your forks, get your knives,

743
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,680
 watch your calories, and come back tomorrow

744
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,040
 for another episode of Dead Rappity.
