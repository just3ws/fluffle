1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
 The man who smelt so bad that they had to ground the flight and then we'll

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,920
 revisit the resistance of light today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:24,400
 Hey everyone this is Jason Carpenter. Well this is Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm Jason

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,200
 Carpenter. A quick clarification, smelt. If somebody smelt so bad is it actually

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,200
 smelled so bad? I'm not for sure. I'm not for sure. I'm barely holding on. I got a

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,520
 pretty bad sinus, some sinus stuff going on. Funny because I have to listen back

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,960
 to the episodes and I was like, "Oh man it sounds like I'm getting a cold. Like I

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,400
 could hear my voice getting a little more horse-aged episode and then sure

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:57,320
 enough I'm having full-on sinus pressure today." But you know doing my thing, taking

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,040
 medicine, sleeping, I'm fasting for it too, which you think would make me more

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,760
 miserable. But once you get used to fasting it's it's it's pretty normal.

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,720
 Heads up to my friend Veronica who went and bought me some medicine today. That was

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,720
 nice. Well that was homebound. I got, before we get started here, because I know

14
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,320
 I'm always so succinct in my beginnings, today I got my copy of Stephen King's

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,920
 Shot John Lennon by Steve Lightfoot. I paid $10 for it and I'm gonna tell you

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,080
 guys right now, I'll put the link at the bottom below. This was easily worth $10.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,640
 There's no sarcasm in this whatsoever. One, he autographed it. I

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,960
 don't know if he does that for all of them, but he did put a message on here.

19
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,440
 "To Jason, thanks for your vital concern, Steve Lightfoot." Like I said in the

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,120
 two episodes regarding Stephen King's Shot John Lennon, I've been following this

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,040
 conspiracy theory for probably about two years now and to be able to to me hold a

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,360
 piece of conspiracy history. It's quite amazing. It's quite amazing. Now those two

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,400
 episodes, I think they're episodes five and six. What that would, I think I'm going

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,320
 to, we're gonna keep covering that conspiracy theory, but if you listen to

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,960
 those two episodes and you weren't a huge fan of it, blame it more on the format,

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,240
 not on the subject matter. I found the subject very fascinating and I kind of

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,560
 did a dramatic reading of his writings. I don't really know how now that the show

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,200
 has, you know, 10 episodes later, I think the show's kind of found its tone a

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,440
 little more. So we're gonna be revisiting that, but I don't, I'm not gonna go over

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,120
 today because I just got it and I really want to read through it, but I'm

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,680
 telling you, it is, I'm not disappointed. It looks amazing. Covers a lot of the

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,600
 same detail, but I'm going to say this. So you know, like I said, I've been

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,240
 following it for two years and his website's just kind of spiraled out, but

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,920
 the, in this one he actually has a, he has a back-to-back picture of Chapman and

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,360
 King and then they do kind of look alike. They do kind of look alike. It's kind of

36
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,240
 weird. So we're gonna probably handle that on Monday or Tuesday because I got to

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,880
 read over that. I got to play practice a bunch of stuff too. Okay, let's go ahead

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,440
 and get started here because I got two really good stories, so I don't think we

39
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,840
 need much introduction. This first story I saw was fascinating just because it's

40
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,840
 one of those situations. It's sad. I feel really bad for the guy, but it's one of

41
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,520
 those situations that I think we can all empathize with, kind of on both levels.

42
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:43,160
 So you're a passenger on a plane and you get up in the plane and the planes

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,400
 flying now. Everyone's trapped on this plane and you're sitting there and you're

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,320
 reading your in-flight magazine or you're, you know, playing, I don't know, what do

45
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,960
 people play on their phones? I don't know, Fortnite, whatever. You're a kid, I guess,

46
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:07,000
 in this scenario, but all of a sudden you start to smell something. Now, it's, you

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,640
 can't really place it at first. It's not, it's not body odor. Does it smell like raw

48
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:20,840
 sewage? No, no, no. It's worse than raw sewage. And you kind of look around and

49
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,600
 either just the smell is feeling, filling your nostrils. You just feel it

50
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,440
 burning, burning your nose and you kind of look around and you notice other

51
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,520
 people, they seem to smell it too because they're also kind of looking around

52
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,280
 like I haven't, looking around the plane. Can't figure it out. Everyone's kind of

53
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,840
 looking at each other and the smell is getting worse and worse and worse. Now

54
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,520
 imagine the worst smell you can imagine. It's kind of hard because scent is such a

55
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:53,080
 different type of scent memory. We can remember like the physical reactions we

56
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,600
 have to smell, but it's hard to actually remember the smell itself. But you know,

57
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,520
 we have stuff like rotten eggs or poop or stuff like that. But no, this smell is

58
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,520
 worse than all of them because you're on this plane, you're up in the air, you're

59
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,920
 30,000 feet in the air and what you're smelling is rotting human flesh. You're

60
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,960
 smelling flesh rot off of a living person sitting four seats in front of you.

61
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,120
 It's overwhelming now. The air is just getting circulated. You have no escape.

62
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,160
 You can't open a window. So you plug your nose at first, but that's no. Available.

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,800
 People begin fashioning little masks for themselves and coughing, retching almost

64
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,800
 because the smell is just filling the cabin. There's no way for the odor itself

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,400
 to escape, so it's only growing as more and more flesh is rotting off of this

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,080
 guy. So passengers begin throwing up. Now that's not how to help me the smell

67
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:01,560
 either. So passengers are throwing up. The man profusely apologizes and he feels bad

68
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:09,320
 that he's rotting. He's rotting in front of you. Pilot is smelling it too and the

69
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,280
 pilot comes back and he assesses the situation. You're still your innate

70
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,040
 year old boy in this scenario apparently and you put your phone down and you see

71
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,640
 the pilot and he's talking to the stewardess and they walk up to the

72
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,600
 man who looks normal. He looks a little sick because he's rotting away,

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,080
 but they didn't notice anything wrong with him. It kind of sounds like a zombie

74
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,680
 movie actually, but so they say well let's lock him in the bathroom. Maybe that

75
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,960
 will stop the smell and then we can get to our destination. And the guy's like

76
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,720
 yeah, no, fine. I'm super sick. I have no problem with that. So he goes into the

77
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,600
 restroom and they lock him in there and it doesn't work. The smell is just too

78
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,160
 overpowering. It's still that it's just creeping out from underneath the bathroom.

79
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,120
 The whole cabin's full of it. They have to let, they make an emergency landing. So

80
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,240
 what happened was this guy named Andre Shillen, Shillian, Shillian, 58 years old.

81
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,920
 He got an infection and he, what happened was he was suffering from tissue

82
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,400
 necrosis. His flesh was rotting on the plane and we're gonna go ahead and post

83
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,520
 the article here. People were fainting from the smell and unfortunately is that

84
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,320
 he's passed away now. They landed the plane and they tried to get him, get him

85
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,720
 treatment but it was too late. Too much of him. It kind of rotted away. And it's

86
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,160
 weird. So this was his response. It's not after he died obviously, but this was his

87
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,520
 after emergency landing he wrote on Facebook. "The tragic and comic component

88
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,680
 of this whole situation is that I caught a disease which, let's not say how and

89
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,720
 why, makes a person quite stinky. As a result, a group of passengers may demand

90
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,760
 the captain for you to be removed from the plane." So I think it's weird that

91
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,740
 they don't really, like he doesn't state what it is and I didn't see on the

92
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:04,760
 article what caused him to have that infection. But they tried their best. They

93
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,200
 did multiple surgeries. You couldn't stop it. Now this guy, this Andre Shillian to us,

94
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,840
 or to me at least, he's just a guy with an unfortunate accident. Apparently in

95
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,280
 Russia he's like would be like their version of Jimi Hendrix. He was like a

96
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,080
 guitar god. He was considered one of the top guitar players in Russia and was a

97
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:34,200
 pioneer of rock music in the Soviet Union. So that's tragic. You know one of

98
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,800
 those things, the smells are impossible really to get past. I always

99
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,520
 ask questions of people and if you have, if you're wondering, is this an act? Is

100
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,000
 Jason just, is this like a bit he's constantly doing for the show or does he

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,240
 actually act like this? I act like this all the time. It's not a bit. But I'll

102
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,760
 ask people I'll go, this is one of my like thought experiments. I say you meet a guy

103
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,160
 or girl, whatever. You meet the person of your dreams and they're everything you

104
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,520
 wanted. Everything you wanted. If you want them to be rich, they're rich. If you

105
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,960
 want them to be successful like a writer, that if you want them to be like six,

106
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,080
 seven feet tall, whatever. But his face is completely busted up. He's totally ugly

107
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,680
 and you can't do any sort of repairs to it. And people always go well how ugly

108
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,880
 are we talking? And I'm like well I mean like on a scale of one to ten let's put

109
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,880
 him in like a three or four. So he's not like if you look at him you want to

110
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,040
 vomit but he's not good looking by any means and even you don't think he's good

111
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,000
 looking face wise. Would you date him? And people generally go yeah, yeah everything

112
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,960
 else is perfect. If he's kind or funny or if he's a you know domineering or

113
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,480
 whatever whatever you look for. Then I ask the same question. I go what if he's

114
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,480
 everything you look for, everything and he has a beautiful face or whatever type

115
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,640
 of face you want but he smells like wet garbage. Would you date him? And most

116
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,520
 people that that gives them pause. We can look past physical differences. You can

117
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,240
 see someone and they're everything's perfect about them but they have some

118
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,000
 you know like their face was burned off or something like that. And you could be

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,960
 like I can make this work but if they smell like wet garbage and again you

120
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:19,400
 can't do anything to fix it. That changes the answer. Smells are super important

121
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,440
 to us. They're completely overriding and we can't really do anything to stop

122
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,400
 them. You can't put a bag over a smell. Now here's a gross smell story that I have

123
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,360
 and I've always I'm sure there was some sort of scientific principle here but I

124
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,800
 used to when I had an apartment in Sacramento. I had these really nice

125
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,520
 neighbors. They were from another country and they made like this super

126
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,960
 pungent food and it actually smelled pretty good. It was all like you know

127
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,720
 rice and sauces and stuff like that. They were really good neighbors and just

128
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,400
 around dinner time you would smell the food through the walls of the apartment

129
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,640
 because it like I say was very pungent but it wasn't it wasn't offensive I

130
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:04,400
 never really cared. One day I went to the bathroom and it was super hot so I had

131
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,960
 the door open. I was living by myself but I like needed air flow in there so I'm

132
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,720
 going to the bathroom and they start cooking their food in the next

133
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:21,960
 apartment and the smell of my poop and the smell of their food created a I

134
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,640
 almost threw up. It created the most noxious smell I've ever smelled in my

135
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,920
 life. I couldn't even describe it to you. I couldn't even try to compare it to

136
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,720
 something. It smelled like a chemical weapon. It smelled like I was going to

137
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,760
 die and I was trapped because I was still going to the bathroom and I remember

138
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,080
 going and I almost like looking back at that I imagine like the molecules the

139
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,240
 two the two smell molecules like binding together into a third unheard of

140
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,440
 smell or uns smelled of smell like it only existed in that one moment of time

141
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,360
 they had to be cooking that exact meal and I had to be deprecating at the same

142
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,200
 time it was disgusting. It was disgusting and what's funny is that I could

143
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,480
 probably like I could probably recognize that smell but I couldn't describe it to

144
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,360
 you. It was absolutely just awful. So I think that's probably my worst smell

145
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,320
 story. I don't think oh you know I did look this up the other day so you know

146
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,320
 there's I guess you know where I'm going with this. I don't know I'm doing a

147
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,760
 lead-in but you know there's speed of light and there is speed of sound. The

148
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,680
 other day I thought what's the speed of smell what's the speed of touch and taste

149
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,640
 of course you know the internet wasn't the you know the greatest help on that

150
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,040
 but I did find out that the speed of taste there is a speed of taste they

151
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,160
 can measure. I could have really find anything on the speed of smell but I have

152
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,760
 to think that the speed of touch has to be faster than the speed of light

153
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,320
 because you figure if I touch a hot stove the signal has to travel from my

154
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,440
 fingertip all the way up to my brain and then all the way back down to my hand to

155
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,440
 move it away and that is almost instantaneously because that you don't

156
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,720
 get burned you're out you know and I think that the distances involved on

157
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,240
 you may go well Jason your fingertip to your brain and back is much shorter than

158
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,840
 you know from here to a light you're out. However I think relatively the

159
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,480
 distances are the same I mean my brain doesn't know and there's I'm gonna try

160
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,240
 to find this article I found a couple things about how your brain actually

161
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,640
 registers pain before you feel it and they can't figure out why like technically

162
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,200
 you shouldn't if you touch it there should be a delay between the time you

163
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,800
 touch it the signal going up to your brain and signal coming back to your

164
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,960
 finger and you're removing it but when we tested it's far faster than it should

165
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,640
 be so they can't really figure that out anyways anyways anyways I don't know

166
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,760
 speed of smell speed of smell so I'm thinking the same thing with the speed

167
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,480
 of smell speed of smell I just probably faster than the speed of sound because

168
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,040
 you got to smell something like not I'm not talking about the little like wavy

169
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,120
 lines like you see in cartoons that reach my nose those are the speed of wind

170
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,440
 but once it hits my nose it has to go to my brain and then back to my nose I

171
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,960
 don't know and I guess that's probably as fast as the speed of taste I'm gonna

172
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,040
 say both of those are stronger faster than the speed of sound and I also think

173
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,200
 speed of sound is stronger than the speed of light because I can shut a door

174
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,880
 and light can't pass through it oh no no sounds is stronger than light is what

175
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,080
 I'm saying because if I shut a door there's no more light but you can shut

176
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:42,600
 10 doors and still hear music so light is faster but sounds is stronger which

177
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,080
 makes me think we shouldn't be trying to build laser guns we should be building

178
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,320
 like big sound guns and just like knocking stuff out of the sky with sound

179
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,600
 that would be the noisiest war ever though if you think about it did you

180
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,200
 know bombs have whistles on them that's what I heard when I was a kid I probably

181
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,680
 heard it from that same encyclopedia that told me whales live to be 500 years

182
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,920
 but apparently bombs have whistles on them so when they fall they go to that

183
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,600
 that they normally don't do that like if you just dropped a metal out of a plane

184
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,680
 but you put a whistle on the end of the palm and so the wind blows through it so

185
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,560
 it makes everyone scared and look up and it's like traumatizing I probably should

186
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,080
 Google I should probably Google a lot of stuff oh and I did Google can a mountain

187
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,800
 be tall enough to reach the atmosphere the other day when I was editing that

188
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,720
 episode and like 10 articles came up so that's ridiculous I said oh I can't find

189
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,520
 it and then I googled it and it's all over the front page anyways so now we're

190
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,720
 gonna get to what I think is becoming if Steve Lightfoot if Steve Lightfoot the

191
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,120
 architect behind who shot John Lennon is becoming almost like the anti-hero of

192
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,400
 this podcast where he's he's he's a mystery then I'm starting to think that

193
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,040
 the resistance of light may actually become our mini-boss because I was

194
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,360
 look I was listening back to that episode earlier today and I'm like these

195
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,720
 guys are so ridiculous the resistance of light is so ridiculous I need to look

196
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,680
 into these guys a little bit more they're the ones who have like the three

197
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,600
 sectors and I'll have I think they're on no place like space episode I think

198
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,640
 they're on episode 8 but anyway so I went and did did some more digging into

199
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,400
 them and they're just absolutely ridiculous so first off I did was looking

200
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,640
 at some of the stuff that they sell and they sell like tachyon water water that's

201
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,560
 been bombarded with tachyons at 36 bucks for like a leader and they sell

202
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,840
 tachyon protectors for your phone you can buy little gems all that stuff and

203
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,920
 I'm like okay you know what you can say hey listen I got this water and I've

204
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,960
 bombarded it with some science stuff and you don't know if I did but you know

205
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,080
 trust me I have you has a resistance of light ever lied to you and you're like I

206
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,160
 guess not you pay 36 bucks for the water but one thing I also came across was the

207
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,560
 sin Tom and a stones sin tonnage stones so there are these little these little

208
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,720
 rocks and they say that around 30,000 kilograms of diamonds are mined around

209
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,760
 the world each year whereas only 50 kilograms of centanami stone are found

210
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,960
 yearly well that might be true but probably because no one's looking for it

211
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,520
 like they're looking for diamonds but anyway so these little rocks which is

212
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,600
 what they are it says I'm just gonna call them sin stones a sin stones is the

213
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,160
 stone with the highest vibration of all stones no and I'm okay source source

214
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,160
 needed but it awakens you to your mission strengthens your inner guidance and

215
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,760
 contact with your higher self and dissolves implants and outdated belief

216
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,400
 system so I guess basically you hold it oh and these ones have been tacky and

217
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,200
 eyes as well anyways you hold it and all your implants will fall out which if you

218
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,360
 are a porn star is probably not a good idea these little rocks and that's what

219
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:05,080
 they are for a four to seven gram rock fifty euros so what is that like sixty

220
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,160
 US dollars and then it goes up fifty euros sixty euros it for a gem grade

221
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,480
 stone whatever that means it's polished they probably through through a fifth

222
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,520
 graders rock tumbler hundred euros and if you want a gem grade stone that's seven

223
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,240
 to twelve grams it's 200 euros so there you go these people are totally ripping

224
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,880
 people off it does appear that they have a lot a big following in Asia which the

225
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,600
 website boasts like I was looking at their web counter and I'll put the link

226
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,480
 into the description but they say they've had 42 million hits which is

227
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,320
 possible I mean scams do get to be very popular they currently have a petition

228
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,640
 now now this is a group that's talking about global enlightenment and so I

229
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,120
 saw that they had a they were raising money for an African village or a kid or

230
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,840
 something like that and so they're the fur global enlightenment they're for like

231
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,720
 helping out of the people's and selling rocks they find itself like that so they

232
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,200
 have a petition and so here's the question you think okay so what's this

233
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,960
 petition about is it about like in world hunger is it about you know save the

234
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,640
 endangered African panda rhino whatever no it's for planetary liberate

235
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,040
 now so you sign this petition and you're you are basically it says we are all

236
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,200
 aware that there are forces within the banking establishment military industrial

237
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,800
 complex and also on the non-physical planes that do not wish humanity to be

238
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,880
 free they have stolen our money they have poisoned our food they are trying to

239
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,080
 take away our freedom they are trying to take away our happiness we will not let

240
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,480
 them so I don't know how the people in the non-physical plane are going to see

241
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,200
 this petition like if they're like ethereal ghosts floating in the void and

242
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,200
 being like oh have you checked out their web page their web presence lately

243
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,880
 anyways so they're trying to get 144,000 people to sign this because that's the

244
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,400
 biblical number in book revelation they have 25,000 people have already signed

245
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,800
 it or 26,000 close enough and what's funny is that they've stolen our money

246
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,120
 they've poisoned our food and then they say they are trying to take away our

247
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,040
 freedom if these dark ones are so powerful why haven't they already done it

248
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,960
 that's always the big question if the Illuminati are so powerful why haven't

249
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,440
 they made their move yet I do believe their private groups trying to control

250
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,320
 parts of the public sector I do believe that but I think the fact that we're

251
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,120
 still freer than we're supposed to be under their rule is a sign that they're

252
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,160
 not doing things right and the same thing with these these non-physical plane

253
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,160
 creatures they've stolen my money and they poison my food but they're trying

254
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,360
 to take away my happiness they haven't got there yet that's pretty that's pretty

255
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:51,440
 bad on you ghost overlord so I found this and I thought this was awesome so

256
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,120
 anyways it's awesome and it's sad at the same time okay so I saw this and this is

257
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,760
 their entry protocols for the underground resistance which again we talked

258
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,480
 about earlier now this is both hilarious and sad first off the website that we're

259
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:16,240
 going to for this is 2012 portal dot blog spot com now one if you don't care

260
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,080
 enough about your idea to register a domain name for 1499 a year through Go

261
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,080
 Daddy it's probably not that important to you really secondly if you're talking

262
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,840
 about the planet being liberated now and these are all this is all recent stuff

263
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,200
 if you're talking about the planet being liberated liberated liberated now and

264
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,360
 you're any day now the pleidians are going to show up and we're going to need

265
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,120
 you to fight the dark ones and it's going to happen it's going to happen soon

266
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,080
 why is your website called 2012 six years ago and here's the thing if they

267
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,960
 bought a domain name and they had linked it to this I never would have known but

268
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,320
 this is what they call themselves 2012 ridiculous the ascension past dude you

269
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,240
 got left behind like the rest of us so apparently a dream has gone out to the

270
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,760
 people this dream has gone out to people who are not yet in the resistance of

271
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,040
 light but are being called up it's their destiny you're a loser in your real life

272
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,040
 you got nothing going on don't worry because there's a super secret fantasy

273
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,920
 war coming up and you too can be a part of it if only you follow us then you'll

274
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,360
 know your true mission in life and everyone who has ever mean to you

275
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,520
 they'll be like you know what Jason Jason was the hero he's the one who fought

276
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,520
 those space ghosts in the battle of Hood River because he had that dream and he

277
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,960
 followed the entry protocols this is this is them this is what they sell to

278
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,000
 go above people anyways so this is here goes if you if you are selected for

279
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 pre-event entry into the resistance the entry protocols are as follows step one

280
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,800
 you will be physically contacted by a resistant agent very near to the place

281
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,880
 where you live so I'm he will he or she will be wearing plain civilian clothes

282
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,960
 and will emanate very positive energy he she will introduce herself himself

283
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,240
 okay that's gonna get annoying he will introduce himself to you and ask you if

284
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,600
 you're willing to enter the resistance it will be explained to you after in

285
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,560
 entering the resistance you will not be able to have any physical contact with

286
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,680
 the service population so let's let's unpack that for a second you're walking

287
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:38,280
 on the street somebody walks up to you in normal clothing who just seems to be

288
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:43,840
 really happy and they're going to say hi I'm Jason would you like to join the

289
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:53,280
 resistance and your answer if yes you disappear you will no longer have

290
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,000
 physical contact with the service population if you say yes you basically

291
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,520
 go missing and become a missing person that is step one step two clarifies that

292
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,480
 because it says you will be given between five and fifteen minutes to

293
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,840
 collect your personal items to bring with you you will be asked to bring

294
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,960
 objects of personal emotional value wedding rings why would you have more

295
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,920
 than one wedding ring of photos of loved ones etc because all other objects

296
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,920
 clothing food gold cash ID documents can be easily reproduced with replicators

297
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,920
 you will be given a small bag and all your items will need to fit in that bag

298
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,120
 size and weight requirements will be very similar to requirements astronauts

299
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,280
 have had for their personal items on a space shuttle now what's funny is that

300
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,520
 then they include a link to how much weight a astronaut can carry on a space

301
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:49,040
 shuttle so again people buy into this nonsense and I'm sure people reading

302
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,720
 this started carrying around photos of their loved ones and their wedding rings

303
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,920
 plural and they're like well this is what I'll take with me because this is what

304
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,200
 who clicked on the link to find out how much an astronaut can carry and why a

305
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,840
 space shuttle why do we even have space shuttles anymore I think they got rid of

306
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,160
 them anyways why five to 15 minutes what if I'm not by my house it says it'll be

307
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,640
 near the location I live but what if I'm in the middle of eating subway and this

308
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,440
 guy comes in and says are you ready to join the resistance and I'm like yeah

309
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,920
 sure but I'm only like two inches into this foot long sub I can't finish this

310
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,480
 in 15 minutes and I got a pocket full of wedding rings I got like eight of them

311
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,480
 because I own a pawn shop anyways step three the resistant agent will escort

312
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,280
 you to the entry point into the resistance this will usually be a service

313
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,200
 store in the cellar or a basement inside a commercial building close to home

314
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,920
 they're gonna murder you they're telling you follow me no one will ever see you

315
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,600
 again just walk into the basement please then it says there there he and it's

316
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,360
 weird cuz then they dropped the whole he she thing about halfway through this

317
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,320
 cuz even they really got tired of it there he will there he will guide you to

318
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,880
 descend a set of stairs that will lead you 30 meters or yards it says both

319
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,600
 underground to the top most level of resistance the stairs will look somewhat

320
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,640
 like this and it's just a picture of a manhole disappearing into the darkness

321
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,680
 it's like a creepy ladder and I'm like I hey man I'm totally on board to find the

322
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:32,200
 dark ones I also hate non-physical entities coming into our plane but I'm

323
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:39,320
 not crawling down that I'm not crawling down that so but they want you to so you

324
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,720
 go down there and it says step four when you reach the resistance level you will

325
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,240
 approach a high-tech door that will lead into a structure that looks somewhat

326
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,680
 like a shower cabin and then they have a picture from a video game to show you

327
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,000
 what the resistance is going to look like it's it's from a video game so I

328
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,880
 crawl I made a stranger that I've never met before just like a normal person

329
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,120
 asked me if I wanted to join the resistance gives me five minutes I can't

330
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,040
 talk to anybody he takes me to the basement has me crawl into the sewers

331
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:16,960
 and get into a shower cabin now it's very typical to say you can't make this up

332
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,720
 this is the this is what these people legit believe because we're gonna get

333
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,800
 to the comments soon you think I'm just you know taking the piss out of this

334
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,080
 website the comments are heartbreaking at this point the agent will ask you the

335
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,560
 last time if you're willing to enter the resistance if you refuse you will be

336
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,640
 brought back up to the surface and never be contacted again I mean you do ask me

337
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,400
 that before I climb 30 meters down a ladder like it just or before I go into

338
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,080
 your crazy murder basement if you accept the agent will leave will leave you

339
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,920
 alone and you'll enter through the high-tech door by yourself you'll be

340
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:59,600
 asked to take off all your clothes wait a second if he's if I'm by myself who's

341
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,960
 asking me to take off my clothes it's just like a voice in the dark take off

342
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,080
 your clothes it's a voice in the dark sewer while I'm standing in the shower

343
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,800
 cabin you'll be asked to take off all your clothes and leave the bag with your

344
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,440
 personal belongings in a special tray then you will be asked to enter the

345
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,880
 shower cabin where you will be disinfected from all nano technologies all

346
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,840
 nano technology and from most viruses and bacteria why not all those - why not

347
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,400
 all viruses question 5 you'll exit the shower cabin on the other you'll exit

348
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,760
 from the other side of the shower cabin into the resistance proper refresh and

349
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,200
 disinfected at this point you will feel much better with bursts of inner joy and

350
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,480
 will feel very alive and full of energy you'll get a new set of clothing let's

351
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:50,080
 see if there's anything else here a doctor shows up they'll give a they'll

352
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,800
 cure you of any possible diseases you'll be given your own room and there's like

353
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,840
 a detox process and blah blah blah so anyway so there you now you know how to

354
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,240
 get into the resistance step 9 last step is after you accept it after you are

355
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,480
 accepted in the resistance you will not be able to go to the surface contact the

356
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,320
 surface population or even use the surface internet / cell phone network

357
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,760
 except in extremely rare cases that will be directly related to your mission you

358
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,320
 will only be able to make direct contact with surface human population after the

359
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:27,200
 event victory to the light so here's the thing again I'm reading this this is

360
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,040
 nonsense I think it's a money-making scam you're listening to this I'm hoping

361
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,720
 that you're on the same page or at least you just think it's gollible or made up

362
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,560
 and I obviously it's made up but there are so many people whose lives are so

363
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,440
 empty to them and they feel so directionless and meaningless to them

364
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,600
 that they buy into this they buy into it hook line and sinker and that's one

365
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,160
 thing I've seen in the conspiracy theory world I it comes across all the time

366
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,840
 people have dedicated their lives to fight in the Illuminati and they they

367
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,600
 feel like that is their goal that's why they were put on this earth because

368
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,640
 otherwise they have to realize they're just an accountant or they're just the

369
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,240
 teacher or they're just some unemployed kid you know they're stuck in a bad

370
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,000
 marriage whatever it is whatever it is these things give people meaning and

371
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,680
 purpose and it's the one thing that everyone is lacking or thinks they're

372
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:28,040
 lacking in life that direction so instead of just being a nobody who everyone

373
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,960
 just walks past because everyone wants to be someone everybody wants to be famous

374
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,760
 that's that I like that song by who's that band how can I not remember them

375
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,200
 they're like one of my favorite bands big-time rush big-time rush you want to

376
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,280
 be famous but anyway so that's besides the point so you know people don't want

377
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,440
 to be nobody they want to be somebody and not everyone has the skills the

378
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,520
 talent the drive to become somebody or the luck to become quote-unquote

379
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,440
 somebody big so they buy into this nonsense now again you're thinking okay

380
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,960
 that's all nonsense hit let's look at some of the some of the comments here on

381
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,120
 this okay here's a couple of the first ones I'm ready to be part of the

382
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,240
 resistance I would gladly give my life to make the event happen quicker the

383
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,840
 event is the coming war between the dark ones and the Pleiadians and the

384
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:27,560
 Arthians and these lunatics here's another one assuming if I was selected I

385
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,480
 would join the resistance movement if my mom was financially taking care of

386
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,840
 during my mission she can't make it on her own without me financially because

387
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:43,080
 she is elderly that's sad here's this guy who believes this like but what's

388
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,160
 holding him back he's like but you know if I join the resistance and I fight for

389
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,680
 the world and I fight for the resistance of light who's going to take care of my

390
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:56,880
 elderly mom I'm the only one supporting her that's his dilemma absolutely

391
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:05,560
 terrible let's see let's find another one okay here's one it's definitely a

392
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,240
 great opportunity I guess it's like someone has to choose to just disappear

393
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,920
 within 15 minutes I wonder how the family members friends co-workers would

394
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,200
 react call the police I'd be okay with it if everyone on the surface would

395
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,400
 simply forget about me but they won't someone disappearing could be

396
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,360
 traumatizing for close ones just saying that's not positive energy I hope no one

397
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,120
 gets kidnapped by fake agents either that's that's or real agents anyways I'll

398
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,680
 keep training as usual he goes on to say or she so these people actually believe

399
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,400
 it and they're like trying to figure out like oh how would I balance you know the

400
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,160
 realism of me wanting to fight this fight this war with having to say you know

401
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,320
 say goodbye to people are just disappearing and I think this is

402
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,400
 probably the most harsh heartbreaking comment it's in all caps but I'm not

403
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,480
 gonna yell it at you Cobra is the author of the article so they're gonna start off

404
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,080
 by saying hello Cobra I am following you since 2013 five years waiting for the

405
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,840
 event I live in Venezuela it's not good I would like to go with the resistance

406
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,320
 but I have two children two children five cats that are my children and only

407
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:27,000
 the death will separate me from my cats not her kids okay cannot disappear in

408
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,600
 15 minutes this does not make sense one how to know that the agents are of the

409
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,400
 resistance that's a good question question number two they would have to

410
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,440
 notify us about 15 days before to promote our family I have to carry at least

411
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:48,000
 three of my cat the most in in defense three how our family is going to know if

412
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,560
 we are okay if we do not communication with them we need a lot of information

413
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:57,320
 and new protocols victory to the light so here's this poor woman who's been

414
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,440
 following this nonsense for five years religiously and she reads this and her

415
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:11,320
 heart breaks and she's like what about my kids what about my cats how am I going

416
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,560
 to help I this is the one thing I believe in this is the reason why I was put on

417
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:21,440
 this planet was to help the resistance and I have to say goodbye to everybody

418
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,800
 and you can just imagine her like being concerned about this pouring over this

419
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,800
 the fact that she has to send this email out and then she decides to choose from

420
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,800
 her cats like imagine oh imagine somebody who's so torn mentally from all

421
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,440
 this nonsense at one night staying up thinking how many cats can I take and

422
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,320
 how many will I leave for the dark overlord now to us that's funny that's a

423
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,640
 funny suggestion but to her that that was a real problem she had to face and all

424
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,880
 of these people here are really like how will I do this like oh no if I leave

425
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,840
 tomorrow how's my mom gonna take care of herself I really want to join the

426
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,320
 resistance this is why I was put on this world these people are disgusting and I

427
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,000
 cover a lot of disgusting people and no these people aren't on the level of

428
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,640
 some of the people we've covered this is gross you're taking advantage of people

429
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,680
 and you're selling them rocks for a hundred bucks and you know that they're

430
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,160
 selling you know that they're selling if this group is really getting 42 million

431
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,320
 hits in the past you know six years on their website someone's buying these

432
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,560
 stupid rocks and their stupid water and all of that stuff they're taking

433
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,200
 advantage of people and they're selling fanfiction as if it's real and while

434
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,440
 there simply they may go well I'm just getting money from them some of them may

435
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,760
 actually believe this at the top but you know they're like well what's the harm

436
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,600
 in just getting money from people are staying up late at night worried about

437
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,840
 which cats they get to take into their resistance and which cats get left behind

438
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:57,080
 to be destroyed it's that's horrible you're tricking people you're emotionally

439
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:06,360
 manipulating people for what for monetary gain it's awful these this website goes

440
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,720
 on and on and on and on and this may just be the beginning of me looking

441
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,880
 into this group they may decide to to use their light lasers and positive

442
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,080
 energy to come after me and all of a sudden I begin getting harassed oh wait

443
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,840
 no no actually I would to them I would be on the side of the space ghost army

444
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:33,520
 they the space ghosts would protect me from these people I would be basically

445
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,720
 in league with the dark ones according to them maybe I am highly unlikely I don't

446
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,000
 think dark ones suffer from sinus pain but I mean this is ridiculous and

447
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,440
 honestly I'll tell you this to you guys this is the tip of the iceberg not just

448
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,920
 in relations to this group but there are other cons groups like this that are

449
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,760
 selling the spill of goods to young men and women and old men and women - yeah

450
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,560
