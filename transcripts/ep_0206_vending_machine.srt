1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
 A young woman's death leaves a whole lot of questions.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,080
 And then we take a look at Seattle's Haunted Vending Machine.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,760
 Is there really a vending machine that is somehow a pocket to another dimension that

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,040
 can serve you drinks that were discontinued years ago?

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:29,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,440
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,840
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
 It's been a pretty exciting day actually.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
 A lot of weird events.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,720
 But again, nothing like podcast worthy.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,280
 Just an interesting day all around.

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,160
 But speaking of the podcast, let's go ahead and get started with this.

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,680
 Now, this story happened when I was on my break.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,360
 And it definitely was something that I was going to cover, but it's one of those stories

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,880
 that I kind of had to wait until all the dust settled.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,360
 Now most of you guys probably know this.

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,720
 There was a young woman named Sol Payas, Pius, Sol Pius.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,840
 And what happened was the media was on alert.

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,000
 The police were on alert.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,920
 More important than the media that a young woman, sorry my nose is running so bad.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,520
 I'm in that in-between thing.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,000
 I get allergies really bad at the start of spring and I have to find the right medical

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,240
 dose.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,680
 And just a side note, I'll go into more detail on a future episode, but just a side note.

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,480
 "Binadryl is considered the world's most potent hallucinogenic.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,880
 You take too much binadryl" and that's not an endorsement.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,240
 If you take too much binadryl, you will have full blown hallucinations.

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,760
 Things that people think acid and shrooms do.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
 Binadryl actually does.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,000
 It's very, very dangerous.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,240
 And they said, "Not only does binadryl make you see things that aren't there, it will

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,400
 make things that are there invisible, i.e. cars.

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,640
 You'll look both ways and you walk across the street and then you're dead.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
 You never, you don't see the car coming.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,960
 Full blown hallucinations and objects disappearing from you.

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,920
 Again, I'm not recommending you guys taking it.

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,200
 I actually have an experience where I took too much binadryl, but I'll talk about that

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 on another episode.

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,240
 But anyways, you'll have to deal with my stuffy nose.

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,320
 I know my voice is a little weirder when I'd stuffed up, but what are you gonna do?

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
 So, daily podcast.

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
 Gotta do something.

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,560
 SoulPias, the reason why she was in the media was that what the official story was, you

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,520
 had this 18 year old girl, this teenager from Florida, who was obsessed with Columbine,

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,480
 who flew to Colorado right before the 20th anniversary of Columbine.

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,880
 And the schools were doing this thing, they weren't doing these things called lockdowns,

49
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,920
 they were doing these things called lock-ins, basically, where you would still go to class,

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,120
 you would still show up and go about your normal school day, but the school was all locked

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,600
 down.

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,160
 Normally lockdowns, you're like stuck in your classroom.

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
 It's an American thing.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,720
 I know I have a lot of international listeners and they're like, "What are you talking about?"

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,880
 But in America, we have lockdown drills where everyone has to go to their class, you lock

56
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,800
 the doors, no one makes a noise, cover the windows, all that stuff.

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,680
 A lock-in drill, the terminology may be something different, but a lock-in drill is, you still

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,800
 are able to go about class, but you're just on high alert.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,640
 Welcome to America, ladies and gentlemen.

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,400
 So, they had the schools in Colorado on this lock, not all of them, but in the Columbine

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,960
 area in this lock-in procedure.

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,320
 Now she traveled up to Colorado on like a Monday and they began searching for her, there

63
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,560
 were sightings of her.

64
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
 They said she's armed and dangerous and they knew exactly what she was wearing.

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,800
 She's wearing like a dark top with camouflage pants.

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,600
 She went to a gun store and bought a shotgun and two boxes of shotgun shells, so now the

67
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,200
 authorities are super worried about what's going on.

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,160
 But on Wednesday, they find her body about like, I think it was like 11,000 feet up near

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,680
 this resort in the mountains, self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head, end of story.

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
 Or is it?

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,840
 And this is such an interesting case, because what has come out is this.

72
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,040
 There's actual facts that have come out and then there are just weird connections to it.

73
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,560
 One, when she traveled to Colorado, she bought three plane tickets.

74
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
 She only needed one.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
 She bought three plane tickets.

76
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,680
 And again, some of this information may change from the time that I read it to the time I'm

77
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,360
 reporting it to even the time that you're listening to it, because new things are developing.

78
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,880
 This all happened around, it was like, I think the 15th, the 16th, and the 17th of April.

79
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,560
 Because April 20th was the 20th anniversary of the Columbine shooting.

80
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,960
 So there's just a lot of odd details in this.

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,520
 They say she was obsessed with the Columbine shootings.

82
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,400
 That's what the media kept saying.

83
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,840
 But if you go to her website, which is dissolvedgirl.neocities.org, which is still up, the first thing

84
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,240
 you'll realize is the website, the whole website is set up to look like it came out of the

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
 1990s.

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
 It's nostalgic.

87
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,800
 Looking at it, I'm like, aww.

88
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,680
 It just brings back the feeling there's these animated gifs and stuff like that.

89
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,120
 And there's nothing really on the website to make it seem that she's obsessed with

90
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
 Columbine.

91
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,640
 So this was her personal website where she posted song lyrics and stuff like that.

92
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,760
 Dissolvedgirl is a massive attack song.

93
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,360
 She was really into Marilyn Manson and the Def Tones and all this stuff.

94
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,080
 All this 90s type music.

95
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,920
 I think the Def Tones and Marilyn Manson are still around, but you know what I mean.

96
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,120
 So she was really into that 90s feel.

97
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,640
 But not a lot of stuff of Columbine.

98
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,360
 There's a couple sketches of guns and there's a sketch that may or may not be one of the

99
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
 Columbine shooters.

100
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,840
 It's hard to tell.

101
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,360
 So then they said, then the story was, whoa, whoa, whoa, she said she told people she

102
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,760
 was obsessed with Columbine.

103
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,240
 She didn't put it on her website, but she was obsessed with Columbine in general.

104
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,960
 That's what she mentioned to her friends and family.

105
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
 Now that may be true.

106
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
 We have no way to verify that.

107
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,200
 So the story is, is that when she went missing from Florida, her parents were alarmed because

108
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,400
 they felt that she had this obsession with Columbine.

109
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,880
 So they called the police, the police called the FBI.

110
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,280
 That's when they would begin tracking her because she used her real driver's license

111
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,480
 and everything to get the plane tickets to fly over.

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,640
 Then they know she went to a gun store where she showed her driver license again and got

113
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,080
 the shotgun of the two boxes of shells.

114
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,720
 So now they're really concerned.

115
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,080
 They began kind of tracking her around.

116
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,640
 They find that she had gone to a gun forum site asking, how easy is it for an 18 year

117
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,840
 old from Florida to buy a shotgun in Colorado?

118
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,480
 And people are like, oh, it's pretty easy.

119
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,960
 This is how you do it.

120
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,720
 But what they have realized is that when she went up to that resort, she went up to an

121
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,680
 area where no cell phones would work.

122
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,640
 She went up there early enough during the manhunt for her.

123
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,000
 The police believe she never even realized they were looking for her.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,520
 So she wasn't on the run, that's why she went up to the mountain.

125
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
 She just went up to the mountain.

126
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,320
 She took an Uber up there and they said, here's the problem with it.

127
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,480
 She took an Uber up to a place where her cell phone wouldn't work in the middle of the snow.

128
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,000
 So there was no way for her to get an Uber back.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,480
 She didn't bring a tent.

130
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,960
 She didn't bring a jacket.

131
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,520
 She had no supplies to stay in the snow.

132
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,680
 Except for a duffel bag containing a shotgun and two boxes of shells.

133
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,720
 But so the police at this point, you'll see a difference of opinion in certain articles.

134
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,560
 But the police at this point believe she traveled to Colorado to purchase a firearm and to kill

135
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 herself.

136
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,240
 She told the Uber driver she always wanted to see the snow.

137
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,840
 So she took an Uber up to a super snowy place.

138
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,100
 There is a lodge up there, but it wasn't open at the time.

139
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,760
 She took the Uber up there, wanted to be in the snow and she killed herself.

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,920
 Tragic, tragic story.

141
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,200
 Now is it possible that she took the Uber up there thinking the lodge would be open

142
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,480
 and she was kind of biding her time until the April 20th where she would go back to Columbine

143
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,800
 and revisit it 20 years later with a shotgun?

144
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,320
 Some police have said, "Oh, 'cause see, the thing is the police put so much effort into

145
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,560
 trying to find her that if it turns out she just killed herself, people are saying, "Oh,

146
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,880
 well, then it was a waste of money.

147
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,840
 It was a waste of time."

148
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,360
 One of the official statements I saw from the local police was saying, "Well, she was

149
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,720
 kind of close to Columbine, but she was in a snowy mountain."

150
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,440
 So I mean, kind of close relative, she was closer than if she was in India, maybe.

151
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,880
 But there is a key factor that when I was reading the stories I didn't really understand.

152
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,800
 The 20th anniversary of Columbine is April 20th, 2019.

153
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,480
 That's a Saturday.

154
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,680
 So if you want to do a school shooting, Saturday is the worst way to do it.

155
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,120
 So I don't, that's what doesn't really fit with this story.

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,960
 Another bizarre element, and this might sound insensitive, but when I saw, when I was reading

157
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,200
 the article in there, like an 18-year-old girl from Florida is missing, she's presumed

158
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,360
 to be in Colorado, she's armed in dangerous, stuff like that, they show a photo of her,

159
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,660
 she clearly does not look to be 18 years old.

160
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,440
 She looks like she's in her late 20s, minimum.

161
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,440
 Now, of course, I met women in my life, I actually had a friend who was 23, she told

162
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,480
 everyone she was 29, and I finally asked her, I go, "Why do you tell people that?"

163
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,280
 She goes, "Because no one takes 23-year-olds seriously."

164
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,640
 So you can age yourself up with the right makeup, it's possible.

165
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,000
 But there's all these little things, that was the first thing I was like, "What?

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 She's 18?

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 That's weird."

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,240
 She's attractive, it's not like she was like, "Ugh, monster woman."

169
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,640
 But you know what I mean, like, she didn't look like she was in high school, or just graduated

170
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,140
 high school.

171
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,520
 There was a big debate on 4chan about what had really happened.

172
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,800
 And some people were to the belief that it was some sort of sacrifice, and it was this

173
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,920
 false flag, and they were trying to take away her guns and all this stuff.

174
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,320
 And then the other group was like, "No, she was probably a misguided person who probably

175
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,360
 did have a little bit of a fascination with Call of Mind, but never planned on shooting

176
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,480
 anything, she just went up there and blew her head off the shotgun."

177
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
 It's an interesting story, and it's one we're never going to really get answers for, because

178
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,520
 even her, generally when people are doing planning weird things, they will try to immortalize

179
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,600
 themselves on their website.

180
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,840
 But it's just song lyrics.

181
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,480
 It's just kind of a tragic story.

182
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,280
 But then, when I was researching it for this, I came across some new information.

183
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,160
 When she did the forum, when she said, "Hey, I'm going to Colorado, I need a shotgun,"

184
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,240
 it wasn't just one post, she was interacting with these other users on this forum.

185
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,840
 And they know it was her, they believe it was her, because the username on the forum

186
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
 was "DissolvedGirl."

187
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,280
 The same name is her website, same name is that song.

188
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,320
 She's interacting with them, and she says, "Yeah, I'm going to go shooting with her.

189
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,080
 I got friends up there, we're going to go shooting together, and I just kind of want

190
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,440
 to have a shotgun ready to go," and stuff like that.

191
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,760
 Is it possible that her Uber ride to the snow wasn't to commit suicide in the middle

192
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,160
 of nowhere among the one thing she always wanted to see?

193
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:40,080
 Is it possible that she went there to go meet with other people to enact some sort of plan,

194
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,680
 and she may have not known there was a manhunt for her, because her cell phone wouldn't work

195
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,160
 way up there?

196
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,920
 So the people on their way to meet her certainly would have known there was a manhunt going

197
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,040
 on up there.

198
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,120
 So when they get up there, they realize that their plan is not going to work, not only

199
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
 that, but every one of the state is looking for this woman standing right in front of

200
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
 them.

201
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,240
 So what are you going to do?

202
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,760
 Is it possible?

203
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,200
 Yes.

204
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,720
 Is it likely?

205
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
 No.

206
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 No.

207
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,680
 And I think that the reason why I really wanted to cover this story is because it really,

208
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,520
 it's so easy to create a conspiracy theory out of a tragedy.

209
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,720
 It's almost too easy.

210
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,680
 What I just came up with, the thing about her meeting friends with guns up in Colorado,

211
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,080
 and just using that bit of information, I was able to weave this narrative.

212
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,560
 And yes, it is possible that that was, but it's highly, highly unlikely.

213
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,560
 I didn't read all of the foreign posts on that gun site.

214
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,440
 They could have asked, "Oh, are you going hunting?"

215
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,520
 And if she could have responded just because she didn't want to say, "Oh, no, I'm hunting.

216
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,800
 Yeah, I'm hunting my own head.

217
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 I'm going to kill myself."

218
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,360
 And she goes, "Yeah, I'm hunting with some friends up there."

219
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,960
 So it's easy, though, to just take little pieces of news information that we find and

220
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,560
 construct a conspiracy theory.

221
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,960
 It's frighteningly easy.

222
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,000
 And I know I barely pronounced that word, but you know what I mean.

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,520
 It's just interesting because it shows how conspiracies grow and how easily they can

224
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,600
 be created and why we have to be skeptical of stuff when we come across it.

225
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,400
 I think that this young woman, based on what I read on her website, was depressed and she

226
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,360
 didn't think she had anything to look forward to.

227
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,880
 Pretty much in her own words, she was saying a lot of that stuff on her website.

228
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:32,200
 I think she really did just want to see the snow and it's easy to get a gun in Colorado.

229
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,000
 So I think all of those things combined, it just happened.

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,280
 Maybe she didn't want to go up there during the anniversary of the Columbine shooting,

231
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,520
 but that could have been a fluke.

232
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,600
 But either way, whatever the reason why she's dead.

233
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,080
 So yes, depressing the topic to talk about on our Friday episode, but something I wanted

234
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,920
 to cover as soon as I could.

235
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,080
 And I was on the break when that happened.

236
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,080
 So the next story, though, is a lot more upbeat.

237
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,520
 Nobody dies.

238
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,960
 There's no anniversaries of mass casualty events.

239
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,880
 And it's funny because it's one of those conspiracy theories that I actually really got into.

240
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
 And I was actually kind of mad.

241
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,240
 Like I was upset when I discovered something about it.

242
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
 So let's go ahead.

243
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
 Oh, damn it.

244
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,880
 I was about to say Jason Jalopy, but that blew up.

245
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,440
 Don't worry, the carbonar copter and the Jason Jalopy are coming back.

246
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,400
 I just need to get the parts for them.

247
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
 Just need to get some parts.

248
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,280
 But for right now, let's go ahead and take the dead rabbit, Durgible.

249
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,800
 It's slow enough and we're only going to Seattle.

250
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,120
 We're going to Seattle, Washington.

251
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,960
 So we don't need to get there super fast.

252
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,440
 We can take the slow route, which is every route in Durgible.

253
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,800
 We're just looking out the windows, looking out the windows, seeing if we can see any

254
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
 big foot walking around.

255
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,080
 So we're in the dead rabbit, Durgible.

256
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,560
 And eventually we see the city of Seattle.

257
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,240
 We slowly lower down to the city.

258
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,160
 Hope no one steals anything off the Durgible.

259
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,800
 Actually what could you steal off of Durgible?

260
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,240
 Like there's no tires or nothing.

261
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,880
 I guess you could just van all his in pop the balloon and then we'd be stuck in Seattle.

262
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,200
 But we're actually landing in an area known as 10th and John Street.

263
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
 Actually it's not an area.

264
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 That's just a cross section.

265
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,000
 But anyways, 10th and John Street, it's the Capitol Hill area is what it's called.

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Capitol Hill.

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,200
 And in this little neighborhood, in this quiet, unassuming neighborhood, is an old Coca-Cola

268
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,840
 machine from the 1970s.

269
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,440
 And it is beat up.

270
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,400
 It's completely trashed.

271
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,760
 But it works.

272
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,440
 So hey, do you have any money I can borrow?

273
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
 You got 75 cents.

274
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,600
 That's how much it takes for soda here.

275
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 You got 75 cents.

276
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
 Okay.

277
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,000
 So you give me 75 cents and I put it in my pocket and then I go, do you have another

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 75 cents?

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 That's for later.

280
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I have to do laundry.

281
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,240
 So you give me another 75 cents.

282
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
 We put it in.

283
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,560
 Now there's something interesting about this vending machine.

284
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,520
 It's a real vending machine, by the way.

285
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,480
 Something interesting about the vending machine.

286
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
 You see there's a label to press for Coca-Cola.

287
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,240
 Obviously, it's Coke machine.

288
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,560
 There's another label that says Mountain Dew.

289
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,000
 Now if you frequent Taco Bell often, there's two things you know.

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,640
 One, diarrhea is a very, very harsh thing to go through.

291
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,360
 And two, Mountain Dew is a Pepsi product.

292
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,320
 And there's actually a lot of restrictions where you can't have a Coke product and a

293
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,000
 Pepsi product served at the same location.

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,720
 Now gas stations can do it and things like that.

295
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,280
 But generally, like a vending machine or a Taco Bell, they're about the same level of

296
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,840
 cleanliness.

297
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,280
 They can only have one or the other.

298
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,840
 But this machine has Coca-Cola and it has Mountain Dew.

299
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,360
 It has some other flavors.

300
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,800
 And then it has a button, or actually a few buttons, labeled Mystery.

301
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,920
 Rumor says, now the machine does exist and it does work.

302
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,360
 But according to rumor, you press the Coca-Cola button, a Coca-Cola classic comes out.

303
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,200
 And not just a Coca-Cola classic, but a Coca-Cola classic before it was called classic.

304
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,400
 You see, when I was a kid, we just had Coca-Cola.

305
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,560
 And then someone decided to come out with a drink called New Coke.

306
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,560
 It was actually just they changed the formula to Coke and nobody liked it.

307
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,320
 It was this huge flop.

308
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,080
 So then they brought back the original recipe called Coca-Cola classic.

309
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,400
 And it's funny because that's actually a conspiracy theory too.

310
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,560
 The conspiracy theory back then is they had a Coca-Cola classic.

311
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,600
 They wanted to change from like sugar to corn syrup or something like that.

312
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,360
 But they knew people would reject it.

313
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,120
 So for about a year or two, they sold a different drink called Coke.

314
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,160
 Someone hated and wanted the old drink back.

315
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,920
 And by then, enough taste buds had changed.

316
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,040
 So when they brought back Coca-Cola classic, it wasn't the same recipe.

317
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,200
 That was their goal all along, was to change that recipe that they had to give it some time.

318
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,840
 So that's a conspiracy theory as well.

319
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,160
 But anyways, old Coke.

320
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,840
 Old Coke, but it's cold and fresh.

321
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,120
 The Mystery buttons, you could get anything.

322
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,120
 If you're lucky, you'll get like a Pepsi, maybe a squirt, some Sprite.

323
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,200
 If you're unlucky, you'll get a Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb or a Barks root beer,

324
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,000
 which I'm not a huge fan of that.

325
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,640
 But anyways, is it Barks?

326
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,360
 But it doesn't matter.

327
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,200
 Anyways, you don't know what you're going to get.

328
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,320
 Every time you hit the button, a different drink will come out.

329
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,560
 And rumor says some of those drinks have been discontinued for years.

330
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,120
 No one has ever seen anyone open up this vending machine.

331
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,600
 No one has ever seen anyone refill it.

332
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,480
 Ice-cold Cokes pop out of it regularly.

333
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:32,560
 In the area, from a span of about 16 years, the earliest article I could find on this was in 2002.

334
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,640
 But most likely it was around before that and then just over time became newsworthy.

335
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,720
 It's not like it showed up one day and some journalists was like, "I got it!

336
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,680
 Stop the presses!

337
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,760
 Haunted Machine would be an urban legend that was working in this neighborhood."

338
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,760
 And then some lifestyle reporter would be like, "Oh, that's kind of interesting.

339
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,920
 I'm going to cover that."

340
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,520
 So people in the neighborhood know about it.

341
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,120
 People travel from other parts of Seattle to test it.

342
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,920
 Because you're like, "Really?

343
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,720
 It's a haunted machine?"

344
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,040
 Yeah, they're like, "Yeah, we don't know who operates it.

345
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,120
 We don't know who collects the money.

346
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,640
 We don't know how the drinks get in there."

347
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,360
 But you put 75 cents in, a drink comes out.

348
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,240
 I was like, "This is awesome.

349
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,200
 This is like the most boring episode of X-Files, but it's still a real-life episode of the X-Files.

350
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,040
 It's still this machine that exists that defies what we know about the laws of vending machines

351
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,160
 and how they operate in the universe.

352
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,680
 There are certain things we know.

353
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,280
 You have to stock them.

354
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,000
 You have to take money out.

355
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,320
 Right?

356
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,080
 I mean, I guess that's all we know about vending machines, but anyways.

357
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:39,200
 So from the earliest article I found was in 2002, the latest article was about 2018, July of 2018.

358
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,000
 And they all say the same thing, the story that I just told you.

359
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,560
 But there is one article--

360
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,840
 Oh, man, this made me mad.

361
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,400
 There is one article as I kept digging into this because I was like,

362
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,320
 "Hot dog! This is the best story I've ever covered.

363
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,000
 This is real proof of something bizarre that you can visit anytime."

364
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,400
 One article in 2014 said, "Hey, we solved the mystery.

365
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,400
 Don't scroll down if you don't want it spoiled for you."

366
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,400
 And I thought, "Oh, it's probably a goofy picture.

367
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,000
 It's probably just nothing."

368
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,360
 And it is a photograph of two people in broad daylight stocking the soda machine.

369
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,080
 And I was like, "No.

370
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,960
 No way."

371
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:25,080
 I reacted like a 9/11 truther who finally realized that the jet fuel only had to weaken the steel beams.

372
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,360
 Not melt them.

373
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,040
 Not melt them.

374
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,600
 I was like, "Uh-uh. No.

375
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 No.

376
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,360
 It's not true, man.

377
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,320
 The picture's not true."

378
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,840
 That was actually my reaction because I spent so much time researching this.

379
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,520
 And I came across that after 30 minutes of looking into this.

380
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,720
 I pulled up a picture of the machine that I knew was real.

381
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
 And I pulled up the picture of the person loading the machine.

382
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,800
 And I'm checking out the background.

383
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,640
 And I'm like, "No.

384
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,240
 No. It's a different background.

385
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,760
 That's a different vending machine."

386
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,200
 It's not.

387
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
 And I looked at it and I was like, "God damn it.

388
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,160
 It's the same vending machine in front of the...

389
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,640
 Because it's in a kind of a rundown neighborhood.

390
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,240
 So it's very, very clear where it's at in both photos."

391
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,120
 And I was like, "Damn it."

392
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,000
 And then I was mad because some of the articles that I had read first were more recent, past 2014.

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,160
 Now, the article that did expose it as mundane was, again, a local newspaper.

394
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,960
 So it kind of makes sense that the other people didn't find it.

395
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,800
 But again, if you just keep looking for Seattle Haunted vending machine, it came up.

396
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,240
 It didn't take me a ton of time to find it.

397
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,920
 At this point, the machine...

398
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,400
 Oh, it's funny because at one point I found the machine is missing.

399
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,440
 And I was like, "The government took the machine, man.

400
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,400
 The government took it.

401
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
 It took it."

402
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,360
 And it's funny because in the first story, when I was talking about being

403
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,080
 cautious of how we look at conspiracy theories, that's why I kind of wanted to bundle these two

404
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,400
 together, is because I am totally susceptible to it as well.

405
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,760
 You tell me a good narrative and I will be like, "Really?"

406
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,240
 But then that skeptical side of me or that inquisitive side of me makes me keep researching it.

407
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,200
 And I'm like, "Damn it."

408
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,640
 I was more like, "Gosh, I wasn't just dammit.

409
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,760
 I was like...

410
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,520
 I was crushed."

411
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,640
 Not the orange crush, like actually crushed, like grape crush.

412
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,120
 So where does that leave us?

413
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,200
 Oh, let me finish up that story real quick.

414
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,680
 So the machine at this time is missing.

415
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,600
 Now, I should have been a little skeptical and I don't know why I didn't pop up on it earlier,

416
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,960
 but the machine has a Facebook page and then at that point I thought,

417
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
 "Well, maybe someone's running it."

418
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
 But you could figure maybe just a fan page.

419
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,240
 Maybe it's no big deal.

420
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,840
 Anyways, the machine's missing as of July 2018 and on the Facebook page it's like,

421
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,160
 "I needed to go for a walk."

422
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,520
 And now they're hashtagging stuff like "Mystery Machine on the Move."

423
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,800
 Oh, and before that happened, the price is raised to a dollar and all the drinks became mystery drinks.

424
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,440
 See, the thing is, is like in the first instinct, when you saw it, you thought maybe

425
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,880
 it was just this abandoned vending machine in the middle of nowhere that was mystical

426
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
 or paranormal for some reason.

427
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,960
 But once the people started changing the price and putting like changing the labels in there,

428
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,760
 then you go, "Well, obviously someone's modifying it."

429
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,280
 But again, you think if nobody in the area has ever seen anyone out here and it's been here for at least 16 years,

430
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
 then what's going on?

431
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
 Is the machine modifying itself?

432
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,720
 When it just disappeared, people are like, "What?"

433
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,040
 And then I realized, I think that obviously people in the area saw,

434
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,960
 if they could get a photo of these people refilling it in broad daylight,

435
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,640
 then obviously people in the area probably did see people refill it from time to time,

436
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,040
 but it was a fun urban legend for a wacky city of Seattle.

437
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,080
 But this is really what my takeaway was on this.

438
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,680
 The reason why I fell so quickly for it is because I believe that is where we will find the paranormal.

439
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,840
 I believe that the paranormal hides in the mundane.

440
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,200
 The speculative hides in the everyday.

441
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,360
 Because that is in plain sight.

442
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,280
 I used to have a job where I'd deal with lots of cash, lots of cash.

443
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,840
 And you're dealing with pennies, you're dealing with notes,

444
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,320
 you're dealing with coins, you're dealing with all this stuff.

445
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,760
 Massive amounts of these things.

446
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,920
 And I thought, in the billions of coins that are out there in the world,

447
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,360
 a few of them are proof of alternate realities.

448
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,000
 Because if we look at the story of the man of Toret, who I covered long, long time ago,

449
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
 man, that was like episode like 20.

450
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,480
 And he supposedly traveled from an alternate dimension to our dimension.

451
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,400
 If someone is walking around and they shift realities and they have coins in their pocket

452
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
 and obviously if you handed someone a dollar bill and it had a picture of Mike Tyson on it,

453
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,560
 you'd be like, "What? But when's the last time you looked at coins?"

454
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,040
 Like really looked at coins, really looked at a penny or a nickel.

455
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:03,280
 Out of the billions of coins in the world, time travelers and people slipping through

456
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,080
 alternate dimensions, when they're in the middle of a city that they don't know how they got,

457
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,840
 they're aware they're at, and they need to go and use a vending machine,

458
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
 they're going to put those quarters in.

459
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,760
 And those quarters are going to be of a president who never existed in this reality,

460
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,480
 or in the case of a time traveler, a president who doesn't exist yet.

461
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
 And he was just a sloppy time traveler.

462
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,120
 That's where we'll find this stuff.

463
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,040
 And those coins just get tossed in the mix and with millions and billions of other quarters

464
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,320
 and they're constantly getting spent.

465
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,280
 But as I always dealt with all these coins, I thought, within the monetary system,

466
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,920
 if there is such a thing, especially alternate realities,

467
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,560
 more so alternate realities than time travel, but you can see that too.

468
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,720
 Definitely with alternate realities, within the monetary system, there would be,

469
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,000
 statistically there would be proof of people coming from alternate dimensions to ours,

470
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,120
 with a pocket full of coins, and spending them.

471
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,320
 Especially if the shift is so small that the person entering our dimension doesn't realize

472
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,440
 they're not in their home dimension, they would just walk to the grocery store,

473
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,120
 buy some stuff, pull their coins out.

474
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,480
 And it wouldn't be until closer examination when you looked at that coin,

475
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,200
 when you would be like, that is not a US president.

476
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,400
 Who is Booger McFartface?

477
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,520
 Like, who is this dude?

478
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,680
 Like, we've never heard of this guy before.

479
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,360
 We probably should elect him, because that's kind of a dope name, but who is this dude?

480
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,480
 So that is what I mean by, I think, that the truly paranormal can hide.

481
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,760
 Does hide within the mundane.

482
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,000
 A guy who shows up who's like, I'm from the future,

483
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,600
 there's going to be these great civil wars, I have this time, like John Teter,

484
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,920
 but we have a lot of people like that, there's going to be these civil wars,

485
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,440
 and I have to get this time machine, and they're posting stuff on the internet,

486
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:57,840
 and they're doing like these like ARGS things, would be swept up by the government so fast,

487
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,000
 they would disappear.

488
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,840
 Absolutely disappear, every trace of them would disappear.

489
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,480
 But if someone came to the past and kept a low profile, and was going about their business,

490
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,480
 but was sloppy with what they were doing, wearing clothes that are not made yet,

491
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,760
 and leaving a jacket behind at a restaurant, someone like picks it up, and they're like,

492
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,320
 what?

493
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,520
 Blue Ivy has her own clothing line, she's like three.

494
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,800
 And I actually think she's a boy, I'm not for sure, but anyways, that would be the giveaways.

495
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,520
 It would be in stuff left behind that we leave behind every day.

496
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:44,800
 Lint from pockets that is made up of material that hasn't been synthesized yet, things like that.

497
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,240
 That's where I think you'll find that stuff, and that's why the the vending machine really kind of

498
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,920
 spoke to me, because anyone could say I'm a medium, I come from the astral realm,

499
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:03,760
 I have these magical powers, blah blah blah blah, but they are easily noticeable, easily debunked,

500
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,600
 but if they are real, you wouldn't hear about them.

501
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,400
 The government would either buy them out, or take them out.

502
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,560
 But if it's a vending machine sitting in the middle of nowhere, that nobody knows about,

503
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,920
 that isn't in the newspaper, it's just a thing on a block that every so often a kid comes up to

504
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,760
 and goes, this is weird, isn't it? That I bought this soda and this drink came out that I've never

505
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,960
 even heard of, this is bizarre, and other kids are like, yeah, that is weird.

506
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,560
 And they just go about their business, and it doesn't become a sensation.

507
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,960
 That is possible.

508
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,560
 Now again, we could go down the rabbit hole and say, at one point back in 2002,

509
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:49,360
 when that first article was written, the machine was real, and it was really something abnormal,

510
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,040
 and that machine was taken by the government, and replaced with a look-alike machine that

511
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,240
 had the same qualities. But now we're just getting into weirdo, tinfoil hat nonsense.

512
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,280
 And we don't cover that on this show.

513
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:10,960
 I think the soda machine is a bust, but I do truly believe that if we want to find

514
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,480
 the answers to what's out there, we don't have to look to the sky.

515
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,920
 We don't have to look in the palm of our hand. We don't have to look at a medium,

516
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,800
 or a psychic, or an astrological chart. We just have to look at the things around us,

517
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,720
 pay attention to them, and see what's out of place.

518
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:42,560
 But the scariest thing about that is because the idea of alternate realities and traveling

519
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:50,160
 between them may be possible. One day you may be looking for those small changes around you,

520
00:28:50,160 --> 00:29:01,920
 and you realize everything has changed, and you may become the outsider with a pocket full of odd coins.
