1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 A "MARICAL" drug is on the market, but could it be used to control the human population?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,600
 And they would travel back to the year 1923 to visit a log cabin.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,200
 It's been a long abandon, holding nothing but a skeleton and torment from beyond the

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,680
 grave today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:26,200
 [Music]

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,280
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,080
 I'm drenched in sweat.

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,080
 Yes, it's if you've been listening since episode one.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,240
 It's summertime and I'm recording with no fans on.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,800
 We're also taking a break from Alien Disclosure Week as well, but we will finish it up tomorrow

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
 with the New York Times.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,320
 They're going to take a look at those New York Times articles about you have put disclosure

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,960
 very, very weird information in there that not a lot of people are noticing or at least

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
 talking about.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,080
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Wyemop.

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,640
 Wyemop, thank you so much for supporting the show.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,920
 Really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,320
 She actually recommended a story to me today about Jack Parsons.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,040
 It's funny, I've read about Jack Parsons a lot.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,160
 I don't really think I've mentioned him on the show.

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,440
 He was the guy who was a big part of JPL, big part of early American rocket technology

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,600
 and a super weirdo occultist dude who used to run around with L. Ron Hubbard and I think

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
 he was Bing and his wife or L. Ron Hubbard was Bing and Jack Parsons' wife or something

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
 like that.

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,160
 And so yeah, if I can find a really cool, because I've read a lot about him, if I can

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,600
 find a cool new angle to really talk about and she kind of led me on to want to look

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
 into it, we may end up talking about Jack Parsons if you're familiar with that.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,880
 I'm looking for a new angle on it though.

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,200
 That all being said, Queen Mob, thank you so much for supporting the show.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,360
 You're going to be our person behind the cockpit pilots, what they normally called.

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,800
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's okay too.

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,520
 Just help get the word out about the show.

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,840
 Talk about it online, talk about it to your friends.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,200
 That also really, really helps out a lot.

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
 So Queen Mob, let's hop into Jason's lobby.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,720
 We're going to go for a little drive.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,640
 First off, we're going to drive to a local hospital.

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,160
 A local hospital and it's bustling with activity.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,960
 We walk in and there's people sitting around with broken legs.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,120
 It's like something you'd see in like an episode of ER.

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,320
 There's a guy with his arm in a sling.

45
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,800
 And then I guess people dying because it's a hospital.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
 And the baby's being born.

47
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
 So you know, the universe balances out.

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
 But we're here for a specific reason.

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,040
 This guy is being brought in by authorities.

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,200
 And they're like, "Hey, we got a call.

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,440
 This guy wants to kill himself.

52
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,400
 This guy is trying to kill himself."

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,240
 So we're like, "Oh, that's weird."

54
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,240
 That's weird that they said that out loud and we can identify this guy.

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,400
 But we follow Queen Mob, myself and you are also welcome.

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
 HIPPA laws be damned.

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
 We walk into this guy's room.

58
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,400
 This guy is completely despondent.

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,560
 He's going to kill himself.

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,800
 And the doctor goes, "Hmm, I have the thing right here.

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,480
 It'll cure your illness."

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,200
 And he pulls out a little nasal spray bottle and he sticks it up the guy's nose and he

63
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,760
 goes, "Psst, psst."

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
 And then he puts it in the other nostril.

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
 Psst, psst.

66
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,080
 Gives him two sprays and the guy goes, "Whoa, dude.

67
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
 Whoa, what?

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,360
 I totally don't want to kill myself now."

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,200
 "Doc, that's amazing."

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,160
 Doctors like, "This isn't the end.

71
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
 You need to do therapy.

72
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,400
 We need to look at some other stuff."

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,920
 But it is amazing.

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,640
 The doctor holds out this little inhaler for us to see.

75
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,400
 This stuff is real.

76
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 It's not only...

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
 So here's the thing.

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,160
 We always hear about, like Elon Musk just talked about putting a chip in people's brains

79
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,360
 so they can control their mood.

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,280
 That's like a theoretical thing they're working on.

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,240
 What I just described to you is real.

82
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,740
 Not only is it real, it's in use today.

83
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,200
 It's from Johnson & Johnson's.

84
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
 It's called Spravado.

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,840
 And it is a nasal.

86
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,720
 It's a incredibly rapid release antidepressant.

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,240
 Most antidepressants take a couple weeks to build up.

88
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,440
 But this stuff, psst, psst.

89
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
 It's a rapid...

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,160
 I mean, that's faster than fast.

91
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,520
 They're like, "Get out of the way, fast-acting antidepressant.

92
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,800
 I'm a rapid antidepressant."

93
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
 Spravado.

94
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,840
 They came up with it back in the '90s, but back in March 2019, the FDA said, "We approve

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
 this."

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,240
 You can actually use this on people.

97
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,240
 Johnson really wanted it to be in use at a VA hospital.

98
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,960
 We have a horrible suicide epidemic with our veterans here in the United States.

99
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,460
 It's absolutely tragic.

100
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,960
 It's heartbreaking.

101
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,840
 And when the history books are written about the COVID crisis, long after everything has

102
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,800
 settled down, I think one of the things we're going to see is accurate suicide statistics.

103
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,280
 I think no one's really reporting those yet.

104
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,080
 Maybe we don't have the numbers to really match them, but even before COVID, we were

105
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,520
 seeing suicide rate going up 30% in the past 10 years.

106
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,840
 In the article from Medical Express that was written about this, the article was, "Nasal

107
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,680
 spray approved for treating suicidal people."

108
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,840
 This was written by Cynthia Coons.

109
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,720
 It specifically said, "Because COVID-19 has caused a massive increase in depression."

110
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,240
 I think when we're really honest about the COVID crisis and the cost of everything that's

111
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,560
 been going on, we're going to find just massive suicide rates, which is tragic.

112
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,040
 So, Sprovato, they really want to start using this stuff now.

113
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,720
 Since March, 6,000 people, since March of 2019, 6,000 people have been treated with this.

114
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,040
 You're suicidal.

115
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
 They sprayed up your nose.

116
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,720
 You're not suicidal, right now, at least.

117
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,360
 It can be a long-term thing that you're dealing with depression and things like that.

118
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,760
 So I read that and I thought, "That's amazing."

119
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,160
 But then the little conspiracy theorist thing popped up in my head.

120
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,400
 As a drug, this is great.

121
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,200
 A possible short-term cure for a very serious illness.

122
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,520
 But then I thought, "Hmm, I'll stroke my little beard.

123
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,560
 Queen Mab, let's hop back in to Jason Jalapy.

124
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,440
 We're going to travel to the year 2025 right at the same hospital.

125
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,080
 But now it looks like something out of New Detroit.

126
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,480
 It's straight up Robocop.

127
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
 There's like graffiti on the top floor.

128
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,600
 We're like, "How did they do that?

129
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,200
 How did they get way up there?

130
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,560
 There's a bunch of punks."

131
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
 They're like, "What?

132
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,840
 Yeah, they have the green mohawks with the spikes and stuff like that.

133
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,720
 And their spikes have spikes.

134
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,200
 It's the craziest thing.

135
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,400
 Genetically modified hair in the year 2025."

136
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,120
 We see people being dragged forcibly into the hospital by the police.

137
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,560
 The police are like, "What?

138
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,320
 You don't follow whatever laws we're talking about.

139
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,520
 It's the year 2025.

140
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,040
 You don't eat yogurt on Sundays."

141
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,000
 And the guy's like, "No, it's disgusting.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I never eat yogurt."

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,280
 And they're like, "Uh-huh."

144
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,440
 And you see the doctor, but now he's wearing a black leather medical coat.

145
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
 He's all evil looking.

146
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,880
 And he pulls out a little black colored nasal spray.

147
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,760
 And he puts it up your nose and you're like, "No, no.

148
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
 I'll never eat yogurt."

149
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,560
 Oh, whatever you say, master.

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
 Whatever you say.

151
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,040
 Apparently now you just become a goon.

152
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,360
 This is what I was thinking.

153
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,080
 It's a fast releasing antidepressant.

154
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,680
 But what happened?

155
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,400
 If you were to cap fully on to cover up our spiked mohawk, what would stop the government

156
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,480
 from being like, "You're a dissident.

157
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,360
 You're not following what the government does.

158
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,520
 We're going to spray this up your nose."

159
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
 Is that alarmist?

160
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,680
 Is that alarmist?

161
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
 It would work though.

162
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,520
 Like, let's say you were out protesting against the government and they're like, "Mmm-mm."

163
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,760
 They have just a giant cannon that's in the shape of a nasal spray bottle.

164
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,440
 Two cops have to jump up and down on it and it's all pshh, pshh, pshh into the crowd.

165
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
 They're like, "Uhhh."

166
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
 And then they're just peaceful.

167
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,680
 To put a chip in someone's brain, like that's really hard to do against your will, right?

168
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
 You're like, "No, no.

169
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,920
 You'll never take me alive."

170
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,160
 And then like in the ambulance, "What?

171
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
 No way."

172
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,640
 And then they're dragging you in the operating room.

173
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
 "Uhhh."

174
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,640
 And then they're putting the oxygen mask on you, like slapping it away.

175
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,760
 But take hours to do, right?

176
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,640
 Or they could just come to your house and spray you in the nose with it.

177
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,640
 Or my idea where they're jumping up and down on it.

178
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,800
 Entire neighborhoods get fumigated.

179
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,280
 Fast acting antidepressant.

180
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,960
 It's great for people who need it.

181
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
 But what's to stop?

182
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,320
 What's to stop the brutal totalitarians of the year 2025 from using it against us as

183
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,760
 a weapon of war?

184
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,280
 So let me explain a little bit about what this is.

185
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
 This far into the segment.

186
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
 People are like, "What is this man?

187
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
 What is he talking about?

188
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,720
 There's no magical stuff."

189
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
 It's ketamine.

190
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,760
 Technically, it's a cousin or a relative to ketamine.

191
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,040
 It's maybe like a sister-in-law to ketamine.

192
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,720
 But it's a drug people now use just to get blotto, right?

193
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,560
 They want to go to the k-hole.

194
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,000
 It's horse tranquilizer, but for your nose.

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And you go, "Shh."

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,800
 And it basically gets you high.

197
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,080
 You get instantly sedated and you just kind of just want to go with the flow, man.

198
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,280
 You just want to eat pancakes.

199
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,520
 It's that.

200
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,720
 And it's very expensive.

201
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,080
 It starts at $4,700 a month.

202
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,720
 You get a little spray bottle of it.

203
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
 In Britain, they've already said it's too expensive.

204
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,400
 If you're currently using it with your doctor's permission, we'll pay for it, but we're not

205
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,720
 allowing anyone else to use it.

206
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,360
 In America, they want to make it more open than that.

207
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,400
 But so that's what I should have explained that all earlier.

208
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,000
 What's interesting is when I was reading this article, I came across this sentence after

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,520
 I had already imagined my Robocop-esque future with a bunch of robots dragging us out of our

210
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
 houses.

211
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,000
 They're spraying ketamine right in our faces.

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,160
 They go to the Kentucky Derby.

213
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,520
 Psh, the horses are all falling asleep.

214
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,200
 But one of them is wearing a gas mask.

215
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
 They're like, "Good ol' Gassy wins again."

216
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,760
 Everyone's like, "Oh, why do I always bet against Gassy?

217
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,880
 I know the robots are going to show up."

218
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,600
 After I had already imagined that future, when I was rereading the article, I came across

219
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
 this sentence.

220
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,240
 "In its steadies, Johnson and Johnson found those who got the drug had a rapid reduction

221
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,320
 in the severity of their thinking.

222
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:54,240
 Although the results didn't differ in a statistically significant way from patients given a placebo."

223
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,920
 That's an interesting little thing.

224
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,120
 It's not saying that it doesn't work.

225
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,640
 It's saying that if you walked up to someone and just sprayed them with a nasal spray that

226
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,240
 just had water in it, it would also statistically have a chance of snapping them out of whatever

227
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,600
 deep despair they're in at that moment.

228
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,920
 Again, suicide ideation is a long-term thing.

229
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,720
 Therapeutic therapy has to be included in this.

230
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,520
 But this obviously helps in some fashion.

231
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,840
 They have made it available.

232
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,600
 However, we must keep it out of the hands of the Robocops of the world.

233
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,720
 Because once Elon Musk invents those, it's the last annual here.

234
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,360
 We've always been afraid of the New World Order.

235
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,200
 You never knew you were supposed to be afraid of the Nose World Order.

236
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,520
 Bet you didn't smell that one coming.

237
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,800
 Queen Mab, don't tell anymore puns.

238
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,720
 Queen Mab, let's go ahead and hop on that carbonicopter.

239
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,520
 We're leaving behind the futuristic Hellscape of 2025.

240
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,080
 They're trying to shoot mis-status.

241
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,960
 But luckily, the wind is at our fronts.

242
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
 Is that a good thing?

243
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,760
 That means it's blowing it away from us?

244
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,240
 The Robocops are like, "Probably shouldn't have built nose receptors in me."

245
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,440
 We're flying away.

246
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,960
 We're going back to old-timey Nevada.

247
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,240
 Old-timey Eureka Nevada, to be precise.

248
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,680
 It's the year 1871.

249
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,840
 This was actually a request from Kent Allard.

250
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,920
 So Kent, thank you so much for this story.

251
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,280
 It's a great story.

252
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
 He sent this to me.

253
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,400
 Also sent me another story that it's going to take me a long time to do.

254
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,040
 But it's one that I had lost.

255
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,360
 It was a story that I had long before I was doing the podcast.

256
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,520
 Probably back in 2011, 2012, I read this amazing story online.

257
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,240
 I don't even know how I'm going to present it to you.

258
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,640
 I thought it was gone forever because you know how the internet can be.

259
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
 But no, he found it.

260
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,320
 So hats off to you with that, too, Kent Allard.

261
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,720
 We're flying low over the Nevada desert.

262
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,120
 Look out for that canyon.

263
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,840
 And there's a little wood cabin just standing there.

264
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,400
 Been all deserted and stuff.

265
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,800
 Wind, sand.

266
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,920
 Sand doesn't make a noise, so I had no sound effect for that.

267
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,480
 But we're walking across the sand.

268
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,440
 We walk into this cabin.

269
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
 And there's a pirate in there.

270
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
 Arr, matey.

271
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,280
 It's time for me to leave.

272
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
 And he leaves.

273
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
 And we're like, OK.

274
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,000
 And we also see-- the pirate didn't happen, but we also see a skeleton just sitting there.

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,800
 Technically, skeletons wouldn't sit there, right?

276
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
 It would just be like a pile of bones.

277
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,000
 Maybe the skull's on the table and the rib cage is in the chair.

278
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,200
 And then there's just a bunch of random bones sitting on the ground.

279
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 But you get the point, right?

280
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,840
 Even if you just saw a skull, you would be like, well, where's the rest of the bones?

281
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,640
 You understand it's a dead human.

282
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,560
 We're walking around this log cabin and you lean against it.

283
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,200
 After a long day of meeting a pirate in a room full of a skeleton, you kind of lean

284
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 against the wall.

285
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,040
 This is exactly how I expected my Thursday to be.

286
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,040
 And you feel something kind of like nudge against your elbow.

287
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
 You're like, well, that's weird.

288
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,760
 And you turn around and you see a piece of paper pushed into the space between the logs.

289
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,440
 This is actually a real letter that was found in a log cabin in Eureka, Nevada.

290
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,600
 This was published in a newspaper called The Crisfield Times.

291
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,880
 It was in the August 18th, 1923 edition.

292
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,040
 This is compiled from a book called History of Crisfield and surrounding areas of Marylin's

293
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
 Eastern Shore.

294
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,520
 This is a newspaper in Crisfield, Maryland.

295
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,040
 So we start reading this letter.

296
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,000
 We sit down altogether.

297
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 We're reading this letter.

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,960
 After four years of wandering, I am back in the cabin, which I built six years ago.

299
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:35,680
 Surely those six years of hell should go toward the final reckoning.

300
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
 That's a way to start a letter, right?

301
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,560
 Like that gets your attention right there.

302
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,480
 There's a skeleton in a room.

303
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,520
 There's a letter in the wall.

304
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
 Right there.

305
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
 Life sucks.

306
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,320
 But maybe it's a damn payment on the damnation that is awaiting me.

307
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
 Dude.

308
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,280
 Unfortunately, this guy is not an author.

309
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,360
 He's a pile of bones.

310
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,640
 But we'll find out why he's a pile of bones.

311
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,240
 He continues with the letter with this.

312
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,160
 I wonder if anyone will ever read this or will it rot beside me?

313
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,560
 It seems that I could lie down easier if I write out that which I could not dare to whisper

314
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,240
 since I did it.

315
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,760
 He goes on to say that his name is Les Singleton.

316
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,920
 So we turn to the skeleton and go, "Hi, Les."

317
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,440
 His name is Les Singleton.

318
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,560
 He was born in Crisfield, Maryland.

319
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,960
 That's why they're reporting it in that newspaper.

320
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,680
 He enlisted in the Confederacy and suffered two wounds during the war.

321
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,560
 And then eventually his parents died.

322
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,120
 Confederacy lost the war and he was looking around the burning remnants of Maryland and

323
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,360
 he goes, "So he goes to Nevada."

324
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,280
 He ends up in Eureka in the year 1871.

325
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,920
 And he gets a job as a feeder at a furnace in Richmond.

326
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,880
 So a feeder, despite if you Google "feeder" today, which is someone who feeds another

327
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,840
 human until they become immobile and then feeds them more.

328
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,560
 That's one of the worst fetishes.

329
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,240
 Okay, that's not true.

330
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
 There's a lot worse.

331
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
 But that one's bad.

332
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,880
 So, but basically it's already been burned in my head.

333
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,120
 So as I'm reading this article, I just imagine this man throwing cheeseburgers into an 800

334
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,320
 pound person's mouth.

335
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,440
 But that's not what he's doing because that fetish wasn't around back then.

336
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,320
 They didn't have enough food to have that.

337
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,720
 He is a feeder at a furnace in Richmond.

338
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
 And he's sitting there.

339
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,440
 He's throwing coal with a shovel.

340
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,360
 He makes that noise for eight hours a day.

341
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
 Throwing it into the furnace, the fire.

342
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
 Burning it up.

343
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
 He's like, "This isn't a bad job.

344
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,840
 It's just making me awfully hungry for cheeseburgers.

345
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,480
 The big boilers looks like a giant fat dude."

346
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,360
 It's like, "Someday people will pay money to watch me do this."

347
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,720
 So anyways, while he's imagining the future of the internet, his coworker, John Murphy,

348
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,880
 is a total jerk to him.

349
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,080
 He's constantly berating him, pushing him around, which is not something you--it's

350
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,240
 bad enough to have a workplace bully, but when you're near a giant furnace.

351
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,720
 That's not especially where you don't want someone to pull pranks.

352
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,240
 But they're dropping hot coals down your overalls.

353
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,880
 You're like, "Ow, ow, ow!"

354
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,600
 And it sounds funny, but really you're suffering third degree burns on your spine.

355
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
 Ah!

356
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,680
 Guys, constantly picking on him, though.

357
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,760
 John Murphy's constantly picking on Less Singleton.

358
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,040
 And then one day, it escalates to physical violence.

359
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,200
 John actually slaps Less Singleton, and Less Singleton falls to the ground.

360
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
 He's like, "Ahh!"

361
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,720
 Which would, if I imagine, is super hot.

362
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,440
 He falls hands first right into the coals.

363
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
 "Ahh!

364
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,880
 I should get up a little bit faster than I am, but I'm going to get up slowly so I can

365
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,680
 contemplate my revenge."

366
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,840
 Because at this point, he says, "Murphy signed his death warrant then and there."

367
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,880
 So his letter, he's detailing all this stuff.

368
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,720
 The second that hands relate on him, he's like, "I was going to kill this dude.

369
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,720
 There was no- This dude was not walking away from this."

370
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,400
 But the thing is, is that John Murphy could tell that he finally pushed Lil Less Singleton

371
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,800
 too far.

372
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
 Less did nothing.

373
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,480
 And John Murphy starts going, "Dude, what are you going to do, man?

374
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
 Like I just pushed you.

375
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Look at your hands.

376
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Look at your hands.

377
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,440
 They're all smoldering, little like smokes coming out of them.

378
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,160
 Cartoon smoke lines are coming out of your hands right now, bro.

379
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
 What are you going to do?

380
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,640
 What are you going to do, man?

381
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
 Huh?

382
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
 What are you going to do?

383
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,280
 Unless Singleton just is staring at him."

384
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,080
 Here's another quote from his letter.

385
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:30,600
 He "taunted me for being a coward, and I restrained myself with the greatest difficulty.

386
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,280
 Consoling myself with thoughts of the terrible revenge I would wreak upon him.

387
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
 The idea struck me.

388
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:44,000
 It would be an easy matter to strike him on the head and throw his body into the furnace.

389
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,840
 Detection would be impossible."

390
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,360
 So imagine now that Singleton is staring at John Murphy, right?

391
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,640
 And he's imagining that speech in his head.

392
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,160
 But in real life, it's just John Murphy going, "He taunted me for being a coward, and I restrained

393
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,480
 myself with the greatest difficulty.

394
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,200
 Consoling myself with thoughts of the terrible revenge I would wreak upon him.

395
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
 The idea struck me.

396
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,480
 It would be an easy matter to strike him on the head and tell him to come out here to

397
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
 laugh at you."

398
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,040
 I can just imagine those two things happening at once.

399
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,640
 You had that inner monologue, he's just seething.

400
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,720
 Steam's coming out of his ears, steam's coming off of his hands, and then just this dude

401
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,760
 pointing and laughing.

402
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,320
 Two weeks later though, Les has his chance.

403
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,680
 He looks around, huh?

404
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,560
 And he, bonk, hits him on the back of the head with a shovel so hard that it kills him.

405
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,120
 Now I can, knowing modern science, he probably didn't kill him, which makes the next thing

406
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,880
 even more gruesome.

407
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,400
 It probably knocked him out.

408
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,200
 I mean, I don't know, maybe modern shovels you get at Home Depot are a lot lighter than

409
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,920
 the shovels they had.

410
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,800
 Back in 1871, your grandpa's like, "What?

411
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
 These shovels today suck.

412
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,760
 Back in my day, a shovel weighed a thousand pounds."

413
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,520
 Probably knocked him unconscious.

414
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,320
 Probably didn't kill him though.

415
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,840
 So when he picks up John Murphy's body and throws him into the furnace, there's a pretty

416
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,040
 good chance that he was still alive when his body began to burn in the fire.

417
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,400
 Let's go back to this letter here.

418
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
 I really love the letter.

419
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,640
 I love, because I love the way that he's describing everything.

420
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,440
 I love manifestos to begin with.

421
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,080
 I kind of collect them.

422
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,440
 I love the language that he uses.

423
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,480
 That's why I'm really referencing this letter a lot, but quote.

424
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,320
 The next day was truly hell.

425
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,720
 It seemed as if every shovelful I flung into the feed hole of the furnace struck on Murphy's

426
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:43,000
 body and the bubbling of the blast took itself, a speech, and upbraided me for my wickedness.

427
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,160
 When barring out time came, I try to look it up.

428
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
 I don't know what that means.

429
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,440
 I'm imagining that's when you're like pulling out the stuff you've been smelting based

430
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,800
 on the context of this next sentence.

431
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,000
 When barring out time came, it seemed I was raking human bones instead of clinkers of

432
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 iron.

433
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,440
 Hallucination fixed itself upon my brain and I saw Murphy materialize that every part

434
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,840
 of the furnace.

435
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,560
 I got such a mania for looking into the feed hole that I soon became incapacitated for

436
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,680
 further work.

437
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,280
 Then I built this cabin and went into the charcoal burning business.

438
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,280
 That's the last part's not a joke.

439
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
 That actually happened.

440
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,080
 If I was being tormented by the flames, if I burned a man alive or dead, it doesn't matter.

441
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,080
 If I killed a man and hid his body in the flames, every time I'm doing something flame related,

442
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,440
 I see him out of the corner of my eye, wanting a cigarette.

443
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,600
 There's a little tiny John on the match head shaking his finger at me.

444
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,400
 I would not be like, "Oh man, I'm having such horrible visions at the feeder factory or

445
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,880
 wherever I work.

446
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,160
 All those flames, they remind me of that man I murdered.

447
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,160
 I'm going to go get a job at another flame related place.

448
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,760
 I'm going to go get a job at a crematory."

449
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
 Not a good idea.

450
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
 He could have done something else.

451
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,040
 But anyways, that doesn't need to work in out, obviously, right?

452
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,320
 He ends up kind of wandering around.

453
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,080
 He says he goes back east, which I'm assuming he ends up back at Chrisfield, Maryland, which

454
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,280
 is where he's from.

455
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,240
 So he says this, "I went back east where I wandered for four years.

456
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:19,520
 But no matter where I went, I saw Murphy just before my eyes, sitting in a white hot blast,

457
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,200
 taunting me.

458
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
 I came back to Eureka and paid the furnace a visit."

459
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
 That's where you want to go, right?

460
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,920
 Like, "Oh man, those good old days, you're all nostalgic for that time you murdered a

461
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
 man."

462
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,320
 Like, "Oh dude, it was so fun growing up, listening to that 90s music, that 1890s music.

463
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
 Oh my god, so great."

464
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:47,160
 They had the back country boys though.

465
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,240
 Brittany Musket doesn't even make, well, you know, like Spears is a weapon.

466
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
 Musket's a weapon.

467
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,640
 Let's see if I can come up with anyone, anything else.

468
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
 Fiona Appleseed.

469
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
 He's like, "Johnny Appleseed?

470
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,120
 Is that, is that even make sense?

471
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
 No, give me one more.

472
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 Give me one more.

473
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
 I think."

474
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
 The moment's gone.

475
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
 The moment's gone.

476
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:14,120
 Okay, so anyways, maybe you can email me, or your 90s, 1890s band.

477
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
 What are we even talking about?

478
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
 We're talking about a man who's murdered someone.

479
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,000
 Anyways, he's nostalgic for the good old days.

480
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,600
 The good old days of that time he murdered his bully.

481
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,080
 I came back to Eureka.

482
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,200
 I'm just thinking of 90s days.

483
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,200
 I came back to Eureka and paid the furnace a visit.

484
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,400
 Although it was shut down, I saw Murphy there grinning at me.

485
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,000
 I could feel my reason slipping.

486
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,880
 So I went to town and bought some Lodinum, which is basically morphine.

487
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,120
 It was super, super potent morphine.

488
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
 It was a tincture.

489
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,920
 Two, two to three teaspoons would kill you.

490
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,240
 It was a deadly dose and it came in a little bottle of it.

491
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,040
 They'd be like, "We trust you.

492
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,160
 We trust you with this hardcore medicine that you're not going to use it to commit

493
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
 suicide."

494
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,320
 I'm not going to give them the 19th century use that.

495
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,160
 I imagine it would just put you to sleep.

496
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,880
 But anyway, I actually didn't plan that.

497
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
 That's interesting.

498
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,760
 We started off with suicide prevention and now this dude's killing us.

499
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,120
 So he has this little bottle.

500
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,640
 He's sitting in the cabin where we're at, where we're going to be in the future.

501
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,040
 He's sitting there and he's finishing out this letter.

502
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,280
 As soon as I finish writing, I will take the poison and lay down in the bunk.

503
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
 Wait a second.

504
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
 Why was a skeleton actually?

505
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
 I guess I made that detail up.

506
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
 I don't think a skeleton was sitting.

507
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
 I just imagine it was sitting.

508
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:33,520
 I don't think a skeleton was sitting at a table writing a letter.

509
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,280
 That wouldn't be the most comfortable place to kill yourself, right?

510
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,880
 You're like, "Hmm, I'm going to take this poison that's going to put me to sleep

511
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 till I die.

512
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
 I'm going to sit up.

513
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,440
 I'm going to go running a marathon until I fall over."

514
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
 That would make sense.

515
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
 I guess I should finish reading the story.

516
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,920
 I mean, I did finish reading it.

517
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,880
 For whatever reason, I just imagine when they said they found a skeleton, I guess I always

518
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,520
 imagine that my skeleton would be sitting down.

519
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,360
 I sit way more than I sleep, right?

520
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,320
 I just imagine a skeleton was sitting in the chair.

521
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,000
 That's why I had that whole thing at the beginning about how a skeleton is just sitting there.

522
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,080
 Anyways, then you would see a whole skeleton if it was in the bed.

523
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,880
 So, moral of the story is, the detail is important.

524
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
 Here we go.

525
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,280
 "Soon as I finish writing on this table that I'm sitting at, Jason, I will take the poison

526
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,920
 and lay down in the bunk.

527
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,840
 I will lay here and rot and vermin will feast on me.

528
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,560
 I am sure I cannot go to a worse hell than I've been in for the last six years."

529
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,960
 So he took that letter, he wrote it out at his table as people do, and then he got up,

530
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,920
 he stuffed it into the wall of his cabin, took the poison, laid down and died.

531
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,880
 Now tell me if this is in a spoiler headline.

532
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,600
 Like, that was a great story, right?

533
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 It's kind of a great ghost story.

534
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,200
 It's a story, a true crime story of revenge.

535
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,400
 This guy was just pushing him to the edge, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing.

536
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
 The edge wasn't a metaphorical edge.

537
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,960
 It was literally the edge that would push him into a furnace and he goes, "Hey, it's

538
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
 either you or me, buddy."

539
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,920
 But he couldn't live with the guilt.

540
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,280
 But this is the whole headline.

541
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
 This is the whole headline.

542
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,560
 "Note that skeleton's side reveals tale of murder, apparition and suicide."

543
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
 That's not bad, right?

544
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
 Oh, I'm not finished.

545
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,600
 "Confession is found in cabin after 40 years.

546
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,400
 Victim says he was born in Christfield, located in Nevada at close of Civil War.

547
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,040
 Killed man and threw body in furnace.

548
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,760
 Return to cabin after years of wandering in East."

549
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,840
 So why do I even have to read the article at that point?

550
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,200
 You've told me everything.

551
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,120
 But I didn't want to read that to you in the beginning because obviously that spoils

552
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,640
 a lot of the stuff.

553
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,000
 What's interesting about the story is that so this letter is found.

554
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,400
 It's then forwarded to the people of Christfield, Maryland, and they reported it in their newspaper

555
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,200
 and they end up asking, they want to know more about the story.

556
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,840
 When they send reporters out west to talk to people who lived in Eureka at the time,

557
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,880
 this was a documented event.

558
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,280
 People who had lived in Eureka, the old timers were sitting in their rocking chair, which

559
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,880
 was the height of technology back then.

560
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,400
 Look at this amazing chair.

561
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
 Elon Musk invented it.

562
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,760
 They're going back and forth, back and forth, and the reporter's like, "That's an amazing

563
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,960
 story too, man invents rocking chair."

564
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,360
 Look at that next week.

565
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,600
 But do you remember anything about Les Singleton and John Murphy?

566
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,280
 And they talked to these people, all these old timers all over town and no one in town

567
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,040
 knew either of those people.

568
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,520
 They knew about the furnace.

569
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,060
 They had heard about the story afterwards, but they go, "No, we've never known of a

570
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,560
 Les Singleton or John Murphy."

571
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,000
 Now he said he lived there for years.

572
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,480
 People were like, "Nope."

573
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,200
 And it's a small town.

574
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,080
 Nobody ever knew anything about either of these guys, which makes me think there's an even

575
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,320
 more tragic tale to this story.

576
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,080
 We don't know what wounds Les Singleton suffered fighting in the Civil War, but it's possible.

577
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,200
 Some of them were brain damage or mental damage, right?

578
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,380
 It's possible that John Murphy never existed, that Les Singleton never worked at the furnace.

579
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,760
 But he thought that he did.

580
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,440
 He thought that he was being berated by someone.

581
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,840
 He thought he was being pushed through the edge.

582
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,080
 And he thought he murdered somebody.

583
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,080
 And trapped in that mental delusion, he had created a reality in his own head that nobody

584
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,680
 else knew of.

585
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
 It just wasn't real.

586
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:34,840
 And he travels across the country, being haunted by the spirit of a man who never existed.

587
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,560
 And in the end, suffering from years of brain damage, he ends up in a cabin in the middle

588
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,320
 of Eureka, the cabin that he remembers building.

589
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,120
 But it's just an old abandoned cabin in the middle of nowhere.

590
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:54,760
 As he writes a letter, a ghost of a man that never existed sits across from him, smiling.

591
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,480
 You deserve what you get, Les.

592
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,080
 You deserve this.

593
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,440
 You deserve everything.

594
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,440
 In those last moments still haunting, Les takes a swig of morphine, sets it down, puts

595
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,000
 the note on the wall, and dies.

596
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,680
 Fearful of burning in hell for his sins that he never committed.

597
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,000
 Is this the story of a man who was so small in life that he could exist in a community

598
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,560
 for years and people just don't remember him?

599
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:33,320
 Or is it the story of a man who was driven mad by war, by unrelated killings, by unrelated

600
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,240
 strife, by unrelated depression?

601
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,480
 And as those thoughts built up in his mind, it created a reality of its own.

602
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,960
 One where he finally stood up against the bullies of the world and killed one.

603
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:52,720
 But in the end, even that imaginary sin was too much for Les Singleton to live with.

604
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:08,240
 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

605
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,720
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

606
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,400
 Have a great one, guys.

607
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:22,400
 Bye.

608
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,980
 (upbeat music)

609
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,560
 (upbeat music)
