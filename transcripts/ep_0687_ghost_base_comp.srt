1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 The FBI issues a bizarre demand that should frighten anyone who uses the internet.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,300
 And then we meet a young family stationed at a California military base.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,000
 While her husband is deployed, it's up to the mother to protect their two children.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,400
 But how can she protect them?

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,000
 From a threat she can't even see.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I'm a walking down.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,500
 [Music]

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,500
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,500
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter and childhood personal best friend of mine.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 Writing a Dead Rabbit command on the back of an enormous enchanted elephant.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 It's Steve Daimwood. Everyone give a round of applause for Steve Daimwood. Give him a little round of applause.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,500
 One time listeners of the show recognized that name. I've talked about him several times on this show.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,500
 My original Ghost Hunter partner in crime, Steve Daimwood, is now supporting the Patreon. Thank you so much Steve.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 You know what's interesting? Steve, as far as I can recall, is the first person I knew my age who saw a ghost.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,500
 Back in the 80s and the 90s, you still did not talk about paranormal stuff or UFO stuff.

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 It was considered something that kooks believed, especially UFOs.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,500
 You'd get the Time Life books, you'd watch the shows narrated by Leonard Nimoy,

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 but you were still considered cuckoo, cuckoo if you ever mentioned publicly that you saw a ghost.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 Or that you saw a UFO. This is debatable, but I'm pretty sure Steve was the very first person I knew around my age who had seen a ghost.

22
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 Hope you don't mind me sharing the story, Steve. Steve told me the story a long time ago.

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
 He was a little kid. He was a little kid living in his house.

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 And I don't remember the age, I don't remember what age he was or the location or anything like that. Don't blow up my spot.

25
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 But he was a little kid, and if I remember the story correctly, it was at his house, he was all alone.

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:27,500
 And a stagecoach, like a phantom stagecoach, a translucent horse and carriage, you know, like old timey dude and everything like that?

27
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,500
 A translucent horse and carriage, horse and buggy, like old pioneer.

28
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,500
 I'm really caught up on it, you're like Jason, just get to what it does. You don't have to keep describing it when it is.

29
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,500
 So it had wheels with spokes of old oak taken from the mightiest trees.

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,500
 He's sitting at his house, and the stagecoach begins to gallop through his house.

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:58,500
 And wasn't knocking stuff over, it wasn't like excuse me, sir, as the horses were, it was moving through the house as if it wasn't there.

32
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,500
 Now I would like to imagine little six-year-old Steve running all the way in the end of June.

33
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 And he's like, "Ah, he's running down the hallway as the stagecoach is coming."

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 There's also a huge chance that Steve is going to email me after this episode and be like, "What are you talking about? That never happened."

35
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 I remember you telling me that story, Steve.

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,500
 Anyways, and I remember being like, "Whoa, that was the first time I'd ever met someone my age."

37
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 And it seemed it goes.

38
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,500
 And usually the ghost stories were like, "My great-grandma Zelda came to me after she passed away."

39
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
 Which I'm not discounting that. That's beautiful.

40
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 But it's a little less exciting when she's chasing you. Does she have a stagecoach?

41
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 I mean, it's beautiful she came back to say goodbye one last time.

42
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 But did you run from her?

43
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 So that was an amazing ghost story of Steve's.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 There is a high likelihood that that part of the episode will get edited out of Steve's like,

45
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 "Dude, I don't want you sharing my ghost stories, especially ones that I don't even remember happened to me."

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
 No, I'm pretty sure Steve told me that story.

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
 Anyways, I went to high school, Steve. He's a great guy. We went on ghost hunts.

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 And I'm gonna go more into detail about mine and Steve's ghost hunts on tomorrow's episode.

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 Because not only am I going to rehash this time we met a Civil War ghost,

50
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 and the time we went to a spooky, spooky graveyard in Folsom, California,

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
 I am going to for the first time ever.

52
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 Tell a story that was deleted from this podcast. Lost media, some may say.

53
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,500
 The burned pants story. Steve Daimwood was a key player in the burned pants story.

54
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,500
 And I recorded that episode maybe three, four hundred episodes ago and never released it.

55
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 So, stay tuned, stay tuned tomorrow for more crazy personal ghost stories as well as finally the burned pants new listeners.

56
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,500
 What are you talking about? Civil War ghosts? You met a Civil War ghost? Yes. Kind of.

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,500
 Burned pants tomorrow, but we got a ton of stuff to cover today as well.

58
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
 Steve, I'm gonna toss you the... Oh, I gotta finish my intro.

59
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 Steve, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. I totally get it.

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,500
 Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,500
 Steve, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out too.

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
 Sunrise, Florida.

63
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 [imitates Jason Jalopy]

64
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,500
 Old-timey Jason Jalopy. It's not as cool as a Phantom Stagecoach, but we did chase a couple kids through their houses in this thing.

65
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 Steve is driving us down to Sunrise, Florida. It's February 2nd, 2021.

66
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,500
 We're in the sleepy little town of Sunrise, Florida. It's 6 in the morning.

67
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:46,500
 David Lee Hooper is a 55-year-old man, generally known around the apartment complexes being a bit of a crank.

68
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,500
 Actually, that's not far enough. They actually think he's a dangerous, psychotic man.

69
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 He's not just like Maxine. He's not just like this guy walking around in his robe and his coffee.

70
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,500
 He's like, "Don't talk to me before I have my cup of Joe." People are afraid he's going to murder them. He's way more than just a crank.

71
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:15,500
 6 a.m. February 2nd, 2021. David Lee Hooper is getting served a run-of-the-mill federal arrest warrant for suspected child exploitation.

72
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 Which generally means child sex abuse images, a.k.a. child porn.

73
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 So the FBI goes to arrest this dude. It turns out he is fully prepared for this.

74
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 I mean, obviously, if he's doing this disgusting stuff, he has to know if this is going to happen eventually.

75
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 He's armed. He has one of those ring doorbell video cameras. He sees them coming.

76
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 He opens fire. The FBI's calling for backup. It's this whole thing. I actually thought about covering it at the time.

77
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 Because it was this crazy true crime story. In the end, two FBI agents were killed. Three were wounded.

78
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 David Lee Hooper killed himself. And SWAT teams showed up. They didn't know if there were explosives in the building.

79
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 They took a tank and drove it through his apartment. It's considered the bloodiest day in FBI history since 9/11.

80
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 It was a terrible, terrible tragic event for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

81
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 I remember reading those articles at the time. I'm like, "This is insane. It's like something out of a movie."

82
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 But I didn't cover it. I thought it was an interesting true crime story, but I didn't cover it. Until this.

83
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,500
 Because this is where it goes from being true crime and goes into the realm of conspiracy. And I've never seen this before.

84
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,500
 I've seen stuff kind of like it, but it was always super specific.

85
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 This just came out yesterday. When I keep saying yesterday, this came out on June 5th.

86
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 Everyone covered this new story. It was a huge new story. All these websites are running it. All these newspapers are running it.

87
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,500
 I almost ran a segment on it. Very, very widespread news report.

88
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 This event happened on February 2nd in April. USA Today, the publisher for USA Today, GANET, got a subpoena from the FBI.

89
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 And they said, "Listen, we're doing this criminal investigation. We need some information from you."

90
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:09,500
 What we want from you, what the FBI wants from you, GANET, is that you published an article on February 2nd, 2021.

91
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 You published it at 9 a.m. Here's the link. It's this USA Today article regarding the shooting and killing of these FBI agents.

92
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 We want to know who read this article. We want to know the phone numbers and the IP addresses of every single person who clicked on this article

93
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 between 8.03 p.m. and 8.38 p.m. We expect this information as soon as you can provide it.

94
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,500
 We all know there are websites out there that sell illegal drugs that are actually honey pots for the federal government.

95
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 You're like, "What? That's the thing. You're buying a bunch of drugs. You're waiting for your heroin."

96
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 We all know there are websites out there that are actually set up by the government to commit fraud or terrorism.

97
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 They don't get you to commit it. They get you to commit to it. They arrest you before you do it.

98
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
 You also know there are websites out there that the feds are watching.

99
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 They're trying to check the traffic that's going in and out of these sites.

100
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 They can go, "Oh, this is Guy. He visited this website. Let's look out for drug information. Let's look out for drugs coming to this address."

101
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 We all know those things. I have never, ever seen a mainstream website about an article that was written on hundreds of websites on that same day.

102
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 Being told, "We want to know everyone who visited this between 8.03 and 8.38 p.m. a very specific time."

103
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,500
 Give us that information. Don't tell anyone about this, either. You'll be jeopardizing this investigation.

104
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 The reason why we know about it now is that GANNIT is filing suit. They're saying, "No way. Absolutely not. We're not giving you that information. We'll take you to court."

105
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 That's First Amendment. They have the right to read our articles.

106
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:14,500
 And the only thing I could think of was that somebody referenced that article between that time period somewhere else on some other forum.

107
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 And they said, "Did you see this USA Today article?" And they provided that link. And it was between the time of 8.03 and 8.38 p.m.

108
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 And they wanted to know who that was. They wanted to know who that was.

109
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 It may have been on some dark net forum or something like that. That was my idea.

110
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 My theory was that somebody then sent, after this happened, sent a threat to the FBI and said, "Well, more's coming, guys." And then provided that link.

111
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:51,500
 And they were taking it. They wanted to know who sent it. That was my... Unfortunately, see, I'm a little more Cobra Commander in my aspirations.

112
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 And I forget the sewer people existed. So the FBI did announce today. So that all happened yesterday.

113
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 The FBI announced today we're taking back the subpoena. We're taking back the subpoena.

114
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,500
 The reason why we issued that subpoena, because everyone thought it was weird. Why that time?

115
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:16,500
 The reason why we issued that subpoena was not because Destro was planning to destroy the Eiffel Tower and he mentioned this article.

116
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 No, it was because we believed this other child molester had visited the website at that time.

117
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 And they knew if they could get all the IP addresses and all of the phone numbers of everyone who visited that, they could catch a good chunk of them.

118
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 People clicking on the link from that dark net forum or the person who submitted it in the first place.

119
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,500
 Fascinating and terrifying. I understand we want to lock these people up.

120
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,500
 But you have to imagine hundreds of thousands of... Okay.

121
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 Tens of thousands of people were reading that article between that time period.

122
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,500
 And all their information being given to the government for them to troll through and start to make these connections.

123
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 At what point do you say, "I'm willing to have all of my IP information out there because I know I'm not one of those creepos"?

124
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 So yes, you can have access to all of my information.

125
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 It's fascinating. It's a fascinating thing because your gut instinct is to be like, kick down their doors.

126
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 Absolutely kick down their door. Do whatever it takes to kick down their door. That's your gut instinct.

127
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
 Because originally, see, I thought this was like a threat.

128
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,500
 It's funny because if someone was... This is going to come out wrong, but if someone was making threats towards the FBI,

129
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,500
 I would be like, "Hey, dude, it's freedom of speech. The guy probably didn't really mean it. He's just blowing off steam.

130
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
 He was the apartment complex owner. He's like, "Oh, my apartment's."

131
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
 But when you learn what it actually is, it's super gross.

132
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,500
 And at that point, you're like... You know what I mean? Like, that's the struggle.

133
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 Like, if you're going after really disgusting villains, where does the line of liberty and freedom...

134
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
 Where you're just like, just kicking their doors?

135
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 Where you just harvest mass amounts of information. Everyone's phone...

136
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 The reason why they wanted the phone numbers was because if they were using their phone access to the website.

137
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,500
 Fascinating story, though, and that is a conspiracy.

138
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 And you have to wonder, the reason why we know about it is because USA Today did not comply with it.

139
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,500
 You have to wonder how many times websites, like mainstream websites, again, this isn't just weirdo websites out there that the police are watching.

140
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:31,500
 You're clicking on articles on San Francisco Chronicle, on Drudge Report, all these other websites.

141
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,500
 And they're like, "Hey, can we get a list of who clicked on this article?"

142
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,500
 And you're just reading it, you're just reading like, you know, the sports scores or something like that.

143
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,500
 But at the same time, some gross dude, some gross disgusting dude was posting on some forum.

144
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,500
 "Hey, did you see how James LeBron did last night? Long live King James!"

145
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:55,500
 Now you're in that database! You're in that database because that Fox News is like, "Yeah, sure, here's all of our files. We don't care."

146
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:02,500
 I'm not saying Fox News would do that, but I'm saying that how many times does this happen that they... we don't know about?

147
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,500
 It's probably a lot. Probably a lot.

148
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
 Fascinating story, true crime and conspiracy, intersecting.

149
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 Steve, I'm gonna go ahead and touch you the keys of the carbonar copter.

150
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:19,500
 We are leaving behind Sunrise Florida. We are headed out to a military installation somewhere in California.

151
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 [imitates car engine]

152
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 This comes from a Reddit user named Sweets1924.

153
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,500
 So let's give them an actual human name. We're gonna call her Emily.

154
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 And if that's her real name, it's just a shot in the dark. Emily is a young mother, a young military wife, and her husband...

155
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:49,500
 Her husband, Duke? Her husband, Duke, is ready to sign up with GI Joe and fight the forces of Cobra, the villains we should actually be fighting, other than the real life disgusting pervos out there.

156
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 Duke is ready to go take the war to Cobra. They have two kids. We'll just call them... we'll just call them Veronica and Bobby.

157
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
 It doesn't really matter what their names are. They're living on base housing in this military base in California.

158
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 The location is not named in the story. It's understandable why. And you'll see as the story progresses.

159
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 And this truly is a story of progression. Duke is gonna get deployed.

160
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:20,500
 So eventually it's just gonna be Emily and the two kids, home alone, on this base housing. They're living on this military base.

161
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,500
 And a couple days before Duke is deployed, everyone is asleep in the house.

162
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 And Emily says they have their blinds open in their bedroom to just let a little bit of light in. No one likes sleeping in pitch darkness.

163
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,500
 And this night, they hear their bedroom door open.

164
00:15:36,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

165
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 No, soon they would be having the bad dream. Is that a good thing? Should I start including segues like that? It wasn't their kid. I guess I forgot to tell that detail. It wasn't their kid.

166
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 They turned on the light. I got too busy doing my new Robert Stack transitions. They turn on the light. There's no kids in the room. It's kid-less.

167
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 They go and they check on their kids and their kids are sleeping. Totally fine.

168
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:39,500
 Duke gets deployed. Emily is now home alone with Veronica and Bobby. They watch a Netflix one night.

169
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 And a bag of potato chips falls off the fridge.

170
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 And she looks at it and she goes, "Oh, I must have put the bag too close to the edge of the fridge. It happens."

171
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:59,500
 If that was where the story ended, right? Think about how often stuff falls off of your fridge. It does all the time in my place. Stuff's constantly falling down where I live.

172
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,500
 I never think about it. I never think about it. It happens so often and I think that probably happens in a lot of beer. Like, Jason, no, your house is definitely on it.

173
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 Stuff shouldn't constantly be falling off or check the foundation at least. So that was always falling down where I live.

174
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,500
 So I don't even think about it. And this is what I mean in the story of progression. If just the potato chips fell down, you wouldn't even think about it.

175
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:27,500
 But she's connecting all these threads together. The person running around in the room, you would think, "I just woke up. Just dreaming."

176
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:35,500
 Potato chips falling, nothing. But that night, she's putting the kids to bed. She puts little Bobby to bed and she puts Veronica to bed.

177
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 And she says that they're sleeping soundly. She goes back out of the living room. She's like, "Finally, some peace and quiet."

178
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 And she goes and checks on the kids every once in a while. She checks on Bobby sound asleep. She checks on Veronica.

179
00:17:49,500 --> 00:18:02,500
 She's peeking through the door and she sees Veronica's blanket being lifted up off of her. She said it looked like someone had grabbed it and was pulling it up into the air.

180
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:10,500
 Impossible. And she throws the door wide open and the blanket falls and just lays there.

181
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 Now, Emily goes, "That must have been my imagination. There is no way what I saw is actually real."

182
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 A couple of nights later, the house is quiet. Everyone's asleep.

183
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:45,500
 Emily hears from the hallway, "DEEP MORNFUL SOBBING."

184
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 She's like, "What the hell is going on now? Someone is just in extreme depression."

185
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 She's like, "Listen, I don't know my kids missed their dad, but this is a little too much. Get over it."

186
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 She goes out into the hallway, completely empty hallway.

187
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 Now, at this point, Emily is 100% for sure she's going insane.

188
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 She's not even thinking ghost at this point. And that's a really interesting path to take.

189
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 I know when I've had ghost experiences, that is your first instinct.

190
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 That was Steve's first hallucination. A lifelong hallucination problem. I mean, chase away a stagecoach.

191
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 When I've seen ghost stuff, my first thing is I must be going crazy.

192
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,500
 When you see something just off the corner of your eye, you just go, "That's just out of the corner of my eye."

193
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,500
 When you're seeing stuff a lot, your first instinct is, "I must be losing my mind."

194
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,500
 Because that's what we think of. That's what we think of. You're just going crazy.

195
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
 So that is her first instinct. She's not bringing over mediums.

196
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 She's not downloading apps onto her phone and trying to do white noise, talking and stuff like that.

197
00:19:52,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 She's like, "Oh my God, I hope my kids are safe. I hope that someone will take care of them while I'm in the Insanisylum for a week trying to get over this."

198
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,500
 It's a sex day though. She's sitting in the living room, "Mommy, mommy, mommy!"

199
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,500
 Her daughter and her son are running down the hallway towards her, "Mommy, mommy!"

200
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 And mom's like, "What is going on?"

201
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
 "Mommy, I was just in my room," said Veronica.

202
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,500
 Because the little kids sound the same. You can't tell if it's a boy or a girl, right?

203
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 This is Veronica. "Mommy, I was just in my room and there's a girl in my closet."

204
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,500
 I finished the story. That's not the end of it. I don't know why it takes such a long pause.

205
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 Just imagine Emily's mouth going, "Oh!" that whole time.

206
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 "There's a girl in my closet. Mommy, you won't believe this."

207
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
 So me and Bobby were playing the closet game.

208
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
 You know the game where we open and close the closet door?

209
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,500
 And then my voice started to change back to normal because Jason got tired of doing that voice.

210
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 I was hanging out by the closet with Bobby and there's a little girl in the closet.

211
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 And she's mean, Mommy. She's so mean.

212
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 Because I have pigtails. You see this detail that Jason's telling us about now?

213
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
 I, Veronica, have pigtails.

214
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,500
 And the little girl in the closet said, "Take them out or I'll cut them off."

215
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 And then she called me a little bitch.

216
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 She called her a little bitch. She called.

217
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 That's an actual quote. I'm not adding that in.

218
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 This little girl, I mean, it's one thing to have a ghost be like haunting your house.

219
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 But it's another thing to be like, "Man, what's up, bitch?

220
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
 What are you laying there? I'm pushing you over."

221
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
 They're not there to haunt you. They're just there to bully you.

222
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,500
 You're like, "Hey, I've just seen all my change. It's taking your lunch money."

223
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 You're like, "Oh, man, what am I supposed to do? Your wallet's missing?"

224
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
 Your ghost is like, "Ha ha ha."

225
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,500
 "Is he actually projecting you in the middle of the night giving you swirlies?"

226
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
 How come that's an Adam Sandler movie that needs to be made?

227
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,500
 Anyways, I know I totally cut it. I ruined the tension.

228
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,500
 This little ghost, imagine now, okay, this little creepy ghost girl.

229
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,500
 She does call you a little bitch. That's still kind of funny.

230
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 But to a little girl that's super spooky, right?

231
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 And the mom realized her kids don't cuss.

232
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 It doesn't mean they've never heard a cuss word before.

233
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,500
 But if these children were joking, that would not be part of the joke.

234
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 Like, the reason why these children were saying that word

235
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,500
 was because they need-- the mother needed to know the gravity of a situation.

236
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 So at this point, the mom knows she's not insane.

237
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 Or it would be mass hallucination, because the children are seeing it too.

238
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,500
 And Bobby and Veronica are so scared of this little girl, they call her "scary."

239
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
 They're not like, "Her name's Margaret and she just wants a friend."

240
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 They're like, "No, she's scary. That's her name. She's scary."

241
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 It's not just an adjective. She's a terrifying young girl.

242
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 So that night, Bobby and Veronica are like, "We're not sleeping in our rooms, mom."

243
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 At all. Because there's a little ghost girl in Veronica's room.

244
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 It wouldn't even matter if the boy didn't have a ghost in his closet.

245
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,500
 Would you even want to check? They saw a full body apparition that threatened them.

246
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 Physically. Well, Veronica, but still Bobby, you know.

247
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,500
 He might be next. He might want to grow pigtails and then he's doomed.

248
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
 So they're sleeping out in the living room.

249
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,500
 And that night, Emily is FaceTiming with her cousin.

250
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 They're just talking and then the cousin goes, "Hey, is everything okay over there?"

251
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 Imagine that point, Emily's heart stopped.

252
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,500
 She can just imagine there's a little ghost girl floating behind her or something like that.

253
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,500
 The cousin goes, "Is everything okay over there?" And Emily goes, "Yeah, I mean, fine."

254
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,500
 I mean, you probably can tell. I haven't slept a lot lately, but why do you ask?

255
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,500
 And the cousin goes, "The kids are crying."

256
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,500
 Emily's looking around and she goes, "No, no they're not."

257
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:10,500
 And the cousin goes, "I can clearly hear a child crying over the FaceTime. I can hear this child crying."

258
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,500
 And Emily said her cousin was so convinced that the kids were crying.

259
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 Because at that point on the cousin's side, she has to think, is something really wrong?

260
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,500
 Like, has this woman abused them in some way? Like, that would be weird to be...

261
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 I didn't think about this until I was telling the story.

262
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,500
 On the cousin's side, if you clearly hear a child sobbing and then you know there's children there,

263
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 and the parents are like, "Oh no, there's no crying here." That would be super sus, right?

264
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 But anyway, so Emily, I think she probably picked up on that.

265
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 Emily had to show, picked up the camera and was walking over and showed that her two children were fast asleep on the couch.

266
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 Emily could not hear the crying.

267
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 The cousin did though over FaceTime.

268
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:02,500
 That is so terrifying. That is such a scary detail to this story.

269
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,500
 Because you think about all the times you could just be sitting there at home alone, reading a book,

270
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:18,500
 and there's something going on right next to you. There's like a shivering old man breathing right in your ear.

271
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 Because he's super rude too. He needs to know personal boundaries.

272
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 You're taking a shower and right outside there's just this dude standing there.

273
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 He can't wait to leave without a shower. He can't wait to breathe in his ear.

274
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,500
 You know what I mean? And maybe if you were FaceTime in the shower, you're talking to someone in the shower,

275
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 they see the silhouette of an old man standing outside, but you could...

276
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 Oh, dude, that's so scary. That is so terrifying. The fact that something was sobbing and no one in the room could hear it,

277
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 but someone else outside the room could... Oh, dude, it's so spooky.

278
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,500
 Anyways, level of progression. Potato chips falling off of a fridge.

279
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,500
 Phantom sounds being heard from people out. That's just too much.

280
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,500
 But it still wasn't too much for Emily.

281
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,500
 What are you going to do, I guess, would be the thing?

282
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,500
 Your husband who's really in charge of the house.

283
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 Because this is his job. They have this house because of his job.

284
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,500
 They're not making a ton of money. Military enlisted people don't make a ton of money.

285
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,500
 Actually, it doesn't say what rank he is, but fairly young family.

286
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 They're not making a ton of money. What are you going to do?

287
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 And at the same time, you do kind of think, "Maybe I'm just losing my mind."

288
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,500
 But when the kids are seen, scary, and when the cousin's hearing that crying,

289
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 Emily just feels really helpless about it. She has these two kids to take care of.

290
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
 The next day, her and the kids go shopping. They're probably like, "Do you want to stay home?"

291
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,500
 And play Switch. They're like, "Uh-uh, take a shopping. I don't care if I'm trying on shoes all day long.

292
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,500
 I want to get out of here." They go shopping. They come back.

293
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:59,500
 And Emily notices when they get home, they see muddy footprints through the house.

294
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:08,500
 They lead to her bathroom. And the final set of footprints is actually standing on top of the closed toilet seat.

295
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:16,500
 So at this point, two things are very clear. The house is haunted and this ghost is kind of a jerk.

296
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:23,500
 She calls her husband. She's like, "Listen, moms are going off." He's like, "Honey, I can't hear you. Let me go to a quieter place."

297
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 And she goes, "I know things are pretty stressful over where you're at, honey, but this place is super haunted."

298
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:38,500
 Apparently a lot of the base housing on this base, people have complained about ghosts.

299
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,500
 And we talked about this last week. We talked about this last week, last Monday, really.

300
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:50,500
 We talked about the haunted bases on Okinawa, considered some of the most haunted places in the US military.

301
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:56,500
 And that may just be something that servicemen have to deal with.

302
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:05,500
 You're living on base housing. You figure you have all of this emotional energy. You have young families, really, really young families,

303
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 being separated for 18 months at a time. All of this passion and childhood and all of these fears and hopes and wants.

304
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 It's like that's the most dynamic part of your life. The emotional energy, like there's that idea that ghosts are 50% dead people

305
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 and then 50% of the emotional residue we leave behind, a military base, and then you factor in all the affairs and stuff like that as well.

306
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 Now you're just like amplifying this stuff. It would make sense that a military base would be charged with emotional energy.

307
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,500
 And the fact that the military, unfortunately, people die. People die doing it.

308
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:58,500
 You have the young moms at home getting the letter, getting the folded flag, that emotional energy being discharged, the man coming back to find his family,

309
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,500
 but 50 years had passed and now his specter is in a house. His family has moved on. Things like that.

310
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,500
 All of these things that you can wrap up. And when you look at classic ghost stories too, a lot of it is the young woman,

311
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:19,500
 her husband goes out to war, her husband goes out to sea, never returns. You can still see her ghost standing by the window to this day.

312
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 It's very, very classic American Gothic ghost stories.

313
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:34,500
 But the Duke is like, "Yeah, historically all that stuff matters, but what matters right now is that a lot of my fellow soldiers are saying,

314
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 'There's a lot of places on the base that are haunted. Call the chaplain. Call the chaplain.'" So she does.

315
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 She calls the base chaplain, which I'm sure was very hard for her, because she seemed to be struggling with, "Do I have a mental health crisis?"

316
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,500
 The chaplain for the base shows up, walks into the house and tells her this,

317
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 "Okay, I can bless this house." So I'm assuming they were probably Catholic. I can bless this house.

318
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:07,500
 But he never, he never want to hear, he never want to hear a chaplain say, "But," when talking about this type of stuff, he goes,

319
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:14,500
 "I can bless your house, but it's only going to make things worse. You need to find a new place to live."

320
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:21,500
 My advice, as he's like walking around the house, he's all like, "Oh, he doesn't want to go."

321
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 He's like, "It's in the closet, okay, we're not going over there." He tells her, "You need to get a hotel room for a while,

322
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,500
 because I'm going to do this, I will bless this place, but it's going to get worse, so do you have anywhere else to stay?"

323
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:37,500
 And again, a lot of military families don't make a ton of money. They're usually moved, you know, they had family in one state,

324
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,500
 born and raised in Utah now, they're in California. It's not like they can just pick up and go to their mom's house across the street.

325
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,500
 They do have to get a hotel room for a while.

326
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,500
 And the husband does arrange it that they'll get a new place.

327
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,500
 Whether it's off base or another, I wouldn't, even if they're like, "Well, we can move into this other house on base."

328
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,500
 You can pay a little bit extra and be ghost-free, go ahead and do it.

329
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,500
 They move, they do pick up and move.

330
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,500
 And Emily says on the very last day, they're packing all their stuff up, but things are still scattered around,

331
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,500
 knick-knacks and things like that, they're still getting their last of their stuff packed up to go.

332
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:20,500
 Emily's packing, Duke is packing, the kids, the kids are much as the clothes in the closet, mom.

333
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,500
 Let's just go to Pay Less, buy some new shoes, go to Walmart, buy some new clothes.

334
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 Emily said as they were packing stuff up, at one point she looks over, and among all this stuff that's just kind of spread out,

335
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,500
 these knick-knacks, there's a candle sitting there.

336
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,500
 A lit candle.

337
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
 She looks at Duke.

338
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
 Duke looks over at her.

339
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:49,500
 Neither of them lit that candle.

340
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,500
 The problem with ghosts is that we really don't know what causes them.

341
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,500
 We know it's not every single death equals a ghost, because otherwise there would be millions and millions of ghosts everywhere.

342
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,500
 You wouldn't be able to get on it some way without getting covered in ectoplasm.

343
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,500
 We don't know what causes ghosts, we don't know what causes it.

344
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,500
 Scary, this little girl's scary, she did say.

345
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,500
 The reason why she stayed at the house is she was waiting for Uncle Sean.

346
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
 But what does that mean?

347
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,500
 Who's Uncle Sean? Is he alive?

348
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 Is he another spirit?

349
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
 Is she waiting to join him?

350
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
 Is she in fear of him?

351
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,500
 Is she waiting to get revenge on him? We don't know any of these details.

352
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:38,500
 So we don't know where the motivations are, we don't know where these things come from, we don't know why they exist.

353
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
 We have theories, but we don't know why.

354
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,500
 And that's one of the things that makes ghosts so terrifying.

355
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,500
 Really the most terrifying of all paranormal phenomenon.

356
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,500
 We can predict cryptids. Bigfoot lives here.

357
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,500
 You want to fight a vampire, you need these things.

358
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,500
 But ghosts just exist and we live in their world.

359
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
 And we don't know what causes them to come.

360
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 We don't know what causes them to become visible to us.

361
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,500
 Because this house was military housing, you had other families in here.

362
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:20,500
 And as far as we know, no one else was reporting these type of incidents, but at the same time, it could have been happening all the time.

363
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 And the military just covers it up.

364
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,500
 They get a new chaplain every two years just so he keeps his mouth shut.

365
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,500
 So did this family do something to make this ghost appear?

366
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 Was the ghost always there and no one else noticed it?

367
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,500
 Was it a new resident? Was it an ancient resident?

368
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 We don't know any of these things and it's the unknowns that make us scared.

369
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,500
 But the chaplain was right. Whatever this ghost was was extremely powerful.

370
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:57,500
 This ghost was manipulating physical items, manifesting itself in front of people, auditory, visual, lighting a candle.

371
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,500
 Which isn't just a show of its power.

372
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:10,500
 When you think about ghost videos, when you watch ghost videos on YouTube, a lot of times it's things falling over, chairs moving.

373
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
 That is a sign of power.

374
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,500
 Knocking over a bag of potato chips is scary, right?

375
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,500
 And if you saw it happen more than once, you would start to think something was up.

376
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,500
 But lighting that candle is more than just showing this is what I can do, this is what I'm capable of.

377
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:30,500
 I'm more than just an orb, I'm more than just a lonely widow staring out of a window since 1849.

378
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:36,500
 Fire burns. Fire kills.

379
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,500
 I have the power to burn this entire building down.

380
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,500
 And I'm showing you that.

381
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:54,500
 I'm letting you know the only reason you are able to move out of this house is because I let you.

382
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 As Emily and Duke looked at that candle burn, they had to know that that candle could have lit itself at any point in the middle of the night.

383
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,500
 That fire could have sparked anywhere in that house.

384
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:19,500
 It could have sparked inside the wall while the children were home alone.

385
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:32,500
 It could have sparked on the stove, a short circuit, unnoticed until late at night when the entire kitchen was ablaze.

386
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,500
 That ghost was sending a signal, "I could have killed you in your sleep.

387
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,500
 I could have taken the lives of your children anytime I wanted to."

388
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:54,500
 The only reason I am letting you live is because you will always fear me.

389
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,500
 You will grow old, your children will move away and have children of their own.

390
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,500
 They will face things in their life, obstacles they will have to overcome.

391
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,500
 But all of you, all of you will always remember.

392
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,500
 There's nothing more scary than me.
