1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
 It's been the dream of everyone who follows the world of the weird

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:10,640
 To come across an ancient spell book and try to learn its secrets and now thanks to a library

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,220
 You can do that online and

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:21,520
 Then we travel to Bismarck, North Dakota a medium-sized town in a desolate state in America

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,820
 But this town has had a string of mysteries cut and then we travel to Bismarck, North Dakota

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,880
 Or a string of missing people all

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,800
 Seemingly unrelated may point to a sinister

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,520
 Conspiracy today on Dead Rabbit Radio

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:52,400
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,440
 I really do hope you guys are having an awesome awesome day. So I'm gonna be taking a week off next week

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,660
 It's my scheduled break. I take every 50 episodes

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,840
 I take a week off, but I put the call out to my patreon supporters. I asked them a question this time

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:16,200
 How would you guys feel about me doing best of episodes where I'm going to re-release some of those classic episodes that you guys may have

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,280
 Missed with a little introduction and that's what we're going to do. They all thought that was a really cool idea

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,880
 So thank you to all of my patreon supporters who voted on that

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,000
 We're so next week. We're gonna have five episodes that are notable in one way or the other

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,280
 Some of them might be my favorite episodes. Some of them may be episodes that I think

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
 Could be more acknowledged. We're gonna re-release the golf rumors episode

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,520
 Which has never fully been available on YouTube the golf rumors episode

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,720
 It's gonna be a lot of the older stuff like I think the newest episode I have is like 120

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,720
 But we're gonna revisit some of those old favorites you've may have missed it

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,040
 And if that seems to go over well with you guys then when I take the week off will do

24
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,120
 Best of episodes. I think that'd be a really cool idea. Let's go ahead though and move on to our first topic

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,640
 We are headed out to the internet. We're just sitting down here computer. No need for a vehicle

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,880
 Just walk over to a computer do it. I'm not gonna continue this podcast until you're sitting at a computer

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,820
 Okay, there you go. Thank you for following my instructions. I appreciate it

28
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,560
 And you're gonna go and you're gonna search for a library

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,540
 Type it in I'm not gonna tell you can check the show notes. What we're gonna do

30
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:32,000
 Actually read the adjustee what we're doing is we were going to Newberry library in Chicago

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,800
 So being now we view this has become a magic school bus episode by the way

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,760
 Now we get sucked into the computer and now we're in the library

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,040
 We're in Newberry library in Chicago. We get mugged immediately upon arriving in Chicago

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,420
 We're like ah should have stayed online and get forced to the ground

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,480
 They take our wallets run out of the library and that was actually the librarian who was mugging us Chicago. It's quite a brutal city

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,380
 But we're here to find three books three spell books

37
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:06,620
 The book of magical charms. That's pretty self-explanatory. You're like, hmm. I wonder what's in that book

38
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:14,620
 It's probably full of magical charms. The other one was cases of conscience concerning witchcraft that one apparently is

39
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,780
 Should we or should we not hang witches? It's I guess in that book. There's a story about a guy going hmm

40
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,480
 Probably shouldn't hung all those women

41
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,320
 The book that's what that is and then the last book it seems odd

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,440
 Seems like an odd title for a magical text and this is one of those things that you could be walking through your library

43
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,580
 You could walk right by it not even know it's magical. It's called the commonplace book the commonplace book

44
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,400
 So all of these books are written in the 1600s. They believe they were all written by the same two people

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,980
 so they're written in a combination of old timey English and

46
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,260
 Latin the pages are all like worn out and yellowed and gross and stuff like that and so Newberry Library

47
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,660
 That rhymes. Oh, why didn't I pick up on that Newberry Library? It doesn't matter. There's been the news. Sorry

48
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,320
 Just thought it was interesting if I ever need a rap lyric. I'm like, yo, I'll take you to the library

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,160
 Oh, then I'll eat you like a new berry. So yeah, like it I got got flows

50
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,560
 What was I saying before the freestyle started? Oh, oh, what no, what was it? Oh, yeah. Yeah, so these books at the library, right?

51
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:24,860
 Newberry Library has that kid not gonna be able to say that anymore without laughing Newberry Library has these books and

52
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,560
 They go we need to help translating these

53
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,340
 Why don't we crowdsource and they actually have a whole website dedicated to crowdsourcing translation?

54
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,560
 So I think this is something they've done before but they have released images of all of these texts online

55
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,840
 You type it into a little text bar at the bottom

56
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,380
 so you can actually translate it in real time and then all of the

57
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,720
 Possible translations goes to a team and they that way you just can't write, you know, like stupid stuff all day long

58
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,180
 They all go to a team and then they figure out. Oh, this is probably the most logical one

59
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,740
 Or let's take this sentence from this one the sentence from another one

60
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,960
 And then that way the books will be available digitally for anyone to read and people have already started

61
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,980
 Translating a lot of this stuff. So this is some of the stuff they've come across

62
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,880
 I love these their spells on how to get rid of a toothache

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,500
 You're like, oh, that's awesome, but they require a dead man's tooth

64
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,220
 Apparently you take the tooth of a dead man, which I mean technically

65
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,980
 You know actually that raises a good question. How how does the spell know if the dude's dead?

66
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,380
 Like if I find a tooth on the ground and the guy's still alive

67
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,980
 Would the spell work?

68
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,060
 if

69
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,220
 So do they do teeth transplants? Let's say that I

70
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,380
 Die and some guy really likes my tooth

71
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,180
 So he takes his tooth out puts my tooth in and then throws his tooth on the ground

72
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:51,020
 This is like what is it the ship of Agamemnon or whatever that philosophers thing if a living man puts a dead

73
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,060
 tooth in his mouth and then throws his tooth on the ground

74
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,980
 Wouldn't the dead man's tooth in his mouth now become part of a living body?

75
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,740
 What if he took his tooth and put it in my dead skull?

76
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,380
 How would the spell ten years later know which one was which?

77
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,980
 But anyways, that's a thought experiment use that at your next dinner party. Hey guys guys

78
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,660
 Sorry to interrupt the conversation, but I have a philosophical question for you. Let's say I find a dead man

79
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,380
 And I need a new tooth also

80
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,980
 They have a spell on how to get rid of the cramp

81
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,060
 Which is not like the awesome name for some new super villain

82
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,980
 It was like the old-timey name for menstrual cramps

83
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:41,100
 So put away your I know you just sketched out the cramp fighting Superman this giant just

84
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,860
 Uncomfortable force punching Superman in the face the cramp is menstrual cramps

85
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,220
 Apparently you take some sort of rag and you just lay it on your thigh

86
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,580
 So there you go ladies try that out and if that doesn't work

87
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,420
 It's fine a dead man pull his tooth out try that as well

88
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:04,380
 Cheat at dice games you're like Jason these are stupid you're telling me that they have these magical texts that I can help translate

89
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,060
 Possibly in the world and you're telling me how to cure two things

90
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,620
 But I have to dig up a human corpse how to fight a menstrual cramp and

91
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,900
 how to

92
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,900
 You know what I'm wondering why

93
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,260
 Here's a question for you. Don't get mad. Don't get mad

94
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,860
 Do super heroes like Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel?

95
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,260
 Men straight

96
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,700
 Now I'm not saying I'm not making a joke. I'm not and I'm not riffing

97
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,140
 I'm not saying like the Legion of dooms like hey guys look out Wonder Woman's menstruating this week

98
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,540
 So she's gonna be super aggressive. I'm not making a joke in the continuity of the comic books

99
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,140
 Has that ever been addressed?

100
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,760
 Has that ever been addressed where you have?

101
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:56,660
 Spider Woman or Captain Marvel or rescue who's the female Iron Man?

102
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,540
 Any of these characters Wonder Woman I already said black canary

103
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,320
 Magic anyone anyone ever said

104
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,820
 There's I have to be a plot point

105
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:13,300
 I'm not saying that the point of the comic book was in Superman has to like fly around the world looking for a tampon for Wonder Woman

106
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,420
 I'm not saying that I'm just saying has it ever been addressed ever in the continuity because some of these characters have been around

107
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,420
 Wonder Woman's been around for what like 50 years at this point

108
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,680
 Captain Marvel has been around since the 1970s the female Captain Marvel

109
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:34,220
 Magic's been around since the early 80s all of these characters. I have they ever once addressed the fact that

110
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:41,980
 They're like my stomach hurts like is that ever been I don't think so I

111
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,800
 Honestly, and it's not a huge seal

112
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,860
 They never announced that when Spider-Man has explosive diarrhea like there's bodily functions

113
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,540
 But there's just weird now that I think about it and I guess it raises question does Wonder Woman even menstruate like being an Amazonian

114
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,700
 She can have children right?

115
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,860
 Like I don't know if she's ever had a kid in like alternate continuity

116
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,820
 But I mean again you're going Jason Deanna Troy did she ever have a I don't know okay?

117
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,140
 Maybe it's just kind of blowing my mind because like you can look say yeah Princess Leia probably has a

118
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,260
 menstruate

119
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,200
 I've already heard the clicks of half of my audience just be like nope

120
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,900
 No, wait for tomorrow's episode. This is way too much the way too much

121
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,900
 Yeah, I just wanted to hear about spell books and I was talking about I don't think it's a shameful thing that women have

122
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,840
 Menstruation or periods. I don't know why they don't mention it

123
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,300
 but I guess because it's just this natural thing that happens, but I guess that

124
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,640
 You people don't people don't want to read about it people don't want to have like Wonder Woman being like

125
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:53,000
 After I defeat evil then I have to go to the grocery store real quick because I don't like where would she even carry her tampons at in her costume?

126
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,180
 Like she doesn't have a purse

127
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,980
 Her plane is invisible

128
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:05,580
 You would just see her flying by and then some maxi pads just like floating where the glove you assume the glove compartment would be

129
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:12,820
 I mean she flies an invisible jet. So I'm just I guess they just never menstruate. I guess female characters never menstruate

130
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:21,380
 But you would assume you wouldn't assume that none of these fictional characters ever go to the bathroom at all like spider-man is just full of

131
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,820
 feces from

132
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:31,120
 1963 to today he's never pooped like you assume those characters pooped so you would assume the female characters would also menstruate

133
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,380
 But yeah, just weird

134
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
 Yes

135
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,940
 Let's get back to spell books

136
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,140
 So yes, yes you with me - you're done fast forwarding. Okay, perfect

137
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,620
 You can also cheat at dice. Don't fast forward yet. I got some good spells. They also have spells on summoning spirits

138
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:57,820
 You can conjure up an ancient demon using this spellbook and it was all like really weird language

139
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,540
 Well, I mean love it was Latin

140
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,580
 I thought about reading on the podcast, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it

141
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,860
 It also teaches you how to invoke the seal of Solomon, which I should actually do an

142
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,180
 episode on Solomon King Solomon

143
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,500
 biblical figure

144
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:21,020
 And you guys are like great not another one of those episodes, but but hey, he's it's like it's one of those things like in the Bible

145
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:26,020
 He's like I chopped that baby in half and people are like no no don't chop the baby in half and he's like

146
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,820
 I've done good work today. I found out who the real mother is. That's how people kind of know King Solomon

147
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:41,240
 Why is this man his big biblical figure? What a lot of people aren't aware of is that apparently he had a ring and a seal that allowed

148
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,340
 him to

149
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:50,460
 Control demons like actual like Satan like fallen angels who who sided against God with Lucifer go to hell

150
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:57,560
 Solomon King Solomon somehow figured out to turn them into slaves and had them build these great works and work

151
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,540
 It's a slaves. They're like mining gold for him like not like go get me some gold as Riyadh and

152
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,300
 Comes give him gold. He's like ball Barath you grab this pickaxe

153
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,960
 to put on this little miners hat and dig for five weeks in a row and demons like

154
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,300
 That's an interesting story

155
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,420
 I'll see if I can dig more information up on it

156
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,940
 But anyway, so you too if you have this book if you can translate this section or actually this parts translated

157
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,660
 You can just read it. You can invoke the seal of Solomon get some nice demon slaves. I'm not recommending doing that

158
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:37,940
 Not do not get a bunch of demon slaves end up getting possessed and going to prison for doing awful things and saying

159
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,460
 But dead rabbit radio told me to don't mess with it

160
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,180
 But I'm just saying that according to this book there you can do it, but don't

161
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:53,180
 Don't don't is what I'm saying is I can already tell you guys are googling Newberry Library. You're like, I need some demon slaves

162
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,700
 Let's go ahead

163
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,340
 But yeah, if you know any Latin or old-timey English or you just want to spend a fun rainy afternoon

164
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,740
 summoning dark spirits to completely ruin your life or

165
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,940
 Simply getting rid of a toothache. You follow the show notes

166
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,260
 You'll be able to go down there or just Google Newberry Library

167
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:15,060
 Actually go to the show notes because when I went to Newberry Library took me a bit of time to find that actual section if you go through

168
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,620
 The show notes it will take you directly to the translation part of those books

169
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,940
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next topic. We're walking out of Newberry Library. See you guys later

170
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,420
 librarians are like

171
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,780
 Spending our money throwing it up in the air. They're like making it rain with other people's money. We're like, ah

172
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,980
 So I don't have any money. I'm assuming you don't have any money either you had if you had a second wallet

173
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,060
 You go I know traveling with Jason is quite dangerous. We've been assaulted. He's pushed me in a pile of poop before

174
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,660
 I got my second wall with is wrapped in a ziploc baggie in case I get pushed in a poop again

175
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,540
 I'm like awesome. So we are traveling your pain. We're traveling to Bismarck, North Dakota

176
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,740
 So let's buy some private plane tickets like Jason. Can't we just fly commercial?

177
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,900
 Did I ever do the story of actually about that guy that minister? I think it was um

178
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:13,900
 One of the big televangelists and I don't know if I covered this yet. He said I was about to make a joke about it

179
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,140
 there was this

180
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,660
 Televangelist minister who won't fly commercial planes. He had to buy private jets and

181
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,200
 They asked why and he said because a flying a commercial plane is a tube of full of demons

182
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,700
 Like that's where all the demons fly commercial. So he needed a private jet. I should I don't think I've covered that story

183
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:41,440
 That's the story. That's basically all it is some weirdo saying something and they asked him to clarify that and he wasn't saying like

184
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,980
 Everyone on a commercial jet is a demon, but demons always fly commercial jets

185
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,980
 So it's one of those weird things

186
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,300
 So anyways, he flies private jet. He has like two or three private jet

187
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,900
 Anyways, we're flying private because I don't want to be stuck in a tube full of demons

188
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,460
 You're like considering we just talked about evoking them definitely risk

189
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:06,500
 So yes, you spend your life savings or maybe you're allowance. I don't know how rich you are to get us a private jet

190
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,420
 We're flying up to Bismarck, North Dakota, and we're going back in time. This is a really really fan-saving

191
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,180
 currency jet. We're going back in time. That's why I got you your life savings. We're going back in time to the year

192
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,740
 1989 so

193
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
 So Bobby Brown is humping around

194
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,640
 Ace of Base is a few years away, and we are in Fargo, North Dakota. It's February 26th

195
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:35,700
 1989 and there's this dude named Roy Hagel. He's 38 years old. He's from Bismarck, North Dakota. He's in Fargo

196
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:43,020
 He's at a bowling tournament, and this is the last time he has seen a life, but not the last time he's ever heard of

197
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,980
 Because on March 6th, he calls a buddy from Arizona. So he's in Fargo, North Dakota

198
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,540
 Then what 12 days later? He's in Arizona. He calls up his buddy in Bismarck his hometown

199
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,420
 He goes listen. I've been to nine states in nine days, and I'm out of money, but you know, I'm gonna I'm gonna get back to

200
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,860
 Bismarck. I'm headed back to Bismarck, but he's like, okay. Yeah, come back here. Odd phone call to make

201
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,980
 Four days later though, his car is found at Death Valley Monument

202
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,640
 So the it's exactly what it sounds like. It's Death Valley. It's the place you don't want to go

203
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:26,740
 We've covered it before and the very least it's a complete wasteland full of heat and vultures and buzzards and

204
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,500
 Wiley Coyote and Roadrunner at the most there's been stories of hidden civilizations underneath that

205
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,580
 But his car is found there

206
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,020
 He's not

207
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,140
 They see when authorities get to the car the keys

208
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:48,620
 And his wallet are in the front seat and as you see me steal his wallet, you're like

209
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,080
 Shaking your finger at me. I'm like, dude. I don't got any money those librarians. I take his wallet

210
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,060
 We also see because now we're there with the investigators. There is footprints leading away from this car

211
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,420
 Now what's interesting is the news reports don't say

212
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,940
 the state of the car

213
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:11,300
 And I'm not saying this so the news reports don't really say what the state of the car is as in that a breakdown

214
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
 Was it out of gas? Who knows but

215
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,580
 We see this car and there's footprints leading away from it and

216
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,940
 We and the authorities follow the footprints for six miles

217
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,180
 and then

218
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,620
 Just an arid desert

219
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,660
 Nothing past six miles, which is quite a long journey. I don't I wonder if they followed them on feet or if at a certain point

220
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,700
 They're like, yeah, let's go get the car. Let's just drive alongside these things

221
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,860
 Now the police were looking into this there was one suspicious thing

222
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:49,780
 He's never been seen since the police are still investigating this there was one suspicious thing when Roy was a child his father disappeared

223
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,020
 came back and

224
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,020
 Then disappeared for good never saw him again

225
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,220
 People thought maybe he was trying to emulate his father

226
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,340
 Maybe he was trying to start a new life and that may be true

227
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:05,900
 If you do decide to leave it all behind to start a new life don't start it in the direction of a desert

228
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,740
 Don't be like hmm

229
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,260
 Fortune is that way and you're like walking into

230
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:18,740
 Doom like hmm. I wonder what's over the next ridge. It's a volcano like if you're gonna start a new life start it in Iowa or

231
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,460
 San Diego or something

232
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,460
 Never been found since

233
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,860
 1994 August 2nd, so he was from Bismarck. He was headed back to Bismarck

234
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,220
 He went on this weird nine-state and nine-day journey August 2nd

235
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,340
 1994 we're in the city of Bismarck now

236
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,940
 Michelle Joulson

237
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,340
 She's hanging out

238
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,340
 She has a job as she worked at like a casino. She goes. Hey, I got a little baby got a little baby boy here

239
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,020
 I'm gonna drop you off with your grandpa and I gotta go take care of some business

240
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,380
 I gotta go get a paycheck and maybe I'll play a little dice

241
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,880
 Maybe I'll go to the casino a little bit and the little three-year-old's like yay. I'll see you mommy

242
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,020
 I you're not gonna disappear, right? And she mommy's like no that was dark. That was super dark

243
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:09,300
 Baby's like what does dark mean? Mom's like just just ignore it ignore this of this insensitive

244
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,780
 Podcasts and she takes the baby to grandpa and says can you watch the baby? I gotta pay up this paycheck

245
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,300
 Grandpa's like yeah, are you guys also has a baby voice?

246
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:26,180
 Are you going to come back or are you going to disappear? And mom's like why does the people keep asking me that I'll be fine

247
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,780
 But she's not she disappears

248
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:35,220
 She's never seen again and she's reported missing within hours like she says I'm gonna go do this paycheck

249
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,580
 I'm gonna go play bingo not cards not dice. Sorry misspoke totally

250
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,620
 And I'm sure right when I said that people go mafia. Yep. She's gonna get abducted by the mafia. No, there's no bingo mafia

251
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,060
 There's no blue-haired mafia there might be actually actually that'd be a good idea for like a really terrible

252
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:58,060
 Comedy starring Melissa McCarthy where you have this bingo hall

253
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:03,320
 That is like being run poorly you have a bingo hall

254
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,420
 That's kind of like in disrepair Melissa McCarthy comes in to drop her mom off and she realizes

255
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,360
 Well, we can make a lot of money doing this stuff like if we took a little bit off the top

256
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,980
 But first we have to make this place look better

257
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,620
 So it starts off like a lovable comedy where there's a busy like there's a there's like a bloodthirsty businessman

258
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,700
 played by

259
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,620
 The Rock in his first role as a villain

260
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,780
 He's trying to tear down the bingo hall and Melissa McCarthy has to hold like bake sales

261
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,980
 But like some stupid old woman puts a bunch of her son's weed in the brownies

262
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,620
 So everyone's tripping out and then they hold like a bikini car wash

263
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,960
 So there's like this montage of all these 80 year old women spraying cars down with hoses and stuff

264
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,140
 Like that and it starts off like a little rascals and that's not in the little rascals

265
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,860
 But it's I hope it's not a little rascals

266
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:58,200
 it starts off as that type of comedy or these guys are trying to beat this businessman and then about say

267
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,060
 45 minutes an hour into the movie

268
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,440
 You're like just get back to them. It's same people

269
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,140
 45 minutes to an hour into the movie the Rock admits defeat and

270
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:16,160
 Falls in love with an old woman at the bingo hall. So like his character arc comes full stop because I don't know why I was trying to

271
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,840
 Tear did my my great grandma used to play here. Not that's not the woman. He's dating

272
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,480
 It's not the only day my great grandma used to play here and but I found true love with this 80 year old woman

273
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,680
 Everything's going to work out and then the last half hour is Melissa McCarthy

274
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:38,440
 Like becoming like straight up casino level mobster like chopping old people's fingers off if they can't make their bingo bills

275
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,200
 Just like dunking their heads and like hot jars of my lanta. She's like how's your stomach now?

276
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,380
 And it becomes just like this brutal the first hour

277
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,800
 You're clapping and laughing at like stoned old women and bikinis

278
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:59,380
 And then the ending is her like forcing old with selling old women into sexual slavery and you're just like

279
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,440
 And it would be called the movie would just be called

280
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,220
 bingo with a

281
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,040
 Exclamation point and the bottom of the exclamation point is a bingo number

282
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,240
 So everyone's like oh this is gonna be look like like a total romp

283
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,920
 And then it just ends and it ends with Melissa McCarthy shot of Melissa McCarthy sitting on a throne made out of bingo cards

284
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,400
 That's just and then it just there's no credits the movie just ends

285
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,640
 So anyways I

286
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,200
 Make that movie Hollywood make that movie anyways

287
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,920
 Michelle Juleson is missing and

288
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
 And she's never seen again

289
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,080
 they

290
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,160
 Find her on August and that happened on August 2nd on August 8th

291
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,760
 They find her car at a comfort Inn in Bismarck and they

292
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,000
 They had been looking for the car from the beginning and one of the

293
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,140
 Detectives on the case was no one for finding stolen cars like that like just really really good at tracking stuff down

294
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,540
 And he said I don't believe that car was there

295
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,780
 He goes I can't say for sure that we specifically checked that parking lot of that comfort Inn

296
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:10,000
 But I'm almost for sure that that car was not there on August 2nd because again like I said they started

297
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,360
 They reported her missing after hours

298
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,640
 Her car had nothing in it except for a half eaten gas station sandwich

299
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,560
 And one thing the detectives thought was weird they found scoria

300
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,560
 Which is like a pumice type rock in the intake manifold of the car

301
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,520
 So it's kind like this car was driving in an area with a lot of scoria

302
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,700
 There is not a lot of scoria in Bismarck. There is scoria in North Dakota

303
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,060
 There's scoria all over but an interesting place where there's a lot of scoria

304
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:45,660
 DeFallee and you're like Jason come on seriously these these missing people took place years apart

305
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,620
 One wasn't even in the city of Bismarck. He was from the city of Bismarck and

306
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,420
 There's scoria all over the United States. Why are you even connecting these two?

307
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,620
 It's kind of bizarre not to that I say

308
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,860
 November 16th 1996

309
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:09,880
 Bismarck, North Dakota now North Dakota in 1996 had a population of 54,000 people and I was looking at this and they do have

310
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,640
 couple hundred missing people every year, but the majority of them are

311
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,040
 Found right away and then there's maybe like 20 or 30 where the detectives have to do some sort of follow-up

312
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,840
 And then these cases have never been solved

313
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,660
 The story of Roy Hagel the story of Michelle and the story I'm about to tell you of Sandra Mary Jacobson and

314
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,820
 John Jacobson her five-year-old son

315
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:41,340
 She is headed to Bismarck to go to dinner with her mom. She's in a neighboring town

316
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,860
 She's driving to Bismarck and she calls the police in Bismarck 911. What's your emergency? I?

317
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:52,100
 Was just driving through

318
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,600
 Center Center, North Dakota and

319
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:11,680
 I saw a ritual I saw a ritual it I mean I don't know it looked it looks satanic it

320
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:19,120
 There's something wrong out here that I swear there's a bunch of sane worshipers out here

321
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
 And they were having a ritual and I saw them

322
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,580
 And I don't know if they saw me, but I saw them

323
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:33,380
 I'm not in center anymore. I'm headed to Bismarck. I'm gonna go see my mom, but I think there's something bad going on out here in center

324
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,500
 Now the police

325
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,540
 Go that's really bizarre and they say

326
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,620
 Why didn't you call the police in center? Why are you calling?

327
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:50,740
 Bismarck is 40 miles away from center. You go. Why don't you call the police in center and she says I don't trust

328
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:57,640
 Police in center and I don't trust the police that are closer to them as well. I trust you guys because I think

329
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:04,480
 They may be part of it. I think there's a conspiracy you see there's just satanic conspiracy. I

330
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,080
 don't trust them

331
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,320
 Sandra does have

332
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:16,240
 According to articles it doesn't go into specifics, but I think we can imagine it says she has issues with mental health

333
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,100
 So that could be she has full-blown delusions about things

334
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,900
 It could be anxiety or depression

335
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,820
 Both of those would be considered a whole plethora of other symptoms would be considered mental health issues

336
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:35,400
 Someone who is constantly anxious or depressed would be listed as having mental health issues as is someone who had

337
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,220
 schizophrenia or

338
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:43,460
 manic or manic depressive bipolar stuff like it's all in that umbrella. So we just hear words like

339
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,660
 mental health issues not necessarily mental illness

340
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,280
 But when she got to her mother's house her mom immediately

341
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,240
 Could tell something was wrong with her daughter

342
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,760
 In the mind that which makes me think that the mental health issues are a little more serious than she just has clinical depression

343
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,200
 But the mom realizes something's wrong with the daughter and the mom says we need to go to the hospital

344
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,280
 Let's go to the hospital. Just get you checked out. It's not gonna be a big deal. Everything's fine

345
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,520
 And the daughter goes okay we go to the hospital

346
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:19,060
 But can I get gas put gas in my car first the mom goes sure the daughter Sandra puts her five-year-old son in her car

347
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,420
 Drives to go get gas. She is seen putting gas in her car

348
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:29,900
 But all of that happened about 730

349
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,580
 She goes to get gas the mom's at home by 10 p.m

350
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,340
 She calls the police and says my daughter and my grandson are missing and again

351
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,440
 Let this and the story of Michelle be a a

352
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:51,120
 Wake-up call for you. You do not under any circumstances have to wait 24 hours to report a missing person

353
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,520
 That is not true. That is probably one of the biggest

354
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,880
 Dumbest myths that have ever come out of Hollywood honestly. I think that has cost people their lives

355
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,120
 It's a narrative device in stories to make the characters go out and search

356
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,980
 Instead of having a massive police force and do the search that is an adventures and babysitting plot device

357
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:18,100
 That is not real life. If you believe someone is missing you can call police

358
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:23,620
 Very very quickly. It's not you will never call up in the police go you got away 24 hours

359
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:31,060
 That is 100% an invention of Hollywood and I think it's probably one of the most destructive myths out of Hollywood

360
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,800
 She goes missing the next day her car is found at Centennial Beach, North Dakota

361
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:43,060
 No Sandra no John and yes Centennial Beach is at a river

362
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,060
 so the cops get there and

363
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,500
 they go

364
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,400
 We're looking for this missing person the mom said she had some mental health issues

365
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,840
 She parked by a river

366
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,480
 No one's in the car

367
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,500
 They couldn't search the river at the time the weather was bad were in November. It's North Dakota and

368
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,340
 It's a raging river and they go if the bodies went into the river. We'll never find them

369
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,420
 The car is found

370
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,700
 With a door wide open

371
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:24,760
 Keys in the ignition purse on the seat

372
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,060
 These three cases have all taken place

373
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,600
 Seven years apart

374
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,340
 We had 89 94 and now 96 and they were all linked in quite a few autoways

375
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,560
 all the victims are

376
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,720
 Related to Bismarck Bismarck in North Dakota

377
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,440
 All of the victims one of the main things found about them is their vehicle. They're not getting snatched out of their house

378
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,120
 Their vehicle is in a location where it normally would not be

379
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,640
 All of them had items left on the driver's side seat

380
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,280
 two of them specifically keys and

381
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,280
 Purse wallet where they carry their money

382
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,560
 These articles the the reason why I came across these three cases

383
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,740
 These were written in an article called missing person cases are not forgotten. It was written by a reporter named Jenny Michael

384
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,300
 She wrote this in February 22nd 2008 and it's really the last

385
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:30,900
 Recorded article about these three cases. I've seen follow-up articles on one of the case or the other case

386
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,600
 But only this article ever put all three of them together

387
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:40,680
 Originally, I was looking up the story of Sandra Jacobson and I found this article and I was like it's just a missing story

388
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,920
 It has the satanic Colton it it'll be interesting and as I was researching it

389
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,760
 I came across this article and we start to see these connections coincidences

390
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,320
 sure

391
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,540
 Sure a woman who has a mental health issue sees a satanic Colt

392
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:06,660
 Performing some sort of ritual and has enough interaction with law enforcement in her area. She doesn't trust them. She thinks they're part of the conspiracy

393
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,780
 So right there you go, she's just having some mental health issues

394
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:18,720
 But when we have a string of missing people who have these coincidences who have these similarities

395
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,480
 Disappear off the face of the earth never to be found

396
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:30,820
 All with abandoned vehicles all with items on their seat all either headed to or living in Bismarck

397
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:36,340
 I'm not saying I do as a normal practice. I do not

398
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:42,520
 Take to heart what people say in the throes of panic and a woman's frantic 911 call

399
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,860
 while she's driving through North Dakota talking about seeing a satanic ritual and a

400
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,340
 County-wide conspiracy. It's not something that you would normally put a lot of faith in

401
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,860
 But when you have a total of four missing people

402
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,900
 possibly connected and

403
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:06,460
 Then you have stories of a satanic Colt operating in

404
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,420
 North Dakota

405
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,580
 There's a difference between being afraid of coincidences and

406
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,220
 having a little bit of common sense

407
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,940
 So if you live in the city of Bismarck or

408
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,740
 anywhere in the middle of nowhere

409
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,740
 Be a little more careful

410
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,020
 Because we don't know why any of these people disappeared

411
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,820
 They could be completely random completely unrelated and just tragic circumstances or

412
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:40,460
 They could have stumbled on to a dark secret in the middle of the night

413
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,460
 They could have known too much

414
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:50,820
 And they just had to disappear before they said too much

415
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:56,820
