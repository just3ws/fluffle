00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 Two men driving down a lonely road see something that adds a new wrinkle to the myth of Bigfoot.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,360
 And then we meet a man who believes that the government is covering up the existence of UFO

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:21,840
 and he will do anything to expose the government's lives. Even murder. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,680
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,920
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys have an awesome

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,640
 plan this weekend. Go out and do something. I've started lifting weights again man. It feels so

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,720
 good just moving my body. I'm not walking as much as I used to. It's kind of like it's kind of messing

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,680
 with my head so I have to figure out ways to be active at home and I just feel so much energy when

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,560
 you just pick stuff up and put it down and then you pick up heavier stuff and put them down. So if

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,200
 you guys aren't physically active I really recommend it. It's as much physical activity as you guys can

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,480
 do. Everyone has different levels but it helps your mood so much. It really really helps my mood.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,000
 Even doing the little bit of weightlifting that I do. I also want to say we're getting ready to wrap

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 up season 11. So next week is the last episode before my week off. My well-deserved week off. I

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 take a week off every 50 some odd episodes where I do nothing dead-rabbit-radio related. A ghost could

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,720
 show up at my apartment and I would just be reading a magazine. A non-paranormal magazine and I'd be

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,400
 like "Hey bro, can you come back in a couple days?" Because I'm exhausted and the ghost is like "Sure."

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,360
 So get ready for that next week. It's going to be the last week. I'm going to take a week off. We'll

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,560
 be back for season 12. Now let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,800
 Thomas Redacted. Thank you so much for supporting the show. Continuing to support the show really

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,680
 really helps out a lot. You're going to be our captain, our commander this episode. If you cancel

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,760
 part of the Patreon, I totally understand. Just help get the word out about the show. You guys

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,880
 don't understand how much that helps the show grow. Word of mouth is the number one way to get

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,320
 new people to try out a show. So that it would be amazing and it saves me advertising money. And I

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,360
 spend no money on advertising. So if you guys get the word out and you guys have been, the show

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,960
 has been growing. It's been awesome. But if you can't support the show financially and I know a

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,000
 lot of people can't, that's totally fine. Just spread the word about the show. Thomas Redacted.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,960
 He's all dressed up like a little FBI agent. He's a cute little FBI agent. Has a little badge. He has

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,720
 a little trench coat on. Thomas Redacted. We are going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:49,520
 We're going to go for a drive to Beaverton, Oregon. Car is driving down the road. It's

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,840
 nighttime. It's the spookiest time of not day. It's the spookiest time, right? There's sun. That's

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,240
 not spooky. And then nighttime. Super spooky. So Thomas is driving us down this road. We're in

32
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:08,000
 Beaverton, Oregon. It's October. Spookiest month too. Bad combination October night. October 1992.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,600
 We're driving down Cornelius Pass, which is a road in Beaverton. There's a dude and his friend.

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,320
 We're going to call the main dude Russell and his friend will be Bernie. And they're driving down the

35
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,520
 road. Everything's going normal, right? Trees on both sides of the road. Spooky spooky owls.

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,720
 They're being followed by a car driven by an FBI agent and a bunch of podcast listeners.

37
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,560
 And that's not super alarming. But what is alarming is as the road starts to hit a turn,

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,680
 you got to slow down for that turn. So they're slowing their car down to make the turn safely.

39
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,960
 And that's when their headlights hit something. Walking across the road in front of them.

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,240
 It was a Sasquatch. It was a hairy creature walking around Oregon. And there's been a ton of

41
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,120
 Bigfoot sightings in Oregon and Washington. It's kind of the home of Bigfoot. But this Bigfoot

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,400
 was only four feet tall. So you go, oh, it was a baby Bigfoot. We've talked about those. We've

43
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,160
 even talked about Babyfoot, which are known to be in Oregon. But no. As their car is slowing down

44
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,200
 and their headlights are illuminating the road in front of them, they see this Sasquatch. He's only

45
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,000
 four feet tall. And his arms are so long, even though it's standing up straight, they're dragging

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,240
 across the concrete. That's probably the noise he's making because his knuckle cert. They said

47
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,720
 that his face was incredibly ugly. That's actually a quote, incredibly ugly. More than just normally

48
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,480
 ugly. But other than this being a relatively small Bigfoot. Also Bigfoot tends to not to drag his

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,400
 knuckles on the ground. But rather than this being some sort of hairy monstrosity walking around

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,920
 Oregon, you kind of put two and two together and say it's Bigfoot. There's some very, very creepy

51
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,080
 accrued tourmant to this cryptid. That's how you use that word. This four foot tall,

52
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,600
 hairy, incredibly ugly creature knuckles dragging across the ground is wearing a pointy hat,

53
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,000
 like a dunce cap. You think in a gnome? You might think that too. Gnomes don't tend to be four feet

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,920
 tall, but it was also wearing tattered clothing. They could see the remnants of a shirt of pants,

55
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,360
 but they were just rags at this point. It's crossing the road. It's staring at them.

56
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,320
 And it continues to walk across the road like they're not even there. And that's when they

57
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:47,040
 notice this creature is also wearing a backpack. Dragging its knuckles, it crosses the street

58
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,440
 and disappears into the forest on the other side. That's a hiker. I don't see any hiker out there

59
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:01,600
 who's four feet tall with giant arms. I'm seeing. That is a hiker who got lost and is turning into

60
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,120
 something. We've seen cryptids that wear clothes before, but they're usually some sort of like

61
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,200
 demon. There's some sort of like illusionist type things, a river nymph that we'll have a dress on.

62
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,160
 We've even come across Bigfoot's before, Sasquatch's that have had clothing on before, the one who

63
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,800
 was attacking all the Amish people. That was quite a long time ago, but he was wearing raggedy

64
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,720
 clothes. I did a story about a man who was attacked by aliens. He was with a group of people and

65
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,520
 aliens were flying around and he started going crazy and tearing at his clothes and his friends

66
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,560
 had to hold him down as he was trying to run off into the woods. And at that point, I also made

67
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,840
 the observation that maybe he was turning into a Bigfoot. There was also Bigfoot's in the area.

68
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,680
 They had seen these large silhouettes. I wasn't just like, oh, aliens show up. You go crazy. You're

69
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,800
 a Bigfoot. There was already Sasquatch noises and silhouettes around the farm. If I remember that

70
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:03,440
 story correctly. This is somebody who's transforming into something. This is a hiker who has gone missing.

71
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,680
 One of those stories where you never find the body. Just a tragedy for the family and the friends of

72
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,400
 the hiker. This is someone who's shifting into something. And actually is probably long past

73
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,960
 the point of no return. Because the clothes are so tattered and the expression so blank on its face.

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,200
 This isn't someone who had just recently gone missing and was in the midst of a transformation.

75
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:37,600
 This was someone who for months or years was slowly becoming a beast. The only things that

76
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,960
 would make you think that it was still human would be the clothing and the backpack. Was this a hiker

77
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 who got cursed out in the middle of the woods? Was this a mountain man who had a run in with a

78
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,160
 Bigfoot? And while he thought he was observing this natural phenomenon, the alien craft silently

79
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,720
 floating above him had other plans. Or is this the case of a man finding a hat in the middle of the

80
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:14,640
 woods? A little cone sitting there. A lost remnant of a witch's curse. Of a gnome's mischievous magic.

81
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:22,720
 And this man out of curiosity who wouldn't put on a hat that they find? I mean if you're worried

82
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
 about lice you might not. But you figure in the middle of the woods there's no lice in the middle

83
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,280
 of the woods. I don't think right? You might have a couple ticks in it. You find a dunce cap in the

84
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,200
 middle of the woods and as a joke you put it on, you can't wait to get back to the campsite, show

85
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,960
 it to your family. Some neat little trinket you found out hiking. But you never make it back to

86
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:52,400
 the campsite. You find yourself wandering further and further away from civilization. This isn't

87
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,360
 just a hat. It melts your mind. It changes your body. The human that the rescue team is looking for

88
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:07,120
 no longer exists. You are now just a beast wandering the wilderness. The last pieces identifying you

89
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:14,480
 as human, your clothing, your backpack, are slowly rotting away. Someday people will just think

90
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,120
 you're a beast. A naked gorilla-like creature walking through the woods of Oregon. And when

91
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,240
 the transformation is fully complete that hat may fall off of this creature's head. And sit there

92
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,920
 alone in the forest of Oregon waiting for someone else to show up and be curious enough to put that

93
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,520
 hat on their head. I thought that was a really creepy story. Obviously everything I said after

94
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:48,480
 the story was conjectured. This was from Paranormal Story Archive December 2001. And it was cataloged.

95
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,640
 I found it on ThinkAboutItDocs.com which is a great resource. I go there all the time.

96
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,240
 Everything I said after the initial story is conjecture, but there's just so many elements.

97
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,360
 I- I- This is the type of story I actually find really unsettling. It was just a Sasquatch walking

98
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,920
 across the road. I would have blazed right past it. Never would have told you guys it. But when we

99
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,280
 see that bridging between the human civilized world and the monstrous world like this, it really

100
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,680
 makes me think that a lot of creature sightings, especially bigfoot sightings, they may actually

101
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:26,000
 be humans who have been transformed in one way or the other. Thomas calling that carpenter

102
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,320
 copter. He's all hiding behind a tree. Everyone's hiding behind a tree. What? What? No, it's solely

103
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,280
 fine. Come on out. I got hats. Hats for everyone. Dead rabbit radio hats. You can buy one. Put

104
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,040
 them on. You slowly become a monster, but you're my monster. So that's all cool. But I guess I don't

105
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,920
 want a bunch of monsters running around. Thomas, I coax you out from behind the tree. Call in that

106
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:54,720
 carpenter. We are headed out to Long Island. Helicopters leaving behind Oregon. We're flying

107
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,400
 out. Thomas isn't afraid to put on the pilot's helmet. I was like, dude, you're not going to

108
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,640
 turn into a helicopter. Just put on the helmet. I'd have that be cool if he turned into a helicopter

109
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,320
 than I'd have two of them. He's like, what? Don't listen to me. You put on your helmet,

110
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,920
 you have to. We're flying out to Long Island. Now, I also found this story. I just read a ton of

111
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,560
 stuff all the time, and I've really loved the way stuff is formatted on. Think about it, docs.com.

112
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,680
 When I was reading this story, I saw an interesting note. So the website is just all these lists of

113
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,200
 stories by dates. This story started off with a four letter word, the four letter word,

114
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:37,200
 in the paranormal community. Hoax. The article says hoax November 24th 1992 South Haven National

115
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,480
 Park Long Island, New York. A large metallic cylinder shaped craft with glowing blue ends

116
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,760
 reportedly exploded over Long Island. Wreckage debris and some fragments of the humanoids

117
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,400
 were recovered at the above site. Fire teams, police and secret service were involved.

118
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,760
 The remains of the craft and its occupants were moved to Wright Patterson, which is an air force

119
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,400
 base. So says hoax. And I'm thinking that actually piques my interest more than anything. Yes,

120
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,080
 US military or any world military shooting down UFOs. That's interesting. But you'd be surprised

121
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,160
 how many of those reports are out there. I don't really cover them much because there's just kind

122
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,080
 of a dead end. The Armenian Air Force shoots down a disc, the Russian Air Force shoots down a disc,

123
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,880
 and they just kind of go, they shoot down the disc, villagers. It sounds exciting, but the

124
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,080
 stories just kind of end. And they're all exactly the same. So when this one was labeled as a hoax,

125
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,400
 I was actually really intrigued by it. So I began looking at the story of John Ford.

126
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,400
 This story is excellent on two different ways. One, we get to look at this man John Ford and

127
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,840
 his escapades too. I've talked about this before on the show. The way that paranormal

128
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,880
 researchers and UFO researchers were treated is radically different than they're treated today.

129
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,920
 And there's an article in the Washington Post called "Out There" written by Michael Colton.

130
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,560
 And it's a very, very well written article. I got a bulk of my information from this article,

131
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,240
 but I'm going to read some passages from it to show you the difference of how people are treated

132
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,480
 today versus back when this article was written. When I was growing up, it was a totally different

133
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,720
 world for paranormal researchers. Let's go back to the 1980s. We got on our pastel suits who were

134
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,440
 ready to walk around New York City. It's a crime written hellhole at this time. So get your switch

135
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,240
 blades ready. We're going to duke it out with the sharks and the jets and the bloods and the grips.

136
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:38,160
 John Ford, he's the chairman of the Long Island UFO Network. There's 400 people involved in this

137
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,200
 organization. That's huge, especially for back then. In 1988, one of his nemeses was the Long

138
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,640
 Island Brookhaven National Laboratory. That sounds like something out of a superhero comic book.

139
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,200
 Brookhaven sounds spooky. So when you have this building, known as the Long Island Brookhaven

140
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,240
 National Laboratory, it draws the attention of the UFOologists in the area. In 1988 is really when

141
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,440
 John Ford jumped 10 toes into this thing. Previously, he was a bailiff, the local courthouse,

142
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,280
 and he really wanted to be a politician. He was this weird dichotomy, and you run into him every

143
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:22,880
 once in a while. He was conservative, and he hated Republicans. But he had to work within those halls

144
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,560
 of power to make it as a politician. But when you're conservative and you hate the people that

145
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,080
 you're trying to get to vote for you, it doesn't really work out well. So as much as he wanted

146
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,080
 to be a politician, his dreams are always stymied. We're going to put a little pin in that for a

147
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:45,840
 second. He becomes this devoted UFO researcher. He really believes like he's so close to finding

148
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,440
 the truth. And because he believes that he's close to finding the truth, he also begins this delusion

149
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
 that the government is after him. The government is actively going after him. And that wouldn't

150
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,520
 make sense because he's beefing with actual politicians. Every time he loses an election,

151
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,320
 every time he loses a debate, he could think the government is in on it, because he's actively

152
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,680
 working against the halls of power, i.e. he's trying to be a politician as well. When your local

153
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,560
 garbage man thinks the government's after him, it's probably not true. When you're actually

154
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,960
 running for government, the chances go up that there's government forces looking to stymie you,

155
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,680
 because they are being controlled by the people in power and you're trying to get them out of power.

156
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,200
 1989, Morchis Bay, Long Island. There's glowing lights in the sky one night.

157
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:46,720
 Ford goes out and he starts interviewing locals. And he pieces together this story

158
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,920
 that there was a UFO flying over Morchis Bay. And the US government goes, "Go, go, go, in these

159
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:04,400
 helicopters. Go flying off over the night sky." Shootin' missiles at it. UFO doesn't know what to

160
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,120
 do. It's just sittin' there. It's advanced warp technology. Doesn't work for some reason. The

161
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,360
 missiles impact with this saucer, blowing it to pieces. The remnants of the vehicle crash into the

162
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:25,600
 water. US military sends in special forces to recover 17 alien corpses. Those bodies are taken to

163
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,360
 Brookhaven. He's announcing the story. He's telling people this is what happened. We actually had

164
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,400
 military versus alien combat right in Long Island, guys. Like, "Isn't that convenient? I

165
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,960
 haven't been here and I believe in aliens and that happened." The official story was, yes,

166
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,840
 there were helicopters flying over the bay that night. And yes, there were glowing lights. But

167
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,520
 this is the official story. There were helicopters dropping flares because there was a sinking ship.

168
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:01,760
 And they wanted the rescue ships to know where that ship was. November 24th, 1992,

169
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,400
 South Haven National Park, Long Island. We're walking up to the park and there's a guard standing

170
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,720
 there and he's like, "Stop! You guys can't come in here." And we're like, "What? We just want to see.

171
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,080
 We want to go to the National Park." We heard there's like trees and stuff. He's like, "You're

172
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,960
 right. This is the only place left that has a tree, but you can't come in here. You got to go to

173
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:27,040
 some other state park." Why not? He goes, "Because it's closed." And we go, "Why is it closed? Why are

174
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,640
 you closed?" John Ford hops out of a bush and signals us over. We walk over to him and he goes,

175
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,240
 "Listen, I'm going to tell you guys the truth of why this place is closed." There was a cylinder

176
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:46,320
 shaped craft with glowing blue ends. He does a sound effect that he does it much better than I do.

177
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,920
 It blew up and the pieces of it crashed into the state park. There's bodies over there. There's

178
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,280
 alien bodies over there. I actually have video footage. I have video footage showing firefighters

179
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,000
 pulling an alien body out of a wreckage of a craft, setting it on the ground, leaving it

180
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 so that the feds can show up and take this alien to Brookhaven.

181
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,480
 That's an interesting story. We walk out of the bush. One of you guys is wearing a little dunce

182
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,000
 cap. I'm like, "Oh no. We walk out of the bush." We go up to the garden. We're like, "Hey, so we heard

183
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,320
 this story about this alien ship. The guard kind of rolls his eyes and goes, "You're talking to John

184
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,760
 Ford, right?" We're like, "Yeah, but I mean, obviously the place is closed. Is he making the

185
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,120
 whole story up? It is closed. We can't get in. That is a fact." And the guard goes, "Yes, it is closed.

186
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,960
 Why is it closed?" The official reason, duck season. Every show often during duck season,

187
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,960
 they close off the state park so people can hunt ducks. Look at each other. We're like,

188
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,520
 "I didn't know you could hunt at a state park." I actually thought that was what's going on.

189
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,960
 At that point, the guard, he's lost his patience with us. He's loading his gun.

190
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 We put a dunce cap on him. We run away real quick. It's interesting because John Ford did have this

191
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,200
 video of this fire and there is a firefighter moving something around and he was showing it to all

192
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,520
 these UFO conventions, all these UFO researchers. And even he admitted it wasn't a really good quality

193
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,200
 video. He says, "Yeah, you can't really tell. You can tell there's a fire, but you can't tell where

194
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,720
 I'm at and you can't tell that there's actually an alien body, but I'm telling you guys. This alien

195
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,480
 shit blew up. This body was laying here." Now, remember, this is the story that was labeled as

196
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,560
 a hoax. If I think about it, docs.com. I'm going to read you a passage here from that article out

197
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:43,280
 there by Michael Colton. Leading into this article, he was talking about how John Ford was sure that

198
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,920
 there were aliens here. And now we're going to introduce a new character to this Preston Nichols.

199
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:57,760
 So here's this quote. "Preston Nichols was sure too. Portly and absent-minded, he lives with his

200
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,640
 father in a small, shoddy house cluttered with electronic equipment, books, videotapes, and a

201
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:17,520
 rock collection." In his living room, while his fat dog snores, Nichols cues up a video and announces

202
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,760
 quote, "I didn't believe in time travel until I saw evidence that I had time traveled."

203
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,520
 Well, get to the time travel thing in a second, because that's another great twist.

204
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,960
 But do you see, I mean, this was an article written by The Washington Post. It completely

205
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,800
 sets the scene to go, "Koo-Koo, look at this big ol' fat weirdo over here. Every part of that

206
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:47,920
 passage is meant to completely dismiss Preston Nichols. Portly and absent-minded. I mean,

207
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,560
 he wasn't Pearl from Blade, he wasn't this big ol' fat dude sitting in his living room.

208
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,120
 He lives with his father, so you look at this loser over here, look at this big ol' bum.

209
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,840
 He even has a rock collection. What a nerd. And his small, shoddy house cluttered with items.

210
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,760
 He even makes fun of the dude's dog, his fat dog snores." Listen, I'm not throwing shade at Michael

211
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,320
 Colton. This was how it was all reported back then. You were completely dismissed if you believed in

212
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,880
 aliens. Completely dismissed. You might have a little more respect if you believe- you actually

213
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,440
 had more respect if you believed in like New Age, healing crystals and stuff like that. That was

214
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,920
 more like upper class beliefs, but people who believed in UFOs, people who believed in Bigfoot,

215
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,800
 they were all laughing stocks. And here you have this article. It's a very well written,

216
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,120
 very well investigated article, but you have this stuff. This article was written in the 90s.

217
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,400
 This article was more contemporaneous to the events of the story, so that's just how it was

218
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:58,160
 reported. Look at this big fat loser with his big fat dog playing around with his rock collection

219
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:05,920
 and his dirty house. This guy's a loser. And all of that stuff builds this picture, but really the

220
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,360
 key part is Preston Nichols believes he is time-traveled. So leaving behind the editorial-ness,

221
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,880
 we're getting- I just like to always shine a light on that because I think it's a fascinating

222
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,880
 aspect of the evolution of paranormal culture. So here is Preston Nichols' time-travel story.

223
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,120
 This article is being written, I believe, in like '97, '98. Preston Nichols says,

224
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:35,040
 "In 1995, there was another UFO crash. There was other videotape of a fire caused by a crash UFO."

225
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:42,720
 And I was showing that videotape. In that videotape, there is a handsome, young, handsome, non-portly

226
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,800
 firefighter. You can totally tell he doesn't live with his dad and his totally muscular dog is

227
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,520
 sitting next to him. He sees this video footage of a firefighter who looks exactly like he did when

228
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,560
 he was younger. Preston Nichols, who is hanging out with John Ford, who's actually trying to

229
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,800
 uncover all this stuff with John Ford. That's why he's part of the story. He says that, "I saw

230
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:13,440
 this videotape of the younger me, so my theory is that somehow the younger version of me traveled

231
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,560
 into the past." Like, I don't remember it. So like, in the future, there's a young version of me who

232
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:26,000
 travels into the past of 1995 to find proof of alien crashes on Earth. That's a video footage of me.

233
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,840
 What's interesting, this is kind of the, as much as I talk about the way that paranormal researchers

234
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,280
 are talked about back then, there's also, you also got to call out craziness when you see it, right?

235
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:45,200
 And yeah, time travel is possible, I guess, like in theory, but this is just a weird detail to an

236
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,520
 already weird story. It just adds another layer of "what?" on it. Because you have this man going

237
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,160
 around saying that all these alien ships are crashing in his area. Now we've involved time

238
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,600
 travel as well, who's actually a younger Preston Nichols is trying to figure all of this stuff out.

239
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,200
 So when you have all this crazy layered on crazy layered on crazy, it causes a lot of pressure

240
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,200
 on the people underneath it. John Ford begins to become paranoid. Let me back up. John Ford

241
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,440
 becomes even more paranoid. Because now he's not just fighting with local politicians, he's fighting

242
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,760
 with time travel and aliens and military cover-ups and guards standing outside of state parks with guns.

243
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,200
 So he starts carrying a gun. Now I don't have any problem with people carrying around guns using

244
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,480
 them responsibly, but I do have a problem with how he got the gun. He met an ex-felon named Joseph

245
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,120
 Mazuceli. Now this guy is not the guy you want to be hanging out with, especially if you're already

246
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,120
 paranoid, but he was a tough guy and John Ford wasn't a tough guy. So he was able to kind of

247
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,360
 absorb some of that energy from Joseph. You know what I mean? Like if you're not that tough and

248
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,200
 you hang out with a tough guy, no one's going to mess with you because now you have this pit bull

249
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:05,600
 in your corner. They also meet, these two guys also meet Kevin Koch. And what happens is he begins

250
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,000
 buying guns from John Ford and John Ford's getting them from Joseph. Now they have a little like

251
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,520
 gun smuggling ring going on. Kevin and Joseph aren't really interested in UFOs. Joseph's

252
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:25,440
 interested in a place where he can fence guns. Kevin is interested in being a snitch. He's actually

253
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,560
 a government informant. June 11th, 1996, Kevin, Joseph, and John Ford sitting around the kitchen

254
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:40,960
 table and John begins to brag. You know, I'm so tired of those Republican jerks. I can't win any

255
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,360
 elections and if I win an election, I can expose the truth, but they're in the way. They're in the

256
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,040
 way. They need to make room for a real conservative. What are you going to do about it, John? Well,

257
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,000
 I actually got something in my car that'll take care of them. Kevin's ears perk up. He's also

258
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,160
 wearing a wire so the agents who are listening to the wire, their ears perk up as well. I got some

259
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,200
 radium. You guys are like, "What? Okay. Where'd you get it? What do you want to do with that?"

260
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,800
 Even Joseph, he's not a snitch. Even he wonders what's going on. "Why do you have radium? Where'd

261
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,600
 you get it?" He goes, "I got it. You don't need to know where I got it from." But I have a plan

262
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,960
 that I'm going to with your guys' help. I have three lit suits in my garage.

263
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,640
 We're going to sprinkle it on their food. We're going to put it in their toothpaste.

264
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,600
 I'll sit in there and be brushing their teeth. Oh, what a bright smile I have today. I can even

265
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,600
 see it. I can even see it when I close my lips. My teeth are all glowing. "Mmm, Sally, this is some

266
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,640
 delicious omelet. Oh, no, no, no. You can actually see it floating down the digestive tract. I'm going

267
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,960
 to put it in their food. I'm going to put it in their toothpaste. I know the three targets I'm going

268
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,160
 to hit are these three Republican Party members because not only are they keeping me from my

269
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:04,320
 dreams of being a politician, they're also part of the UFO cover-up." That was all that anyone

270
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,200
 needed. Right? That's all he basically laid out. Motive, means, opportunity. That's all it took.

271
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:19,040
 The feds end up wrapping them up. They got Joseph for being like a felon. They got him for being

272
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,880
 part of the conspiracy to commit murder. I think he was also like, "Yeah, yeah, let's do it. Let's

273
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,280
 make them glow." But they also got him for being like a felon and possession of guns. They got John

274
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:33,520
 Ford for conspiring to kill three politicians. And they got a third guy. The snitch got off

275
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,880
 free. They got a third guy, Edward Zabo, because he provided the radium. He worked at a laboratory.

276
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,040
 He worked at Brookhaven. He's like, "Oh, I hate my buses. I never get the day off. I always got a

277
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,640
 babysit of these gray aliens." Now, experts have said this plan wouldn't have worked. Like, the

278
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,440
 amount of radium he had, they said he would have had—I mean, it would have made them sick. It

279
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,120
 goes—it would have taken 20 years for these guys to die. And they were already in their 60s. They

280
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,960
 would have just been 80 years old glowing a bit. Everyone's like, "You look so healthy. You're

281
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,600
 just so into that baby blue glow." They look like Dr. Manhattan. Now, Edward Zabo and Joseph

282
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,360
 Masculelli both were facing up to one to nine years for their plan in this plot, because again,

283
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,520
 they were just kind of side associates. But history doesn't really say what they got. I tried

284
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,760
 really hard to find out how much time they got. We don't really know how much sentencing they got,

285
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:35,040
 because the media circus was around John Ford. Because of his plan, he was facing 25 to 75 years

286
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,600
 in prison. Part of it was because he was trying to kill government officials. The other part was

287
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,480
 his method. He was trying to use radium, which escalates it to like a terror charge. I think

288
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,160
 anytime you're trying to attack a government official, it's a terror charge. But I could be

289
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,040
 wrong on that. But anyways, he was facing the rest of his life in prison, because at this point,

290
00:28:53,040 --> 00:29:00,640
 he's in his, like, 30s? 40s? So 25 is putting him pretty high up there. So he's taken in,

291
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,120
 and of course, one of the first things they do is they have to find, are you competent to stand

292
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,880
 trial? Like, if you're a blithering idiot, or if you're just a psycho, like super psycho,

293
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,720
 that's an actual medical classification. They're like, "Oh, I can't treat that guy. He's

294
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,680
 super psycho." And the doctor's like, "Oh, I guess I can't." They'll deem you unfit for trial.

295
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,160
 So that's the first thing, the court has to figure out whether or not you're actually competent to

296
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,880
 stand trial. Think about all the people who believe conspiracy theories, all of the bizarre

297
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,920
 paranormal beliefs that people hold today. Going back to when this article was written in 1998,

298
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:42,080
 I just looked it up. This is how people felt about believing in UFOs, believing in rogue CIA

299
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,800
 operatives running around Long Island, because he believed that stuff as well. He believed that

300
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:53,360
 AIDS and Ebola were man-made viruses. That's really not that out there nowadays, right?

301
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:01,520
 Remember, the name of this article was out there. That stuff is pretty well accepted within the

302
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,400
 conspiracy community. And I'd say even AIDS and Ebola, there's a lot of people who don't believe

303
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,480
 in a lot of conspiracy theories who believe those could be man-made. This is the quote from the

304
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,360
 Washington Post regarding his beliefs and his competency to stand trial. Quote, "He did not

305
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,560
 have to lie or exaggerate to the doctors to be found unfit. He simply told them what he believed

306
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:34,160
 to be true, which seemed so fantastical that they could only label it delusional behavior."

307
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:44,240
 Ideas that are considered mainstream now back then could get you found incompetent to stand trial.

308
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:54,160
 He never stood trial, but he never walked free again. He's still alive today. The latest

309
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,680
 article I could find on him was June 3rd, 2019. He's still locked in a mental hospital. He's 70

310
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,440
 years old now. And the mental hospital, the reason why he was back in the news, was because he was

311
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:19,280
 held all these years, since 1998, in a secure mental facility. And he finally, in June 2019,

312
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:26,720
 was released to a less secure mental hospital. A less restrictive institution is the term that's

313
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:34,000
 used. He has never stood trial. He has been locked up in a mental institution all this time.

314
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,320
 Now, I'm not saying a man who plotted the murder of three people should just run out willy-nilly,

315
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,120
 right? But he has done 22 years in a mental hospital already. If he had gone to prison, if he had

316
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,920
 served his sentence, he would have been paroled out by now. He has been held without a trial. And

317
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,120
 again, I think that he is on record saying he was trying to murder these people. I'm not trying to

318
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,480
 minimize that at all. But I find it fascinating that this man has been locked in a secure mental

319
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:14,560
 hospital all this time. His crime was a terror threat. It absolutely was. And he deserved to be

320
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,400
 punished for it. 22 years in a secure mental hospital, punished for it. Who knows? You could

321
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,000
 argue that the mental hospital was by choice. It was safer than prison. Maybe, but not a secure

322
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,400
 mental hospital. I mean, those words you don't want to hear together, right? I personally think

323
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,640
 mental hospitals are far more terrifying than any prison. That's my personal thing. But you have to

324
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,120
 wonder, after all this time, so many of these ideas have become mainstream. If you believed

325
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,800
 everything this guy said, everything that I told you, time travel, UFOs crashing, military cover-up,

326
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,480
 man-made diseases, none of these would be controversial statements nowadays. Get a lot of

327
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,400
 people to nod their head to one or two of those. And these beliefs used to get people thrown into

328
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,080
 mental institutions. Again, he was incarcerated. He was put away because of the terror threat. I'm not

329
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,400
 minimizing that. That was why he popped up on the radar. But the reason why he went to a secure

330
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,520
 mental facility was because he believed things that you can watch YouTube videos on, and people

331
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:24,480
 don't even blink an eye. At the most, they might roll their eyes and walk away. That's how far we've

332
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,840
 come in paranormal and conspiracy culture. Used to be simply saying those things would have you

333
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,680
 deemed incompetent to stand trial. Really incompetent to understand what was going on around you.

334
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,760
 I was watching the documentary the other day. There was a point in time that Alex Jones was

335
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:51,440
 making $100,000 a day. That was at his peak. There's always that story that the people who talk about

336
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,400
 conspiracy theories openly, like myself, like Alex Jones, like Art Bell, like George Norrie,

337
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,760
 Mysterious Universe, last podcast on the left, whoever you want to name. David Ike. The reason

338
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,520
 why we're allowed to talk about these things is because we are so far from the truth that we

339
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:20,080
 actually do more damage to the disclosure movement, to the conspiracy movement. That's why we can talk

340
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,680
 about these things so openly. David Ike has a program on Amazon, and the reason why we're allowed

341
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,880
 to do these things is because we're so far from the truth. Stories like John Ford really make you

342
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:39,200
 wonder about the opposite. The people who do figure something out do start to piece things together.

343
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:49,200
 Do start to see the truth behind all of the lies. They get locked up. They get deemed insane for 22

344
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:58,160
 years without a trial. And their legacy in UFOology is their story is simply labeled a hoax. And that's

345
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,320
 it. Not even the Washington Post said the story was a hoax. They just believed it was the ramblings

346
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:13,760
 of a madman. A hoax implies maliciousness in the creation of the story. Did John Ford make the

347
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:20,240
 story up to get attention to himself? Did he not have enough evidence to truly back up his statements?

348
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,600
 That's not a hoax though, right? That's just a guess that's wrong. Or did he discover the truth

349
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:33,200
 of time travel, of Brookhaven laboratory, of the military shooting down UFOs right over Long Island?

350
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,680
 I don't know the answer to that, but if I did know the answer to that,

351
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:46,160
 you might find me locked in a mental hospital. And this entire podcast being labeled as nothing

352
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:53,520
 but a hoax, an ARG, a lark, and quickly being forgotten. We are allowed to say what we say

353
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,080
 because we are not exposing the real truth.

355
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,800
 When's the last time you heard a podcast and they're like, I don't know. I'm probably just

356
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,120
 saying stuff that's not true, but it's interesting, right? It's interesting. I know most of you people

357
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,600
 already clicked off because I started the exit, but yeah, I think when I do conspiracy theories,

358
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,080
 sometimes I'm actually scared about certain ones I may cover because I've never heard them before.

359
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,560
 And I go, what if this one's true? What if this is the one that gets the bullet in the back of my

360
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,960
 head? And then nothing happens. And I go, well, I guess that was also just far off the mark.

361
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,600
 We're all just searching for the truth, right? The question is what happens when you find it.
