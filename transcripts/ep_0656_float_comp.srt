1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 Is Russia planning on building an army of the dead?

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,400
 And then we travel to Old Timey America to take a look at the story of a young man who

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,920
 gains the ability to fly.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,600
 Sounds awesome, doesn't it?

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,800
 It turns out it would actually suck today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:29,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,880
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,440
 We got so much stuff to cover.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,940
 I just won't go from a nap.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,720
 That's what you guys want, a podcast produced by a slightly sleepy man.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,720
 It was a night nap.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
 It's 8.30pm.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,720
 I like to take late naps.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,400
 First off, we gotta give a shout out to our Fan Art Friday submission.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
 Look at this drawing from Dropshot.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,680
 It's the picture of a rabbit.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,080
 He looks slightly terrified.

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,400
 He looks like he's wondering why he's in the black void, but he has some nice books

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,800
 in front of him so he'll be okay.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,840
 Dropshot, thank you so much for sending this over.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
 Really appreciate it.

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,040
 Then we gotta give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, writing into Dead Rabbit

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,640
 Command on the back of 10,000 Stallions.

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,680
 That should be the name of a band.

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,480
 We hear the Stallions coming in.

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
 It's in Valid ID.

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,000
 They're on the back of every Stallion at the same time.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,080
 It's Quantum Patreon supporters.

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,320
 Valid ID, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,160
 If you guys can't swear to Patreon or if you only exist in one place at one time, that's

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
 fine too.

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,680
 I just read the word about the show.

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,160
 Really, really helps out a lot.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,960
 In Valid ID, I'm not gonna toss you the keys to any vehicles just yet.

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,400
 I wanna talk about this.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
 It's Friday.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,800
 Gonna be a kind of a laid back episode.

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,400
 Got some good stories for you.

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,160
 We're coming up to the end of the 90 days to a better you.

41
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,720
 And I want you guys to really focus on that.

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,000
 I wanted to give a shout out to one of our listeners, Yuri.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,240
 It's just to show a good example of this.

44
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,240
 Yuri, when we did the first 90 days to a better you, they decided to re-pick up their hobby

45
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,680
 of doing 3D modeling.

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,520
 And they actually sent me some car model parts they were working on.

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,600
 And now they're doing the second 90 days challenge.

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,880
 They're trying to get a job in the 3D modeling industry.

49
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,520
 So far Yuri's sent out 30 applications trying to find their dream job.

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,480
 That's what the 90 day challenge can do for you.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,360
 And this isn't, you don't have to buy a book.

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,960
 You don't have to subscribe to anything.

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,200
 This is me hoping to encourage you to be better.

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,960
 And to tell you what guys, if you guys miss this 90 day deadline, it's okay.

55
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,160
 Just make the next 90 days.

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
 The best 90 days.

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
 The best steps forward for the rest of your life.

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,760
 Invalid ID, hop on off all of those stallions.

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,320
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the hair hang glider.

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,240
 It doesn't need keys, but it's just a souvenir.

61
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,920
 Go ahead and grab on to the hair hang glider.

62
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,920
 We're going to hang on to your ankles and run.

63
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
 Jump off that cliff.

64
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,760
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:03,160
 We are headed out to Siberia.

66
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,960
 As we're going back, hit that little button there.

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
 I hope you can reach it.

68
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,120
 I hope you can reach it before the design hang glider.

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
 We're going back in time as well.

70
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,440
 We're going back to the 5th century BC.

71
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,480
 You thought we were doing that whole AD thing.

72
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
 Nope.

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
 BC.

74
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,120
 We're going to the Valley of the Kings.

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,800
 It's in Tuva in Siberia.

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,040
 Back in 5th century BC, there was a man sitting there writing a book.

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,120
 He's writing out his name and he goes, "My name is Hero."

78
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,840
 Everyone's like, "Oh dude, this guy must be super awesome.

79
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,880
 His first name is Hero, Dotus."

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,800
 And they're like, "Oh man."

81
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,120
 That's a callback joke.

82
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,680
 Hero Dotus, the great Greek historian, is writing about the Skythians.

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
 He puts a question mark because I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right either.

84
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,520
 The Skythians were a race or like a subculture.

85
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,800
 From Iran, they were nomads who took their horses, took their swords and traveled around

86
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,200
 the continent.

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,720
 I don't know exactly what that had to do with it because I don't know if they were like

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
 ruthless bandits.

89
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,760
 I don't know if they were like helping old ladies out of like ditches and stuff like

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
 that.

91
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,160
 That was a real big problem back in 5th century BC.

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,200
 A lot of ditches, a lot of old ladies.

93
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,200
 I don't really know how the culture was, but I do know that they were very famed in combat.

94
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
 Actually, I do know how their culture was.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,760
 Before, I don't know why I blanked on this detail, there's an old lady in a trench and

96
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,640
 she's like, "Not again!"

97
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,600
 And a Skythian warrior rides up and she's like, "Oh young fella, you'll help me out."

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,320
 I don't know, I can't say how their politics were.

99
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,880
 I can't say who they'd vote for.

100
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,680
 But the Skythians were known to drink out of human skulls.

101
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,800
 That should kind of tell you what their D&D alignment would be.

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,200
 They drink out of human skulls.

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:03,160
 This part, Herodotus, he has stated that supposedly, this sounds a little like made up to me.

104
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,720
 This sounds like another tribe trying to give him a bad name.

105
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:16,880
 They drink out of human skulls and they have capes made out of human scalps.

106
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
 Come on, that's impossible.

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,640
 You know how many people you'd have to scalp?

108
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,360
 I've tried it, I've tried it.

109
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,200
 It takes more than seven.

110
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,160
 You know how many people you'd have to scalp to make, maybe like a baby cape, maybe like

111
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,880
 a cape for your son and then they'd grow out of it and you'd be like, "Oh, you can pass

112
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
 it along to your little brother."

113
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,000
 Think about how much skin you have on your scalp and then imagine peeling it off and

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,520
 then how many you heads would it take to make like a cape?

115
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,760
 I don't know if they necessarily had like Phantom of the Opera cloaks.

116
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,080
 They're like all satiny smooth.

117
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,840
 They're only killing people with the smoothest skin.

118
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,520
 But still, a cape, like a five foot, six foot long cape, made of human, seriously made

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,120
 of human scalps.

120
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,640
 It sounds a little ridiculous to me, but the Skythians, they drank out of human skulls,

121
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,040
 they might have made capes made out of human scalps.

122
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
 Plus it's so cold.

123
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,040
 Like, what if you haven't scalped enough people that winter?

124
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,360
 You're like, "Oh, I'm so cold.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,760
 Can I just get, you know, some cloth?"

126
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,000
 And they're like, "No, we have a reputation up hold.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,400
 I can't just like take some like camel hair and pretend it's a human."

128
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,360
 No, as you're freezing to death.

129
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,760
 Anyways, the Skythians roamed the area.

130
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,680
 Herodotus wrote all Herodotus, some say, but speaking of fake news, Herodotus is writing

131
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,560
 of these guys' adventures.

132
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,800
 The year now is 2017, and we're still in the Valley of the Kings in Tuva, Siberia.

133
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
 And they've found the burial site of these ancient warriors.

134
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
 So they actually knew where the burial site was.

135
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,120
 It was called Valley of the Kings.

136
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,080
 They're not like, "I wonder what's buried there."

137
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:58,120
 But in 2017, Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu had an idea.

138
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,240
 An archaeological idea.

139
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,960
 He goes, "Let's get a bunch of resources.

140
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,680
 Let's get a bunch of egghead scientists to come on out here.

141
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,160
 Let's excavate the Valley of the Kings.

142
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 Let's find some bones, ladies and gentlemen."

143
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,360
 Weird, right?

144
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,080
 I'm not saying that if you're the minister of defense, all you can ever think about is

145
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
 defense.

146
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,600
 I mean, they're allowed to have hobbies too.

147
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,680
 But it's weird to spearhead this expedition with all these bones.

148
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,960
 You are the minister of defense after all.

149
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
 But anyways, he does it.

150
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,120
 I'm not saying he stood there and took a site like Indiana Jones, but it was a personal

151
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,720
 project of his.

152
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,160
 Fast forward now to April 14th, 2021.

153
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,520
 Sergei's holding this meeting with the Russian Geographical Society.

154
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,120
 Vladimir Putin is there as well.

155
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,840
 Sergei and Putin are buddies.

156
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,240
 Which I think would make sense if you were the defense minister.

157
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,600
 You wouldn't want to have a defense minister.

158
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,120
 He didn't like you.

159
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,120
 Sergei is given this speech to the Russian Geographical Society and he announces their

160
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,880
 true intentions.

161
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,120
 This is 100% true.

162
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,600
 They're announcing their true intentions with this burial site.

163
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,840
 When I said 100% true, I went back and looked away at sources.

164
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,160
 They're the daily male mysterious universe in the Siberian times.

165
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,280
 But even if the first two can be a little iffy.

166
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,240
 Siberian times, that sounds legit.

167
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,760
 Sergei gives this speech and he says, "What we're looking at doing, ladies and gentlemen,

168
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,680
 if we're not just digging up any old bones, those are everywhere.

169
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,680
 My dog can do that."

170
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,640
 He gets on his notes, waits for laughter and everyone's just super quiet.

171
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,080
 He's like, "Okay, that joke bombed.

172
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,720
 But we're not just looking for any bones.

173
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,240
 We're looking for quote, organic material."

174
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,080
 When talking about organic material, he says quote, "I believe you understand what would

175
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
 follow that."

176
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
 Unquote.

177
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,680
 Everyone is kind of looking at each other.

178
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
 They're like, "Not really.

179
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
 What does that mean?"

180
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,400
 And then he goes on to specify something that they could do something maybe like dolly the

181
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,760
 sheep.

182
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,440
 So he's talking about cloning.

183
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,120
 He wants to make clones of these ancient nomads.

184
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,480
 This is, so this flabbergast me.

185
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,120
 Because we have the world of science and then we have the world of the paranormal.

186
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,320
 And very rarely do they meet unless the world of the paranormal invites scientists.

187
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,360
 Being like, "Hey, can you prove these ghosts exist?"

188
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,720
 As the scientists are all possessed floating in the room.

189
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
 They're like, "No, ghosts are fake."

190
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,760
 And they're like, "Oh, dang it.

191
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,920
 Not again."

192
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,920
 But usually that's how it works.

193
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,400
 Scientists usually don't show up.

194
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,400
 Scientists probably don't usually call up the mystery machine and be like, "Oh, we

195
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,680
 think our labs, Hampton."

196
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,200
 These archaeologists, these trained scientists, invited a shaman down to the burial site before

197
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,560
 they even got started excavating these bones to bless the area.

198
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,520
 They were so terrified that these spirits would curse them, would kill them.

199
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,560
 Ghosts can watch, and Jones too, right?

200
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,800
 Ghosts can know what happens at cursed archaeological sites as well.

201
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,160
 Then they brought a shaman out.

202
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,360
 I found that so odd.

203
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,200
 I've seen reports of like police working with magic users around the world or priests

204
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
 and things like that.

205
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,520
 But I've never seen scientists go, "You know, before we get started with all of this

206
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,440
 rational cause and effect scientific and method stuff, let's bring in a shaman.

207
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,800
 Let's bring in a shaman to make sure none of our faces melt."

208
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,000
 This is going on apparently.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,560
 According to the Daily Mail, the Russian defense minister is talking about cloning

210
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
 these soldiers.

211
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,760
 And that's what they would be, right?

212
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,400
 You don't clone them, you don't clone them and then give them a job and then see how

213
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,360
 they work at a fro-yo shop.

214
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,240
 You would take the bone marrow from these ancient warriors and try to replicate them.

215
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,840
 It's interesting though, because you imagine the strong- this could be a bit of a rant

216
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,880
 and I could be totally wrong, but I would imagine the strongest man in the 5th century

217
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,560
 is like the average high school football player today.

218
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,400
 Just through nutrition, just through environmental factors, I would say, like you took someone

219
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,400
 from the 5th century, BC, and put them in a foot race with a high school athlete.

220
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,640
 Herodotus has a little starter pistol.

221
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,040
 I think the high school athlete would smosh them.

222
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,480
 And I'm talking about not the equivalent of just some schmo from the 5th century.

223
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,760
 How did I get here?

224
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,400
 A highly trained warrior.

225
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
 Now, I'm talking about a foot race.

226
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,600
 If it's some sort of brutal battle to the finish, that high school scalp is going to

227
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,160
 become part of a cape.

228
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,920
 But now we're talking if you took a cloned dude from the 5th century and put him up

229
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,640
 against spetnats, or green berets or something like that, or the Coast Guard, I don't think

230
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,840
 it would match up.

231
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,600
 So is this going to come to- are these really the best warriors humanity has to offer?

232
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,160
 You think you could probably just dig up someone more recent, right?

233
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,360
 You wouldn't have to go here.

234
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,560
 If you can clone people, why don't you just get a current dude?

235
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,360
 Like a guy who just died a couple weeks ago.

236
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
 Sorry, I'm just getting great.

237
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,480
 But there's war heroes born every day.

238
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
 I get him.

239
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
 And clone a bunch of him.

240
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,720
 I guess the problem, I guess the thing is, is the family would know, right?

241
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,840
 If a family unfortunately lost one of their loved ones in a battle, they died bravely.

242
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,640
 And then the next day, you're watching television, and there's like a hundred of them running

243
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
 down the street.

244
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,600
 You'll be like, "Um, Mr. Putin."

245
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,680
 I have a little question about my son's remains.

246
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,800
 I've noticed there's scores of him now, standing guard outside your palace.

247
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
 There we go.

248
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,640
 That might be going on.

249
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,640
 We may soon be facing down a fleet of warriors that used to be from the 5th century BC.

250
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,760
 But I think we could take them.

251
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,600
 I'm not too worried about it.

252
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
 Invalid ID.

253
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
 I'm going to toss you the keys of the Carpentercopter.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,680
 We are leaving behind Siberia.

255
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:56,120
 We are headed out to Dexter, Missouri.

256
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,560
 This is one of those stories that I came across during my vacation and couldn't wait to tell

257
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
 you it.

258
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,240
 I thought it was so fun, fascinating, and full of frights.

259
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
 I was going to say terrifying, but I wanted to stay with my F theme.

260
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,880
 It's really kind of a terrifying story.

261
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,400
 Invalid ID.

262
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,920
 Let's land that Carpentercopter.

263
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,440
 It's June 1884.

264
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
 We're in Dexter, Missouri.

265
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:28,000
 Everyone put on your Missouri clothes.

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,960
 So everyone put on your Missouri clothes.

267
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,880
 Straw hat, straw in the mouth.

268
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
 Straw pants.

269
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,120
 It was a very itchy time back then.

270
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
 Everything was pure straw.

271
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,720
 We're walking towards the farm of the Beck family.

272
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,160
 You had Reynard Beck, 27 year old man, his brother Samuel, and their poor unnamed mother.

273
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,040
 She was unnamed from birth.

274
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,920
 Sad story.

275
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,360
 The mother, Reynard, and Samuel are all living on the Beck farm.

276
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
 It's a hard life.

277
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,560
 It's been a hard few seasons.

278
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,480
 They're barely growing enough stuff you can grow, enough farm stuff you can grow in Missouri

279
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,000
 to make ends meet.

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,640
 Reynard Beck spends long days working the fields.

281
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,760
 And then he comes home and goes to sleep.

282
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,960
 It is a back breaking existence.

283
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,760
 But one morning he wakes up.

284
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,280
 "Ooohhhhhh.

285
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,360
 Time to get to work.

286
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,440
 Time for my entire body to ache with the unending labor of man."

287
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
 Wait, huh?

288
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:34,200
 And he realizes that his painful knees, waw, waw, waw, the throbbing redness that normally

289
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,240
 greets him when he wakes up is all "Hello, Reynard!

290
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,440
 Here comes horrible pain!"

291
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,240
 And we don't know how to pronounce your name.

292
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
 "Waw, waw."

293
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,040
 His knees normally hurt and the first thing when he wakes up he notices his knees don't

294
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
 hurt.

295
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
 What?

296
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,520
 Then he's like "Okay, well that's weird, but surely my back will still be sore.

297
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,760
 Oh good old back, you're always tense and uncomfortable."

298
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,160
 Then he realizes his back is fully relaxed.

299
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
 What?

300
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
 What is this sensation?

301
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,800
 It feels like I've been able to relax for more than four hours.

302
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,680
 Every joint in his body is pain free.

303
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,600
 He feels so good.

304
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,280
 He has a zip in his step.

305
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,040
 He's ready to get to taste like all his pain's gone.

306
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,120
 Time to do even more work today.

307
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,440
 He jumps out of his bed, ready to ruin whatever his body has healed.

308
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,800
 And that is when he discovers his feet aren't touching the ground.

309
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
 Huh?

310
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
 What?

311
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,960
 He looks down and he can see that he's hovering off the floor of his bedroom.

312
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,080
 He gets panicked obviously by this.

313
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,680
 And he jumps back onto the bed.

314
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,240
 And he's sitting there for a second.

315
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,960
 He's like "What in the world?

316
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,400
 Maybe it was just a hallucination.

317
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,240
 Maybe this pain free existence is tricking me."

318
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:58,040
 He slowly steps back onto the floor and sure enough he's floating above the ground.

319
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,040
 This is an interesting story because I want you to kind of put yourselves in the shoes,

320
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,200
 in the floating shoes of Reynard.

321
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,800
 What would you do if you woke up like this?

322
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,040
 There'd be a moment of elation but then I think it would be filled with terror.

323
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,600
 Because of the implications obviously.

324
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,680
 You have this implication that you are no longer bound to one of the three laws of the

325
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
 universe, gravity.

326
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
 It would also be kind of fun.

327
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
 Wheeee!

328
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,200
 You're floating around but it'd still be terrifying.

329
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,040
 But Rey, we're called Rey for short because I'm having a hard time with the other name.

330
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,760
 He has that fear like we would but he also has another issue.

331
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,720
 This is 1884, Missouri and his family and the whole community is Bible Thumb in Christian

332
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
 Town.

333
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,440
 Anything that seems slightly out of whack is considered the work of the devil.

334
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,560
 So he's concerned about that.

335
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,720
 All of these things are going through his head.

336
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,040
 He wants to call out for help but he's afraid that the Amishka will help you, will help

337
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
 you into the arms of Jesus Christ.

338
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,680
 He's like "No, no, that's not what I meant."

339
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,920
 He's afraid that whatever's going on will be considered the devil's work and he'll

340
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,360
 be killed for it.

341
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,080
 He's also afraid that he's afraid of that possibility in the future.

342
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,040
 He's also afraid right now he might just float away.

343
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,240
 And that's when he hears his mom from downstairs.

344
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,880
 "Reynard, come on down, it's breakfast time."

345
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,680
 He's just floating there and he's like "Great.

346
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,120
 I hope I get my share of the waffles.

347
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,440
 I know my brother Samuel loves to eat all the waffles."

348
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,880
 And he's floating there and then he realizes something.

349
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,800
 He had some old fishing weights, like some old lead weights in some of his pants across

350
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,720
 the room so he's kind of like now swimming through the air to these pants and he grabs

351
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,560
 them, he pulls the lead weights out, attaches them to his own pants and then, doop, sinks

352
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
 to the ground.

353
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,640
 Reynard is a 166 pound human.

354
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,680
 And I don't think, I don't think he had a lot of weights on him but he just had a few

355
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,120
 and just enough of these little lead weights held him to the ground.

356
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,520
 He walks downstairs uneasily because he's still a little floaty but at least now his

357
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,720
 feet are touching the ground.

358
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,520
 He walks downstairs, says nothing to his family, just enjoys his waffles and tries to think

359
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,960
 what's going to come next.

360
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,920
 He has to do work.

361
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,800
 He can't not work right at his farm.

362
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,920
 That would be even more suspicious if he took the day off.

363
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:27,480
 This guy with these little lead weights on his pants walks outside of his house into

364
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,360
 the bright burning Missouri sunshine.

365
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:39,320
 He has to go about hoeing the ground and picking potatoes and watering the goat, whatever you

366
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,680
 do on a farm.

367
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,440
 The whole time knowing if he bends over too far and a couple lead weights fall out of

368
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,280
 his pants, he's just going to float away.

369
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,120
 He has to work a full day.

370
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,520
 Supper time is the best sound he ever heard when that stereotypical little bell was being

371
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:05,320
 rang.

372
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,360
 This goes on for a couple days and he still hasn't told anyone and when he has time to

373
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,720
 himself he practices moving without the lead weights.

374
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,280
 He'd go into his room and take the lead weights out of his pocket and he'd fly around his

375
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,520
 room.

376
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,360
 Until one day his nosey brother Samuel barges in.

377
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
 I don't know why.

378
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,640
 I've never barged in on another person in their room, especially when you hear him going

379
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
 "Weeeee!

380
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,120
 This is so much fun I've ever had and I'm all by myself.

381
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
 Yippee!

382
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
 Don't ever walk in.

383
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
 Don't ever walk in."

384
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,440
 Samuel walks in and sees his brother, who's now had a couple days practice with this skill,

385
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,640
 flying around the room.

386
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,280
 He's like jumping from wall to wall, having a ball.

387
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,640
 His brother immediately thinks that Rey is pulling a prank.

388
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,160
 Which is the most elaborate.

389
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,040
 I mean I'm a bit of a prankster.

390
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,440
 I've never even thought to get ropes and pulleys and make myself fly around a room.

391
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,520
 First Samuel thinks it's a prank and then of course Samuel thinks the devil is involved.

392
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
 And Rey knew this was do or die.

393
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,880
 Literally do or die.

394
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,040
 He had to convince Samuel that this was not the devil's work.

395
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
 I don't know what happened.

396
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,360
 I woke up the other day and started flying around.

397
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,120
 I can't even explain it.

398
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
 It's super weird.

399
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,520
 I kept it from you guys because I was afraid you guys would try to hang me.

400
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
 Although I started to think how do you hang a man?

401
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
 How do you hang a man who can float?

402
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,960
 And Samuel's just standing there, arms crossed, listening to his brother basically plead for

403
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,080
 his life.

404
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,840
 After this monologue, after this Academy Award winning monologue about how the devil was

405
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,240
 not involved, Samuel goes "Listen, I get it.

406
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
 I believe you.

407
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
 It's not a prank.

408
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
 Devil's not involved.

409
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
 I believe you."

410
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,720
 I don't know what this means.

411
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,960
 Rey's kind of sitting there, kind of floating above the bed.

412
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,120
 He's showing off now.

413
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,920
 He's just floating above the bed.

414
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,840
 Samuel goes "This means that we're going to be rich.

415
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,800
 We are going to make so much money."

416
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,320
 Samuel and Rey come up with this plan to become a freak show.

417
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,280
 Oh, one man freak show.

418
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,320
 Samuel would be the guy outside, step on up, meet the incredible levitating man.

419
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
 He's going to fly around your head.

420
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,080
 You're going to think it's wires, but it's not.

421
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,600
 It's not the devil either.

422
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
 Don't murder my brother.

423
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,880
 But watch him spin around in the room.

424
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,440
 And they start off by going to local lodges, local halls, meet the incredible levitating

425
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,360
 man Rey's, flying around the room.

426
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,160
 And people would come out and they'd be like, "Well, what an amazing thing."

427
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,720
 Now some of them thought it's just wires, it's just ropes, but you're still getting

428
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
 good money's worth.

429
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,840
 That nickel you paid to get in is worth watching a man on wires float around.

430
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,600
 But part of the trick was, if you don't believe it, step right up.

431
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
 You've got a broom.

432
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
 You've got a broom.

433
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 You can rent it for a dime.

434
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
 Give me an extra dime.

435
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
 They'd use brooms.

436
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,600
 They'd use sticks to try to hit away where any wires or ropes would be.

437
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
 And there aren't any.

438
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,400
 He's still just floating around.

439
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,800
 The act began to involve.

440
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,880
 Eventually he's just not floating around.

441
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,040
 He began reading the newspaper, reading the newspaper while he's floating.

442
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,960
 Isn't that amazing folks and people looking at each other like, "I guess."

443
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,040
 I mean, it's more amazing than he's just floating.

444
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,800
 It doesn't matter what he's doing, but his act began to involve him reading the newspaper

445
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,520
 while he was floating.

446
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,560
 Drinking tea while he was floating.

447
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,920
 Again, who cares?

448
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
 He's floating.

449
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
 Who gets bored of that?

450
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,360
 He's like, "Oh, Martha, I don't want to see the man who's defying the laws of time

451
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
 and space again.

452
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,320
 Lame."

453
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,760
 They start, they eventually get this big tent.

454
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,280
 It's this huge event.

455
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,160
 People are now, originally they were touring.

456
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,120
 Now people are coming to see Ray fly around this tent.

457
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
 Scientists would come out.

458
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
 Skeptics would come out.

459
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
 They tried to disprove it.

460
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
 They couldn't.

461
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,920
 At one point, some skeptics were so violent.

462
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,680
 While he was flying around, they began to destroy the tent because they figured if they

463
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,520
 destroyed the tent that all the ropes and pulleys will break.

464
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
 But they weren't able to.

465
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,000
 They didn't destroy the whole tent.

466
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,240
 Luckily, luckily for Ray, he's like, "No, my axe's over.

467
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
 See you guys later.

468
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
 No refunds."

469
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,920
 He's floating up into the sky.

470
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,720
 They destroyed enough of the tent to basically prove that this guy is actually floating around.

471
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,360
 A huge act, a huge draw.

472
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,480
 But one day, the tent sat empty.

473
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,280
 Flap opening in the breeze.

474
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
 Just a cricket.

475
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,840
 A cricket who finally got a nickel.

476
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,440
 Finally somehow it got a nickel standing outside.

477
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
 There's no one in there.

478
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,560
 The next day, the tent is still empty.

479
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,240
 Days go by.

480
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,480
 The tent remains unused.

481
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
 People knew this guy locally.

482
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,160
 They knew he lived on the back form.

483
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,360
 People would show up at their house and be like, "Hey, Ray, what's up?

484
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
 You?"

485
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,200
 He sort of choked a thousand times.

486
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
 He's like, "Ah, not this one again."

487
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 People are stopping by.

488
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,680
 They're like, "Hey, how come you're not doing that whole floating around thing?"

489
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,160
 I was really hoping on seeing it this weekend.

490
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,320
 And Ray was like, "I quit.

491
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,920
 I'm not doing the floating thing anymore."

492
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,480
 People were like, "How do you not do the superpower anymore?"

493
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,800
 He's like, "I'm not going to do it."

494
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,680
 People kept coming to his house and asking, "When are you doing your act again?"

495
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,920
 He wouldn't do it.

496
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,240
 He was doing this for a total of six years.

497
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,080
 It wasn't like this was a month-long thing.

498
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,640
 For six years, you could count on every weekend seeing a man read a newspaper.

499
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,240
 If he's reading it to you, you're an illiterate farmer.

500
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,520
 You're like, "I wonder what happened to the news this week.

501
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,120
 Only the flying man can deliver my news."

502
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,440
 This went on for six years, then all of a sudden, nothing.

503
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,440
 The whole thing ended.

504
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,080
 And when people would ask him, "Hey, what's going on?

505
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
 Journalists stopped by.

506
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
 Locals stopped by."

507
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,960
 They'd ask, "What's going on?"

508
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,960
 He'd always say this quote, "Once a person is in the air, he can never be the same person

509
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
 as before."

510
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,800
 Eventually, he stopped even answering the door.

511
00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:01,040
 Some say that he lost his powers one day and was ashamed of it.

512
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,960
 Some say it was all a hoax to begin with and someone came too close to figuring it out.

513
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:15,120
 And those would be reasons why he quit, but as to why he stopped answering the door, there's

514
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,040
 another tale in the area.

515
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,280
 One day, a young man was walking across the Beck Farm to interview Ray.

516
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,720
 That's become the new pastime.

517
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,680
 Pay a nickel, you can interview Ray.

518
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:33,960
 As he's moving across the Beck Farm, he sees a belt of weighted fishing lures laying in

519
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,560
 the dust.

520
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:45,600
 The young man just looked up into the sky, hoping to catch one final glimpse of Raynard

521
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,960
 Beck.

522
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,800
 Fascinating story.

523
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,920
 I love this story.

524
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,160
 I found it during my vacation and I couldn't wait to share it with you guys.

525
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,360
 You'll find this story in several places online, like I just described to you.

526
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:09,000
 It's called "Alexa Vukovic of ancient origins.net, dug a little deeper."

527
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,400
 Was asking the same question, "Is this story true?"

528
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,680
 This story took place in 1884, but the earliest printed version that Alexa could find was

529
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,200
 August 31, 1972.

530
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,400
 There was a letter written to a newspaper in Kansas called the Belleville Telescope.

531
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,440
 This is a newspaper in Belleville, Kansas.

532
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,160
 It was written by a man named Dr. R. N. Van Koor.

533
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,520
 The letter is written from the point of view of a physicist studying gravity.

534
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,880
 In this letter to the editor, in this letter to the newspaper, talking about gravity, it's

535
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,480
 kind of a weird thing to write into.

536
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,040
 One day the newspaper goes, "You know the gravity of the situation in this physicist

537
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,520
 writes out a letter, speaking of gravity."

538
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,440
 In this letter, it tells the story.

539
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,640
 That one, that original letter in August 31, 1972, does have a conclusive ending.

540
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,000
 It says, "He eventually lost his powers and went around living a normal life."

541
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,040
 The original printed version that we can find has that.

542
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,240
 Now in the story proper, you notice I kept saying journalists kept showing up.

543
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,440
 There are references to news reports of this.

544
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,520
 None have ever been found.

545
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,720
 None have ever been found.

546
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,000
 There were supposedly contemporary news reports of all this, but I couldn't find them and

547
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,320
 neither could Alexa.

548
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,520
 The earliest version was August 31, 1972.

549
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:43,440
 This story became very popular in 1978 because issue 79 of Ripley's Believe It or Not comic

550
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,880
 books did a story on this.

551
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,440
 So there's a lot of illustrations of little man drinking tea floating around.

552
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,680
 That's when the story really took up.

553
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,840
 But the earliest version we can find is 1972.

554
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,720
 Is the story true based on almost a hundred year gap between the story happening and a

555
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,520
 written version of it?

556
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,720
 Most likely not.

557
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,800
 We've covered stories like that in the past on the show, the hotel room in Paris where

558
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,120
 the mom showed up and then disappeared.

559
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,640
 You had these massive time gaps.

560
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
 That's really interesting one.

561
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
 I'll put that on the show notes.

562
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
 There's little more to that mystery.

563
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,680
 But we'll see stories where there are these massive time gaps between when the story was

564
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,520
 originally told, when it was supposed to happen, and then when it was published.

565
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:30,160
 If there really was a flying man, there would at least be a scrap of a newspaper article

566
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,360
 from 1884.

567
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
 It's possible.

568
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,200
 I shouldn't say there would have to be because time can, newspapers can shut down and especially

569
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,920
 back then archives could get destroyed and things like that.

570
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,920
 But most likely the story isn't true.

571
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,000
 The real ringer for me was the fact that he could levitate unless he had a couple lead

572
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,240
 balls in his pockets.

573
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,200
 Even with his clothes on, that wasn't enough.

574
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,160
 He had to have the lead weights on him to hold him down.

575
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,480
 But I mean, again, I've never floated.

576
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,920
 I don't know what it takes.

577
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,600
 Whether or not it's true is almost secondary.

578
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,760
 Such a fascinating story.

579
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,320
 The reason why I love this story is because everyone wants to fly and this story turns

580
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
 it into something terrifying.

581
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,960
 I think in the old timey, hero-dotus times, they'd look up and see birds flying go, "Oh,

582
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
 I want to be like that.

583
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,160
 Maybe if I flap my wings and wore some feathers."

584
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,600
 I'd look fabulous and I would also be able to soar through the air.

585
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,000
 But in modern times, we watch stuff like Superman who can just fly around.

586
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,720
 I think he's the prototypical flight superhero.

587
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,200
 There's Submariner and Iron Man has rockets.

588
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
 That doesn't really count.

589
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,680
 But as far as just being able to stand up and float around Superman is really what we

590
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
 think of.

591
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,560
 And there is something alluring about flying around.

592
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,080
 But it's controlled flight.

593
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,960
 You have to have that first word in there.

594
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,120
 That's not what Rey really had.

595
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,680
 That's what's scary about it.

596
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,560
 He woke up and he was floating.

597
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,800
 Now luckily he was in his room.

598
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,200
 But was there a time like do you have to wake up to gain this power or could it just strike

599
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 anytime?

600
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,560
 Could you be walking down the street tomorrow and then a sensation comes over your body?

601
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,760
 You feel free.

602
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,000
 You feel free of pain.

603
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,360
 You feel free of stiffness.

604
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,320
 You feel healthy and vibrant.

605
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,840
 You feel light.

606
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:32,840
 You look down and you see you're already 5, 10 feet off of the ground.

607
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,720
 Nothing could save you.

608
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,360
 Nothing could stop you at that point.

609
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:47,720
 As you watch the earth recede beneath your feet, you're floating up slowly.

610
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,760
 You can see the looks of the people who were previously standing next to you.

611
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,240
 Their jaws dropped.

612
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,880
 You can't believe what they're seeing.

613
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,560
 50 feet.

614
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,160
 100 feet.

615
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,280
 A thousand feet.

616
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,960
 You're watching the world grow small beneath you.

617
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:14,640
 At least if you're falling from a building or an airplane.

618
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,080
 It's fast and there's an end to it.

619
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:25,640
 But you just keep floating up.

620
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,040
 The atmosphere gets colder.

621
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,280
 The air grows thinner.

622
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
 You can't breathe.

623
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,200
 But you continue to float.

624
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:43,480
 As your body leaves earth and enters the cold vacuum of space.

625
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:52,040
 You were chosen by the universe for a unique experience.

626
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,600
 Your body will never decay.

627
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,240
 It will simply move through the darkness of the universe.

628
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,240
 Frozen and alone.

629
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:29,520
 You will do nothing until the end of time, but float.

630
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:48,160
 Thank you again.

631
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,740
 (upbeat music)
