1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 What would you do if you broke into somebody's car and what you stole turned out to be haunted?

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,160
 What?

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,960
 And then we traveled to the Philippines to go on patrol with the local police there.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,760
 We think it's just going to be a routine night of pulling over drunk drivers and beating

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,920
 people up, but it turns out we're about to come face to face with a terror from beyond

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,920
 reality today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:40,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,280
 I'm your host Jason Garvenor, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,000
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,480
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and get started right away.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,440
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command with his head held high.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,640
 I'm going to give it up to one of our Christmas livestream contributors, Bishi Boshi.

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
 Woohoo!

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
 Yeah!

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,720
 Come on in Bishi Boshi.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
 Walking on into Dead Rabbit Command.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,960
 Bishi, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,120
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,160
 Just helps for the livestream.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
 Just helps for the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,720
 Like I said, I'm going to be doing these next two episodes a week, more of original

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,080
 episodes and then two weeks of classics.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,480
 I don't have to go on vacation, it's this big thing.

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,600
 So I won't be recording stuff, I'll be in another city.

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,360
 But I'm trying to give you as much content as possible.

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,920
 Two weeks of classics episodes and then one week off where there'll be no new stuff.

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,800
 I'll still be doing the TikToks on the YouTube channel if you guys want to follow me there.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,600
 But I plan on doing at least one livestream, possibly two, because I want to keep you guys

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
 entertained.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,080
 And I just also just took a two week break and I hate leaving you guys.

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,080
 So we'll probably be doing at least one livestream, maybe two.

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,000
 So if you want to be a part of that, subscribe on the YouTube channel so you will be alerted

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 when that happens.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I guess I should give you guys dates right now.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,720
 I'm like, I don't know when I want to do it.

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,080
 I guess I should figure that out.

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,480
 I'll announce that next week.

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,480
 Bishibashi, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

40
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,600
 We're going to jump off the highest point at Dead Rabbit Command and glide all the way

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 out too.

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
 Thailand.

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:25,040
 We're headed out to Thailand.

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,720
 Specifically we're going to a place called Mewang.

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,440
 And it's July 12th, 2022.

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,240
 So very, very recent story.

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,080
 There's this scrap yard in Mewang.

48
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,480
 So the cops are like, okay, that car got destroyed.

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,960
 Bring it on into the scrap yard.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,320
 And then the giant crane picks up the car.

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,920
 And it's like, okay, I've never, ever been in a scrap yard.

52
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,880
 I've only seen them in cartoons.

53
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,760
 And the movie 13 Ghosts is how I imagine they are, right?

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,480
 You have like a burly guy sitting in a hot, sweaty booth.

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,400
 And he's like, oh yeah, yeah, it's not even working there.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,800
 That's just some guy who lives in this sweat lodge.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
 And then you have the actual boss.

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,760
 He's just a normal guy.

59
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
 He's waving to us.

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,240
 We're waving at him too.

61
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,560
 Someone else is controlling the crane.

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,120
 And my cars are getting crushed and turning into little cubes.

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
 That happens, right?

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,000
 That's what happens at scrap yards.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,280
 But at this scrap yard, maybe things are different or maybe this is how scrap yards normally

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
 are.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,960
 What happened was back on July 12th, 2022 at this scrap yard, the scrap yard owner, we

68
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
 don't have his name.

69
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,640
 This story is really interesting because although we don't have the names of the participants,

70
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,960
 this story was widely reported in Thailand.

71
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,000
 I found multiple sources, video footage of this stuff.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,840
 So it's a story that's not an urban legend.

73
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,760
 Like you will see in the show notes, you'll see clips.

74
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,800
 You can click on and watch the video of the events that are about to unfold.

75
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,760
 Okay, I should say part of the events, right?

76
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
 Because you're like, what?

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
 That part, that was the most interesting part.

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,440
 How come that wasn't on video?

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,280
 Okay, so we're at this scrap yard and we're going to meet this scrap yard owner.

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,440
 It's just called Tony.

81
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,400
 And Tony's out walking around one day through the scrap yard.

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,400
 He's like, all these cars, so many cars, so little time.

83
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,920
 I probably should get to work instead of walking around waxing poetic about my job.

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,640
 I probably should get to work.

85
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,280
 He's walking around the scrap yard though and he sees sitting out in just in between these

86
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,760
 two cars, a giant stuffed Hello Kitty doll.

87
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,880
 Just things like a good three feet tall.

88
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,040
 It's pretty big and he's like, what in the world?

89
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,760
 He's looking at the Hello Kitty doll.

90
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,120
 Now the Hello Kitty doll he's quite familiar with.

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,640
 It's not that he didn't expect to see a Hello Kitty doll at the scrap yard.

92
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,880
 There is a Hello Kitty doll at the scrap yard.

93
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,400
 But the curious thing is, is for the past month, it's been sitting in a car about, I don't

94
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,280
 know, 10 feet away, 20 feet away.

95
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,600
 But here it is sitting.

96
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,080
 It's been removed from that car that's been sitting at the scrap yard for a month and

97
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
 here it is on the ground.

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
 And he's like, what?

99
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,600
 How did it end up on the ground?

100
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,800
 He goes and he decides to check the video footage.

101
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:24,320
 So he begins watching the video footage and he goes, interesting, interesting.

102
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,840
 Let's go back in time to just the month previous.

103
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
 May 2022.

104
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,360
 So a little more than a month, right?

105
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
 May 2022.

106
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,600
 A young woman was driving her car and in the backseat, she, this is so crazy that this

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
 is a real story.

108
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,560
 It sounds like an urban legend, but again, there's video footage of this, not this part.

109
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,480
 The video footage shows, okay, I'll tell you that in a second.

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,480
 So anyways, this woman is driving her car down the road and in the backseat, she has

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,200
 this giant Hello Kitty doll.

112
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,080
 That's like three foot tall Hello Kitty doll.

113
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,240
 One of her friends bought it for her, for a birthday present.

114
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,720
 And so she has it in the backseat and it's just chilling there.

115
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,880
 But the woman gets in a horrific car accident and dies.

116
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,360
 After she'd been removed from the wreck, there's just this mangled car sitting there.

117
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,480
 And it's not like completely busted up, but you know, it's, it's ruined, right?

118
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,400
 And the driver's dead.

119
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,480
 And the car is eventually taken to the scrapyard.

120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,960
 I don't think the police like take it there that night.

121
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
 I think the family has a chance of like, you know, getting stuff out of it or stuff like

122
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
 that.

123
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,360
 They're like, nope, not only is your daughter dead, but all of her belongings have become

124
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,200
 a cube in a junkyard.

125
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,800
 No, no, at some point though, the car was taken to the scrapyard and the Hello Kitty doll

126
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,560
 was in the car when that happened.

127
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,520
 And so from May to July 12th, that Hello Kitty doll was just sitting in the backseat of this

128
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,880
 car, this same car where the woman had died in.

129
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,400
 And for over a month, everyone who walked by the car would see there was a giant Hello

130
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,680
 Kitty doll and it completely untouched.

131
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,080
 You couldn't even tell that it was in a horrific car accident, right?

132
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,560
 It wasn't covered in blood or anything like that.

133
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,320
 It was just sitting in the backseat.

134
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,920
 So that's how he knew.

135
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,400
 That's how Tony was that was that what I named them.

136
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,680
 That's how Tony knew that there is a Hello Kitty doll at the scrapyard.

137
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,560
 The question is how did it get 20 feet away?

138
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,600
 So he's reviewing video and the scrapyard is by a street.

139
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,000
 Obviously they don't airlift in the cars.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It's by a street.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,560
 The people walk down and there's, he finds us on video and this is the video you'll see

142
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
 in the news reports.

143
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,080
 A man and a woman are walking down the street and something catches their eye and you see

144
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,480
 them walk over to the car and the girl steals the Hello Kitty doll out of the backseat of

145
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,640
 the car and then they walk off frame.

146
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,640
 They go home.

147
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,960
 That explains how it got out of the car, but how did it end up here in between these two

148
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
 cars?

149
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,920
 Like when did that happen?

150
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,280
 So the scrapyard owner continues to watch video and he watches about 2 a.m. that night

151
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,720
 after the Hello Kitty doll was stolen.

152
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,080
 The same man from before and his little puppy are walking down the street super early in

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,360
 the morning and he's carrying the Hello Kitty doll.

154
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
 He just drops it off.

155
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,400
 He just drops it in between two cars, turns around, walks away.

156
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,600
 The scrapyard owner realizes, I think I know what's going on.

157
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
 He had a theory.

158
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,600
 He goes, "I bet you anything that the doll was haunting."

159
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,880
 He just kind of had a feeling about that and sure enough, according to reports, the suspects

160
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,520
 were identified and when they were questioned about, "Well, we know you broke into this

161
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,240
 car and you took the doll.

162
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
 Why did you bring it back?"

163
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,480
 This is the story that we've heard as well.

164
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,200
 That night, that same night they took that doll, right?

165
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
 They took the doll during the day.

166
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:46,440
 It's a very clear video, but when they went to bed that night, the woman saw a black

167
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,800
 figure, a black silhouette in the shape of a little girl standing in her bedroom and

168
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,720
 then suddenly the woman began to feel some sort of force choking her.

169
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 She couldn't breathe.

170
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,640
 She felt some sort of invisible presence in her room trying to kill her.

171
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,560
 She ordered her boyfriend to get rid of the doll.

172
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,200
 He was trying to choke her.

173
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,080
 He was all dressed in a green screen outfit.

174
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,600
 He's hoping he would blend in with the background.

175
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,320
 He's like, "Oh, I forgot to add the special effects."

176
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
 He's like, "Yeah, honey.

177
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
 I will get rid.

178
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,700
 I'm such a brave boy.

179
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,960
 I will take this haunted doll and get rid of it."

180
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,920
 That's the video footage of them coming back and dropping it off.

181
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,040
 That's the story of the haunted Hello Kitty doll.

182
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
 What's interesting is I've read multiple sources on this.

183
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,400
 I first found it on Coast to Coast AM's website.

184
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
 It's a great website.

185
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,800
 It's one of the seven websites I check every single day.

186
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,440
 So many good stories from that website.

187
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
 So many great articles.

188
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,960
 I actually read two papers from Thailand, two websites from Thailand.

189
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,920
 One I had to use translation and the grammar was all crazy.

190
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,600
 The other one was far more concise.

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
 It was written in English and it basically laid out the same story.

192
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,880
 I do have questions.

193
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,640
 I don't know why we don't know anyone's names.

194
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,760
 I find it very odd, I guess, that the police would bother investigating the theft of a

195
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,840
 Hello Kitty doll.

196
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,760
 It doesn't really say that the scrapyard owner recognized them.

197
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,840
 How did we get the second part of the story?

198
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,340
 I don't know.

199
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,560
 But we sure enough do have video footage.

200
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,160
 Whether or not the ghost girl is an added detail, because you do start to play a game

201
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,240
 of telephone at a certain point, I'm not for sure.

202
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
 But the articles say that's what happened.

203
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,120
 But we know for sure that the doll was taken and then a couple hours later the doll was

204
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,560
 brought back in the middle of the night.

205
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,120
 So everything does kind of track.

206
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,680
 It's a great new story.

207
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
 And this is a conspiracy theory.

208
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,000
 I've talked about it a lot on this show.

209
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,280
 I haven't talked about it in probably two, three hundred episodes, but this doll's gone

210
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
 now.

211
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,720
 I can almost guarantee it.

212
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,960
 I believe that there are organizations, either private collectors or government institutions

213
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,320
 that would want this doll.

214
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 Right?

215
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,240
 If you had something that was possessed, you would want it.

216
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
 I mean, think about it.

217
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,120
 I dropped what was it, $30, $20, $30 to buy a haunted doll.

218
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
 And it's not haunted.

219
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,680
 I mean, I haven't seen anything here.

220
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
 Well, I say that now.

221
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,600
 And I'm constantly talking about ghosts in my apartment, but a little Veronica, right?

222
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,240
 That's an old school, again, topic on the show.

223
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,640
 Somebody would want this, right?

224
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,680
 If this was provably a haunted thing, whether it'd be like Zach Baggins or like some other

225
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,680
 researcher or a collector of ghost stuff, or even like someone who collected stuff that

226
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,960
 was macabre, you know, a birthday present that was sitting in the back of the car and

227
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,800
 a woman was killed in the car.

228
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 Or I also think that, I think, again, I don't want to go too much off in a tangent.

229
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,880
 I've talked about this before, but we know that the government investigates UFOs and

230
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,240
 we know that government investigates psychic phenomenon.

231
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:57,480
 I am sure I will bet money that the government also investigates demonic activity and ghosts.

232
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,920
 I really believe that.

233
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,800
 I think that no one will ever admit to it because it sounds so foolish.

234
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,200
 And I bet you there are people in the government, there is a government job, there's a government

235
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,720
 job where you go around collecting items like this.

236
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
 I do believe that.

237
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
 That's one of my conspiracy theories.

238
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,160
 And it might sound like one of the more outlandish ones, but they investigate paranormal phenomenon

239
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,440
 like remote viewing and telepathy and things like that.

240
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,720
 And they investigate UFOs.

241
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,520
 So why wouldn't they investigate ghosts?

242
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,600
 Which could be technically our biggest national security issue is ghosts, right?

243
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,840
 They can walk into your base.

244
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,120
 You know, like you're sitting there, you're guarding a bunch of nuclear bombs and then

245
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,120
 this dude comes in, he's rattling chains, he's floating, little casserole guys floating

246
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,400
 around, you're like, stop him and he's like floating into the missile and he's like pulling

247
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,720
 wires out and stuff like that.

248
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,640
 Like whatever government controls ghosts first could totally win, right?

249
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,680
 Why do you need a remote viewer if you can just be like going to the graveyard and being

250
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
 like, hey, you guys aren't doing anything, right?

251
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,320
 And the ghosts are like coming out and they're like, why don't you go spy on our enemies?

252
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,680
 They're the ones who killed you in the first place.

253
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
 And they're like, what?

254
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
 I thought I died of old age.

255
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,520
 You're like, yes, but old age wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Soviet Russia.

256
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,480
 So then you have these ghosts floating around and they're like floating around Russian stuff

257
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
 like that.

258
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,440
 They're like poking their heads and like looking at battle plans.

259
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,620
 And then you could even have ghosts like scaring people, right?

260
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,680
 Like the Navy SEALs are getting ready to take a base and they're like, okay, go, go, go.

261
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,520
 And then like a ghost is floating in front of them.

262
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,680
 It's like from Return of the King or whatever it was.

263
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,000
 Oh, that scene was so dumb.

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,760
 I thought that was such, I never read the books.

265
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,200
 I was like, what if there were a bunch of ghosts show up?

266
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,560
 They trained for this giant battle.

267
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,760
 They went on this giant mission and they're like, oh, let's get some ghosts to fight.

268
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,260
 You have a good, no, I'm just saying that maybe that's real.

269
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,920
 And then the ghost like goes into the base and the commander's like, okay, enemy troops,

270
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,160
 you go here and then we do this stuff.

271
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,240
 You go over here and he's giving these plans and he's like, now it's time to take a shower.

272
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,400
 But you guys are fighting.

273
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,660
 He's taking a shower in the bathrooms all steamy and stuff.

274
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,880
 And then like the ghost sneaks in is like putting like spooky handprints on the window

275
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,400
 and he's like, ah, and then it's writing stuff on the mirror like your next or move all your

276
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,800
 troops to the West flank.

277
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,560
 And he's like, ah, and then he's so scared.

278
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,200
 He's like, okay, guys, go to the West flank and then the Navy SEAL is coming the other

279
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
 way.

280
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
 Maybe, right?

281
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
 Okay.

282
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,800
 This is ridiculous as that sound, it would work.

283
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
 It would work.

284
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,480
 There's a bunch of military commanders all since episode.

285
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,560
 They're like, let's try this.

286
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,800
 That is insane.

287
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
 Let's try it.

288
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,260
 I would totally, if I had the means, like if I was a government entity, I would totally

289
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,420
 try to get this doll, right?

290
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:40,860
 Little girl ghost ride choking out military officials, assassinating political leaders.

291
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,420
 They're like, sir, we don't know what killed this man.

292
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,960
 We've been with this Hello Kitty doll in the prime minister's office.

293
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,540
 We don't know if it's evidence or not.

294
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,100
 You could totally do stuff like that.

295
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,020
 What I have, let's get back to the real story.

296
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,400
 Let's get back to the stuff that's realistic and actually in the story.

297
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,980
 Woman dies in car.

298
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
 Little girl ghost.

299
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,840
 I find that very interesting.

300
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:13,380
 If the haunting part of it is accurate, she didn't appear as the age she died.

301
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,800
 She appeared as the age of a little girl.

302
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,440
 That's just an interesting phenomenon, right?

303
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,400
 You could say skeptically, like the reason why she saw a little girl, because she thought

304
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,260
 it belonged to a little girl and her mind made up the image of a little girl and her

305
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,020
 mind made up the image of her being choked.

306
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,660
 But yeah, I could a ghost show up as its younger form, like that old lady from Titanic, right?

307
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:41,900
 She showed up as hot Kate Winslet instead of old lady.

308
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:47,700
 So maybe based on that documentary I saw, Titanic, ghosts show up at different ages.

309
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,740
 That would suck to be like, yeah, I've lived to be 106 and then you die and you're like,

310
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,360
 yeah, I wish I had died when I was 32 when I could actually jog and stuff like that.

311
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,280
 I'd be a healthy ghost instead of an old spooky ghost.

312
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
 But who knows?

313
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
 Who knows?

314
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,240
 That's why I got my new catchphrase for this show, because sometimes I'm like, I don't

315
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
 know how to wrap up that segment.

316
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
 I've kind of said everything.

317
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,520
 And otherwise, I'm just going to keep talking.

318
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,120
 Bishi Bashi, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter we are leaving

319
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
 behind Thailand.

320
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,080
 We're going to head all the way out to the Philippines.

321
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,500
 We're in the Philippines.

322
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,780
 Specifically, we're in the city of Manila.

323
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,780
 It's May 10th, 1951.

324
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,140
 And it's a nice warm evening, but there's a thunderstorm rolling in.

325
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,620
 So people know they better enjoy it while they can because pretty soon it's going to

326
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,620
 rain.

327
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:46,780
 It's going to be spooky out.

328
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,520
 And on this night, there are two officers, two police officers, they're on a routine

329
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,280
 patrol and all of a sudden they get a call for a disturbance at a local waterfront bar.

330
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
 So they're like, let's go.

331
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,560
 And they drive over there.

332
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,960
 And as they're getting closer to the bar, they see there's a crowd of people outside

333
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
 the bar.

334
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,720
 And they have that must be disturbance.

335
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,480
 Something must be going on over there.

336
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,760
 So they jump out of the car and they run over.

337
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,920
 And as they're going over there, they hear a woman screaming, "Keep it away from me.

338
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
 Keep it away from me.

339
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
 Help me.

340
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
 Help me get it off me."

341
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
 And the cops are like, "What in the world is going on?"

342
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,740
 And they get into the crowd of people that start pushing people away and they see a

343
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,700
 young woman rolling around on the ground.

344
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,420
 And everyone is just standing around her.

345
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,380
 They have no idea what's going on.

346
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,980
 Now the police thought they would show up and, you know, like she'd be getting attacked

347
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,780
 by a dog or another person or something like that, right?

348
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,420
 But they had no idea this woman was just going to be rolling around on the ground all by herself.

349
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
 They're all disappointed.

350
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,540
 They're like, "Oh, I wanted to fight a dog tonight."

351
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,200
 She's just rolling around on the ground and she just keeps screaming, "Keep it away.

352
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
 Keep it away.

353
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
 Why isn't anyone helping me?

354
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
 Keep it away.

355
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,680
 I can't stand the pain.

356
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
 Stop.

357
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
 Stop."

358
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
 The cops are like, "Oh, okay.

359
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
 This woman's nuts, right?

360
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,280
 This must just be some crazy lady."

361
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
 We'll pick her up.

362
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,480
 They're on the back of the squad car.

363
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
 Take her to the hospital.

364
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
 The police station.

365
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
 We'll figure it out, right?

366
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,280
 But before they can do that, as this woman is writhing on the ground screaming about

367
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,180
 something that no one can see but her, the police officers and the other people in the

368
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,500
 crowd begin to see teeth marks appear on her body.

369
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
 Stop.

370
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 It hurts so God.

371
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 And they're watching.

372
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,980
 It looks like just someone is digging their teeth right into her neck.

373
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,820
 The unmistakable sight of a set of teeth biting into this woman and they're watching these

374
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,740
 bites appear on her neck and on her arms.

375
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,640
 The officers grab the girl and they pick her up and they drag her to the car and the entire

376
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,040
 time she's fighting them, "Get them off me, please.

377
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
 Help me.

378
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
 Help me."

379
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,760
 She's completely lost in this insane haze.

380
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,880
 And the officers don't know what to do.

381
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,920
 There's nothing attacking her, but they're clearly seeing the marks of an attack just

382
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,520
 appear on her body.

383
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,520
 They have to handcuff her because she's fighting them so hard.

384
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
 They handcuff her.

385
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,360
 They put her in the back of the squad car and they take off.

386
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,820
 They're driving at top speed back to the police station.

387
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,940
 I don't know if all police stations have this.

388
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
 I don't know.

389
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
 I've never heard of this before.

390
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,940
 But apparently there's a thing called the police doctor where it sounds like the great

391
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,620
 idea for a show actually.

392
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,620
 It's a doctor who's at the police station who I imagine just like, "What do you do?

393
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,780
 How often do you have to render medical aid to..."

394
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,220
 Actually, not that I think about it.

395
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,520
 It's probably a pretty good idea to have a trained medical expert at a police station

396
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,920
 because people are constantly coming in from fights, getting roughed up by the police,

397
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,680
 car accidents, stuff like that, DUIs and things like that.

398
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,960
 So it would make sense to have a police doctor.

399
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,320
 I don't know if they actually exist or maybe they did exist at one point.

400
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,400
 It actually seems like it'd be a pretty exciting job.

401
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,160
 But anyways, they go, "Let's take her to the police doctor."

402
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,020
 Driving on the road, "Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo."

403
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,380
 On the loudspeaker, "Get out of the way, get out of the way!"

404
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
 And get the police doctor.

405
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,380
 Call the police doctor.

406
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
 It's like, "What?

407
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,380
 We're just civilians.

408
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,380
 We're on the side of the street.

409
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,140
 Why are you telling us who to call?"

410
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,140
 Car is driving on the road.

411
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,700
 Eventually they get her to the police station and the entire ride.

412
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,940
 She's been screaming in the back seat, "Save me, save me.

413
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,460
 They're gonna get me."

414
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,760
 Now again, police deal with this type of insanity all the time, but they're not used to seeing

415
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
 just bite marks appear on people.

416
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,760
 So they still don't really know how to figure this out.

417
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,560
 They take her into the station.

418
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,320
 They take her into the police station and there's the police doctor.

419
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
 He's sitting there.

420
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,000
 I'm just reading the newspaper or something.

421
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,280
 We're just waiting for someone to come in injured.

422
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,440
 And he jumps up and he takes a look at her.

423
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,920
 At some point you're able to identify who this person is.

424
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,540
 Her name is Clarita Villanueva.

425
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,460
 Clarita Villanueva, right?

426
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,020
 And the police doctor takes one look at her and goes, "I think she's just having a bad

427
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,500
 reaction to some drugs.

428
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
 That's what it looks like."

429
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,900
 And the police officer's like, "Yeah, we would think that too."

430
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,900
 But then the invisible bites start to appear.

431
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,180
 The police doctor's like, "What are you talking about?

432
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
 Invisible bites?"

433
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,100
 The officer's like, "Yeah, I know.

434
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
 It's super weird."

435
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:24,960
 Apparently not only do they have a police doctor at this police station, they have two doctors.

436
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,840
 Because another doctor came and saw her and goes, "Well, not only is drugs, I think it's

437
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,340
 an epileptic fit.

438
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,160
 I think she's having a seizure."

439
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,240
 But anyways, whatever the case is, they don't know what to do with her, right?

440
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,720
 She's too violent to take to a hospital.

441
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,560
 We'll just put her in the cell and she'll be safe.

442
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,240
 Like if it is drugs, she'll sleep it off.

443
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,760
 If she's having a seizure, hopefully she'll sleep it off.

444
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
 We'll just put her in the cell.

445
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,660
 So they drag her in there, they take her handcuffs off, they put her in the cell.

446
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,740
 And at that point, she's pleading with him, "Don't leave me alone.

447
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,780
 Please, please, please, please, don't leave me alone in here."

448
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,180
 And they're just shutting the cell door.

449
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,460
 "No, Sybys, please, please, don't leave me alone.

450
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
 He's gonna come back.

451
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,940
 He's gonna come back."

452
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,420
 They walk away.

453
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,460
 A couple minutes pass and it's a couple quiet minutes, right?

454
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,300
 The police station's a little quieter.

455
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,740
 Thunderstorm has grown a little closer outside, but everything's quiet in the police station

456
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:21,720
 for a moment until she begins to scream even louder this time.

457
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,640
 Screams are echoing through the police station.

458
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,040
 A couple police officers run into the jail area to check on her and they do not see anything

459
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,480
 except for her in the cell.

460
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,120
 And she is standing there screaming.

461
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,440
 She goes, "He's in the cell with me.

462
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,680
 He's in the cell with me.

463
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
 You have to help me.

464
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
 You have to let me out.

465
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
 You have to let me out.

466
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
 He's gonna get me."

467
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,440
 And there's just no one in there.

468
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,460
 And she describes this...

469
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,340
 Someone must have asked, "Who's in the cell with you?

470
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,340
 What does he look like?"

471
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,340
 Because they don't see anything.

472
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,020
 And she described him as a man.

473
00:22:53,020 --> 00:23:03,620
 He was floating in front of her and he had large, bulging eyes and a cape, which sounds

474
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,100
 dumb, admittedly, right?

475
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
 It sounds pretty stupid.

476
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,140
 Like, you're over for some demon.

477
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,460
 You're over for some horrible monster man.

478
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,120
 He's like, he looks like beyond description, something from the darkest pages of the creepiest

479
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
 horror novel ever.

480
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,840
 And it's a dude with a cape and bulging eyes.

481
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,680
 So this is the man who was attacking her outside the bar.

482
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,640
 And the officers are like, "Oh, that's..."

483
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,120
 The officers are super disappointed.

484
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,720
 They're like, "Oh, that is gonna be speaker than that."

485
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,160
 And as they're complaining about her hellish hallucinations, all of a sudden more bite

486
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,880
 marks begin to appear all over her body.

487
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,820
 Now you don't have just the original two officers and the people outside the bar who

488
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,020
 are saying this and who knows what level of drunk they were.

489
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,420
 Now you have even more police officers clearly seeing these bites appear on her body.

490
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:57,180
 They summon the doctor, they bring the chief of police in, and they're like, "Listen, what

491
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:02,780
 the original officer said was true, this woman is just bites are appearing all over her body."

492
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,420
 And at that point, the doctor is looking at the bite wounds and he goes, "These are not

493
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,420
 self-inflicted."

494
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,040
 Which should have been obvious if she had bites on her neck.

495
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,000
 It's kind of hard to bite your own neck.

496
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,560
 The girl, she's in such a state of panic, but apparently the assault has stopped.

497
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:26,400
 She was so freaked out about all this, she actually becomes exhausted and passes out.

498
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,680
 She just falls asleep.

499
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,040
 And the doctor goes, "Let her sleep.

500
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,720
 Tomorrow we'll take her to the hospital where we'll see what's going on.

501
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
 It seems to be fine now."

502
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,220
 The doctor is walking away, he's making sure there's not a man with a cape floating behind

503
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,780
 him.

504
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,980
 Next morning she wakes up, they're getting ready to take her to the hospital.

505
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:51,140
 They call in an ambulance, she's walking down the hallways of the police station.

506
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,740
 She begins screaming again.

507
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,100
 This ended once she fell asleep, but now she's screaming again, "It's back!

508
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
 It's back!

509
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
 It's back!

510
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,100
 Oh no, it's back!"

511
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,780
 And the police are now having to force her through the police station because she wants

512
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,760
 to run.

513
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,560
 She's put in the back of the ambulance.

514
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,160
 The police officers say, "Good luck guys, this one's a weird one."

515
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
 Huh?

516
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,640
 The ambulance driver says, "Woo, woo, woo."

517
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,280
 Ambulance starts driving on the road and the woman in the back is now screaming, "There's

518
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,080
 two of them!

519
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,560
 There's two of them!"

520
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,880
 And there are paramedics sitting in the back of the ambulance and sure enough they see

521
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,560
 these bite marks appear on her body.

522
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,060
 You now have had it spread over a long period of time.

523
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,580
 It's not a rash, not a stress rash.

524
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,340
 We're seeing this phenomenon happen over and over and over again with entirely new sets

525
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
 of witnesses.

526
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:48,660
 They finally reach the hospital and the attacks completely stop.

527
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,340
 And she's in the hospital for a couple of days and she's put under a 24 hour guard.

528
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,940
 Because how else would you...

529
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,060
 You would know that this was impossible, but you're clearly seeing it happening and multiple

530
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,520
 people are seeing it happening.

531
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,280
 Like you know that on the one hand she must be crazy, but on the other hand she's going

532
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:14,200
 crazy because she's being attacked by this invisible force.

533
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,720
 It's interesting, so we have these descriptions of these people and I read and reread this

534
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,440
 story over and over again to try to figure out so these attackers, the way I figured

535
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,460
 it out was this, the very first attacker, man, bulging eyes, a cape, and he could levitate,

536
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,060
 he was invisible obviously and he was biting her.

537
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:42,140
 The two attackers she described in the ambulance, it wasn't clear if one of them was the same

538
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,660
 as the man with the cape because there was a bit of a different description, but the

539
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,860
 two attackers in the ambulance actually I think were two separate entities apart from

540
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,860
 the first one.

541
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:57,080
 It was almost like she was being attacked by a menagerie of these paranormal fiends.

542
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,520
 Two attacks in the ambulance, one was described as a big hairy human with black fur, black

543
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,200
 hair, sharp canine teeth, and a beard.

544
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,920
 And then the second one, oh and that one also had feet three times the size as normal human

545
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,040
 feet.

546
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,660
 The second one in the ambulance was three feet tall, also black hair covering its entire

547
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,160
 body and it was very ugly.

548
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,300
 So I don't know if she was implying the other two were kind of cute.

549
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,380
 It was hard to tell, I think it was three different entities or the guy with the cape also was

550
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,220
 the dude with the giant feet and was all hairy.

551
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:42,700
 I think it was three different entities, but that was the case of Clarita Villanueva.

552
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,180
 They never, it's interesting because on the one hand list and those creature descriptions

553
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:52,680
 sound like if you gave your nephew a pack of crayons and said draw me a picture of a monster

554
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,600
 that's what you draw, right?

555
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,680
 Just really goofy stuff that doesn't make sense.

556
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,000
 Oh and he has bulging eyes and a cape and you're like I'll try again buddy.

557
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,760
 And then he's all sweating, he's feeling the pressure, he's like oh I didn't know this

558
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,720
 was a test.

559
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,960
 Giant feet and hairy, I mean technically that's big, but you know what I mean like a beard

560
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,760
 floating around in an ambulance like the creature descriptions are kind of weird.

561
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,180
 We do have a date, we have an exact date, we have a name which I always like, we have

562
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,900
 a location which I always like, we have multiple witnesses, this story takes place over the

563
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,860
 period of time with multiple witnesses, but that's all we have.

564
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:33,940
 I got this story from ThinkAbout@Docs.com and what gives this story really a lot of legitimacy

565
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:39,420
 is that this story was originally reported by one of the original pioneers of UFOology,

566
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,980
 a man named Frank Edwards.

567
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:50,480
 He was one of the very first major media figures, it may have cost him some jobs people feel

568
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,360
 that who believed in the UFO phenomenon?

569
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:01,760
 Like 1947 like Kenneth Arnold flying his plane, saw a fleet of UFOs, he said they moved like

570
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,920
 if you skipped a saucer over the lake.

571
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,920
 He didn't say they looked like saucers, he actually thought they had like a boomerang

572
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,140
 shape but because he used the term saucer and I'm talking like a saucer, we don't really

573
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,500
 use them anymore do we?

574
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,020
 Little saucer you put your teak up in.

575
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,020
 The term flying saucer is actually a misnomer, he said they moved, it's so interesting to

576
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,260
 think about that right?

577
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,220
 The very first guy, the very first mass UFO sighting.

578
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,660
 This was long before Roswell became a national story right?

579
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,260
 You just had the idea something might have happened in the desert of New Mexico but and

580
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,980
 then no one ever talked about it again.

581
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:39,000
 Kenneth Arnold flying he saw a fleet of UFOs, he said they moved like a saucer skimming

582
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,040
 on the water.

583
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:47,080
 So almost like they go up and down and up and down and up and down, they didn't glide,

584
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,760
 they didn't go faster, they didn't do these maneuvers that no plane could ever do before,

585
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,840
 they just had this weird movement to them and from that term we now have the word flying

586
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,920
 saucers and we have UFOs appearing as discs but that's not what he saw, I find that so

587
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,420
 fascinating, I almost had a whole segment on that but it was kind of boring, it was

588
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,220
 kind of dry so I'm just talking about it a little bit here but how someone can make,

589
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,340
 like the chupacabra does not exist, that's the one cryptid that I will flat out say

590
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,780
 doesn't exist.

591
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:19,380
 All of the chupacabra stories can be traced back to one woman who had some mental problems

592
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,020
 and she saw the movie Species and thought it was insider knowledge, she thought it was

593
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,980
 predictive programming, she thought the government was trying to tell us that the movie Species

594
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,040
 actually existed and that's why the chupacabra, the description of it is basically a short

595
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,400
 alien from the movie Species with the stuff coming out of the back of its head and stuff

596
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
 like that.

597
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,160
 Chupacabra we can tell the person who first reported it, there's a famous book called

598
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,160
 I think it's Hunting the Chupacabra or Chasing the Chupacabra, that's a government trying

599
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,920
 to be loud in their car so I don't reveal the truth but so we know that that cryptid

600
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,440
 doesn't exist, every story that is about the chupacabra before that event is 100% made

601
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
 up.

602
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,140
 When they go no there's reports in 1800's and other weren't, they didn't exist and

603
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,580
 any report going forward and what's interesting so I don't necessarily, if someone comes

604
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,180
 out and they find that their chickens have been mutilated, I'm not saying that that guy's

605
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,140
 lying, that might be a real phenomenon but it's not a chupacabra, chupacabras do not

606
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,460
 exist, they just don't.

607
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,660
 And so it's weird because people really believe in that but it doesn't exist, the chupacabra

608
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,960
 we know for a fact does not exist, we can trace it back to one person so when we look

609
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,200
 at the phenomenon of the UFO shaped like a disc, shaped like a turned upside down saucer,

610
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,000
 that's not what he said, that's not even what he saw.

611
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,320
 But when someone put that out there and the newspaper started running headlines, flying

612
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,520
 saucers, people then started to see what he was misquoted seeing, I find that so fascinating,

613
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,120
 so fascinating, it goes all into the world of tulpas and things like that but anyways,

614
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,980
 Frank Edwards, 1947, like you had the Kenneth Arnold thing, someone gave Frank Edwards a

615
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:04,140
 book, he was like mildly interested in paranormal phenomenon, someone gave him a book about

616
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,660
 flying saucers about Kenneth Arnold and this guy would, the equivalent to him nowadays would

617
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:16,020
 probably be like a, not like content wise, not like, but reach wise would probably be

618
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:26,120
 on the level of a Tucker Carlson or Steven Colbert or a big media personality, a big

619
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:33,920
 media guy, a Don LeMond type of figure and he didn't just do news, he did all sorts of

620
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,400
 stuff but then he starts talking about UFOs, it would be a level of, no one was talking

621
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,080
 about it and people believe that it did cost him work because people are like dude you're

622
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,340
 nuts, he began to write all these books about UFOology and he became super super into the

623
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,980
 phenomenon, he was one of the leading people who talked about this, so the fact that he

624
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:59,140
 researched this, that he was into this adds in a ton of credibility, a ton of credibility,

625
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,300
 I find it super fascinating, obviously it's very scary, we don't even know, this is one

626
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,020
 of those things that doesn't even sound super alien, it sounds more spiritual, sounds more

627
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,280
 demonic, right, that type of assault but who knows, it's one of those phenomenons that

628
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,760
 we don't see very often, right, it sounds like a demonic attack, we actually just covered

629
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,040
 that story yesterday where the guy got his back scratched when he was recording the

630
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,000
 cursed album but it's a terrifying event and it's one that we don't have a key piece

631
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,440
 of information, what started this?

632
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,420
 You know what I mean, and I want to know what started this so we can avoid it, because if

633
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,740
 this woman was messing with some dark spirits, if this woman was reading the Necromanon for

634
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,900
 example or doing a Ouija ceremony out in the middle of a graveyard or just opening herself

635
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:54,500
 up to dark influences, I'm gonna be like she deserved it, she deserved to get bit, but

636
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,020
 we would know and we could avoid that stuff but if this is just something that happened

637
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:01,100
 to her randomly, there's a bunch of people at a waterfront bar, they're watching the

638
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,680
 thunderstorm roll in, they're getting as many drinks as they can and then before they have

639
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:11,480
 to walk home in the rain, out of all those people at that bar, these entity chose her

640
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:20,680
 to torment, chose her to devour, like why her, that's always the question when we look at

641
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:28,160
 these paranormal phenomenon, why that person, someone moves in a haunted house, they're

642
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:35,460
 gonna have ghosts, someone involves themselves in the dark arts, they're gonna invite demonic

643
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:42,940
 activity into their lives, that's not always the case, you can steal the Hello Kitty doll

644
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,220
 and be haunted by the ghosts of the Hello Kitty doll or you could just be having a drink

645
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:55,260
 with friends one night and something latches on to you, that was my story right, remember

646
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,760
 I'll put it in the show notes, that episode I did, Solar Plexus Clown Gliders, I just

647
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,760
 happened to be sitting in a courtroom, I had a college assignment, I had to go watch a

648
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,920
 trial and write a paper on it and because I was in that room at a certain time, I feel

649
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,800
 like a dark energy latched on to me and I suffered for quite a long time, I was in serious

650
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:24,360
 pain, back pain because of that and then that caused a whole cascading effect, so did she

651
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:31,540
 invite this presence into her life or was she just chosen at random to suffer, it's a creepy
