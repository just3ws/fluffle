1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
 A cuddly cryptid, a woman washed away returns to the same place she was swept from a year

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:15,100
 and a half later, and then we take a look at the terrifying story of Texas' own Candy

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,360
 Lady.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,920
 Was there a woman leaving candy on children's windowsills?

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,080
 And did her trap work today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:34,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,920
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,920
 You are listening to the only podcast that will not discuss the Mueller Report this week.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,400
 I repeat, the only podcast.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,680
 The only podcast.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,680
 They are.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,160
 You don't have to worry about that at all.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,320
 This is your refuge from politics.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,120
 We're gonna go ahead and get started here now.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,480
 I kinda cheated in the beginning when I said it was a cuddly cryptid.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,920
 Let me go ahead and get started here.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,800
 So, I was sent this link the other day.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,880
 I'm gonna read this to you, and I want you to see if you- this is such a bizarre description.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,640
 I'm gonna read this to you, and I'm gonna see if you can guess the creature we're talking

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,360
 about.

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,480
 Its appearance is character- and I'm leaving out a few key details.

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,640
 Okay, 'cause otherwise it gives it away.

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:29,920
 Its appearance is characterized by dark blue hair, a huge mouth devoid of teeth, large

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,520
 bulging eyes.

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,800
 His voice is serious and abrupt, and his speech is simplified, using an abundance of infinitives

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,560
 and emitting other linguistic compliments.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,920
 His diet includes muffins, donuts, apples, bananas, lettuce, as well as other inedible

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,920
 items such as salt and pepper dispensers, traffic signs, towels, pins, typewriters,

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,840
 telephones, motorcycles, Peabody awards, a truck, a safe, a Volkswagen Beetle, and the

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,640
 letter of the day.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,800
 So that's the description of Cookie Monster.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,480
 That's the Spanish Wikipedia description of the Cookie Monster.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,040
 Now the English version of Cookie Monster does not have any of this, which I think is absolutely

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
 hilarious.

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
 The English version of Wikipedia is just like, you know who we're talking about.

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
 It's Cookie Monster.

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,440
 But the Spanish version decides to create this horrifying image of this creature with

41
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,360
 no missing all of his teeth and a huge mouth, bulging eyeballs, and I guess those are accurate

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,280
 descriptions of Cookie Monster, but they're terrifying nonetheless.

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,080
 The reason why I came across this was because in the previous episode I did about shape-shifting

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
 women who eat men.

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,320
 I think it was the title, something like that.

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,960
 It was maybe four or five episodes ago.

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,680
 I forget very quickly.

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,520
 I described there as one of the cryptid women, one of the shape-shifters, who was described

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,920
 as having cookie-like hair.

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,560
 And I actually had two listeners chime in on that.

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,680
 Both of them kind of said it's probably a translation error.

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,360
 On YouTube, Edward...

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,760
 Edward Baez?

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
 Baez?

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,240
 Anyways, Edward said maybe they meant like empanadas.

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,320
 Like it's the hair was flaky.

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,160
 And then Jimmy emailed me and he said maybe it's like churros.

58
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,400
 Like dreadlocks.

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,760
 I think it is a translation error.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,880
 According also to this Spanish Wikipedia page, Cookie Monster's best friend is Gustavo Frog.

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,000
 That's just weird to me.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,480
 I always thought Kermit the Frog was fairly...

63
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,760
 I know more about the history of Cookie Monster now than I ever thought I would know.

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,400
 Definitely more than I ever learned on Sesame Street.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
 He started off stealing cereal.

66
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
 His original name was the wheel.

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,000
 His original name was the Wheeljacker because he stole the wheel-shaped cereal.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And then there he...

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
 His best buddy was a guy named Flute Snatcher.

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
 Now I don't...

71
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,920
 Because he ate fruit...

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,080
 Because he stole flute-shaped cereal?

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,720
 Now again, those might be translation errors as well.

74
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,560
 But that's a little bit about...

75
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,720
 Who are we talking about again?

76
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,160
 Oh yeah, Cookie Monster.

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
 Cookie Monster.

78
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,960
 Also known as Mostro de la Galetes.

79
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,200
 So I think that's like Monster of the Cookies or something?

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,320
 And in Latin America, he simply goes by the name Lucas.

81
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,440
 And I guess when Disney bought...

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
 They used to have different names everywhere.

83
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,440
 When Disney bought them up, they said, "Nope, it's Kermit the Frog, it's Cookie Monster,

84
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
 they didn't...

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,080
 They used to localize everything."

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,960
 So now if you grew up with Gustavo Frog and Lucas running around, they're like, "Who

87
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
 is that guy?

88
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,080
 Who is the Cookie Monster?"

89
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,320
 Om nom nom nom nom.

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,560
 That might have gone on a little longer than I originally planned.

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,000
 I don't know, I found that fascinating.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,480
 And thanks guys for your explanations of cookie-like hair, they're probably pretty likely.

93
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
 Now we're gonna go on...

94
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,520
 You know, it's actually been a really interesting week.

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,720
 Conspiracy and weirdness-wise, I got a lot of stories that are fairly recent coming out.

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,280
 But one of the ones that popped up, like maybe in the past few days, was really bizarre.

97
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
 And from the first thing you hear, you're like, "That's absolutely impossible."

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,920
 And then you go, "But...

99
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
 Weirder things have happened."

100
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
 And then you keep reading into it and you're like...

101
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,960
 Yeah, I don't know.

102
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,880
 So we are going back a year.

103
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,160
 We're going back to January 2017 and we're traveling to the island of Java, the tastiest

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,400
 sounding island other than Cupcake Island.

105
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,320
 We go to Java Island.

106
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,560
 And we're sitting on the beach.

107
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,320
 We're enjoying the nice weather.

108
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
 It's beautiful out.

109
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,960
 There's sun, there's hot chicks walking around in bikinis.

110
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,760
 And we're just drinking a Mai Tai.

111
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,600
 I don't know what they drink there.

112
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,160
 We're drinking an alcoholic drink.

113
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,200
 We're drinking iced Java with some liquor in it.

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,520
 We're just hanging out.

115
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,600
 And we see this woman with her sister and I think one of their sons.

116
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
 She was with two other people.

117
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
 I'm just making up family members.

118
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,680
 Oh, it was like her eighth cousin.

119
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,720
 Now she was out there with at least her sister.

120
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
 I know that for sure.

121
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,720
 The woman's name is Naining Sunar-sir.

122
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,080
 Nairing Sunar-si.

123
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,680
 We'll just call her Naining.

124
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,000
 That probably pronounced that wrong as well.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,200
 But anyways, Naining, she was a 52 year old woman.

126
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,120
 She's out on a beach vacation with her sister and an other family member.

127
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,720
 Could be anyone in her genealogical tree.

128
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,320
 It's her great ancestor.

129
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
 They're out at the beach.

130
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
 They're enjoying the fun.

131
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

132
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

133
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

134
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

135
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

136
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

137
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

138
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

139
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

141
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

142
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

144
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

145
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

148
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

149
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

150
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

151
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

152
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

153
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

154
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

155
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

157
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

158
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

159
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320

 They're enjoying the sun.

364
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

365
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

366
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

367
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

368
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

369
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

370
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

371
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

372
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

373
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

374
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
 They're enjoying the sun.

375
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
 The Daily Mail.

376
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
 And I did read that article, by the way.

377
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
 Was it Sexy Spice?

378
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
 But anyway, it doesn't matter.

379
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 They banged.

380
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
 That's the point of that.

381
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,160
 So The Daily Mail is a tabloid, but it wasn't just in The Daily Mail.

382
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,680
 It's in a lot of paranormal websites.

383
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,160
 It's in a lot of like regular news websites, because it's such a bizarre story.

384
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
 Here's the kicker.

385
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,280
 So I started looking into this because I was like, "That's absolutely fascinating, if true."

386
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,720
 And it's kind of fascinating if it's not, because it just shows how quickly rumors spread.

387
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,120
 So I watched the video.

388
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,020
 I didn't understand a word of it.

389
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,920
 But I watched the video.

390
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,120
 And the video is purported to be her being taken off the beach and taken home.

391
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,960
 She's not wearing a yellow dress.

392
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,460
 She's wearing a blue top.

393
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,120
 So immediately I said, either she was taken somewhere else and they changed her clothes,

394
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,160
 or the videos fake.

395
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,240
 And it's being attached to this story.

396
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,560
 And sure enough, I found when I was continuing to research this, one of the articles said,

397
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,000
 "Here's some photos that are being purported to be Ninning, but these are actually photos

398
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,760
 of someone being let out of a mental hospital and taken home."

399
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,560
 And what's weird is that this footage and these photos are being used in almost every

400
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,600
 article, but only one pointed out, people on WhatsApp have identified that those photos

401
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
 are from a totally different news story in the same area.

402
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,960
 So that's not Ninning.

403
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,160
 Has nothing to do with this story.

404
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,400
 So right off the bat, the video evidence is not true at all.

405
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,720
 And then I go, "Okay, well that's a big spoiler."

406
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,600
 And now I'm thinking the story's false.

407
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,000
 And here's the thing.

408
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,960
 To me, this is the detail that stuck out.

409
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,680
 I will accept that someone can get swept out to sea and washed away and go into some sort

410
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,000
 of magical portal land or something like that and come back.

411
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,520
 I don't believe it off hand.

412
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,920
 I kind of did this one, but I guess not really, I didn't believe it, but I thought I'm open

413
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,120
 to the idea of dimensional portals and stuff like that.

414
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,760
 What I thought was weird, so let's say that the story is true.

415
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:45,280
 And she begins giving her dad instructions to come to the beach and find her.

416
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,480
 And I guess I should have said this earlier.

417
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,400
 She was found at the same location that she had gotten washed away.

418
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
 That actually was the original story.

419
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,000
 But then the story evolved that it wasn't the same spot, it's 500 meters away, whatever.

420
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,240
 So if I'm trying to get someone to come to my location, I'm not going to start asking

421
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,800
 them to come out two months before I show back magically up in reality.

422
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,480
 Because it's very, very likely.

423
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,000
 Because she had been coming to her dad in the dreams for a long time.

424
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,640
 And then he still had to go out there every day for a couple weeks to find--every day for

425
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
 a couple weeks.

426
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,560
 At any point, he could have just been like, "Ah, I'm having these nightmares."

427
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
 Here's a pro tip.

428
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,240
 Whenever a ghost or trapped in a magical realm and you need to send a message, don't send

429
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,200
 the message too early.

430
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,840
 Because then they're going to go out, get discouraged, and go back, or people are going

431
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
 to start thinking they're crazy.

432
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,640
 Send them the night before you leave Oz or whatever.

433
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,320
 So I thought that was a weird detail too, the dad going out there every single day looking

434
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
 for her.

435
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,560
 They could have said he had the dream and then it was so vivid that he went out the next

436
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,760
 morning and she was there.

437
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,000
 That would be a little more believable.

438
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,280
 But really, I think at this point, none of it's believable.

439
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,040
 I would be surprised if Nainin actually exists at all.

440
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,320
 Oh, and here's another thing.

441
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,360
 This was something weird.

442
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,120
 She's 52 years old.

443
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,560
 How old's her dad?

444
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,800
 In his 70s?

445
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,840
 He would be in his really--he would be in his late 60s minimum if she's 52.

446
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:17,040
 And she had a sister, so yeah, he was probably like, if she's 52 or 53, whatever, he would

447
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,440
 have had to--I look back over at my notes--if he would have to be, let's say he had the

448
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,320
 kids when he was like 20.

449
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 So he's like, and you have this old--you're harassing this old man.

450
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,360
 You're trapped in another dimension and your ghost keeps waking up a 70-year-old man saying,

451
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
 go to the beach today.

452
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
 Go to the beach today.

453
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,680
 And he's like, oh, my arthritis.

454
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,400
 And she's like, I don't care.

455
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,160
 So that detail was kind of weird too, that she was so old.

456
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,760
 But I'm thinking that they may have made her that old to match the photos in the video

457
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,160
 that was going to be attached to the story.

458
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,600
 Weird, weird story.

459
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,240
 Don't think it's true, but there's definitely either someone concocted it on purpose to

460
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,080
 play some sort of prank, or it was just a--or I wouldn't be surprised to find out if this

461
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,760
 is--legends have been going around for a long time in that area.

462
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,360
 This story and it's constantly being updated every 10, 15 years, and this time it actually

463
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,720
 just went viral, which is a possibility as well.

464
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,480
 But that is actually a good segue to our last segment, because we're going to talk about,

465
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:28,600
 again, another urban legend that it kind of--it stands in the same categories as this one

466
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,240
 where we don't know whether or not it's real, but far, far more sinister.

467
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,640
 Far more sinister.

468
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,040
 The year--well, the decade?

469
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,480
 The early 1900s.

470
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,280
 The place, Texas.

471
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,720
 Somewhere in Texas.

472
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,320
 The year in the 1900s.

473
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,080
 The location someplace in Texas.

474
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
 The biggest state.

475
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,960
 Oh, that's the second biggest state, but a giant state somewhere in there.

476
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,640
 There's a little kid sitting in his room.

477
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
 It's nighttime.

478
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,440
 He doesn't have comic books or video games or anything.

479
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,280
 He's probably just looking at wood carvings of Spider-Man.

480
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,080
 Has a little candle under his bedsheet to read.

481
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,160
 House goes up in flames.

482
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,560
 But then they move to another house and this little kid sitting in bed, no candles this

483
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
 time.

484
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,240
 And he hears a noise at his window sill.

485
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,200
 And he sees a shape kind of move away in the darkness.

486
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,480
 The little boy opens the window and out on the sill are little pieces of old-timey candy.

487
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
 To him, new candy.

488
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,080
 He's like, "Mmm, sass, spirula.

489
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,760
 Mmm, molasses-flavored jolly ranchers."

490
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,680
 And he begins to eat the candy.

491
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,360
 And he notices in one of the wrappers.

492
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
 And it's so funny, I'm talking like he's delicate.

493
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,200
 He's probably like, "Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah."

494
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,680
 Cookie monstering that.

495
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,520
 He was lucasin it.

496
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,200
 The next day after his sugar coma wears off, he notices one of the wrappers has a message

497
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,680
 on the inside of it.

498
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,080
 And it says, "Come play with me."

499
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,240
 And it's signed, "The Candy Lady."

500
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,400
 So the Candy Lady story, what we know about the Candy Lady is this.

501
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,480
 There was a woman named Clara Crane.

502
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,120
 And she was born in 1853.

503
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,480
 She was born in 1853.

504
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,120
 She was married to a drunk man.

505
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,920
 He was a farmer.

506
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,000
 And one day he was out drinking and running the farm stuff.

507
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,600
 And their daughter was out there as well.

508
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,120
 And due to his alcohol-induced negligence, the daughter is killed in an unspecified

509
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
 way.

510
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,840
 The mom is just completely just toast over this.

511
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,680
 Her mom can't believe, Clara Crane can't believe that her husband killed the daughter,

512
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,320
 even if it was an accident.

513
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,360
 She then poisons some candy and gives it to him.

514
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,960
 And he's like, "Mmm, sasperilla, my favorite.

515
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
 Ah, ah."

516
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
 And dies.

517
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,760
 She is arrested, but she's found insane.

518
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,320
 So she is put into the North Texas Insane Asylum.

519
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,720
 And it is there where her man is truly shows, I mean not just killing her husband.

520
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
 She makes a new daughter.

521
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,640
 She makes a new daughter out of a bedsheet.

522
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,760
 So she takes a bedsheet and she rips it up and binds it together.

523
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,280
 And now she has like a Blair Witch, like effigy, style daughter.

524
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,280
 But she carries around the hospital with her.

525
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,760
 And she talks to it like it's her daughter.

526
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,360
 And I don't understand the, like did she feed it?

527
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,160
 Was it all like completely, was it all like covered in gross pea soup as she's trying

528
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
 to feed her daughter?

529
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,960
 Like, but I guess insanity is insanity.

530
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,880
 And she probably imagines it's eating the pea soup, but in reality everyone else is

531
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,400
 like, "Can you wash your daughter?"

532
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,560
 She's like, "I bathe her every day."

533
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,920
 They're like, "No, wash your machine, please."

534
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,080
 But anyways, due to overcrowding, there's talk about letting Clara Crane go because

535
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,600
 she's such a nice woman.

536
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,120
 The doctors are like, "Yeah, she's pretty cool."

537
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,320
 I mean, other than that disgusting creature, that disgusting golem she's created that she

538
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,000
 carries around and tells everyone it's her daughter.

539
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,440
 Other than that, she's trying to get it to date other bedsheets in the hospital.

540
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,640
 She's like introducing it, takes it down to the laundromat and she's like, "You are the

541
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,600
 queen of the ball, my daughter."

542
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,960
 She ends up writing a letter to her sister, Aggie, which is a great name.

543
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,040
 This is the letter that was written, "Dearest Aggie, I am elated.

544
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,160
 I have been informed by Dr. Matthews."

545
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,720
 I almost read that as Dr. Mattress.

546
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,160
 "I've been informed by Dr. Matthews that Marcy and I," Marcy's the bedsheet baby, "that

547
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,760
 Marcy and I will be returning home in less than three weeks."

548
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,200
 As you can imagine, Marcy can barely contain her excitement.

549
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,320
 Every night she asks, "Is tomorrow the day we go home, mother?"

550
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,360
 Very soon I will be able to tell her, "Yes."

551
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,440
 The idea of the talking bedsheet is bizarre.

552
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,340
 Like if someone was actually carrying around a bedsheet baby, that's weird enough.

553
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,280
 But then to imagine it's having conversations with her, because in conversations with the

554
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,520
 kid, I mean, does the mattress go, "Why is the sun in the sky?"

555
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
 Well, because it is.

556
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
 Why?

557
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
 Well, that's where God put it.

558
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
 Why?

559
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,600
 Well, I mean, kids can be quite annoying.

560
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,840
 So I guess if you had a mattress baby, it would actually be a little better than a real

561
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,200
 kid because then it wouldn't keep annoying you.

562
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:33,280
 But anyways, Marcy, the bedsheet, and Clara Crane do get let out of the North Texas insane

563
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,600
 asylum.

564
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,840
 And then about five years after that, kids go missing.

565
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,600
 So let's go back to the herb and the legend part of this.

566
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,120
 This has an interesting wrap up.

567
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,120
 So in this town, apparently in her hometown, her unnamed hometown in Texas, children started

568
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,480
 getting candy put up on their window sills.

569
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,920
 And a kid goes missing.

570
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
 And the cops are baffled.

571
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,440
 Again, we're back in the 1900s here.

572
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,720
 The cops are baffled as to what happened to this kid.

573
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,600
 He snuck out in the middle of the night.

574
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,800
 Couple weeks later, another kid goes missing.

575
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,120
 And now the cops are really, really concerned about what's going on.

576
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,840
 And it is then that the parents learn about candy being left on window sills.

577
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,640
 Kids had been eating it and not telling their parents because they're not supposed to eat

578
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
 candy.

579
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,080
 They're not supposed to eat candies from strangers.

580
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,840
 And more importantly, they're not supposed to eat in bed.

581
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,300
 But they did all three of those things.

582
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,440
 So parents started to warn their kids, do not eat candy on your window sills.

583
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
 Don't do it.

584
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,480
 You're going to get snatched by the candy lady.

585
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,760
 This all came to a head when a boy who was previously found missing, there was a farmer

586
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,360
 or a rancher or somebody was walking along a goalie.

587
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:51,660
 They found the body of a 10-year-old boy with his eyeballs gouged out and his pockets full

588
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,000
 of candy.

589
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,600
 Now the interesting thing about this story, every piece of evidence that makes you think

590
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,120
 it has proof seems to be fake.

591
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,440
 But you don't know.

592
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,160
 And there's basically two separate stories here.

593
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,480
 So let's look at the story of Clara Crane first, because that's the one that has the

594
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,320
 most specific stuff.

595
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:21,360
 Clara Crane in Texas, as far as I could find, on Ancestry.com there was a Clara Crane in

596
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,600
 Texas, but she was born five years before her mother.

597
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,120
 So the story of her being born in 1853, or however the word, I might have misstated it

598
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,800
 earlier in 1953, but she was supposedly born in 1853, or in that time period, the only

599
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,640
 person listed having a daughter named Clara Crane was born after that.

600
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:49,960
 There used to be a place called North Texas Insane Asylum, so that place did exist.

601
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:57,040
 And there was a short news article about Clara Crane being sentenced to prison for the murder

602
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,800
 of her husband, but the article is not sourced, it doesn't say what newspaper it comes from,

603
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,720
 it's like a blurry scan of a presumable newspaper article.

604
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,320
 So it could be fake, we don't have a way to track that back.

605
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,560
 In the story of Clara Crane, it does not list where she's from, it's just a small town

606
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,080
 in Texas that takes place in Texas.

607
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,760
 We have a newspaper article that specifies, she was 28 years old, this happened in Ellis

608
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,520
 County and she was tried at the Hattuck Street Courthouse, so we get more details from the

609
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,960
 article.

610
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:37,440
 So that makes me think that the story of Clara Crane existed before the story that people

611
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,680
 tell their kids about, "Ooh, watch out, she could get you," but you end up being on the

612
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,240
 far, far north of Texas, that's left vague for a purpose.

613
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,080
 The article that's being purported to be true specifies this was in Ellis County.

614
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,520
 So the fact there's a discrepancy between the two makes me think that either this, Clara

615
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,000
 Crane actually did exist and the details have kind of been wiped clean to make the story

616
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,480
 more universal, or someone came up with the legend of Clara Crane and then someone faked

617
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
 the evidence and when they were faking it, they're like, "They just can't put in the

618
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,000
 news article somewhere in Texas that this court happened, whoever created this article

619
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,520
 had to give more detail."

620
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,800
 Chicken or egg, chicken or egg, we don't know.

621
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,320
 But like I said, the person who's supposedly Clara Crane, I could only find one on Ancestry.com,

622
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,040
 but that doesn't really mean anything because not everyone's listed in Ancestry.com, so

623
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,280
 I'm back to square one.

624
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
 Is it square one?

625
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,120
 Or is it square, yeah, I'm back to square one, I'm back to the beginning of the board

626
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,840
 game, that's where that saying comes from, Jason, don't be an idiot.

627
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,480
 So I think that's where that saying comes from, but anyways, did Clara Crane exist?

628
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,400
 We don't know.

629
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
 It's super bizarre.

630
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,480
 It's such an unknown urban legend conspiracy theory, I think outside of Texas, that not

631
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,200
 a lot of people have delved into it.

632
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,000
 I've found a lot of resources on it, and a few of them were very like, tried to dig

633
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,080
 into it, but since there's not a lot of information to go on, it's rough.

634
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,800
 So then let's jump, so did Clara Crane exist?

635
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,600
 Who knows, this woman may have actually existed at some point, but did she make a bedsheet,

636
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
 baby?

637
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,480
 And the right letters to her sister, we don't know.

638
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,240
 We don't have any of that information.

639
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,840
 And then let's go to the crimes, missing children in Texas, possibly Ellis County, Texas.

640
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,440
 Kids going missing, candy being left on windowsills, a young boy found with his eyes gouged out

641
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,360
 in his pockets full of candy.

642
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,440
 Did those incidents happen?

643
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
 Again.

644
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,600
 As of now, we don't have any proof of any of this stuff.

645
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,160
 The crimes are at this point over a hundred years old.

646
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:54,200
 It is quite possible that this urban legend came out of something.

647
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,920
 Either Clara Crane is true, and they created the story of the Candy Lady as a warning towards

648
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,680
 kids, you know, don't take candy from strangers is really the point of the story.

649
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:11,600
 Or the Candy Lady crimes are true that three kids went missing when one was found dead with

650
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,320
 candy in its pockets.

651
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,080
 And the Clara Crane story was a retcon to kind of give this madness some sort of face

652
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,920
 to it.

653
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,640
 Or most chilling that both parts are true.

654
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
 Both parts are true.

655
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,120
 There was a Clara Crane that was sent to North Texas.

656
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,800
 It was actually North Texas lunatic asylum, whether that part of the story is true.

657
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,880
 And then later back in Ellis County, kids went missing with candy on their windowsills.

658
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,840
 There's been a lot of stories we've covered on this show that are only like four or five

659
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,120
 years old that are completely horrific.

660
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,760
 Like the guy who held up, who did the school shooting and the sexual assault at the same

661
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
 time.

662
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,800
 That's been pretty much a race from the social consciousness.

663
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,240
 We have the speargun murder story that's been erased from the social consciousness.

664
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,240
 So there are stories even recently that you think, man, how can people forget about this?

665
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,040
 And when we're going back a hundred years, it's very likely, or I should say it's possible,

666
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,320
 that these series of incidents played out.

667
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,520
 The idea of not taking candy from strangers is something that I think most parents, if

668
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,880
 not all parents, really worldwide instill in their kids.

669
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,560
 What's interesting is that if this case is real, this may have been the origin of that

670
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,360
 saying, don't take candy from strangers.

671
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,600
 It's weird to think that the phrase, don't take candy from strangers is used so commonly.

672
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,900
 It's like a trope.

673
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,520
 You can have a television show called Strangers with Candy.

674
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,480
 Like it's, you get it.

675
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
 You get that saying.

676
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,000
 Basically, it's ingrained in our consciousness.

677
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,440
 And the crazy thing is, is that saying may be based on a real set of disappearance and

678
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,040
 murders.

679
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:59,120
 That saying we all use could have started in a little county in Texas.

680
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,880
 When a boy unwrapped a piece of candy, it said, come play with me.

681
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,320
 He crawled out the window to the dark shape standing in the field.

682
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,800
 And that was the last thing he saw before his eyes were cut out.

683
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,680
