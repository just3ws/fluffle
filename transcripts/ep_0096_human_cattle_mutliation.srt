1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
 You've heard of cattle mutilations that have humans been subject to this extreme behavior

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,560
 as well.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we're going to end on a light note today as we talk about the smelliest smell

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,040
 ever recorded today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:27,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,440
 I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,440
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,360
 I'm feeling a little under the weather.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,520
 I don't know if it's the weather change or if I was out in the cold a little too much

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,200
 or a little bit of the flu.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,800
 It could be a combination of all three.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,200
 So we'll go ahead and get through this and then I'm going to crank my heater up and watch

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
 some movies.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,360
 Yeah, I'm just not, my tummy's not feeling 100%.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,480
 I think I'm just tired though.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,440
 Like I've just been working hard.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,760
 And just another quick reminder.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,800
 After this week, I'm taking a week off.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,300
 So the first week of November, I will not be producing anything Dead Rabbit related.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,880
 We will come back with season three, the second week of November.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,080
 So after Friday, I'm going to go ahead and take a week off and just kind of rest.

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,880
 I'm actually going to catch up on some research, but we're not going to be recording anything.

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,080
 So we'll be back for season three at the beginning of the second week of November and I will

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,280
 be ready to go.

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,440
 So first thing I want to talk about, actually, you know, I want to talk about this first

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,240
 too, because it's not necessarily a whole segment by itself is just really, really weird.

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,520
 Something recently happened.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
 Okay.

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,800
 So the article came out on Monday, which is today, but it was Friday.

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,920
 So the 27th of October in Oakland, California, these police, they're working in their downtown

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,680
 office, you know, just doing paperwork, stuff like that.

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,120
 And some people come in and they're like, we think we found a human head.

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,400
 And the cops are like, you know, it's a close to Halloween.

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,280
 They figured either the people were pulling a prank on them.

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,440
 They're like, oh, we're either going to laugh at this or we're going to arrest you for wasting

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
 our time.

39
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,360
 Or they thought, well, these guys probably just found some prop, some Halloween prop,

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,040
 and it looks super realistic.

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,080
 And they figured, you know, it's just a, it's a prank.

42
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
 It's a prank, bro.

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,080
 It's just a prank.

44
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,880
 The cops go, the people bring the head and these two people, they're like, hey, we have

45
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
 this head.

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
 You might want to investigate it.

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,400
 And they bring it in and the cops, it takes them not very long to realize it is a real

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,080
 decapitated human head.

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,600
 And they said, this was the quote, it was decomposed and had a little bit of flesh on

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
 it.

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,480
 I can say in my years of service, I've never had a human skull delivered to the police station.

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,280
 And these people, they found it in the backyard of an apartment complex.

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,480
 And so immediately the cops are like, okay, this is an actual, this is first off that's

54
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
 gross.

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,080
 Secondly, we need to investigate this.

56
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,560
 Like I said, this just happened this weekend.

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
 They don't know who the head belongs to.

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,720
 They don't know how it got there.

59
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,960
 They don't know how the person died.

60
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,840
 They've been asking people around the apartment complex.

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
 They see any weird stuff lately.

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,000
 And that's pretty much all they have to go on is two people showing up with the head.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,320
 I'm sure they were initial suspects, but yeah, weird, weird.

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,240
 Someone out there got their head chopped off and it was thrown in an apartment complex

65
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,440
 backyard.

66
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,760
 And it must have been there.

67
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,320
 I'm wondering if it was either there for a bit and no one noticed it or it was somewhere

68
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,760
 else and they transported it and got rid of it at the apartment complex.

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,000
 But Oakland police, I'm sure they had other things going on that night or they were super

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,560
 bored one or the other, but now they definitely have a case with very little evidence and

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,440
 no crime scene that they now have to solve.

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,520
 So we'll keep you informed if anything more comes of that.

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,680
 I don't think it will, but yeah, we'll keep you informed.

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,960
 Next thing I wanted to talk about.

75
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,520
 So I did the episode on Operation Plate.

76
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,120
 Now it's funny because I try to keep my shows relatively short under 30 minutes tops.

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,680
 That Operation Plate, that segment alone was 28 minutes and it was funny because I recorded

78
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
 it and then I'm editing it and usually I'll record it and then every episode gets about

79
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,840
 20 minutes edited out of it.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,360
 That segment was so lean.

81
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,800
 I left the bare bones of that story in to the episode.

82
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,760
 I recommend you guys following the links and reading more because there are tons of first

83
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,880
 hand, I took out, had to take out a couple of the villagers first hand encounters of

84
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,760
 the Chupa Chupas because I was just simply running out of time.

85
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,280
 There were, a lot of people had their own encounters with these vehicles or creatures

86
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,000
 or whatever they were and I was like, I'd love to include all these little tidbits but

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,520
 I just, I needed to keep it lean.

88
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,880
 Having it clock in, I think the episode was around 35 minutes, was literally as short

89
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,960
 as I could get it with having every plot point.

90
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,720
 Everything that was in there almost had to be in there.

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,920
 But I recommend out of all the episodes I've done, that's the one that you click on those

92
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,160
 links you're going to read some really cool first hand UFO encounters.

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,280
 So I encourage you to go back to that and check those links out.

94
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,760
 But when I was researching that, I came across an article, it was deaths attributed to UFOs

95
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,320
 or you know people who had died during the investigation of UFOs, things like that because

96
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,160
 a couple people had died by the Chupa Chupas.

97
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,960
 And I came across a couple stories too to be exact of human mutilation.

98
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,120
 Now not human mutilation like some gross old serial killer or some like gang bangers, but

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,960
 people who they suspected were human forms of cattle mutilation.

100
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,880
 Now if you don't know what cattle mutilation is, it is the theory that cows are abducted

101
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,160
 by aliens and they do these surgical procedures to them.

102
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,080
 Generally their eyes are removed, their anus is removed, all the blood is drained from the

103
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,320
 body, they have like these burn marks in their skin, they have these holes bore into them.

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,280
 And the reason why we know about it is that we find cows in the middle of nowhere and

105
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,080
 they're missing their eyes and they're missing their anus, they're missing their genitals and

106
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,680
 they don't have any blood and farmers have been dealing with this problem for a long time,

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,000
 I mean in recorded, like in the past mostly like say 40, 50, 60 years there's been more

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,440
 documentation of these cattle mutilation.

109
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,040
 And the theories started off as like oh it's a satanic cult or it's UFOs or it's some

110
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,080
 sicko out there traveling all of the United States doing these things to cows, but farmers

111
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,520
 do find these cows, they can't find them and then when they do find them they're missing

112
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,880
 their eyes and other soft tissue parts of their body.

113
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,880
 And the theory with UFOologists is that they're being abducted, tested on and then being

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,960
 dropped back off.

115
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,520
 Now the question of whether or not humans have been subjected to this, you know, people

116
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,360
 believe, some people believe that we do have proof of it because we have two stories of

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,440
 bodies that have been found in similar states.

118
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,960
 So there was an interesting story that came out of New Mexico in 1956, it's known as the

119
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,840
 Jonathan Lovett incident.

120
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,120
 So Jonathan Lovett and William Cunningham were friends and they were in the military

121
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,280
 together and they said, William Cunningham, so spoiler alert, you think you know what

122
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,440
 happens to Jonathan, William Cunningham says that him and Jonathan were out and about and

123
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,560
 they were looking for like missile debris, that there was a missile test or something

124
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,880
 that had happened and they had to go find pieces of it that fell off for their job I'm

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,160
 assuming, I don't assuming they're just collectors.

126
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,680
 Cunningham comes back to the base alone and he says something took Jonathan.

127
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,800
 They went to go look at these sand dunes to go find this debris.

128
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,440
 Actually, and now I've kind of figured out probably what happened here, but they go to

129
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,960
 the sand dunes to look for this debris and all of a sudden Jonathan Lovett disappeared.

130
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,000
 He couldn't find like he was gone in a heartbeat.

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,800
 And then Cunningham heard the screams, he ran over and he saw Lovett there and there was

132
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,600
 a silver disc hovering over Jonathan Lovett and these like, he described him as snake-like

133
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,440
 creatures but basically these tendrils came out of the vehicle, wrapped around Jonathan

134
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,200
 Lovett and sucked him into the boat and a boat, sucked him into the spaceship or whatever

135
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,680
 it was, the silver disc and then it flew away.

136
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,080
 People were thinking that Cunningham know he must have done something to him and buried

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,240
 the body or something like that, but what happened was eventually Jonathan Lovett's

138
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,760
 body was discovered and he had these wounds such as removal of the eyes, ears and tongue

139
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,960
 and according to this article on UFOinside.com, every drop of blood had also been removed

140
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
 from the carcass.

141
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,120
 So that's a little spooky.

142
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,400
 You're out with your buddy, palling around the dunes and the little spaceship zooms

143
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,280
 him up and then it flies away with him and then you find his body and he has the wounds

144
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,520
 that we attribute with cattle mutilations.

145
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,120
 The next story we have on that actually has less information but more documentation because

146
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,440
 unfortunately we have photos of this poor fellow.

147
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,840
 We don't know who he was and took place in Brazil which is kind of weird because we were

148
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,360
 just there with our Operation Plate episode.

149
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,200
 This took place at the Go...Gawana Paringa Reservoir.

150
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,400
 It's south of, say, south...

151
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,360
 It's south of São Pablo.

152
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,040
 São Pablo is how you say it but anyways, so they found this body and the pictures are

153
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,560
 quite grisly so don't be clicking on the links if you don't want to see a picture of a screaming

154
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,160
 dead man because this guy, he has his lips completely eaten away, his anus is completely

155
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,840
 gone, he has damage to the genitals, his organs are also messed up, gone.

156
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,440
 Let me read...so this is from the autopsy report.

157
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,280
 I'm going to read this specifically because this is important.

158
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,240
 From the autopsy report, we observed the removal of the right and left orbital areas

159
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,200
 such as your eyeballs, emptying of the mouth cavity, pharynx, or pharynx, neck, right and

160
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:40,600
 left armpit area, abdomen, pelvic cavity, right and left groin area, the axolary regions

161
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:51,240
 on both sides showed soft spots where organs had been removed and so on.

162
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,440
 Decisions were made on the face, internal thorax, abdomen, legs, arms, and chest.

163
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,280
 Shoulders and arms have preparations of 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter where tissue and

164
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,120
 muscles were extracted.

165
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,080
 The edges of the preparations were uniform and so were their size.

166
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,880
 The chest had shrunk due to the removal of internal organs.

167
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
 Cause of death.

168
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,200
 Acute hemorrhage in multiple traumatisms.

169
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:24,720
 There is a component of cause of mortis by vagus stimulation.

170
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,960
 Implying cardio respiratory arrest caused by extreme pain.

171
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,160
 So basically he had a heart attack as he was in so much pain.

172
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,520
 The victim showed injuries of vital reaction characteristics.

173
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,120
 As in there is the component torture.

174
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,880
 The suggested modis operandi is incisions and soft parts natural orifices using sucking

175
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
 devices.

176
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:52,840
 He died of a heart attack caused by pain.

177
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,240
 And I read on other websites too that his body was also completely drained of blood.

178
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,640
 So here's the thing.

179
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,600
 So cow mutilations for the most part have been debunked.

180
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,240
 Yes, that is real.

181
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,120
 The cows are being found with their soft organs gone.

182
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,360
 And they're missing some of their blood.

183
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,960
 And that's why hyperbole is very important with conspiracy theory.

184
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,960
 They're missing blood but they're not completely drained.

185
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,360
 There's not a single drop of blood in them.

186
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
 So in 1979 there was Sheriff Herb Marshall.

187
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
 Herb or herb?

188
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,840
 I think it doesn't matter.

189
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,360
 I've always said herb.

190
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
 Herb?

191
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
 Wait no do I say it?

192
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
 I guess I say herb if it's a person.

193
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,640
 Anyways he's in Arkansas and he goes you know what?

194
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,280
 I'm having all these reports of cattle mutilations and the farmers and ranchers are telling me

195
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,200
 that they think UFOs are taking them or satanic culture or whatever.

196
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,280
 But I think it's something more natural.

197
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,600
 So he took a cow carcass and he threw a freshly killed cow and he threw it out and they watched

198
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,320
 it for 48 hours straight.

199
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,800
 No one showed up to drain anything from it and they blow flies.

200
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:02,920
 It was basically maggots turning it to flies and predators which will go for the soft tissue.

201
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,600
 They'll burrow holes in you and they'll eat out your butt hole and they'll eat out your

202
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,080
 eyes and your lips because that's all the easiest things to eat.

203
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,400
 Path of least resistance.

204
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,360
 And then after that another research group I believe it was in Canada did a similar experiment

205
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,920
 and they said yeah I mean everything you can attribute to well let's let me back up.

206
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,120
 Most of the things you can attribute to cattle mutilation happen just naturally in the world.

207
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,680
 And you go well Jason ranchers and farmers they see dead cows all the time don't you think

208
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,960
 they would know this was natural?

209
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,920
 And they do see dead cows all the time but they don't find the carcass they see a dead

210
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,800
 cow and they get to it before all the scavengers.

211
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,160
 It's eat dying on their farm as opposed to a cow getting away from the farm dying and

212
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
 then four days later they find it.

213
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,320
 So the two humans who died.

214
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,000
 It's possible that one the guy from Brazil was tortured to death and just the rest of

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,800
 the damage was done by predators.

216
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,960
 I think this the guy in Brazil was probably killed very horribly maybe they were like

217
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,680
 sucking his organs out while he was still alive.

218
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,280
 But again the most logical answer was he was murdered by other humans and we just found

219
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,000
 his body later.

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,560
 The guy in New Mexico I mean I don't want to cast dispersions or anything but it's most

221
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,480
 likely again the most likely answer is he was killed by his friend.

222
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,760
 I do think it's weird that if I murdered a guy in the middle of nowhere my go-to story

223
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,360
 would not be a UFO kidnapped him unless I figured the body would never be discovered.

224
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,720
 So if I murdered somebody in the middle of nowhere I would not then go to the cops and

225
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,120
 say oh my god dude my friend something terrible happened to him they're like what happened

226
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,080
 and I said a UFO abducted him like that wouldn't be my go-to thing so if he did murder him

227
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,600
 I the story may have evolved over time because I'm seeing that a lot doing this podcast I'm

228
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
 seeing a lot.

229
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,400
 Now again let me go to that real quick.

230
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,920
 Recently I'm sure the original story for both of these bodies were like there was no blood

231
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,000
 at the crime scene like we didn't find a lot of blood and now it's become there's no blood

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,200
 at all in the body it's been completely drained and I know that's 100% false for this Brazil

233
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,000
 one because in the excerpts of the autopsy report that I just read to you there is no

234
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,640
 mention of the body having no blood in it like zero blood whatsoever.

235
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,560
 If it said that on the autopsy report this website would have definitely highlighted

236
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,840
 that part because that helps their theory.

237
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,040
 This website is one of the sites that talks about the body's drain of blood especially

238
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,640
 when it talks about Jonathan Love it.

239
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,020
 So if the body actually had no blood if the coroner could say this body has not a single

240
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,000
 drop of blood in it I think the body probably didn't have a lot of blood in it and then

241
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,400
 over time the story has morphed to saying it had no blood none at all it's just completely

242
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
 dry.

243
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,000
 There's biological actions that take place with blood and everything like that.

244
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,600
 That's why there's not blood everywhere from every time someone spilled blood because

245
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
 little things are eating it.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,920
 But anyways both of these stories can be logically explained.

247
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,680
 The cows being found with their eyes being bore out and their buttholes gone and stuff

248
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,440
 like that and these two gentlemen who have similar wounds my thing with the whole catamethyl

249
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,480
 the catamethylation thing the idea of it is creepy to begin with that there's vehicles

250
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,560
 out there beyond our understanding that are abducting cows and possibly humans and experimenting

251
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,080
 on them and just dropping off in the middle of nowhere for us to find it it's creepy you

252
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,480
 find like this carcass you don't know how it got there or why it suffered the wounds.

253
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
 Some people say that some of the cows have looked like they broke their necks due to

254
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,320
 drops from heights and how else would a cow fall unless it was beamed up and then dropped.

255
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,880
 My pushback to the whole alien side of the catamethylation thing is that so what we have

256
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:59,640
 to accept is a race of people a race of beings have built ships that are beyond our understanding

257
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,760
 of technology and they also have the ability to beam things up or have tendrils that can

258
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,320
 come down and grab you and pull you up into their ship and then they just throw your body

259
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,360
 out when they're done with it they don't have an incinerator they don't have I mean we have

260
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,680
 incinerators if we if somebody does something they don't want anyone to know about just

261
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,680
 throw it in a fireplace at the very least or you take them to a crevatory but somehow

262
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,360
 these aliens have all this advanced technology and they go man we're doing these experiments

263
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,560
 and we hope nobody finds out because our experimentation isn't done yet we need to have all these cow

264
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:40,480
 anuses to be able to take over the planet and yet they just throw the cows outside why don't

265
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,300
 they fly over the ocean and drop them into the ocean make it more difficult for us to

266
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,200
 suss out what their plan is so I mean the story of the aliens that automatically has

267
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,880
 that weak point and you could say well the aliens want us to know no they don't know

268
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,320
 they don't ever never ever that's there's there would be no reason for them to want

269
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,480
 to leave evidence if the point of it was to do some sort of experiment on it they would

270
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,440
 just dump them off when we kidnap monkeys and experiment on them to do makeup we don't

271
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,320
 then take the monkey bodies and throw them back in the jungle to let the other monkeys

272
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,680
 know that we're doing it or to so fear in the monkey population no we dispose of the

273
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:28,040
 bodies in a laboratory or in a crematory I think well you know the the guy again the

274
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,320
 the military guy I don't want to disparage him at all but I think him and his buddy were

275
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:41,800
 probably out doing something that was frowned upon in the 1950s and something happened and

276
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,960
 the best story he could come up with is a giant snake slithered out and got his buddy

277
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,400
 which you can read in the Freudian implications of that if you'd like I think that's far more

278
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:00,760
 likely than a group of beans far more advanced than us took a dude drilled out his butthole

279
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,520
 and threw him on the ground I but I don't think that I for one the whole story may be

280
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,320
 made up it may just be part of ufo ology lore but it's also very likely that he did something

281
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,480
 to his friend and made the story up and with the new Mexico thing my question to be why

282
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,880
 didn't you fo take the witness as well a man did die we're assuming the whole story could

283
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,160
 be completely made up because one thing another thing I've learned during this podcast is

284
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,760
 sometimes you see the same story repeated over and over again and then it turns out it's

285
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,400
 just me it's just completely not true but let's assume the story is true why didn't

286
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,080
 the UFO take cunning him to why did it let a witness go and again I say why did the

287
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,200
 UFO then dump the body later why didn't it just incinerated and the guy goes missing

288
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,400
 and that way the alien and whoever was piling in the ship would be like I pulled one over

289
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,280
 on those good old Yankees flying away but instead it drops the body the guy got the murder

290
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,640
 charges you didn't get charged with murder and stuff like that the entire story just kind

291
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,760
 of smells in general hey you know what actually that's a good segue because speaking of smells

292
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,320
 I came across this this is going to be really short because I think it's hilarious there's

293
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,560
 not a ton of information on it it's true though we'll say that here is a word I can't pronounce

294
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,640
 you I know you guys love this when I'm talking about stuff that I can't pronounce so this

295
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:27,920
 is a compound called thioacetone thioacetone and it is a it basically is a terrible terrible

296
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,840
 smell now you go all that you know that's not bad Jason stuff smells all the time you should

297
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,040
 smell your mama's feet or something like that no this stuff is so gnarly and it spreads

298
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:49,280
 out thioacetone is more than just a bad smell it's described as fearful quoting this article

299
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:56,680
 here it says it makes innocent downwind pedestrians stagger clutch their stomachs and flee in terror

300
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:03,680
 it reeks to a degree that makes people suspect evil supernatural forces so they don't know

301
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,840
 why it smells so bad it has they believe it has something to do with the sulfur component

302
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,040
 of the compound but it basically will just unleash through a city I think it's like up

303
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,080
 to a half a kilometer it's this huge range where you will be just walking on the street

304
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,200
 and you'll be like it's so bad when they back in 1889 was the first time that it was really

305
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,920
 know this effect on it was truly notated it says the reaction produced an offensive smell

306
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,000
 which spread rapidly over a great area of the town causing fainting vomiting and a panic

307
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,360
 evacuation because people just started you were just minding your own business and the

308
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,480
 worst smell you could ever imagine hit you and you're like you would think the world

309
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,320
 was ending if you heard it is melt this so again I don't want to be reading quotes the

310
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,720
 whole night but I just think these are so funny so this happened in the 1960s okay now

311
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,160
 we're in I think Britain yeah okay recently we found ourselves with an odor problem beyond

312
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:07,200
 our worst expectations during early experiments a stopper jumped from a bottle of residues

313
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,280
 and although replaced it once resulted in an immediate complaint of nausea and sickness

314
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,040
 from colleagues working in a building 200 yards away two of our chemists who had done

315
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:23,840
 no more than investigate the cracking of minute amounts of triathletone found themselves the

316
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,960
 object of hostile stairs in a restaurant and suffered the humiliation of having a waitress

317
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,000
 spray the area around them with the deodorant the odors defied the expected effects of dilution

318
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,480
 since workers in the laboratory did not find the odors intolerable so when they were super

319
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,560
 close to it they didn't notice it and I'm assuming I know sometimes you're they have

320
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,400
 that delicacy in Sweden that's the rotted fish and you open it up and the smell is so

321
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,520
 bad it burns your nose so you can't smell it but if you like walk into the room after

322
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,840
 the cans opened you're going to be physically sick because it smells so bad you have to

323
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,240
 be there when it's open so these two chemists they're messing around they immediately like

324
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,520
 they're not basically their nose hairs give up and die but as the smell left the laboratory

325
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,040
 it was totally noxious now they said this the chemists were like there's absolutely no

326
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,320
 way that was us because the laboratory is a closed system the smell could not leave the

327
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,000
 laboratory to convince them otherwise we're going back to the quote here to convince them

328
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,960
 otherwise they were dispersed with other observers around the laboratory at a distance up to

329
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,240
 a quarter of a mile and one drop of either acetone gem I'm not going to go into that

330
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,800
 and one drop of either one chemical I can't pronounce or this other chemical I can barely

331
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,600
 pronounce were placed on a watch glass and a fume cup cupboard the odor was detected

332
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,880
 downwind in seconds so now these two chemists now they're out of the laboratory and they're

333
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,800
 walking around and they could just be like oh my god this is the worst smell ever I don't

334
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:59,560
 know why they don't use this as a weapon I'm wondering if the smell how long the smell

335
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,440
 lingers in a particular area but it seems like it would be a really efficient like you can

336
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:12,200
 prepare for like loud noises you can prepare for bright lights but you kind of have to be

337
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,520
 able to breathe like you can plug your nose up with stuff but in some sort of like right

338
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,960
 situation you're going to want to have the ability to breathe in and out of both your

339
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,840
 mouth and your nostrils if you're walking into a right situation you already have ear plugs in

340
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,920
 heavy sunglasses and now you've got plugs up your nose you're really limiting your ability to interact

341
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:36,360
 with other people in a rioting situation I we shoot tear gas into people's houses I think it

342
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,520
 would and actually that probably answers the question right there tear gas can be fairly

343
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,400
 contained but anytime you would use this weapon like if someone was in their house and you're like

344
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,760
 come out of your house they're like no and then you're throwing stink bombs into their house

345
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,560
 yeah everyone suffers you're gonna have a quarter of a mile of people being like what did I do

346
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,880
 wrong what did I do wrong why does it smell so bad and then if you lived in a bad neighborhood it

347
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,920
 would constantly be happening and so yeah I kind of want to end it on end on a light note today

348
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,280
 usually like the end story is kind of the heavy story but I was like you know what we had a rough

349
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,360
 weekend it's been a rough weekend for everybody involved you just had all that craziness that

350
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,760
 happened here in the United States and I was like let's end on a funny note today plus I'm not feeling

351
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:25,560
 100% as far as just my tummy but I know I talk about the grossest stories this episode but yeah

352
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:33,960
 it was nice to end on a light note I should say dead rabbit radio at gmail.com is going to be our
