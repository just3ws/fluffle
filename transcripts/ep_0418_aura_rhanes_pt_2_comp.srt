1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 A young man has a close encounter of the turned kind.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,760
 And then we revisit the story of Aura Reigns.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,360
 An alien space captain who was so beautiful, men fall in love with her at first sight.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,080
 It's a famous story a lot of people know about her.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,760
 But not a lot of people know that she came back to Earth to eat at a disgusting restaurant.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
 Today I'm Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:39,760
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,760
 First off I want to give a shout out to one of my legacy Patreon, Carson Wright.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,760
 Carson thank you so much for supporting the show.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
 He's a good guy. I know him in real life.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
 All my Patreon supporters are good guys.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,760
 But I know Carson personally he's awesome dude.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,760
 The other day he was like hey you guys want to get back together and play some Dungeons & Dragons.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
 Oh yeah sure.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,760
 Then he starts talking about playing Seven Days to Die which is a zombie survival game.

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,760
 I'd be totally down to play it but my computer won't run it.

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,760
 Carson let's play Castle Minor Z.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,760
 Castle Minor Z look it up.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,760
 You have an Xbox 360 and you're under the age of 30 you know exactly the game that I'm talking about.

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,760
 My computer runs that. I've been playing Castle Minor Z a lot.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,760
 It's Minecraft but with machine guns.

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,760
 So Carson 1v1 me bro.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,760
 Also I think all this week pretty much I've been doing talking about movies I've been watching on Shutter.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,760
 Now again I'm not sponsored by these guys but right I'm telling you this because it's an awesome deal and I signed up for it myself.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,760
 And I don't get any kickback from these guys.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,760
 I'm doing it as a service because I think it's awesome for you.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,760
 Shutter.com is a horror streaming site.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:03,760
 If you use the promo code SHUTTON you get 30 days free and that's what I'm signed up and then after that it's like 5.99.

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
 I've been watching a different movie each night.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
 I watched a movie the other day.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,760
 I didn't talk about it but last night I watched Soul Station.

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,760
 It's the prequel to Train to Busan.

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
 Now both of those movies are available on Shutter.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
 They're also available other places YouTube.

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
 Amazon might have them as well.

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,760
 But Soul Station is an animated prequel to Train to Busan.

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,760
 Both excellent zombie movies.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
 Excellent zombie movies.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760
 I might rewatch Train to Busan tonight.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,760
 Or I might watch Mandy starring Nicholas Cage.

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
 I've always been curious about that.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
 That's also on Shutter.

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,760
 What I'm going to do is on Friday night, let's say 7 p.m. Pacific Standard Time,

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,760
 I'm going to do a live stream where I'm going to be discussing these movies.

48
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,760
 So we'll have a little movie club night on Friday 7 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,760
 If you want to catch the live stream on YouTube you're more than welcome to.

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
 Obviously you don't really need my invitation.

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,760
 It's a public thing.

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,760
 Then I'm going to upload the audio to the podcast for the people who don't.

53
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
 Watch the YouTube or miss the live stream or whatever like that.

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,760
 We're not going to be watching the films or anything like that for copyright reasons.

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
 But we're going to be discussing them.

56
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,760
 So, so far this week we've watched The Room on Shutter.

57
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,760
 We watched One Cut of the Dead.

58
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,760
 We watched Soul Station.

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,760
 And then we're also going to discuss the movie Mandy.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
 I'm going to watch that tonight.

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
 I also watched Super Max.

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,760
 It was a television show.

63
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
 It wasn't that good.

64
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,760
 But anyways, I'm not going to talk about that.

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,760
 So, if you want to join the Dead Wrap Movie Club, it's totally free.

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,760
 And again, I think most of these movies aren't only on Shutter.

67
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,760
 I think you can rent them on YouTube as well.

68
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,760
 Soul Station is available for free on YouTube.

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
 Someone uploaded the whole movie.

70
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
 And we'll talk about Trained to Busan as well.

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,760
 But anyway, so yeah, if you want to join the Dead Wrap Movie Club, it's totally free.

72
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
 Let's go ahead and get started.

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,760
 Carson, I want you to fire up that carbonar copter and then take the keys back out

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 because we're just sitting down for a second.

75
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
 You like that little tease there?

76
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,760
 This story I've been thinking about for like, I don't know, a year.

77
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,760
 And it's really super inconsequential, but I find it so fascinating.

78
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,760
 Since everyone is at home, everyone's doing the distant learning.

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 This is your English class for today, guys.

80
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
 This is super bizarre.

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
 Now, this is an English thing.

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,760
 I don't know how well it translates to other-- probably not at all.

83
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,760
 But obviously, if you can understand English, you're probably being like,

84
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,760
 "What? English is your second language? Ah, ah, ah!"

85
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
 Fast forward five minutes.

86
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,760
 I just don't think this grammar rule-- we're going to talk about grammar, guys.

87
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
 This grammar rule applies to other languages.

88
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,760
 What's fascinating about this is I consider myself, even though it may not seem the way that I speak,

89
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,760
 pretty well versed in the English language, right?

90
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,760
 I think a lot of English speakers do.

91
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,760
 You would hope so, at least, right?

92
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
 But this is a rule.

93
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,760
 It's an English rule that nobody was ever taught, but it's intrinsically true.

94
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,760
 There is an order to adjectives.

95
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
 What? Yeah, whoa, whoa.

96
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
 Calm down, guys. Put down the pitchforks and the torches.

97
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
 I know you're going to blow your mind there.

98
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
 Sit down.

99
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
 There's an order to adjectives.

100
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
 They have to be in this particular order.

101
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
 Otherwise, it doesn't sound right.

102
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,760
 Now, I remember in elementary school-- I remember in elementary school,

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
 we were diagramming sentences and doing all this stuff.

104
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,760
 You're never taught this, but it's just intrinsically built into the language.

105
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
 Here's the order.

106
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:30,760
 First, you do opinion, then size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose.

107
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,760
 You'd say the big red ball is the size, the color, and the purpose.

108
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
 The red big ball, it sounds weird.

109
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,760
 The ball big red.

110
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
 Big red good ball.

111
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
 The opinion comes first.

112
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,760
 Good red-- no, no, that's wrong.

113
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
 Good big red ball.

114
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,760
 I mean, obviously now it's not like a caveman, which doesn't help,

115
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,760
 but there is an order to adjectives.

116
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,760
 And when you start messing it up, the shiny sword.

117
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
 I have a shiny sword.

118
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,760
 I do actually have one sitting right by my door, so don't break it.

119
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,760
 I have a shiny sword, not a sword shiny.

120
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,760
 It's a long shiny sword.

121
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,760
 See, the long is the opinion.

122
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
 Some people may consider it tiny.

123
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
 A giant would be like, "That's not long. This is long."

124
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,760
 There is an order to-- isn't that weird?

125
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,760
 You're like, "Jay, seriously, that was the first five minutes of your podcast?"

126
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
 You're darn right it is.

127
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,760
 That's the first five minutes of my podcast.

128
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,760
 I think that's fascinating. I've wanted to talk about that for like a year.

129
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
 And this just seemed like the right episode.

130
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
 So there we go. That's weird, right?

131
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,760
 This kind of bizarre, spooky, woot.

132
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,760
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

133
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
 Carson, let's fire up that carbon helicopter.

134
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,760
 We are headed out to Indiana--

135
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:55,760
 flying over the prairies and like the wheat fields and stuff like that.

136
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,760
 It's nighttime, so we're coming in dark.

137
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,760
 We're specifically headed to Marion, Indiana.

138
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,760
 It's July 17th, 1989. It's 10 p.m.

139
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,760
 Now, there's this dude, he's hanging out at his house,

140
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
 which is generally what people do, right? It's 10 p.m.

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,760
 You might be out, but this guy wasn't.

142
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,760
 And like most of these stories, he sees something weird.

143
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,760
 None of these stories are-- he had a normal night.

144
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,760
 Like, you know something is going to go wrong when I'm talking about it on Dead Rabbit Radio.

145
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,760
 Or I just want to tell you about Grammar.

146
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
 It's dude sitting at his house and he sees something outside of his window.

147
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:40,760
 He sees a UFO hovering over a pond out in a field by his house.

148
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
 He's like, "What?"

149
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
 He's fully clothed, by the way.

150
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,760
 Normally, you don't have to add that detail,

151
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,760
 but in this case, I do. He's fully clothed and he's like,

152
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
 "What in tarnation is that?"

153
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
 He gets up off of his couch.

154
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
 Then something creepy happens.

155
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
 We don't see this happening very often.

156
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,760
 I guess we see it out in cars, but you know, a man's home is his castle.

157
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
 It's a little bit different.

158
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
 He's in his house, the power goes out.

159
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,760
 Now he's in a pitch black house and he's looking across this field

160
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
 and he's watching this UFO.

161
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,760
 Now that adds a layer of creepiness to it.

162
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,760
 The fact that it has the ability to shut off the power in the house is creepy.

163
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,760
 It's plunged into darkness.

164
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,760
 Power outages are always unsettling because they just happen so quickly.

165
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,760
 The civilized world is ripped from you in an instant.

166
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
 You're in a pitch black house.

167
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,760
 And then there's a bright flash.

168
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,760
 And then the next thing he knows,

169
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,760
 he's standing about five feet from the window.

170
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,760
 He was looking out, but now he's moved farther away from the window.

171
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,760
 He feels a pain in his side.

172
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,760
 All this stuff is happening simultaneously.

173
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 So bam, he realizes he's in a different location than he was just a second ago.

174
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
 He has a pain in his side.

175
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,760
 He looks down and sees a bright red mark right on the side of his body.

176
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,760
 And while he's taken all of this in, he realizes all of his clothes are gone,

177
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,760
 except his underwear and his underwear is on backwards.

178
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,760
 And then he begins throwing up.

179
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,760
 After that, he began having dreams, reoccurring dreams of something with large eyes,

180
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,760
 hunting him, stalking him,

181
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,760
 following him everywhere he went.

182
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,760
 Pretty creepy story.

183
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,760
 And again, one, you have the power outage out of the house.

184
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
 Again, cars will shut down,

185
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
 but a lot of times, like driving your car powers off,

186
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,760
 that's not as chilling as your home basically having all of the energy ripped out of it.

187
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
 That's spooky.

188
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,760
 I think it's kind of funny that the aliens went through the trouble to put him back in his house,

189
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,760
 but put him farther away with no clothes on.

190
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,760
 Like they could have, I bet you this was some aliens first abduction.

191
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
 This is his first day on the job.

192
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,760
 He was interning and he's like, oh yeah, yeah.

193
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
 So we have this whole thing.

194
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
 Hey, Barry, Barry, you're paying attention to this, right?

195
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm paying attention to this.

196
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
 We have this thing where we abduct people.

197
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
 We do experiments on them.

198
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,760
 We implant them with false memories and then we put them back exactly where we left them.

199
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
 Hey, Barry, Barry, you're paying attention to this, right?

200
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

201
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
 I just, someone called me.

202
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
 I just had to check.

203
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
 I'm waiting for a call from the doctor.

204
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
 Okay, we don't have doctors.

205
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,760
 We're biomechanical aliens and we heal ourselves, but that's kind of weird.

206
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,760
 You drop him back off exactly where you left him.

207
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

208
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
 I got it.

209
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
 And I imagined that it was Barry.

210
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,760
 He's Barry the aliens first day and he's like, after they all got done doing this stuff

211
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,760
 and they have this foolproof method of dropping him back off in his location, the guy disappears

212
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,760
 and then the lead aliens like looking around the UFO is like, oh, are you kidding me?

213
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
 He finds the dude's clothes everywhere.

214
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,760
 Oh, you're telling me you teleported him back with no clothes?

215
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
 You know what?

216
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,760
 Put his underwear on.

217
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
 Put his underwear on.

218
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
 I'm pretty sure I did that part, right?

219
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,760
 So, I mean, I guess I'm making fun of this guy who got kidnapped, cut open and had his

220
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
 underwear put on sideways.

221
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,760
 See close encounter of the turned kind, because his underwear is turned around.

222
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
 You like that?

223
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,760
 And then he's throwing up.

224
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,760
 That would be terrifying enough, but then to know that afterwards you're still going

225
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,760
 to have these nightmares about these aliens chasing you, these monsters, things with big

226
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
 eyes is the way he described them.

227
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 Chasing them means that the experience definitely had an impact on him.

228
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,760
 And I'm sure in those dreams he saw something with large eyes following him around and then

229
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,760
 there's like another guy with large eyes in the background, bumbling stuff up.

230
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,760
 And the stalking creature turns around and goes, Barry?

231
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,760
 And every night the guy wakes up and he's like, what was the point of that dream?

232
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
 Who's Barry?

233
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,760
 Let's go ahead and fire up that carbonar copter one last time this episode.

234
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
 We are headed out back to Nevada.

235
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,760
 So Carson fly us on out and then we're going to take the dead rabbit dune buggy, because

236
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
 I mean there's not a lot of desert places we go to.

237
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
 Fire up that dead rabbit dune buggy.

238
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,760
 We are going to outrun the war pups.

239
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,760
 We are headed out to Mormon Mesa.

240
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,760
 Now yesterday's episode, I don't do a lot of two-parter episodes, because I really like

241
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
 the episodes kind of stand alone so people can jump in and out.

242
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,760
 But yesterday was just such a long, it's just such a long story.

243
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
 So I'm going to give you a brief overview.

244
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,760
 There was a guy named Truman Bethrom.

245
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,760
 He was a mechanic for a road construction crew/spiritual advisor at the same time.

246
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,760
 And in July 27, 1952 he met a bunch of aliens.

247
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
 Now they didn't abduct him.

248
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
 He's like, hey I want to go on your ship.

249
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
 And they're like, yeah sure.

250
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
 And they bring him on the ship and he's looking around and all the aliens are these little

251
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,760
 short dudes with perfect olive skin.

252
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,760
 There's no wrinkles or creases or nothing.

253
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,760
 He meets the captain, the bombshell, the brunette bombshell known as aura reigns.

254
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,760
 Just a real curvy, sexy lady.

255
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,760
 Perfect thighs, perfect chest, perfect complexion, everything.

256
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,760
 He falls in love with her immediately and she tells him all about her home planet, Clarion,

257
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,760
 which now, yesterday I said that it existed on the other side of the sun.

258
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,760
 Originally he said it existed on the other side of the moon.

259
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
 We just can't see it and the people go, that's not true.

260
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
 And he goes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

261
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
 It's on the other side of the sun.

262
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
 That's the ticket.

263
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
 That'll work.

264
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,760
 And then later on in his life he said it was in another solar system.

265
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
 It wasn't anywhere near as so, you know, whatever.

266
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
 Probably making the whole thing up.

267
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,760
 But he ended up meeting, he fell in love with this alien woman.

268
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
 She's from a planet where everyone's Christian.

269
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
 There's no liquor.

270
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,760
 There's only polka music and you just square dance.

271
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
 Now you don't have to square dance.

272
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
 You can be a scientist or work on a road construction crew.

273
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
 So anyways, he falls in love with her.

274
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
 He comes back to Earth.

275
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
 He writes his book.

276
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,760
 He starts a cult and then he ends up passing away in 1969 after having this successful cult and writing all these books.

277
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,760
 Now, it's not a super well-known story, but in UFO lore it's kind of well-known,

278
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,760
 but it's not like this big mainstream thing.

279
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,760
 Back in the day it was really popular because he did have followers to join his cult and stuff like that.

280
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,760
 But nowadays it's kind of an obscure story, especially because parts of it don't make sense,

281
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
 i.e. a planet on the other side of the sun.

282
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,760
 Like I said on yesterday's episode, it's a really old conspiracy theory that there's a planet that's complete in opposite orbit of us.

283
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,760
 And we've been able to say with the way gravity works and stuff like that,

284
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 we would be able to detect a body the size of Earth on the other side of the sun.

285
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,760
 So, the Macyte Mysterious Universe did an article, a follow-up article basically, written by Nick Redfern.

286
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
 It's in the show notes, you can take a look at it.

287
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,760
 And this is the only place I could find this story.

288
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
 So, take it with a grain of salt.

289
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,760
 In the Mysterious Universe they publish a lot of stuff, a lot of the stuff is pretty legit.

290
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,760
 But this was the only place I could find this story.

291
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,760
 We've heard the story about Truman out at Mormon Mesa, meets the love of his life, she flies away.

292
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,760
 He ends up, his wife ends up divorcing him because he's in love with his alien,

293
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,760
 he ends up hiring his secretary when he's running a cult that looks like her, he's totally obsessed with this chick.

294
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,760
 It's his waifu, 100%.

295
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,760
 Now, the story that that all happened, that was in July 1952.

296
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:33,760
 In August of 1952, we're going to a little diner in Glendale, Nevada.

297
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,760
 Ding, ding, ding, that's the door with the little bell we walk in.

298
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,760
 It's a 1950s diner, we're just kind of walking around, we're dressed up in our suits,

299
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,760
 little fedoras, never mind, take four and a half.

300
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
 It's sad those have such a bad reputation.

301
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
 We're wearing our suits, we've got our suits in our ties.

302
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,760
 Ladies, you have your little suit in your tie, maybe you're wearing a little pencil skirt,

303
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
 is that what those are called, those little cute little skirts?

304
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,760
 Make your legs stick together so you can barely move.

305
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,760
 Don't worry, we won't have to run in this episode, so you'll be fine.

306
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:10,760
 We're walking into this diner, and I'm trying to get the waitress's attention.

307
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,760
 She's super hot, she's super hot, she's blonde, this is my own fantasy.

308
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
 I don't know about this detail.

309
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,760
 Hey, hey, what's up, so are you on the menu and you're a super, you're like Jason, oh my God, please don't.

310
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,760
 So is the special you and me, and you're like, oh my God, Jason.

311
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
 Please, please, please.

312
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,760
 Anyways, as I'm continuing to spit stellar game at this waitress dude, I'm breaking her heart.

313
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
 She wants me so badly.

314
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:43,760
 A crock of what we should be paying attention to is across the restaurant is Truman and his friend Whitey,

315
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,760
 which is an, don't we all wish we had a friend named Whitey.

316
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,760
 That's a dope name for a friend, because you imagine him to be old and good at everything.

317
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
 Hey Whitey, can you fix this pipe?

318
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,760
 Yeah, sure, I don't know how you would fix just the pipe, but yeah, I can fix it.

319
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,760
 He also seems like he would know everything about like whatever region you're in.

320
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,760
 And I should also say it's three in the morning, so it's pretty late.

321
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,760
 Most of the people here are long distance truckers, people who are getting off work, people who don't want to go home.

322
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,760
 Now this time Truman is, so this is after he met our arraigns, this is after the alien reduction.

323
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,760
 He's still, and after he told his story to everyone, he's still working for the road crew, and he's still a spiritual advisor at the same time.

324
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,760
 It's such a weird combination of jobs.

325
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,760
 Anyways, so they're sitting there, they're eating pie, Truman and Whitey are eating pie, they're drinking coffee.

326
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,760
 Truman, mmm, delicious black coffee.

327
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
 Look, look, look, so good.

328
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
 Eating some cherry pie.

329
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,760
 Theater of the Mind, people.

330
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,760
 Theater of the Mind, don't you feel, don't you smell the cherry pie?

331
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,760
 A small man and a woman walk into the diner.

332
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,760
 Dling, daling, daling, daling, daling.

333
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
 Now the man is unusually small.

334
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,760
 Little, around five feet.

335
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,760
 But the woman, the woman's a knockout.

336
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,760
 [Wal-Wal-Burn-O]

337
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:22,760
 She's walking in her beautifully bright red skirt, black little jacket on top.

338
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
 Black sunglasses.

339
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,760
 Everyone's attention in the restaurant is on this beautiful woman.

340
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,760
 We're not really paying attention to the dude, because she's just a knockout.

341
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,760
 Now Truman knows who this woman is.

342
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,760
 This is our arrange.

343
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,760
 Now again, this is months after the UFO visit, and she was on a UFO.

344
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,760
 She was in some greasy restaurant that's open at 3 a.m. in Glendale, Nevada.

345
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,760
 Now Truman's like, "I gotta go talk to her."

346
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
 Like, that is her.

347
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
 And Whitey gets super nervous.

348
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
 I don't know, boss.

349
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,760
 That looks a little something about this is making me a little nervous.

350
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
 Apparently now he's Jim Carrey.

351
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
 And Truman goes, "Dude, calm down, calm down."

352
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,760
 And Whitey's like, "I can't calm down, I can't calm down."

353
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
 And he leaves.

354
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,760
 He leaves his bro when he needs him the most.

355
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,760
 But Truman is undeterred, puts down his fork, chling, chling, puts down his cup of coffee,

356
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
 and he walks over to the woman.

357
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
 He goes, "Here's a quote.

358
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
 'I beg your pardon, lady.

359
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
 But haven't we met before?'

360
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,760
 And she turns, and with what he describes as a demonic or deadly hiss,

361
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,760
 she says, 'No!'"

362
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:53,760
 Truman responds, "You very closely resemble a lady I met some time ago out on Mormon Mesa?"

363
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,760
 "No!"

364
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
 She hisses back.

365
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 He keeps asking question after question.

366
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,760
 "No! No! No!"

367
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
 You think her voice would get sore?

368
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
 Because I'm getting sore just doing it.

369
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
 "No! No!"

370
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
 He's asking all these questions.

371
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
 He wants to know.

372
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,760
 Now he says, "The man is not responding to any of this at all."

373
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
 He's just sitting there, acting like nothing is going on.

374
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,760
 He describes him as acting like he's deaf or blind.

375
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,760
 He just sat there and ignored the whole interaction while he's trying to pimp on this hot chick.

376
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,760
 And eventually Truman, he's looking at her and he's like, "I know this is her."

377
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,760
 But he had some suspicions that it wasn't.

378
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,760
 One, they're in the middle of a diner.

379
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,760
 So it wasn't in the middle of a desert on a UFO.

380
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,760
 Two, the man had a scar on his face.

381
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,760
 Now that was one thing that he kept saying was that these people, their faces were creaseless and they had no wrinkles.

382
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,760
 They had perfect, perfect complexion.

383
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
 Super smooth skin.

384
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,760
 So the fact that one of them had a scar was throwing them off.

385
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
 And they both had glasses on.

386
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,760
 So he can't really see their eyes.

387
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,760
 And he's thinking, "Maybe this is just some weird coincidence."

388
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 The aliens in the previous episode, they were also like five feet tall.

389
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,760
 I guess I should have said that for the people who are listening to this one first.

390
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,760
 And this super hot chick, this olive skin Latin looking girl in the middle of Nevada.

391
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
 This is just weird, right?

392
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,760
 But she keeps saying that she's not the space alien captain.

393
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,760
 He keeps trying to trick her. He's like, "Nice polka music, right?"

394
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,760
 And she's like, "No."

395
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
 It's a beautiful night for square dancing.

396
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
 "No."

397
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
 But anyways, he's like, "It must not be them."

398
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,760
 So the waitress who'd been serving them, because they're just eating food at the counter.

399
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 It was the 1950s night.

400
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,760
 She walks up to Truman, because he's a celebrity in town.

401
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
 Everyone knows him.

402
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,760
 This story was reported in the news about his UFO abduction.

403
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,760
 She walks up to him and she goes, "That's surely the saucer people that you told us about, right?"

404
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
 And he goes, "Yeah, yeah, I thought that too."

405
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,760
 But they were in sunglasses and that dude has a scar.

406
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
 They kind of look like him.

407
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
 But I went up and talked to her and all this stuff.

408
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,760
 And then she goes, the waitress goes, "You know, I noticed that too."

409
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,760
 You said they had super smooth skin, but that's not a scar on his face.

410
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,760
 It's drawn on.

411
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 Somebody drew a picture of a scar on it.

412
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,760
 Which, I mean, I don't know what makeup designer this guy's working for,

413
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,760
 or how you draw a scar was an actual black line on his face, like you took a Sharpie on it.

414
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,760
 Which Truman, truly, was not the most observant person that he couldn't tell the difference between a pin

415
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 or maybe it was some super sci-fi hologram scar, but then how did the waitress point it out?

416
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,760
 Anyways, at that point, the guy, the wait, motions for the check.

417
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,760
 And the waitress goes over and gives him the check and they go to leave.

418
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,760
 And Truman's just sitting at his table drinking his coffee and he's like,

419
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
 "Oh, that's kind of weird that the scar's fake."

420
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 But again, like, I just don't know and she denied everything.

421
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,760
 And then at that point, the waitress runs over to Truman and he's sitting there.

422
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:22,760
 She goes, "The lady? The lady told me she knows you."

423
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,760
 Truman gets excited as heart's racing. It's not the overdose of caffeine.

424
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
 It's true love.

425
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 And the waitress continues. She says, "Sorry."

426
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
 Here's this interesting quote.

427
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,760
 It's pretty much what I just said, but the ending part.

428
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,760
 "The lady told me to tell you that she knows you and that she was sorry.

429
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,760
 And yes is the answer to some of your questions."

430
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
 Unquote.

431
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,760
 Now, it's a little weird that some of them, he's like, "Oh, which ones did I ask? Oh, no.

432
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,760
 Did I really have to ask the one about the good polka music or I should ask,

433
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,760
 is she really in love with me? Oh, wait, I did ask that. Is that one of the yes questions, Oh, no?"

434
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
 Anyways, that's just kind of weird.

435
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 Yeah, yes to some of them, no to others. Isn't there really the answer?

436
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
 Can't you say that about every question ever asked?

437
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
 "Hey, how did you feel about those questions?"

438
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
 Oh, I said yes to some of them.

439
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
 Some guys are not going to start chasing you out of a diner.

440
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,760
 You said yes to some of them? Everyone says yes to some question.

441
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
 Do you want to have a fish stick? Yeah.

442
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
 Do you want to be boiled in lava? No.

443
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,760
 I mean, there's not yeses all around.

444
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
 Anyways, he runs out of the restaurant.

445
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,760
 Anyways, he turns and looks and the couple had just left the restaurant.

446
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,760
 Dling, ling, ling. And Truman jumps up and he runs.

447
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,760
 He's kind of out of shape. He is 55 years old.

448
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,760
 He's out of breath just by running the 40 feet to get out of the restaurant.

449
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,760
 That's a pretty big restaurant. But anyways, however big it was,

450
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,760
 he gets out of the restaurant. Dling, ling, ling.

451
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
 Dling, ling.

452
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
 And he's standing outside the restaurant.

453
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,760
 It's 3 a.m. a cold night in Glendale, Nevada.

454
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
 And it's empty.

455
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
 Except for his buddy Whitey.

456
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
 [smooching]

457
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
 Not kissing him, not making kissy faces.

458
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
 Smoking a cigarette.

459
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
 [smooching]

460
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,760
 Nothing sweeter than Marlboro Red.

461
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,760
 I'm so glad I'm not a smoker because I could never actually order that cigarette.

462
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
 Anyways.

463
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
 [smooching]

464
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,760
 Turns and he looks at Truman. What are you doing out here, Truman?

465
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,760
 I thought you were inside stalking that woman.

466
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,760
 No, Whitey, didn't you see? They just came out. They just walked out this door.

467
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,760
 And Whitey goes, quote, we got a lot of quotes for this story. Are you proud of me?

468
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,760
 I got them all from this article.

469
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
 Quote, they never came out.

470
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
 [sighing]

471
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
 Honest, true.

472
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,760
 Not a blessed soul passed through that door until you came out.

473
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,760
 Truman's like, why'd you say it all? It's deductive like that Whitey.

474
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
 He's like, I don't know.

475
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,760
 So, that was the last reported sighting of Aura.

476
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,760
 As far as we know, he had never met Aura after that point.

477
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,760
 And that story is nowhere as near well known as the main Aura story.

478
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,760
 So, there's a couple different things. One, well, there's a lot of things to really unpack, but did...

479
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,760
 If... Here's the... I don't even know where to start with this thing.

480
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,760
 So, first off, we have aliens that can teleport walking through doors,

481
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,760
 which then you would wonder why they would go into a diner in the first place.

482
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,760
 Did they know that he was in the diner? It's an interesting point.

483
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,760
 In the main story, I didn't touch on this yesterday because I didn't have a lot of time,

484
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:47,760
 but in the main story, Aura Reigns said that aliens can telepathically tell in their spaceships.

485
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,760
 They can read people's minds. They can telepathically tell if people are good people.

486
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
 So, before they meet them.

487
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
 Which is an interesting thing. I've talked about that on previous shows.

488
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,760
 Like, do aliens choose who they abduct, choose who they interact with, or is it just kind of a crapshoot?

489
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,760
 When you go out hunting for deer, you don't go like, "Oh, I'm gonna shoot that one deer I saw one day."

490
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
 You're just gonna shoot a deer.

491
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,760
 Or when you're... You may be fishing for a particular type of fish, but you don't get one and go,

492
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,760
 "Mmm, this isn't the same one I saw Tuesday," and throw it out. You're just fishing.

493
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,760
 So, do aliens just randomly abduct people, or are they reading our minds and figuring this stuff out?

494
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,760
 If that's true, then Aura must have known that Truman was at that restaurant, right?

495
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,760
 And she could have done this one thing where she was talking to this dude and she's like,

496
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,760
 "Hey, do you want to go to this restaurant?" He's like, "Why do you want to go to that restaurant?"

497
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,760
 She's like, "Uh, 'cause I like it." And she like, tricked him into it, 'cause I don't think he would have went...

498
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,760
 I don't know why I'm assigning a motive to him, but why he would have...

499
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,760
 Maybe she was jeopardizing the mission by going there in the first place. Who knows?

500
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,760
 Maybe the dude was the one who put her up to it. I don't know.

501
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,760
 I don't know. I think you could get into all sort of weird kinky subplots.

502
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,760
 But the point is, is that as far as we know, this is the last time that Truman met Aura Reigns,

503
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,760
 and he continued to love her until the day that he died.

504
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,760
 Now, you may be going, "Okay, Jason, great. You did a two-parter episode about a guy who wanted to bang a space alien."

505
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,760
 Congratulations! And I'd be like, "Thank you. Thank you. I detect no sarcasm in that whatsoever."

506
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,760
 However, there is an interesting side note to this whole story, so I always find it fascinating when you have outside observers

507
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
 pick stuff up on this as well.

508
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,760
 So, let's travel back in time to July 21st, 1952.

509
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,760
 I found this on a really obscure website called, like, The Wanderling.

510
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,760
 And it was doing a story about Truman and the whole Aura Reigns thing,

511
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,760
 but then it ends with this letter that this guy got who runs this website.

512
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,760
 He says he got a letter, or he heard, or somebody told him the story of Face the Cut.

513
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,760
 He got a letter from this guy who said back on July 21st, 1952,

514
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,760
 he had ditched school. He was a runaway. He was like a teenage runaway.

515
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,760
 He got on a fight with his mom, left school. Actually, school was out for the year,

516
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,760
 but he's like, "I'm never coming back. Like, I'm done with school, and I'm never coming back by mom," and he runs away.

517
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,760
 And while he's running away, he meets this guy who picks him up. This doesn't get creepy.

518
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,760
 He picks him up, and he's drinking and driving, and he's just-- the kid just wants to get away from his family.

519
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,760
 And the guy's drinking and driving, and then he gets in a car accident in Mormon Mesa.

520
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:29,760
 Now, July 21st, 1952 is about a week. July 27th is when the alien ship appeared.

521
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,760
 This car's broken down in the middle of nowhere. And what happens is this teenager says that out of nowhere,

522
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,760
 multiple trucks, multiple vehicles full of Native Americans pull up, and they're like,

523
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,760
 "Hey, we saw that you got in that car accident. It's a good thing you're in the middle of nowhere. This could have been really bad."

524
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,760
 But anyways, the natives were like, "Hey, let's, you know, help get your car out of this ditch," and stuff like that.

525
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,760
 You know, if you need to get a tow to a mechanic, we can arrange that and all that stuff.

526
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,760
 But apparently, the car wasn't damaged too much. They're out there in the middle of nowhere.

527
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,760
 And then-- because again, this is July 21st, 1952-- so while they're working on the car and getting everything situated,

528
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,760
 one of the largest earthquakes in United States history happens 30 miles away.

529
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,760
 It's known as the Tahachapi Quake.

530
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,760
 So, I mean, again, it's better to be out in the desert when this is going on than, say, anywhere in a building.

531
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,760
 You're like, "Oh, no. I work at a cracker factory, and the building's made of crackers."

532
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,760
 Like, you don't want that, right?

533
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,760
 Although that would also be bad during any sort of adverse weather.

534
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
 It's raining. Oh, no, this is poorly designed.

535
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,760
 A bunch of horses show up. They're licking the walls. Run!

536
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,760
 So anyways, the point is, is that they're out in the middle of nowhere.

537
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,760
 With these Native Americans and this drunk dude, and there's a big earthquake, and everyone's like, "Oh, that's super weird."

538
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,760
 Now, they do get the car working again, but after a while, the Indian dudes are like, telling this kid,

539
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,760
 they're like, "Dude, we got to take you back home. Like, you can't continue your journey with this guy."

540
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,760
 And the teenager's like, "Yeah, yeah, I was like totally like desperate to get a ride out of town."

541
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,760
 And they're like, "Yeah, this guy's not up to really any good. He's already going to drive in."

542
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
 "Let's take you back home to your mom."

543
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,760
 And the teenager's like, "Yeah, I guess I probably do need to go home."

544
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,760
 So the Native Americans are having home. Now, they get them home, and the mom is like,

545
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
 "Oh my God, thank you so much. I was wondering what happened to them."

546
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,760
 And then there was a massive earthquake, and I lost my job at the cracker factory.

547
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,760
 Everything was not working out, but I'm so glad you brought my son back.

548
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,760
 Can I pay you anything? And the Indians were like, "No, no, no, no, no. You don't have to pay us anything."

549
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,760
 But, we really like your son. We really like your son. He's a pretty good guy.

550
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:39,760
 I was wondering if he could come back with us for this ritual. Mom's like, "What?"

551
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,760
 He's like, "We're going to have this..." It's really hard to describe, but by the end of the week,

552
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,760
 there's going to be this massive event happening out at Mormon Mesa.

553
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,760
 It's a vision that we've been given. And we want your son to be a part of this thing.

554
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,760
 Would he be willing to go hang out with us for about a week and see this thing?

555
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,760
 Now, they're being really cryptic to what it was. We're just going to make people super nervous, right?

556
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
 There's a bunch of strangers. They're super nice, but they're saying,

557
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,760
 "Can we borrow your son for a week? We can't tell you why, but it will be insane."

558
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,760
 So, the mom did end up saying, "No, no, you can't. You can't do it, right? You can't."

559
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,760
 And the teenager, to be fair, also, was like, "I don't know. You guys are cool and all.

560
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,760
 Let's ask him a lot." So, the people go, "Well, we feel bad.

561
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,760
 We were hoping you could be part of this event, but we realize that you're scared of a bunch of strangers,"

562
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
 which is a good thing, and they left.

563
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,760
 Now, later on, after the newspaper articles and everything came out, the teen realized that this tribe

564
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:53,760
 must have known that that UFO was coming, which adds an interesting wrinkle to the whole story.

565
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,760
 Because we have the UFO out in the middle of nowhere, and you have the story of Truman meeting our reigns

566
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,760
 and falling in love, and that's become the lore.

567
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,760
 But the interesting question is, what were they doing out there in the first place?

568
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,760
 Did they come out specifically to see Truman, or were they working with this Indian tribe doing something else,

569
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,760
 and Truman just happened to be there. They were just kind of hanging out talking, and he woke up.

570
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,760
 They didn't interact with him at all. He woke up and began interacting with them.

571
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,760
 So, I always think it's interesting when we have these stories have alternate versions or alternate witnesses

572
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,760
 different places observing the same thing.

573
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,760
 So, out of all the stories we've covered, it may be true there may be an aura reigns out there.

574
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,760
 There may be a beautiful space captain, because they lived to be about a thousand years old on the planet Clarion.

575
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,760
 Could it be a beautiful space captain still out there, unless she was 995 years old when this story took place?

576
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,760
 But she could still be out there flying through the cosmos.

577
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,760
 And if she is, she may be piloting that ship surrounded by short men that do her bidding,

578
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,760
 her crew ready to die at her command.

579
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,760
 And while she's piloting that ship sitting in her captain's chair, every so often her mind goes back to that night,

580
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,760
 that greasy little diner.

581
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,760
 She saw Truman, and she wanted him so badly to come up to her.

582
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,760
 She wanted so badly to talk to him.

583
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,760
 But she knew the rules. She knew the first rule of being a space captain.

584
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,760
 Never fall in love.

585
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,760
 So even though she could read Truman's mind and knew he loved her more than anything,

586
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,760
 she couldn't reciprocate that.

587
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,760
 She just had to walk out of that diner and disappear.

588
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,760
 But that doesn't mean that she didn't love him.

589
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,760
 And to this day, as she flies through space, every so often she thinks of Truman,

590
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,760
 and a smile comes to her face.

591
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,760
 DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com is going to be her email address.
