1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
 What would you do if you had a child and that child was spooky?

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,640
 And then we take a look at the end of the world. Every religion has a

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,720
 idea of how the world's going to end and every religion has a set of signs and symbols leading up to

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,060
 the destruction of mankind.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:27,840
 But what happens when science also declares the end is nigh. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,200
 *Music*

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,880
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing. You're wrestling a bear right now.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:52,460
 You're like, "Ah, this isn't fun." Well, I hope you find some sort of enjoyment in it. Also quick reminder,

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:59,760
 I'm doing the re-release, the remaster of the Earth First episode. I'll put that in the show notes and I need you.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,520
 I need the fluffle to send a recording of themselves or maybe their neighbor.

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,800
 Maybe they can trick someone into saying Earth First, Earth First. Send me an MP3 or a

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:17,000
 wave file of that to DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com so I can have you as part of this great

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,100
 audio escape I'm trying to build. You have no idea what I'm talking about. Episode will be in the show notes.

16
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,500
 The deadline is January 31st. I pushed it ahead because I know everyone's busy with the holidays,

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,980
 but January 31st, 2022. Send me your sound clip and you can be in an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,660
 No purchase required, nothing. I want you guys in the show.

19
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,420
 Someone who's gonna always be part of the show because I'm gonna say their name right now.

20
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,240
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, supporter of the show. Give it up for Chase Kackmus.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 Everyone give a round of applause for Chase.

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,600
 Chase, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the show financially,

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,840
 I totally understand. Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio. That helps out tremendously.

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,420
 You have no idea how much that helps the show grow.

25
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,320
 Chase, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

26
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,540
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're driving all the way out too.

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,740
 It's not really street legal. I don't know why we're taking the Dune Buggy. We just haven't used it in a while.

28
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,860
 So we'll dust it off and that's literal because it's covered in dirt.

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,500
 Let's toss you those keys. We're headed out to the suburbs.

30
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,620
 *Mimics the sound of the dead rabbit*

31
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,900
 The reason why we're in the suburbs is we're here to visit a babysitter.

32
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,860
 So we pull up outside of this house where the parents are gone.

33
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,540
 It's just a teenage girl watching this other little girl and we're like,

34
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,440
 "I'm riding in the bushes but it's not smoky, okay?"

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,240
 I can't think of any other way that we're into this story.

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,940
 So the babysitter is sitting there and the little girl's like,

37
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,680
 "Can I braid your hair please?"

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,200
 Apparently she's babysitting Erkel.

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,040
 And the babysitter goes, "Yeah, sure."

40
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,440
 So the little girl is braiding her hair and they're sitting in front of this mirror

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,440
 and the little girl's braiding the babysitter's hair.

42
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:10,540
 And the babysitter notices that the little girl keeps looking over the babysitter's shoulder.

43
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,940
 So they're both facing the mirror,

44
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,940
 but she notices that the girl's not focused on the hair like she should

45
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,940
 because apparently this is super intense to braid hair.

46
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,140
 She keeps seeing the little girl look over her shoulder.

47
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,240
 And this goes on for like 10 minutes and eventually the babysitter goes,

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,540
 "What are you looking at? What's going on?"

49
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:37,040
 And the little girl goes, "The tall man behind us says he wants to play with you."

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,640
 The babysitter's like, "Oh, dude, that's super creepy, right?"

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,540
 It's like imaginary friend maybe? Ghost?

52
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,840
 We wave goodbye and they don't know we're in the bushes so we skulk off in the distance.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
 Ooh, that was spooky.

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,340
 We go to the next house.

55
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,840
 In this house there is also a little girl and we're hiding in the bushes yet again.

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,240
 And there's a girl, but the mother's here so it's like, "Is that less creepy?"

57
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,640
 It's less creepy that there's an adult in the house.

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,540
 The mother is there with her three-year-old daughter and we'll call the three-year-old daughter Michelle.

59
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,640
 And the mom's name we'll just call her Monica.

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,240
 Michelle has an imaginary friend named Victoria.

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,140
 And they do typical imaginary friend stuff.

62
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,340
 We're just sitting in there and we see like Michelle having a tea party with like nothing

63
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,640
 and we're like, "Pfft, there's not even real tea in those glasses. They're empty."

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,940
 They're too poor to afford tea even for this game.

65
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,440
 And you know, she's like, "Victoria, let's go to bed together."

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
 And they're like reading books.

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
 I don't know what people do with imaginary friends.

68
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,840
 I never really had an imaginary friend growing up.

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,640
 But she's doing this stuff.

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,940
 And now it's time to move away.

71
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,440
 So we're in the bush. We've been in the bushes this whole time.

72
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,340
 We've been in the bushes for like six months.

73
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,940
 We're having door dash food delivered to us on Burger King delicious whoppers.

74
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,140
 It's time for them to move. So Monica's like, "Come on, Michelle. It's time to go.

75
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,940
 You got everything packed up, right?

76
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,940
 You got everything packed up. It's time to go."

77
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,540
 Van's showing up and they're putting stuff in.

78
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:06,940
 And then Michelle turns to the mom and goes, "Victoria wants to know why she can't come."

79
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,440
 Now, Victoria doesn't exist, but the mom needs to placate her daughter because she's distraught.

80
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,340
 And Monica goes, "Well, Michelle, here's the thing.

81
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,540
 Victoria has to stay behind so she can play with other kids, right?"

82
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,940
 Other way to cool her kids. We're gonna afford tea.

83
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,040
 And Michelle kind of looks downtrodden and then she goes,

84
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:37,140
 "Victoria wants to know if she's not going because she's ugly and has a hole in her forehead."

85
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,640
 And the mom's like, "Ugh."

86
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,140
 Oh, and the implications. I don't know if I have to say this, but the implications is the girl, Victoria,

87
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,240
 like, got her brains blown out and she was this ghost walking around with a big old hole in her forehead.

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
 And what else was around her? Oh, she's ugly.

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,640
 So I would assume like her face has been peeled back like the Demogorgon from some sort of shotgun blast.

90
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,740
 I guess it probably doesn't have to be that graphic.

91
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,740
 But that was the implication like this invisible.

92
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,840
 Imagine having an invisible friend because, again, I didn't really have one.

93
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,440
 I had, it's a little complicated story, but I never had an invisible friend.

94
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,040
 Imagine if you did have an invisible friend and your face was shot off.

95
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,540
 Their face was taken out by a shotgun, something with, "Be awful.

96
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:29,140
 Your invisible friend stepped on a landmine. It's just a collection of organs and limbs that kind of follow you from room to room.

97
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,340
 You're like, "Wins the tea party."

98
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,740
 And honestly, that's kind of where I'm going for.

99
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,640
 Not the kids getting blown up by landmines, but this.

100
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,040
 You can go all over the internet of lists of creepy things, kids said.

101
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,640
 We've talked about a couple on this show. We've talked about a couple on this episode.

102
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,940
 My question is this. What is that phenomenon?

103
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,240
 Was it a ghost? Did this girl just, the whole thing is weird.

104
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,840
 Like I find children creepy. I find, I think most people find children creepy.

105
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,440
 And when kids say things that are odd, it really sticks out.

106
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,140
 Because if I was at work with you and I said, "Hey, dude, I'm getting ready to move."

107
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,940
 And you're like, "Oh, that's too bad. I really liked working with you."

108
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,340
 I was like, "Yeah, things just didn't really work out here. No pun intended."

109
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,440
 So I'm leaving, but I was wondering if you could swing by my place after I move out.

110
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,340
 Why?

111
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,540
 Well, because there's this girl there whose face got blown up in a horrible hand grenade accident.

112
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,640
 And I don't want her to be lonely.

113
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,840
 You would have me committed. First off, you'd probably leave the immediate vicinity.

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,340
 Then you're going to call the cops on me. When an adult says it, it's just weird.

115
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,240
 But when a kid says it, it's a combination of precociousness.

116
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,940
 They don't really know any better. They don't know how creepy they're being.

117
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:49,640
 But is it their imagination or are they actually seeing things adults don't see?

118
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,240
 I think it's pretty common in the lore that animals can see spirits when adults may not be able to.

119
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,940
 And I would argue that that's just because their senses are heightened.

120
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,740
 They have different senses and they're looking for different things.

121
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,240
 I'm looking for the remote control.

122
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,540
 When dogs are looking for food in a place to rest and the rest of the time,

123
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,540
 he's looking around and says it's kind of bobbing around.

124
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,640
 Not a very complex creature.

125
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,540
 So when he sees a ghost, he has nothing else to divert his attention or weird noise walking down the hallway.

126
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,140
 The dog will turn and look. It doesn't have all this other random thoughts going through its head.

127
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,040
 Maybe that's the same thing with a child.

128
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,040
 And especially with a child, they haven't been taught the rules of the universe.

129
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,040
 As far as they know, ghosts are real and monsters are real, goblins and all this stuff,

130
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,340
 witches are going to come and get you at any point in time.

131
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,940
 So are they, are these products, these stories that we see on the internet is full of them?

132
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,440
 And I know that you guys have probably experienced this as well.

133
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,340
 Beatrice sent me a story where she was talking about one of her daughters.

134
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,640
 Doing that. Beatrice, a long time listener of the show.

135
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,540
 And so this goes on and on and on.

136
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,540
 The question is, is it just part of their overactive imagination?

137
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,040
 Because to them, the universe is capable of anything.

138
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,040
 So that means a child with no face could just walk into your house,

139
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,540
 sit down and start watching the Big Bang Theory next to you.

140
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,140
 Or, and so it's just their imagination, or are these children actually seeing ghosts?

141
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,240
 Are they actually remembering past lives?

142
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,040
 Are they actually interacting and having imaginary conversations with these ghosts?

143
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,040
 That adults, we forget, we don't have that ability anymore because we know,

144
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,940
 quote unquote, the rules of the universe.

145
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:36,040
 When you hear a strange noise outside, you may go, "It's too cold outside, I don't want to go check it anyways."

146
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,840
 "As your car is getting broken into..."

147
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,440
 "Hmm, those ghosts sure are nasty with their baseball bat smashing my windshield."

148
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
 "That's just a figment of my imagination."

149
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,840
 We go, "No, it's probably just a f-..."

150
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,840
 I do it all the time, I hear stuff all the time, and it goes, "It's probably just a pipe."

151
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,540
 Oh, that's probably just...

152
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,340
 It's probably just a moan.

153
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,540
 It's probably just a cockroach and pain, moaning, going, "Matilda, come back to me."

154
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,940
 I think adults do that more and kids don't.

155
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,340
 Kids hear the noise, they immediately go to the monster show because

156
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,440
 they're thinking of a monster, are they more likely to imagine a monster,

157
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,940
 or are they actually seeing these monsters?

158
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,940
 That's the big question I have about kids making these statements.

159
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,640
 Because if you ask them, they don't know the difference between their imaginary friend and a real ghost that they're talking to.

160
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,440
 And the weirdest thing is, is kids will grow up,

161
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,040
 and you'll ask them, "Hey, remember when you say that really creepy thing?"

162
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
 And they'll be like, "Huh, what? I don't remember that."

163
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,540
 Are these imaginary friends, or not all of them, right?

164
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,540
 Some people just have imaginary friends that are, I guess, big old pumpkins or something like that, chasing you around the house.

165
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,740
 I don't know, I don't really have any context for imaginary friends, but...

166
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:45,340
 Are they just imaginary, or are some of them actually the spirits of the damned?

167
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,340
 Haunting these houses, and as these kids move away, these spirits just continue to kind of move through the house,

168
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,640
 hoping another child will make contact with them.

169
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
 What a lonely existence being a ghost.

170
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,340
 Being a ghost with a busted up face, that would be awful.

171
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,540
 Chase, I'm gonna go and attach you to the keys to the carbonic copter.

172
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,340
 We are leaving behind the suburbs.

173
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,640
 We are gonna fly all the way out to Germany.

174
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,040
 This is something I haven't really covered much on the show.

175
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,940
 It's pretty ongoing.

176
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,240
 I figured I would either cover it, or the world would end, would be one of the two.

177
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,540
 And I...

178
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:31,840
 I've always found it so fascinating how much the conspiracy theory community loves the end of the world.

179
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,240
 It's very counterintuitive to...

180
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,640
 I mean, like, we all study...

181
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,240
 I think we've all at a certain point studied the end of the world,

182
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,740
 maybe our particular religions view the end of the world,

183
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,440
 or maybe just doomsday novels, science fiction dystopian novels,

184
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,140
 but there is a certain allure to the image of the end of the world.

185
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,140
 Like, I'm really into zombie apocalypse stuff,

186
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,940
 and I'm also really into, like, the book of Revelation.

187
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,440
 I was more into the book of Revelation when I was younger,

188
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,340
 but definitely like zombie apocalypse is my go-to thing.

189
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,540
 It's the end of the world.

190
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,240
 It's the end of the world as we know it.

191
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,040
 And conspiracy theorists love talking about the end of the world,

192
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,540
 and we can go all the way back to nuclear Armageddon of, like, the '80s.

193
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,540
 That's when I grew up, during...

194
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,840
 At any point, Soviet Union's going to nuke the United States, and then...

195
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,240
 And then we got into the New World Order.

196
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,140
 I remember Bill Clinton was going to send the blue-helmeted Ewan goons across the United States,

197
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,140
 and you're going to take all of her guns and round us up and throw us in...

198
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,540
 Throw us in these giant internment camps.

199
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,140
 And then that kind of morphed into George Bush doing that,

200
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,540
 and George Bush doing the Patriot Act.

201
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,740
 He's going to have... He wasn't going to have the Ewan troops.

202
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,940
 He was just going to have US troops throw us into internment camps,

203
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,640
 and then that became the Obama thing.

204
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,940
 Like, it's going to end...

205
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,340
 And you start after the Third or Fourth Apocalypse.

206
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,640
 And that's not even counting stuff like 2012 or the Y2K bug.

207
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,640
 After so many Apocalypses, or so many like, "This is it!

208
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,640
 This is the final generation! You get burned out!"

209
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,240
 But what I find so odd is a lot of conspiracy theorists don't.

210
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,640
 They simply pivot and double down.

211
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,540
 It's one disaster after another.

212
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,740
 One disaster after another.

213
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,540
 The one that's going on right now, and here's the thing.

214
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,540
 Sometimes there are disasters that could legitimately be a big deal.

215
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,340
 The Y2K, if that was not corrected, it could have actually caused massive catastrophes.

216
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,140
 That was one that was possible.

217
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,840
 Well, the thing going on right now, there is an island in Spain called La Palma.

218
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,940
 And it's this volcano that's erupting right now.

219
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,740
 And it came to my attention a couple weeks ago, and I was reading about it.

220
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,840
 If this volcano causes this massive landslide, which is possible,

221
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:46,140
 if it falls in precisely the right way, and enough of it comes off at the right time,

222
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:51,440
 it can cause a tsunami that will end up wiping out huge chunks of Europe

223
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,140
 and pretty much the entire Eastern seaboard of the United States.

224
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,240
 You're like, "Oh my God! I didn't know this was going on! You're packing up right now!"

225
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,640
 Well, here's the thing. It is going on.

226
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,740
 And it's been going on for a couple weeks now in Rensi.com, which...

227
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,940
 Rensi.com, I don't even know if I'm pronouncing it right,

228
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,140
 but this is like an old school conspiracy theory website.

229
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,940
 And this isn't like Dead Arab Radio conspiracy theory.

230
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,540
 This isn't even like Alex Jones conspiracy theory.

231
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,240
 This is like some of the most racist conspiracy theories stuff you will find on the internet.

232
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,240
 So don't go on this website at work.

233
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,940
 Right? If you're going to go, "Oh, I love it when I check out a new website, Jason sent me."

234
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,140
 Uh-uh-uh.

235
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,040
 Rensi.com will get you fired.

236
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,840
 And in some countries, it may get you arrested.

237
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,740
 It is straight up as a lot, a lot of really, really racist conspiracy theories.

238
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,940
 But I go there every once in a while just to see what is going on,

239
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,240
 because it's a conspiracy theory website and I'm checking it out.

240
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,940
 They have a 24-hour live feed of La Palma Volcano.

241
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,140
 And you have... There is this weird obsession with...

242
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,540
 And I think it comes down to this.

243
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,540
 Conspiracy theorists, we want to be right.

244
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,240
 And we want to know about it before the other people.

245
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,440
 Those aren't bad things.

246
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,640
 Those aren't bad things, but I've noticed, especially in myself, like,

247
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,040
 I like to be right. I think everybody does.

248
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,940
 And there is a cool thing about knowing something that other people don't know, knowing it first.

249
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,940
 So whenever a new conspiracy or whenever a new inner-the-world thing pops up,

250
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,940
 the conspiracy theory community takes that ball and runs with it.

251
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,040
 And sometimes it becomes a multi-year books, movies, television shows like 2012.

252
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,940
 Or Y2K. You could have had a career off of those, right?

253
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,540
 The La Palma thing, if it happened... The volcano is erupting and there's earthquakes going on and stuff like that.

254
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,340
 You may think it's weird that no one's paying attention to it,

255
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,240
 but the reason why no one's paying attention to it is it has to be...

256
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,940
 It has to happen in this precise way.

257
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,740
 If it does happen in that precise way, millions of people will die.

258
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,140
 But by that same logic, a solar flare could hit us in just the precise way

259
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,440
 and wipe out our electrical grid or an asteroid can come from the other side of the sun.

260
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,540
 We'd have no way to detect it.

261
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,340
 We'd have no way to detect it because the sun is so bright.

262
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,840
 They've always said if an asteroid comes from the opposite side of the sun and it whips around,

263
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:23,240
 we have a day, two days before it smashes into the planet.

264
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,040
 And that's true.

265
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
 So, you know, this might be the most surprising episode of Dead Wrap Radio.

266
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,240
 First we were making fun of a girl and got her face blowing off.

267
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,140
 And now this, but I find it fat and I'm not saying those subjects aren't fascinating.

268
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,840
 I'm fascinated by the end of the world, but I want to take a look at some...

269
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,140
 I always say this, I find these stories fascinating,

270
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,440
 but I don't believe them because I've lived through so many apocalypses.

271
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,140
 Here we go.

272
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,640
 And this is a great view of this.

273
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,040
 I found this story the other day and absolutely loved it.

274
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,540
 There's an article.

275
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,340
 It's another list article, but I'm not going to go through all of it.

276
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:04,940
 TheSmithsonianMag.com did an article, 10 Notable Apocalypses That Obviously Didn't Happen.

277
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,140
 And a lot of them we are aware of 2012, white 2K stuff like that.

278
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,340
 But I found two that were super fascinating.

279
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:19,340
 One here, we found, not we, you and me, but archaeologists found an old Assyrian clay tablet

280
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,740
 that was written back in 2800 BC.

281
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,040
 And this says, this tablet talks about the end of the world.

282
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,340
 In 2800 BC, people were talking about this.

283
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,940
 Listen, we know what this tablet says.

284
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,840
 Listen to this.

285
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,040
 Tell me if this sounds familiar.

286
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,640
 Quote, "Our earth is degenerate in these later days.

287
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,840
 There are signs that the world is speedily coming to an end.

288
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,840
 Bribery and corruption are common.

289
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,640
 Children no longer obey their parents.

290
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:02,440
 Every man wants to write a book and the end of the world is evidently approaching."

291
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,040
 Now the world didn't end.

292
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,740
 The Assyrian Empire did fall apart.

293
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,540
 But I find so curious.

294
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,840
 Every man wanted to write a book.

295
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,740
 I wonder if that means that everyone thinks that they know everything?

296
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,840
 Or if it means everyone doesn't want to work.

297
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,540
 Everyone has these lofty dreams.

298
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,140
 It's such a weird thing.

299
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,540
 But I'm wondering if it's just a self-indulgent society.

300
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,640
 Like, I don't need to harvest the wheat.

301
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,340
 I'm working on chapter three of my seven book series about a boy wizard.

302
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,440
 But back then it wouldn't have been fiction.

303
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,640
 It would have been real life.

304
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,740
 Because you had magicians running around throwing staffs into snakes and all that stuff.

305
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,540
 So we have that written back in 2800 BC.

306
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,440
 The Assyrian Empire ended in 612 BC.

307
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
 So it's not like this person even saw the end coming right around the corner.

308
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,340
 But it's so fascinating.

309
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,440
 Like even back then they're like, nope.

310
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
 This is the worst generation possible.

311
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,340
 Look at these kids not obeying their parents.

312
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,340
 This is the worst thing that a child can possibly do.

313
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,640
 And this article that I'm referencing was written by Dr. Roamy of Atelier.

314
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,040
 I want to go ahead and give him a shout out.

315
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,940
 But we go on from the Assyrian tablet.

316
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,840
 The reason why Chase is flying us out to Germany is we're going to college.

317
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
 It's back to school times, ladies and gentlemen.

318
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,640
 The University of Tübingen.

319
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,740
 That's in Tübingen, Germany.

320
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,140
 People are shaking their heads.

321
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,840
 They're like, dude, that is not a place anywhere in Germany.

322
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,540
 Anyways, the year is 1499.

323
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:30,540
 And Chase, I want you to land this carbon helicopter right on the campus of the University of Tübingen.

324
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,540
 There's a dude walking around the college and was like, yo, what's up, Johannes?

325
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,040
 And he's like, and he's like giving him a high five.

326
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,540
 What's up?

327
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,040
 He's just invented the high five now.

328
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
 He's like, well, this is pretty cool.

329
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
 I wonder if it'll last thousands of years.

330
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,540
 And Johannes Stofler is walking around.

331
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,940
 He was a scholar.

332
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,340
 He was a priest.

333
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
 He was a professor and a scientist.

334
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,840
 This dude had it all, right?

335
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:59,940
 And 1499, he's sitting there in his lab working on like astronomical instruments.

336
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,240
 This was back when they were still trying to learn how to spell astronomical.

337
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,940
 He's like building astrolabes.

338
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,040
 And he is so smart and so beloved.

339
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:16,340
 He becomes the advisor to royalty on all matters astronomical.

340
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:24,240
 So when Johannes makes a prediction based on science, that the world will end, people listened.

341
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,140
 All of Europe listened.

342
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:36,540
 He predicts on February 24th, 1524, the world will drown.

343
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,240
 Six planets.

344
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:46,140
 So at this point, all of them, all of the planets they've discovered, six planets, will unite in 16 different planetary conjunctions.

345
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,040
 All within the sign of Pisces.

346
00:20:51,040 --> 00:21:02,440
 So this is going to cause this gravitational pull and the oceans of the world will swell up and the rain will come down and we're all dead.

347
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,040
 Now, this is a great prediction because it's combining science.

348
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,140
 It's combining his knowledge of astronomy and a little bit of astrology too with the symbol of Pisces.

349
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:22,640
 And he's also religious and the great flood in the Bible is the first disaster that mankind faces.

350
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,140
 So it makes sense.

351
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,940
 God wants to keep the hits coming and there's nothing better than a classic.

352
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,940
 He's going to drown us all.

353
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,740
 Now, as the date got closer, he made that prediction back in 1499.

354
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:40,240
 As the date gets closer, people start to get really antsy because this guy, he's not a crackpot.

355
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,140
 He's an advisor to royalty.

356
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:49,040
 People probably have some of his astronomical gear he's created in their own laboratories.

357
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,540
 People know this guy.

358
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,440
 He's a man of God and a scientist.

359
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,340
 Maybe he's onto something.

360
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,040
 People start moving.

361
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:08,840
 People start selling their property if you live near a water line like a river or a lake, you would sell your property and then buy a boat.

362
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,640
 Now, this was perfect time.

363
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,140
 This is perfect time if you didn't believe in this hogwash to buy a lot of water from property.

364
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,340
 People start selling their houses and buying boats.

365
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,040
 People who have enough money though start to build arks.

366
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,240
 Right now, the instructions are right in the Bible.

367
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,140
 It'll tell you how to build an ark.

368
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,140
 It's weird to start to have this competition.

369
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:39,940
 You have other fortune tellers, other soothsayers, even other scientists in England say, "We dispute.

370
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,440
 We dispute Johann's prediction.

371
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,640
 The world will not end on February 24th, 1524.

372
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,640
 It'll actually end on February 1st, 1524.

373
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,040
 And it'll happen here in England first.

374
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,840
 They want to go out first.

375
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,340
 So now people are like, "Okay, let's see what happens."

376
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,240
 We have two dueling predictions.

377
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,140
 February, spoiler alert.

378
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,440
 The world does not end in 1524, because you're wondering.

379
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,540
 But on February 1st, 1524, nothing happened.

380
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,640
 Nothing happened at all.

381
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,840
 People in England were stocking up on food.

382
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,640
 They were moving to high ground and nothing happened.

383
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,340
 And at this point, we're two months into 1524.

384
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:29,040
 It's been an unusually dry year these first two months.

385
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,340
 But some people are going, "No, no, no.

386
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,040
 God's just saving up that juice.

387
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,840
 Saving up that juice to destroy the planet."

388
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,040
 So it doesn't happen in England.

389
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,240
 And at that point, a lot of people in England go, "This probably isn't going to happen."

390
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,540
 Right?

391
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,040
 Because we thought it was going to happen earlier.

392
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,840
 I sold my house.

393
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
 Going to get my house back.

394
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,440
 You're floating away on a boat just down the river times.

395
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,140
 And they're like, "No refunds."

396
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,540
 It's 23 days, though, until the actual end of the world.

397
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:59,540
 In Germany, back in Germany, there's a man named Count von Igelheim.

398
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,740
 And he has a bunch of money and he doesn't want to die.

399
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,440
 That's the combination of things you need to do what he's about to do.

400
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,240
 He builds a massive ark.

401
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,740
 A three-story ark.

402
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,740
 I mean, that's huge.

403
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,940
 He builds this for his friends and his family.

404
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,640
 And this obviously didn't wait until February 1st and go, "Ah, he's been working on this

405
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,940
 for a while and it's sitting there right on the river on the Rhine."

406
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
 And locals are like, "Oh man, that guy's so nuts.

407
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,640
 He's building that."

408
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,940
 But I'm sure a lot of people went down to help build it just to get paid.

409
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,040
 But locals just thought he was crazy.

410
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,340
 All these other people believe this.

411
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
 But again, people are like, "I don't know.

412
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,940
 It hasn't rained much this year at all.

413
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,140
 England was a wash.

414
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,040
 No pun intended."

415
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,940
 Or England wasn't a wash, actually.

416
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,940
 But on February 24th, 1524, this is the predicted day of the end of the world.

417
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,440
 You had people from all over come out to the Rhine to see these boats.

418
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,940
 Just see what would happen, right?

419
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,240
 Are you just going to sit there and you're going to laugh at these rich people who built

420
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,640
 these boats and sold their houses?

421
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
 Or...

422
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,940
 Now, most people figure at this point it's not real.

423
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,240
 But you have that thing in the back of your head, like the La Palma volcano.

424
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,240
 I was worried for precisely 24 hours because I just found out about it.

425
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,740
 That day I was like, "Oh my God."

426
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,940
 And then as I looked into it more, I go, "Okay, it could happen."

427
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,340
 But it's unlikely.

428
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,540
 But it could happen.

429
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,740
 So I moved.

430
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,240
 I'm no longer living on Eastern Seaboard.

431
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,840
 I moved last week.

432
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:38,240
 They're watching this and they're loading and people are loading supplies onto Von Iglehime's Ark.

433
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,540
 You have a ton of people out there watching this.

434
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,240
 By the midday you have thousands of people watching this spectacle.

435
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,440
 I mean, it's 1524.

436
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,940
 There's no television.

437
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,840
 The most exciting thing you can see is someone loading a boat.

438
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,840
 And while thousands of people are gathered out here watching this,

439
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,740
 and Von Iglehime's Ark is being loaded with supplies, friends, family member are getting on board,

440
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,540
 it starts to rain.

441
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,740
 An unusually dry 1524.

442
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:19,640
 And it starts to pour down rain on the day the world is supposed to drown.

443
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,540
 A panic sets into the crowd.

444
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,840
 That becomes a riot.

445
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,440
 That becomes a mass casualty event.

446
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,340
 Thousands and thousands of people are trying to board this ship.

447
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:46,340
 There is such a massive crush of humans running towards this Ark.

448
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,540
 And there were other boats on the Rhine as well.

449
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:54,140
 But the main object that everyone was going for was this massive three-story Ark.

450
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,740
 So many people were rushing towards each other.

451
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,940
 So many humans were cramped into this small area of the panic.

452
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,040
 The world is ending.

453
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,840
 So many people died in the crush.

454
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,840
 We have no idea how many people were killed.

455
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:21,840
 Count Von Iglehime is dragged off of his Ark and stoned to death by the crowd.

456
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,440
 I don't know how that was supposed to get them on the Ark.

457
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,540
 He was the only one with the keys.

458
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,640
 They're like, "Oh, no!"

459
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,940
 People pushed towards these boats, fighting over them, falling into the water, getting trampled.

460
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,940
 Thousands of people pouring into this small area.

461
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,040
 And the rain continued to fall from the heavens.

462
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:51,140
 It wasn't until the rain stopped shortly after that the crowd realized, "Oh, well, I'm my bad.

463
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:57,040
 I'm so sorry. I kind of lost my mind. I thought the world was about to end."

464
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:03,540
 And as people started to calm down, started doing the deep breathing,

465
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,040
 the true horror of the event became evident.

466
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,640
 Hundreds of people died in this crush.

467
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,540
 You had people fall down and get trampled.

468
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,740
 You had people beaten to death.

469
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,040
 People fallen into the river and drowning.

470
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:26,940
 Hundreds of people died because it rained on a day where a man predicted the world would end by a flood.

471
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,440
 Yohannes is nowadays more recognized for all of his scientific advancements, rather than his prediction.

472
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,440
 I mean, it's a bit of trivia for a man who's created all these instruments,

473
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,940
 but it's still a pretty bad thing to put on your resume, right?

474
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,940
 You made a mistake that killed hundreds of people.

475
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:53,940
 So that's the story of Yohann Stofler and his prediction of the end of the world, which he got kind of right.

476
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,940
 I always think about 2012, a long time ago, that Mayan calendar talking about the end of the world,

477
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,440
 and it wasn't the end of the world, but for thousands of people worldwide, it was the end of the world.

478
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
 That was their last year alive.

479
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,940
 There's a lot of suicides connected to the 2012 prophecy.

480
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,940
 People were afraid.

481
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:19,440
 So what if the Mayan prophecy wasn't seeing the end of the world,

482
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,440
 but seeing the end of a lot of lives due to fear of the end of the world?

483
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,440
 Does that make sense? It's like a chicken and egg thing.

484
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:39,940
 Yohann Stofler, did he see a vision of the future of people dying in the rain and think, "Whoa, the world's going to drown on February 24th, 1524.

485
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,440
 I've done these astronomical layouts, and I can see this.

486
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,440
 I can see people drowning.

487
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
 I can see people dying.

488
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,440
 I can see mass amounts of people being killed during the rainstorm.

489
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,440
 He wasn't seeing the end of the world.

490
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,440
 He was seeing a vision of the future, a vision of the future that he caused himself

491
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,440
 by making the prediction that people would die in the rain.

492
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,440
 He caused people to die in the rain.

493
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,440
 So the next time you hear a doomsday prophecy, take it with a grain of salt.

494
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,440
 At the very least, you may get wrapped up in this conspiracy theory at the end of the world.

495
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,440
 It raises your blood pressure. You're constantly stressed.

496
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,440
 Your friends don't want to hang out with you because that's all you can talk about.

497
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,440
 But at the worst, you might actually play into the prophecy.

498
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,440
 You may unwillingly become part of it.

499
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
 We never really know what's going to happen in the future.

500
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,440
 Not even the prognosticators can truly tell us that.

501
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,440
 But through our own individual actions, we may unwittingly trigger our own demise

502
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,440
 trying to avoid a fictional end of the world.

503
