1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 Monkeys infected with herpes are invading Florida.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,500
 We take a look at the list of the longest movies ever made.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:18,000
 And then finally, we come face to face with the legendary, infamous Count Dante.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
 Today on Dead Rava Radio.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rava Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
 Yesterday was not a great day though.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,500
 I was dangerously dehydrated and I think that's what the problem was.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
 And while I was editing it, I don't really think you came across on yesterday's podcast,

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
 but I was very, very exhausted mentally.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,000
 But yeah, that was a fun night.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,500
 I actually felt like I had run a marathon in my head.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:00,000
 Like once I got rehydrated and ate a good meal, I felt so much better and then I just slept.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And I've taken two naps today so far.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and get started with the episode now.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,500
 This is a story. The first one is a story that popped up in the news just the other day.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,000
 And I was like, it was one of those stories that simply kept getting more and more ridiculous

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 and frightening at the same time.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 So in Florida right now, they're having an issue with these little monkey guys.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 They're called "resus monkeys."

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,500
 They're like the little, little tiny monkey people.

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,500
 So you're thinking, how did a bunch of monkeys show up in Florida?

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,000
 And there are a bunch. Right now there's about 300 of them and that's fairly low.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,500
 In 1938, there was a tour boat operator by the name of Colonel Tuie.

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
 Not his real name, he wasn't really a colonel, but that was his nickname.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 And there's an area in Florida called Silver State Park.

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,000
 It's a really big park, like a national park. It's like 5,000 acres, so it's fairly large.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,500
 And in the middle of it was an island. There's like a lake, I guess, yeah.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 Well, obviously there's like a lake in the middle of the park and in the middle of the lake, there's an island.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,500
 And Colonel Tuie thought, you know what, I'm gonna have like this Tarzan themed adventure park on this island.

31
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
 And you can't have Tarzan without monkeys, right?

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 So he imports these six little resus monkeys.

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 He drops them off on the island and within hours they swam off the island.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 He didn't know they were really good swimmers.

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 So now you had six monkeys on the mainland of Florida.

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,500
 Colonel Tuie, not to be deterred by defeat, gets another batch of monkeys.

37
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:37,500
 Six more of them. They also immediately swim off the island into the wilderness of Florida.

38
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,000
 By the 1980s, there were hundreds of monkeys in the area.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And you know, they're cute. They're little guys hanging out from trees.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 They're omnivores, so they have a very varied diet and that makes them more prone to explode in areas that they shouldn't be,

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 because they can kind of eat whatever. Bugs, fruits, berries, whatever, stuff.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Stuff that monkeys can eat. So they're eating all this stuff, they're hanging out.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,500
 Eventually, the government of Florida was like, okay, we need to get rid of these monkeys.

44
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 So they began calling them and people could come in and capture them.

45
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,000
 They weren't really necessarily letting them shoot them out of trees.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 But you could come in and capture the monkeys and the monkey population dropped.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Between 1984 and 2012, a thousand monkeys were removed from the park.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So again, it was a sizable amount.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 But what happened was in 2012, it got out that the people who were taking the monkeys were selling them to biomedical labs for experimentation.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,500
 So the public was like, no, like, yeah, we have these monkeys in the middle of this national park.

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 They're not hurting anybody. Leave them be, because the alternative is them being tested in laboratories.

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 So the government's like, fine, like whatever.

53
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
 So right now they assume there's around 300 of these monkeys running around Florida.

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 And you think, okay, big deal. A bunch of little monkeys running around throwing poop at people.

55
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:12,000
 Well, two things. These monkeys aren't afraid of humans and they look cute, but they can attack you very quickly.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 They'll rush you very quickly. And a lot of times people will hold out food for them because they look cute.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And the monkey will kind of do that little funny monkey walk over and then get aggressive right when it's about to get the food.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 They're fairly aggressive creatures around humans. They will chase you off.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,500
 They've had to close the state park twice because people have been chased off by the monkeys.

60
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:42,000
 Because the danger of these guys isn't that they're just going to scratch you or throw poop at you or, you know,

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,500
 you know, make monkey noises at you.

62
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,500
 30% of them are infected with herpes B.

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,500
 Herpes B in a monkey, it's related to the normal herpes virus in humans.

64
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,000
 The herpes B in a monkey is, you know, it's going to have a hard time getting a date on a Saturday night.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,500
 But when the humans get herpes, it causes your spinal cord and your brain to swell up.

66
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,000
 It kills you for the most part or causes brain damage.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 They said the chances, there was a quote saying the chances of contracting it is very, very low,

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
 but the consequences of it is very, very high.

69
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,000
 They compared it to winning the lottery in reverse type of thing.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 So it's not something that you'll necessarily get every time a monkey touches you,

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,500
 but if you do get it, you're going to have some serious problems.

72
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,000
 And herpes B is in fluid. So spit. It's in urine.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 It's in feces, which they like to throw at you, and even a good scratch from one of them could give you this disease.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,500
 So it's very, very, has a lot of transmission factors to it.

75
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,000
 The monkeys have started to leave the national park.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,500
 The monkeys have begun showing up in houses that are outside the national park,

77
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,000
 rooting through their garbage, looking for something to eat.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 The monkeys have actually started migrating to other parts of the state.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,500
 They've been sited down to the Florida Keys.

80
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 They've even been sited in Puerto Rico.

81
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
 That's a really good swimmer.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 If you can swim from Florida to Puerto Rico.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:22,500
 In 1997, a woman was working on a monkey in a lab, and she got some monkey juice.

84
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 It doesn't really say what it was.

85
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 She got some monkey--it says bodily fluids in her eye, and she got herpes B and it killed her.

86
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
 And that's an interesting thing, too.

87
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 You can catch AIDS through your eyeball.

88
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's permeable enough that AIDS-infected fluid in your eye will get you.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,500
 It doesn't necessarily have to be through sex if you get it on your face.

90
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 I think you know what I'm talking about, but you can actually penetrate your eyeball

91
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
 and give you AIDS that way, or in this case, herpes B,

92
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 because it's just very, very thin barrier that goes right into the bloodstream and all that.

93
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 So, with this news getting out, like I said, this article just came out a couple days ago,

94
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 will there be renewed efforts to fight the herpes monkeys of Florida?

95
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,000
 I don't think so.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,500
 I think even though 30% of these guys have herpes and they're spreading out into the state,

97
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
 they're being seen in areas where they weren't seen before,

98
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,000
 they're aggressive and they're not afraid of humans,

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I think it'll take a more recent couple of deaths before the public gets behind taking these guys out again,

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,500
 because you could say, "Well, this woman died in 1997 of this,"

101
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,000
 and then the people who want to save the monkeys just has to show a picture of an adorable monkey

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,500
 and go, "Aww."

103
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,000
 So we'll see. Hopefully this doesn't spread.

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Hopefully this is super rare and nobody else dies of it,

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 but the bigger the population gets and the more they spread out,

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 the higher the chances that somebody in Florida or anywhere else in the South could get herpes from a monkey.

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,500
 How would you explain that on a date?

108
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,500
 Be like, "I really love you, honey. I really want to be with you.

109
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,000
 I got herpes from a monkey."

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Now, of course, she probably would know you got herpes from a monkey

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 because your brain would be swelled up outside of your head and you would have a massive spinal column,

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,500
 but let's assume you didn't get that.

113
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,000
 Let's assume you got herpes being a-- didn't kill you, but you had lifelong herpes.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,500
 How would you explain that on your Tinder profile?

115
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Our next story is something that popped up on my radar just because the title sounded interesting.

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
 I dug a little more into it.

118
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 I was like, "That's-- that's-- it was something I didn't know about.

119
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 But what happened was I saw the phrase 'The Cure for Insomnia.'

120
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,000
 That was all that I saw.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,500
 It is a movie that lasts 87 hours.

122
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,000
 It takes three days and 15 hours to watch the whole movie.

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 The Cure for Insomnia, at the time in 1987, was the world's longest film.

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
 It has no plot.

125
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 It's just a recording of a guy, a poet named L.D. Groban, reading his 4,080-page poem,

126
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
 "The Cure for Insomnia."

127
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 And then in-- in intercut with this guy reading this poem,

128
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 there are clips of heavy metal music--

129
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 [imitates heavy metal music]

130
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,000
 --and then hardcore porn.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,500
 I mean, that would keep you up, I guess, if you're starting to fall asleep

132
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 and the heavy metal music is loud enough.

133
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
 I don't know, three days is a long time to stay awake.

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
 But yeah, so I was like, "That's interesting."

135
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,000
 Now, the thing is, the movie was showing apparently one time.

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,500
 It's even showing more, but there's no copy of it in existence today.

137
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 You can't get it on DVD, there's no video copy of it, anything.

138
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,000
 It's just something that people saw and they experienced, and then it went away.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,500
 You know, and that's interesting because when we have the ability to go back and rewatch stuff,

140
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,000
 it does, in a way, kind of diminish it.

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I remember-- there used to be a show on television called "Cop Rock" back in the '80s.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,500
 I think it was like '86 or something like that, '87.

143
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,000
 And it was like a-- imagine CSI but a musical, as how it was.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And it only lasted one season.

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,500
 You can get it today on DVD, but back then that was science fiction.

146
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,000
 You watched the television show and that was it.

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Unless you had a VCR, which really only more wealthy people had VCRs and was recording stuff,

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,500
 even back then.

149
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,000
 Not wealthy like Bill Gates' wealthy, but you had to have a good amount of money.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 We had a VCR, but I don't think we're recording stuff off of television.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,500
 There's just too much television to consume, but we're going to do have a whole library of videocassettes.

152
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 And I remember we were watching-- one day I was watching-- I thought the show was stupid.

153
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 I was a little kid, I was probably like 11.

154
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 And I asked my dad, I go, "Why do you like this show?"

155
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,500
 And he said, "There's something about a song you know you'll only hear one time."

156
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
 And that was the truth back then.

157
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 There wasn't a soundtrack for the show.

158
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,000
 The show simply existed at that time.

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,500
 Now, if it was a big hit, they may have had a soundtrack and stuff like that.

160
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,000
 But television shows weren't being released on VHS.

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,500
 That I know of there may have been specials, like the Charlie Brown special,

162
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 "Simpsons Christmas Special," things like that.

163
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:05,500
 But for my father, watching that show, that was the only time he'd ever hear that song in his entire life.

164
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,000
 So there is something interesting about media we can only consume once and then it's gone.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
 It used to be the same thing before VHS.

166
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 You went to go see Star Wars at the theater, like you walked out of there and you said, "Whoa, that was amazing."

167
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,000
 You were never going to be able to take it home and watch it whenever you wanted to.

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,500
 And once the movie left the theater, that was it. It was gone.

169
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 So there is something about media, something magical about media we can only consume one time.

170
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 But so that was the longest film of the time in 1987.

171
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,500
 There are five movies now that are longer than that.

172
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,000
 Longer than three days and 15 hours.

173
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,500
 Now, I do have to say while I was researching this topic, I was watching, in a bizarre sense of irony,

174
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,500
 I was watching a movie called "Slaughter Claws" about a killer Santa Claus, obviously.

175
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 It was probably one of the worst films I've seen and I'm a collector of bad films.

176
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,500
 I love them. That's probably my favorite form of movie is an unintentionally bad film.

177
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,000
 Yes, I've seen the room and yes, there are multiple movies far, far worse than the room.

178
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
 "Slaughter Claws" is one of them.

179
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 But "Slaughter Claws," I'm watching this movie about this killer Santa Claus, just painfully bad editing.

180
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,500
 There's no plot. The whole movie's maybe an hour long, but it felt like it was three days and 15 hours.

181
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
 And this is what I came across.

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,500
 Fifth longest film was "Three Days, 23 Hours."

183
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:42,000
 It's just a picture of a photograph and there's a boy riding a bicycle, a street, a house, garage,

184
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 and over time the image changes.

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,500
 But it changes over the course of three days and 23 hours so the shift of the movement is imperceptible to the human eye.

186
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 Fascinating.

187
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,000
 "Four" was probably the weirdest of them.

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,500
 The fourth longest movie was called "Untitled #125 Hickory." That movie's five days long.

189
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 It is a six minute, 30 second clip from the movie "The Wizard of Oz."

190
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:22,500
 It says, "From the moment the viewer sees the tornado until Dorothy meets Glenda the Good Rich," which it's that six minute and 30 second clip of the movie stretched out for five days.

191
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,500
 And they actually have clips of it online, like 15 minute clips at a time. It's really just a tone.

192
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 You see like a blurry image and it's like...

193
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 And I think he actually did take that clip and spread it out.

194
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:44,500
 And apparently the five days, the reason why it's that long is that's in real time how long Dorothy spent in Oz.

195
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,000
 So that's why it's spread out that long.

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,500
 The third longest movie is "Beijing 2003." It's six days, six hours. It's just a car driving around Beijing.

197
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,500
 Okay, that's a little bit of a let down after the first two bizarre entries.

198
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,500
 Number two, "Modern Times Forever." This one was interesting. It's ten days long.

199
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:09,000
 And the movie was projected on the side of a building called the "Stora Enso."

200
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,500
 The "Stora Enso" headquarters in Helensky.

201
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,000
 And the movie is projected on the side of the building and what the movie is.

202
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,500
 It's what would happen to that building, how it would decay over the next few thousand years.

203
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
 So you're looking at the building and over the course of ten days the film would change.

204
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 So you'd start to see like window panes fall out and the roof would start to kind of break down.

205
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,000
 And it just like how what would happen to that building over the next few thousand years.

206
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,500
 That's an interesting concept. One person said though, "Why does it have to be ten days?

207
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,000
 Couldn't you then speed the process up and make it last only one day and just make it look quicker?"

208
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 But I think you know again it was a work of art to do that.

209
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And the longest movie blows all those away.

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,500
 So "Modern Times" was ten days. "Modern Times Forever" was ten days.

211
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,000
 This movie was 35 days and 17 hours to watch the whole thing. It's called "Logistics."

212
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 It was these filmmakers who said, "You know what? We're going to follow the production cycle of a pedometer

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 and reverse chronological order." So they went from it being shipped to the...

214
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,500
 Like they open up the package and they find the pedometer that they ordered.

215
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,500
 And then they travel back all the way to see the pieces being sourced to make it at the manufacturer.

216
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
 It's all shot in real time. They open the package up and then they follow it back.

217
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 The whole process it would take to make the pedometer all the way back to the factory in Shenzhen,

218
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,000
 which I believe is in China. Again, these are works of art, really.

219
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 I think out of all of these, "The Modern Times Forever" would be one that I would want to see

220
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,500
 at least in bits and chunks watching the decay of the building.

221
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,000
 Because that's fascinating. But yeah, they're just works of art more than anything else.

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Our next story is "The Life and Times of Count Dante."

223
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Now, Count Dante, you're probably thinking, "Oh, you know, Cape, Transylvania, or like Europe stuff,

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,500
 Scepter, right in the horse." No. Count Dante was actually a martial artist in the 60s and 70s of America.

225
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 Very, very skilled martial artist. And what's interesting, as I was reading this story,

226
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,000
 I came to two different conclusions. My first conclusion was totally off.

227
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,500
 My first conclusion, okay, so let's back up here. So Count Dante was, it was an Irish guy.

228
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,500
 He wasn't actually a count. His legal name was John Timothy Keenan.

229
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 He was this Irish guy born in 1939. Joined the military, really loved doing martial arts,

230
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,000
 really into the hand-to-hand combat thing. Learned a bunch there.

231
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 He was one of the guys who really helped popularize martial arts in America.

232
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,500
 Because before the 1950s, they were relatively unheard of.

233
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,000
 But what happened was Count Dante, well, at this time, he was still John Keenan.

234
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So John Keenan was working with some of the martial arts masters.

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 But he started to get bored of the pomp and the circumstance that came with conventional karate.

236
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,500
 He was a skilled fighter. Now, what's funny was, and this is where I'll go back,

237
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,000
 my first conclusion when I first read about him, I thought, "Oh, this guy is just a blowhard.

238
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 He's not a, he's just like a big marketing gimmick. He's not that good of a fighter.

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,500
 He resorts dirty tricks." But that's kind of what the first article I read kind of seemed like.

240
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
 Like, "Oh, yeah, this guy said that he fought in deathmatches in Thailand."

241
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,500
 And I was like, "Oh, that's ridiculous." But the more I read about him, he actually was a skilled fighter.

242
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,000
 He was undefeated in numerous freestyle competitions.

243
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,500
 Like, he knew his stuff. And I was like, "Oh, this guy's actually more than just a poser."

244
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
 He was well-respected in the martial arts community.

245
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,000
 The reason why I started to think that it was just all an act,

246
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 because he started to come up with this bizarre backstory.

247
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,500
 But first, he had to come up with an effective fighting system.

248
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,000
 He didn't like how karate was all about rules and stuff like that.

249
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He wanted to do street fighting. He wanted to do fighting that would work against assailants that were trying to mug you.

250
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,500
 So he was all about just explosive attacks. It was just about brutality.

251
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 He wanted to hit you as hard as he could, as effectively as he could.

252
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,000
 Not to win the competition, but to lay you out.

253
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:26,500
 And one of the principal parts of this fight style was the dimmuk, or the death touch, which is the fabled "one punch kills you."

254
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 In 1967, he changed his name to Count Juan Rafael Dante.

255
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:38,000
 He made up this entire backstory saying that his parents fled Spain because they were being persecuted during the Spanish Civil War,

256
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 and they changed their names to Genen, but now he's taken on his real name as Count Dante.

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,500
 Count, apparently.

258
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 His new fighting system was called the Dante System, or Cata Dante.

259
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,500
 Count Dante, the deadliest man alive, was what he called himself, but he was the deadliest man alive.

260
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:03,000
 And the reason why he became so famous, a lot of people don't know about him today,

261
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 but back then he became very famous because he took advantage of one of the best advertising mediums at the time for his audience,

262
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
 and that was comic books.

263
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 He posted ads and comic books in the 60s, exclaiming that he was the deadliest man alive.

264
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 And yes, you, you 14-year-old boy reading Spider-Man issue 173, you could also be the deadliest man alive.

265
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 Here's the ad.

266
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 Imagine you are 13, 14 years old in 1965.

267
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,500
 You open up Fantastic Four and you see this ad.

268
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,000
 At first off, it's a picture of Count Dante.

269
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 He's standing there and it looks like he has a giant afro for some reason.

270
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,500
 But anyway, so here's the ad.

271
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:51,000
 Yes, this is the deadliest and most terrifying fighting art known to man without equal.

272
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,500
 Its main, mutilated, disfigurated, paralyzing, and crippling techniques are known only by a few people in the world.

273
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:06,000
 An expert at Democ could easily kill many judo, karate, kung fu, a kido, and gung fu experts at one time

274
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 with only fingertip pressure using his murderous poison hand weapons.

275
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Instructing you step by step through each move in this manual is none other than Count Dante, the deadliest man who ever lived.

276
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Which actually, it's funny, that's a little more both.

277
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,500
 So now there's two claims.

278
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
 First off, the deadliest man alive.

279
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 That's possible. The deadliest man who ever lived.

280
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
 Don't oversell it, Count Dante.

281
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
 Don't oversell it.

282
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,000
 So anyways, you're 13, you're 14, you see that ad.

283
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,500
 What is it going to be back then? A book?

284
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,000
 You're going to have to save up three weeks to get a book to send to this guy to get a fighting.

285
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,500
 Who's not going to do that?

286
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,500
 And even if you didn't do that, every time you open up a comic book, you find that ad in the comic book.

287
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,000
 It just became part of the cultural consciousness for that nerd culture.

288
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,500
 So he ended up forming the admittedly badass named Black Dragon Fighting Society.

289
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:12,500
 Now, of course, the deadliest man alive couldn't just have that title for having a little fighting school.

290
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,000
 He also had to be kind of nuts.

291
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Now, all of this is taking place in Chicago now.

292
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,500
 Black Dragon Fighting Society, this is in Chicago.

293
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,000
 Oh, and I should say, speaking about him being nuts, he once showed up at the doorstep of Muhammad Ali and tried challenging him to a fight.

294
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 He was willing to fight anybody at any time.

295
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 So, and this was Muhammad Ali in his prime.

296
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 So he, and of course, Muhammad Ali didn't open the door, but he was trying to fight everybody that he could.

297
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And he was, like I said, a pretty good fighter.

298
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 He was challenging the karate masters, the martial arts masters of Chicago to just fight him.

299
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And people are like, "No, I'm not going to fight you," because he was nuts.

300
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,500
 Whether or not he knew the dimmock, nobody can really state.

301
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,500
 Or if the dimmock actually exists, but they didn't want to fight this guy.

302
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,000
 This guy, so Count Dante at one point, Bruce Lee had just passed away, and Hollywood said,

303
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 "You know what? We need a new martial arts superstar. What about this Count Dante guy?"

304
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 He shows up in all these comic books.

305
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,500
 They flew him out from Chicago to LA, where he proceeded to beat up the stuntmen

306
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,500
 and the other martial arts performers, injured a bunch of people, and they said, "Go home!"

307
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,500
 He wouldn't pull his punches, even on a movie set.

308
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,500
 They're like, "No, you, you have to shoot a movie. You can't be like breaking people's arms.

309
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 You have to cast, can't be dead. We're a franchise. We want you to do multiple movies.

310
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 You'll be in jail after the first film."

311
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:49,000
 He also had a proclivity to getting himself into some legal trouble.

312
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 One day, him and his buddy, Douglas Dwyer, who was known as the second deadliest man alive,

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 can you imagine explaining that to your date?

314
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 First off, you have to explain that you have monkey herpes.

315
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And then secondly, you have to say, "Yes, I am Douglas Dwyer. You can call me Dougie.

316
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,500
 I'm the second deadliest man alive." And then she is obviously going to ask, "Well, who's the first?"

317
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 I want to date the first deadliest man alive and the guy who doesn't have monkey herpes.

318
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,000
 Who wants to date the second deadliest man alive?

319
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,500
 But anyway, so, Count Dante and Douglas Dwyer, the cop is walking down the street one night

320
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,500
 and he sees these two guys supposedly dressed, I don't know, I'm going to assume they're dressed up as ninjas,

321
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:40,000
 but he sees these two guys outside of a dojo, a rival dojo to the Black Dragon Fighting Society.

322
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,500
 Cop's looking and he's like, "What are they doing?"

323
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,000
 He notices they're kind of fiddling around.

324
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Cop's like, "Oi, get back here!"

325
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,500
 Douglas Dwyer and Count Dante go taking off down the street.

326
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,000
 They run into a dead end.

327
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Should have been working more on that wall climbing technique.

328
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,500
 Cop arrested them. They were taping dynamite blasting caps to the dojo.

329
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:06,000
 They got charged with arson because they were trying to blow it up.

330
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,500
 They were trying to blow up a rival dojo.

331
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,000
 This guy took this stuff really, really seriously.

332
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 In 1970, Count Dante had the brilliant idea.

333
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 There was another rival dojo in Chicago.

334
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 This, I mean, really was like a perfect time to be getting into martial arts

335
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,500
 because you have like that mystical side of it, like it seems so new and there are places everywhere.

336
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,000
 But anyways, there was another dojo that was run by the Green Dragon Society

337
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 and this was their Black Cobra Hall.

338
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 So the Black Cobra Hall of the Green Dragon Society got attacked by the Black Dragon Fighting Society.

339
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Count Dante and a couple of his guys dressed up as police officers.

340
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 [laughs]

341
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,500
 I mean, a bad idea from the start.

342
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,000
 Like, there's no way this is gonna go right.

343
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Count Dante and a couple of his students, his buddies,

344
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 dressed up as police officers, walked into the Black Cobra Hall.

345
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,500
 Said, "Everyone, turn around. You're under arrest and for some reason in particular."

346
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 And then he hit one of them over the head with a club, like a billy club.

347
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 A brawl breaks out.

348
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 So imagine now you're just walking through Chicago and you happen to look into a dojo

349
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:23,500
 and you see a bunch of people in police uniforms and a bunch of people in martial arts uniforms

350
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 having a full-on karate combat through the school.

351
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,000
 Like, you're just looking through the window and you see this huge melee

352
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,500
 and people are doing jump kicks and crank kicks and dim mocks and all sorts of stuff.

353
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 If that was me, I would be like, "I'm going to that school tomorrow.

354
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,500
 I'm dropping out of all other activities I have."

355
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 If that is a typical Thursday night for that dojo, sign me up.

356
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:54,000
 But it didn't end so happily because one of the Black Dragon Fighting Society guys,

357
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,500
 when Count Dante's men, ended up stabbing and killing one of the Green Dragon Society's guys.

358
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:08,500
 And so it was weird because the court basically decided that everyone was in the wrong.

359
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,000
 Even though Count Dante showed up in the police uniforms, there might have just been a weird escalation

360
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 but basically there was, it seemed to be, no legal repercussions for it even though the guy died.

361
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,500
 But Count Dante did have a lawyer who was a mob lawyer who helped get him off and oddly enough,

362
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:34,500
 the mob lawyer later came forward and said that Count Dante was actually the mastermind behind a $4.3 million robbery.

363
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,000
 And Count Dante ended up getting questioned for it but passed the lie detector test, so...

364
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 But again, that was an interesting thing. Like, that could... Maybe he was.

365
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Maybe he was actually like a super criminal with these crotty powers.

366
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Which, but again, all of those details are now lost to time.

367
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,500
 Eventually, he had to pass away.

368
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,000
 And he passed away through an internal hemorrhage in 1975.

369
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,500
 He was in his sleep and a bleeding ulcer killed him.

370
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 A peaceful end to a man who claimed to murder people in the ring,

371
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,000
 to a man who tried blowing up rival clubs,

372
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,500
 to a man who may have been deeply involved in the criminal underworld.

373
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,500
 But there's always been a legend.

374
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:32,000
 That one of the martial arts masters that he was constantly taunting in the city of Chicago,

375
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 all of the threats he made, all of the boasts, all of the "I want to fight you right now and the master would go, I'm not going to fight you."

376
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,500
 There's always been a story.

377
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:52,000
 There's always been the story in the back streets of Chicago that one of those masters waited for his moment.

378
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,500
 Maybe it was on a crowded subway.

379
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
 Maybe it was in a restaurant.

380
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,000
 Or maybe it was when Count Dante was sleeping peacefully in his bed,

381
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 that one of those masters came to him and administered the dimmock.

382
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,500
 An hour later, he was dead.

383
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,000
 Even the man's death is shrouded in mystery.

384
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 And I think that's just the way Count Dante would like it.

385
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
