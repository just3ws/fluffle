1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 It's the beginning of Insanity Week. It's the craziest stories that I could find. I didn't actually want to find them

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,520
 They found me were covering some of the craziest stuff this week on Dead Rabbit Radio

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,680
 first off a time traveler appears in a city in Wyoming his mission

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,120
 Warn us of the massive alien invasion coming in the year 2018

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,200
 and then we meet a group of people who have pierced the veil between reality and

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,200
 fantasy

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
 using methamphetamines and

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,340
 They've started their own religion their gods the shadow people today on Dead Rabbit Radio

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:49,760
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter or I'm having a great day

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,200
 I hope you guys had a great day, too

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
 Hope you guys had a great weekend

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,760
 It was a calm one because this week this week we're gonna cover some of the craziest stories

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,760
 We've come across on Dead Rabbit Radio

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,260
 It didn't go out of my way to find them

15
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,160
 They just somehow dog piled on me no matter what I researched this week

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,200
 Turned into just a super bizarre rabbit hole so to start off Insanity Week coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,080
 It's our newest patreon supporter. He's dressed up as one of those old-timey mental people

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,520
 Not the guys in the asylum. He's not walking around a straight jacket. You know what old-timey people they used to carry around the nets

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
 They had like the funny wagon

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:37,440
 They didn't actually have his people Jesse everyone give a round of applause to Jesse he runs in he's he's drawn like an old

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,960
 Bugs Bunny cartoon character. He's running in with his net. Did they used to do that?

22
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,360
 They used to like drag you off nowadays. They're like police come to the hospital

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,860
 But I guess in the old I saw this documentary once about Bugs Bunny and Debbie Duck

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,080
 Didn't they used to throw a net over you Jesse's like no that didn't exist that didn't exist

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,960
 There was a cartoon Jesse you're gonna be captain our pilot this episode. He's shaking his head. Oh, you think this is bad

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,320
 I feel really bad for the patreon supporter on Thursday's episode

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,740
 But Jesse you're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon work

28
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,680
 You have a job that actually exists. That's fine, too

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
 Just help spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,880
 Jesse I'm gonna go ahead and touch the keys of the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
 We are headed out to

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,920
 Casper

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
 Wyoming

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,400
 Old Jason Jalopy is driving down the road. It's October 2nd

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,320
 2017 it's 10 30 p.m

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,640
 a

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,880
 Man appears in the middle of the street. He's like what where am I?

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 And someone goes you're in Casper, Wyoming and he goes no I mean the date

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,760
 Yes, where you were and today's like no the date the date and they said it's October 2nd

40
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,440
 2017 and he goes

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,480
 They've sent me back too far and he's running through the street of Casper, Wyoming

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,560
 I have to warn somebody have to warn anybody. He's running around this man's name is Bryant Johnson. This is true story. Well

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,520
 The true part is there's a man named Brian Johnson in Casper, Wyoming. He says he's from the year

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,160
 2048 he's running around he starts saying he has to talk to the president of town

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,400
 Who's the president of the town and people are like what are you talking about?

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,720
 Then he'd like run away and then he'd run into someplace else and he'd be like

47
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,040
 What year is it? He knows the year that's just the best way to start the conversation

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,360
 He wants people to know he's a time traveler. He's doing this the police are called out

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,280
 They come out and they see this man. He's running around. I

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,240
 Was kind of making the story more exciting

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:48,360
 It was more like he was stumbling around town going where's the president of town people are like what the alien invasion is coming

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,320
 He wasn't this super active Kyle Reese character. The reason why I had to add that disclaimer

53
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,440
 Was one because it's the truth. I wanted to make sure it's telling the truth

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,440
 But two what's coming next when the police show up this man who I previously said was running all over town

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,280
 The police walk up to him and they can obviously tell he's incredibly drunk

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,480
 They give him a breathalyzer test. He blows a point one three six

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,480
 Which a point zero eight is

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,760
 Illegally drunk or at least illegally drunk to drive

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,920
 So this guy is off the sauce or on the sauce or off his rocker or all sorts of stuff, right?

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,400
 This guy's super drunk. That's an illegal term the guy was super drunk your honor

61
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,200
 So the police question them they're like listen

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,880
 You're drunk. There's not really a question. It's a statement

63
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,520
 We're gonna say that you're drunk and he goes that's funny that you say that it's funny that you say that because you're right

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,760
 I am drunk. I am drunk officer, but not by my own accord

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
 You see in the future

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,640
 This is the greatest excuse. This is the greatest excuse I've ever heard in the future

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,600
 The only way you can time travel is to be incredibly drunk

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,800
 You're like Jason

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,780
 Excuse at all. That's the worst excuse. I think it's a creative excuse

70
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,000
 He says listen, so what happened was in the year 2048

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I was put on this giant

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,260
 Transportation pad and to make it so I could actually time travel. I was force fed liquor is his favorite liquor

73
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,480
 Honestly, he's like and I object Daniels, please go go go go go go. They don't give him like gin or something disgusting

74
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:29,420
 They force fed him liquor and the liquor is the body has to be saturated with alcohol to travel back in time

75
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,040
 The police are looking at each other and they're like that

76
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,360
 We don't know how time travel physics are going to work near 2048. All we know is that you're drunk here now

77
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,760
 and

78
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,600
 You're running around you're asking you're not

79
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,840
 He's adding that detail. You have laser blasters. You're shooting everyone. You're stumbling around town. You're harassing people

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,520
 You're publicly intoxicated. We're bringing you in and he is like no no you can't do that because he does have this mission

81
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,520
 He was sent back in time to warn about this alien invasion that's coming in the year 2018

82
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,680
 He was supposed to return to the year 2018, but he was sent back to the year 2017 instead

83
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,360
 So Jason, why are you covering the story? It seems like just a local weirdo got a little drunk hallucinating whatever

84
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,840
 I mean, it's not outside the realm of what I cover on this show doesn't involve aliens

85
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,100
 But there's a specific reason why I'm covering this story

86
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,160
 It's funny. It is funny and it does give us an idea of what time travel may be like

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:34,680
 What I thought was really interesting was that he was sent back in time to warn us of an alien invasion of the year 2018

88
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,440
 Now obviously it's the year 2021 it never happened

89
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,520
 But the people who sent him back now, this could just be his alcohol-addled brain

90
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,840
 But the people who sent him back were aliens

91
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,440
 Aliens

92
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,200
 Time traveled him back to the year 2017 to warn about an upcoming alien invasion

93
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,520
 That's been under conspiracy caps here for a second when I read that I go

94
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,240
 Why would aliens send back somebody to warn about them invading?

95
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,960
 What if aliens in the few let's let's say this in 2018 aliens invaded the planet

96
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,600
 It was a blowout the aliens spaceships flying around

97
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,880
 Dropping drop and bottles of Jack Daniels and people are like what this is the best weapon ever and they're drinking it

98
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,920
 And everyone's just taking big naps and the aliens are just kind of like walking into Congress and they're like

99
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:28,240
 I guess we won we didn't know humans we didn't know humans would react so poorly to our biological weapons

100
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,880
 We thought it well we thought it would kill them, but instead it just put them to sleep

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,520
 So it's now that you're 2048 and the aliens who've invaded Earth hate it here

102
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:44,280
 So they decide to send the most sober human back. They're like this man only has a blood alcohol content of point one three six

103
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,960
 They send him back in time. He runs around Casper, Wyoming. He's saying aliens are gonna invade and

104
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,560
 Aliens

105
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:01,440
 Also read the local newspaper of Casper, Wyoming. You didn't know that that's the only newspaper aliens read the aliens get all their information

106
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,840
 From the Casper Gazette some little newspaper and they can read this report and everyone laughs at this guy

107
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,720
 I'm not laughing at you Brian Johnson. You're a hero. You saved us

108
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,440
 But Brian Johnson comes back and he's like oh no don't invade the aliens send me back and the alcohol pad and all this stuff and

109
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,440
 Everyone laughs at him and throws him in jail, but up somewhere in recticuli seven the aliens are like

110
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,640
 Oh my god, did you read today's issue of the Casper Gazette?

111
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,680
 Of course, I did that's the only newspaper we read and they saw this and that's why the aliens didn't invade

112
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,760
 So thank you Brian Johnson. Thank you for saving the planet

113
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,680
 All you had to do is sacrifice your own liver and 48 hours in jail. You were able to

114
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,960
 Keep us from being taken over by aliens as we all laid around in alcoholic stupors a true

115
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,880
 Hellish future

116
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,120
 Jesse I'm gonna go ahead and touch you the keys of the carboner copter. We're leaving behind Casper Wyoming. We are headed out to

117
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
 the school of shadows

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:15,120
 This is where the insanity starts this is where the insanity of insanity week starts

119
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
 We're gonna take a look at a group of people

120
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,280
 Who have formed a new religion and I got to give a shout out to Fabio

121
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,160
 Nurbon he actually recommended the story he's recommended a lot of good stuff really really appreciate it

122
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:36,560
 Jesse you see that school down there and that's spooky spooky swamp. There's no roads connecting it to anything

123
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,480
 It's all like dark and moldy and everything like that. That's where we're going

124
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,280
 So hope you guys me and Jesse have on our gas masks on our PPE

125
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,880
 Hope you guys brought those and you came to listen to a podcast

126
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,160
 We're walking through the swamp we open up the school doors

127
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
 I

128
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,720
 Don't know why they sounded like that either don't need to I imagine they are like moldy they make a weird sound

129
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,680
 We're walking into the school of shadows

130
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,100
 This school was set up by a man on reddit

131
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,820
 No one is thought bought 100 and I'm I couldn't verify it, but I think we've covered him before

132
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,640
 We've done a lot of meth stories on this podcast

133
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,640
 Even starting early on if you have a so before had a meth story

134
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,520
 So I think I've covered him before but he created a subreddit back in February 2021 has a hundred and eighty five members

135
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,160
 Which is a hundred and eighty five members more than it should have

136
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,560
 And I'll explain why I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous, but I'll explain why

137
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,360
 But let's take a look at the theories here. So we walk into the school of shadows and

138
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,080
 We sit down in the desk. We all sit down on the same desk. It's a quantum desk

139
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,340
 You can hold all of us. Let's take a look at what thought bought 100 is teaching

140
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,200
 He has a philosophy known as the life addition theory

141
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,720
 Where life is about adding things life is constantly about growing as a person

142
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
 Fascinating really if you think about it, and it's quite simple

143
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,560
 You gain experiences. You don't really lose experiences

144
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,840
 You gain knowledge. I mean you can forget things, but it's not really that you forget it

145
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,120
 It's that you just don't have access to it anymore every life is always about addition

146
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,240
 So you constantly need to be adding observations to your life adding information to your life adding

147
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,600
 Experiences that is what the universe wants

148
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,120
 life is

149
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,720
 perception

150
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,240
 perception is thought thought is reality

151
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,640
 So

152
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:44,480
 What you perceive is reality that is the secret that is the science to getting rich that is an old

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,480
 Philosophy you can warp reality

154
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:56,120
 Through your own thoughts and if you get a bunch of people together and they agree on reality

155
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,920
 That is what constructs the universe. This isn't groundbreaking stuff. It's interesting. It's not groundbreaking stuff

156
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,280
 I hadn't heard of the life addition theory before but the idea that thoughts and reality is and we've all decided

157
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,720
 That's wood. We've all decided that my hand won't go through oak

158
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,920
 That'd be awesome if everyone on the planet just goes Jason's hand can go through oak like if everyone just believed that

159
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,120
 I'm just like sticking my hand pulling squirrels out of trees all day long. I'm like thanks world

160
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,560
 But those are all I remember hearing that type of stuff in high school. That was like high school philosophy

161
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,880
 So that's all well and good and I can understand where that logic is coming from

162
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,880
 This is where it starts to get darker. This is why it's the school of shadows and not the school of intro to philosophy

163
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,920
 If thought is reality and everyone's combined thoughts is what makes up the reality of the universe the shared reality

164
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,840
 psychosis

165
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,960
 bends the rules of the universe

166
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,080
 quote

167
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:00,440
 We believe psychosis has contributed to dismantling reality and making it more simulation

168
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,360
 unquote

169
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,840
 Which we hear a lot about in conspiracy theory today

170
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,800
 That we're moving to a reality that's so

171
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,520
 cartoonish

172
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:20,440
 That you can look at and go how are things playing out the way they are it feels like we're in a simulation

173
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,040
 It feels too dynamic to action-packed too full of mystery

174
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:33,600
 Like constructed mysteries. It seems like we're in a simulation rather than a random chaotic universe and

175
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:42,200
 You could say predictive programming isn't the Illuminati putting stuff in television shows to predict what they have to do because some sort of

176
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,560
 weird cosmic rule

177
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,320
 It's the opposite the universe is so bizarre now

178
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,000
 That it's replicating what is in the popular culture that it is a natural phenomenon

179
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
 And that's kind of what's going on here

180
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,160
 The psychosis is actually bending the universe and making it less real and more simulation

181
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,600
 So the goal of the school of shadow is to continue this process and the best way to continue this process is

182
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,720
 with the deities of the universe on your side

183
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
 aka the shadow people

184
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:26,120
 We've talked about shadow people a lot on this show shadow people I've had personal experiences with shadow people

185
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,800
 I'll put those up cut all put those episodes in the show notes

186
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,560
 There's a whole bunch of theories whether they're interdimensional whether they're gin

187
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,080
 Whether they're alien whether they're the original

188
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,480
 Inhabitants of hell who were pushed out when demons came down. There's a ton of different theories on these guys

189
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,240
 Are they ghosts are they more malevolent ghosts?

190
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,400
 But the shadow people you can see them when you are

191
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,120
 In an area where shadow people normally inhabit a haunted house a normal house

192
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,960
 The shadow person wants to pay you a visit another way that you can actually see shadow people anywhere

193
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,760
 You can be at the mayor's office. You can be talking about the upcoming alien invasion

194
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,680
 smoking meth and staying up

195
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,480
 Will allow you to see the shadow people

196
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,520
 I don't really think just staying up on its own will allow you to see shadow people

197
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:22,680
 But definitely a site a very well known side effect of smoking meth of meth psychosis is seeing the shadow people

198
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,200
 I used to follow the subreddit the meth subreddit and I

199
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,920
 Had a hard time telling because I also cover

200
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,040
 I also follow a bunch of paranormal subreddits and I would see shadow people pop up all the time in

201
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,440
 My reddit thread and I would have to look to see if it was a meth subreddit or if it was the truth is here or

202
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,280
 Ghosts or some other subreddit they talk about shadow people all the time in the meth subreddit

203
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:54,760
 But thought bot 100 has an idea here. We should worship the shadow people. They're the closest we have to real

204
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,440
 Gods real angels real demons are the shadow people

205
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,120
 That's an interesting thought because I guess I guess I should add this in now thought bot 100 smokes a lot of meth

206
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,680
 He does a lot of meth

207
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,160
 He's on a lot of the meth boards as well, and I might have mentioned that earlier

208
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,200
 I think I did in passing but to be specific he does smoke a lot of meth and he's very open about that

209
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,960
 How many people can say they've actually seen God? I can say I've seen the work of God in my life

210
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,560
 But I've never seen him. I mean my eyeballs are still intact. I'm not a pillar of salt

211
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,200
 So but I've never seen God, but you can see you can see the shadow people

212
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,640
 Tomorrow if you start or maybe tonight depending on how quickly you can get it if you I'm not I'm not recommending this

213
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,760
 But if you did start using meth and had meth psychosis, you could see shadow people don't do it. It's not worth it

214
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:55,480
 But if you had questions about faith do angels exist do demons exist you can see shadow people with the right amount of chemicals

215
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,240
 I'm sure with the right amount of any drug or lack of sleep you might be able to have other spiritual experiences

216
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,800
 But it's almost guaranteed with meth. So when you have a religion geared towards meth users

217
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:13,300
 They've all seen the shadow people. There is no faith. They've seen them. They've interacted with them

218
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:21,360
 The shadow people thought about explains that they want to be worshiped, but it's not like the traditional build a shrine kill a calf

219
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,240
 bow before it

220
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
 They clone you

221
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,400
 The shadow people clone you for two reasons

222
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,840
 One the first one is

223
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,120
 Incredibly disturbing

224
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,480
 I mean anyone cloning you for any reasons probably creepy, but when I read this I go that's creepy

225
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,920
 They clone you for two reasons one the shadow people clone you and they keep this clone

226
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,680
 So when and I'm gonna keep using this term over and over again. It's thought-bought 100s term. It's a catch-all term

227
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:03,080
 I'm not saying that everyone who suffers from this does this but just because I'm gonna be quoting a lot because he says it's schizophrenic

228
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:10,880
 He's constantly talking about people who are schizophrenic hear voices and I know not everyone who hears voices schizophrenic and vice versa

229
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,000
 But he says when a schizophrenic hears a voice in their head

230
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,160
 That's somebody else's clone

231
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:30,560
 So think about that for a second extrapolate that for a second was really creepy that means that somebody who is hearing a voice in their head

232
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,200
 Could be your voice

233
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,400
 Could be you

234
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,720
 Isn't that's creepy

235
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,840
 Some dude who's dealing with some sort of mental issue

236
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,440
 And he hears a voice telling him to do horrible things that could be your voice

237
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,440
 Now I'm not saying this is true. I'm not saying it's true

238
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,200
 But that's a creepy theory

239
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,780
 That's one reason the other reason is that they

240
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,560
 feed off of this clone

241
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,440
 Emotionally and this clone of you is called the ego

242
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:15,720
 And so this is how you worship the shadow people you have to go in front of a mirror and you remember good memories about yourself

243
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,520
 You think good thoughts about yourself you build up your ego

244
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,360
 And you look in the mirror and you talk yourself up you make this cloned version of you a

245
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,080
 shining star a

246
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:37,960
 Dazzling light in a world of darkness and it has a two-fold effect one the shadow people get more energy to eat from this clone to

247
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,760
 absorb from this clone and

248
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,480
 You start to become more like your ego

249
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:50,440
 You start to become the superior clone the superior version and the shadow people reward you with this

250
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,600
 Because you're giving them more energy. They will help you in your reality

251
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,840
 Bending quest

252
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,400
 Another interesting thing that thought bot points out is that almost every religion

253
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,280
 reveres the prophet

254
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:11,200
 But we are all prophets we all predict things every single day in our dreams

255
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:19,240
 Second rule of the school of shadows well first one is it helps to smoke meth right it helps to smoke meth

256
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,400
 So you can see the shadow people

257
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,640
 - every day look in the mirror do this multiple times a day

258
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,040
 Give yourself a big ego like literally talk about how great you are remember great things that you did

259
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,160
 Imagine yourself being great. That's giving the shadow people more energy to feed off of

260
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,080
 Three keep a dream journal

261
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,960
 Because the more you write down the more dreams you remember and the more you write down you can start to make

262
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,280
 connections between your dreams and

263
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,600
 Reality you're actually seeing the future

264
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,440
 Thought bot goes on to proclaim that all schizophrenics could be a prophet

265
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:05,160
 The voices that they're hearing since they're us since their actual voices their egos that are spread out across the planet

266
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:13,120
 They could be telling them your dreams that you had and it's their job to make sense of them

267
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,440
 Just like any prophet it is their job to make sense of the vision

268
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
 one of the quotes in

269
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,400
 This is quote we believe in the voices

270
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,720
 This is

271
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:35,680
 Deeply unsettling stuff honestly you notice I'm cracking a bunch of jokes. I find this very very unsettling for a couple reasons

272
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,040
 but

273
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,440
 We'll get into this

274
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,400
 I want to get into a little bit more, but yeah, I find this deep deep stuff deeply unsettling

275
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,600
 I think you can tell my tone has changed a bit. I definitely can tell as well

276
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:55,920
 But let's let's talk about this real quick a thought bot 100 himself is currently creating a new heaven for us a new

277
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,360
 Afterlife I guess I'm using the word heaven. He uses the word afterlife

278
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,240
 He also proclaims that he slammed meth for two years slamming is where you're injecting it so that'll be interesting

279
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,000
 It's always nice to know that the person in charge of our afterlife is a hardcore meth addict

280
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,320
 This is highly dangerous stuff that he's messing with

281
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:22,440
 It's highly dangerous and he's uncontested in this space

282
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,000
 This is the equivalent of

283
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,160
 One nation having a nuclear bomb. No, it's not even that this is the equivalent of

284
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,080
 One drug addict having a nuclear bomb. I

285
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,480
 Have never come across

286
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,920
 Somebody trying somebody organizing a religion around worshiping shadow people

287
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,320
 shadow people are

288
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,200
 The X factor in this whole paranormal game

289
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,720
 Like we can say maybe they're aliens. Maybe they're interdimensional. Maybe they're demons. Maybe they're

290
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,120
 Ambivalent towards the whole thing. We don't know

291
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,240
 They're the only X factor in the paranormal game

292
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,480
 We know what the alien factions want. We know what the angels want. We know what the demons want

293
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,920
 We know what the ghosts want. We know what the cryptids want

294
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,800
 But we don't know what the shadow people want

295
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:22,200
 They're like the mercenaries, you know what I mean like we don't know what their intent is

296
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,560
 So that means that whoever figures it out first has an edge

297
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,040
 And while everyone else is just kind of dismissing them or not not dismissing them

298
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,280
 But as everyone else is just saying maybe they're this maybe they're that we have a meth addict a a

299
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:43,040
 Self-proclaimed meth addict trying to disparage this guy. He says it himself

300
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,600
 Worshiping these things and building a cult around worshiping these things

301
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,760
 185 members now let's say 30% of them are in it for the lulz

302
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,640
 They just thought it was a funny thing to add on to their subreddit. That's still over a hundred people

303
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,960
 Who may be doing this and nobody else is

304
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,520
 No one else is experimenting with this they're

305
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:18,080
 Afterthoughts they're not part of the lore the mainstream. This is extrude. I am not joking

306
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,120
 I think this is one of the most dangerous cults we've covered on this show and we've covered cults like the Leopard Society

307
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,840
 That actually murders people

308
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,240
 still

309
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,840
 Deeply unsettling story deeply disturbing story when I talk about insanity week

310
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,760
 This is the type of thing I'm talking about like the stories are more lighthearted than this

311
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,080
 But this is insane and this is insanity that can actually affect us all building a new afterlife

312
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,120
 From a guy who's been slamming meth for two years and you're like Jason

313
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,680
 You don't really think he can do that

314
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:01,280
 We don't know what the limitations are of the shadow people. We don't know we know nothing about them

315
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,400
 We can't even agree what they are

316
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,480
 You hear but you're knock on the wall you can go maybe that's a ghost maybe that's the plumbing

317
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,680
 Da-da-da-da-da you can debate that but ghost in and of themselves we we for the most part you go they

318
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,120
 Are trapped here. They didn't go under the light

319
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,280
 They have something that they didn't finish those are small variations whether whether or not you go know they have to do this

320
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,360
 Those are small variations, but we know that ghosts are human

321
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,160
 We know that they're human spirits. We know that demons are fallen angels

322
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,880
 Angels are messengers of God

323
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,400
 These are all things that the lore

324
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,120
 Says we know that Bigfoot is a cryptid that lives in these particular parts of the world

325
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,560
 You can debate whether or not these things exist all day long, but they have an alignment

326
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,160
 Shadow people don't and we've covered them so many times on this show

327
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,920
 They are a loose cannon

328
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:02,440
 They are a mercenary group and it is extremely dangerous that the people who are communicating with these things the most are the most

329
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,080
 unstable of society and

330
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,720
 If they succeed in this goal

331
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,960
 If these things do work

332
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,640
 It's bad for everybody

333
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,440
 Outside of the realm of talking like outside of paranormal stuff

334
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,000
 Does any of this stuff make sense? No, I'm not gonna be running through the streets of Casper, Wyoming

335
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,920
 Getting people to shut down the school of shadows like outside of the realm of the paranormal

336
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:36,600
 It's a group of a hundred plus people who are worshiping a what they perceive to be their God or their ruler

337
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,880
 But when we talk about in paranormal when we're talking about this type of stuff

338
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,480
 This is one of the most dangerous groups. I've ever come across

339
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:52,000
 Because if they can actually alter reality they can get enough of them together and

340
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,520
 Use group psychosis to bend the rules of the universe

341
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,320
 Would we even know that it happened?

342
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,880
 Because it's the rules of the universe

343
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:12,640
 99.9% of us just kind of wake up each day and we know what the world was like before and we expect the world to continue like it was

344
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,720
 And I'm not talking about geopolitical events. I'm talking about stuff like gravity or the fact that care bears aren't real

345
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,520
 But if there was a shift like this

346
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,480
 It wouldn't be like the Mandela effect where people go

347
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,840
 I remember there was a cornucopia on fruit of the loom you'd wake up

348
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,600
 Your doctor would be a care bear and you wouldn't even think twice about it

349
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,560
 You'd be like dr. Hugs a lot sure is good with my carpal tunnel syndrome

350
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,360
 But even that would be nothing compared to an afterlife

351
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,320
 crafted

352
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,640
 by a man who suffers from meth psychosis and

353
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,160
 afterlife the rest of eternity

354
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:00,360
 Trapped in a reality made by a man who injects toxins into his bloodstream

355
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,440
 for fun

356
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,960
 We may wake up tomorrow in a new reality a new dimension

357
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:15,320
 Ruled over by mad men who have now ascended to become insane gods a

358
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:22,180
 World inhabited by shadow people. We are simply food sources for them

359
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,280
 They feed off of our light

360
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,640
 They feed off of our hope and

361
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,000
 When those are gone they feed off of our fear our

362
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,920
 anger or

363
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
 sorrow

364
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:43,400
 This is the new reality this is the world that the school of shadows prophesied

365
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:52,440
 It is the one they crafted it is the one they made it is the one we all now exist in

366
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,480
 And it is one that we can never escape from

367
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,280
 We called them crazy

368
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,640
 We laughed at them

369
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
 But in the end

370
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,960
 They succeeded where we failed

371
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:16,320
 Their gods came and showed themselves to the world and while the rest of humanity

372
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,680
 ignored them

373
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,320
 The school of shadows worshipped them

374
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,400
 Their reward was total power our

375
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,720
 Punishment was unending pain

376
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
 I

377
