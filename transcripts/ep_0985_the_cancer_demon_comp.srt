1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
 Is there truly a conspiracy theory to make you look stupid whenever you're using the

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,960
 internet?

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,200
 Then we traveled to Arkansas to meet a middle class family living their best life.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,600
 But when a 13 year old boy is woken up in the middle of the night and sees a ghastly

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,840
 specter in his living room, he has no idea his entire life is about to change.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:39,840
 It's a day on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,440
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,400
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,600
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today so first off walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,960
 of our Thanksgiving live stream contributors.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,960
 Get on your feet and give it up for Rico and Aucopulco.

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,560
 I know it's a country.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,720
 I know Rico is in Aucopulco.

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
 Aucopulco?

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,160
 That's how you say it.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
 Rico and Aucopulco.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,480
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,200
 If you guys can't support the show financially I totally understand.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
 I really do.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,600
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 Really really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,920
 Rico I'm going to go ahead and toss you a shovel and a little conductor's cap.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,360
 Let's hop on board the Carpenter Caboose.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,200
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,360
 Chug chug chug us all the way out to a government facility.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,360
 Chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:48,280
 Rico was taking us to the secret government facility and we're wearing our government

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
 clothes.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,560
 We're in black suits, black shades, black shoes.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,480
 Walking around this military base and they're like saluting us and stuff.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,960
 They're like oh it's the men in black.

34
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,440
 I don't know you guys are going to be here.

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,320
 I love that song Will Smith.

36
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,280
 We're walking around this government facility and we walk past the secret weapon experiments

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,840
 where they're injecting people with growth hormones.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,920
 They're like they're beating up the scientists and stuff like that.

39
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,040
 That's not what we're here for.

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,880
 And then we pass the cloning facility where they're cloning a guy and there's like two

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,920
 of them and the scientists inject them both in growth hormones and they're beating up

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
 each other.

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,120
 Yeah maybe next time we'll check them out.

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,040
 The reason why we're going to this government facility is we're going to the information

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,440
 warfare room.

46
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,280
 Sounds dope right?

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
 Sounds really cool.

48
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,520
 You're like no I want to go back to the clone fights.

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,840
 We're going to this information warfare room and we walk in and we expect to see a bunch

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,720
 of like cyber warriors, people wearing computer graphic armor, hitting each other with computer

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 graphic swords.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
 No.

53
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,280
 It's a guy sitting in front of a computer and he's like tickity-tack-tack-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,720
 He's typing into his keyboard and we're like hey bro what's up?

55
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,080
 And he goes I have the most important job in this facility.

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,320
 The nuclear people, the people who have nuclear powers and other people who work on nuclear

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,800
 missiles, they swear that they're the most important but it's me who is constantly saving

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
 the day.

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,360
 And we go what are you doing man?

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 Tickity-tack-tack-tickity-tack-tack-tack.

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:31,920
 And we see he's sitting there on Reddit and he's changing people's posts.

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,880
 But not in any sort of meaningful way.

63
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:43,880
 We look and someone has written everything you need to know about the fake moon landing.

64
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:53,120
 And all the guy does is delete the letter E from the word fake.

65
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
 Everything you need to know about the fact moon landing.

66
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,880
 The man leans back in his chair and goes yep my job is done for the day.

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,840
 This is a real interesting conspiracy theory.

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,440
 I saw this pop up on Reddit and it's funny at first glance you go that's kind of goofy

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,600
 but I spend a lot of time for the show.

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,160
 I'm constantly looking for stuff because I'm trying to find stuff nobody else is talking

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
 about.

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,440
 That's kind of like the big selling point for the show.

73
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,160
 I cover stuff no one else is covering.

74
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,920
 I'm constantly reading all sorts of different accounts all spread across all these websites

75
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,600
 some on popular websites some on just personal blogs.

76
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,720
 Well I'm on Reddit the other day and there is this guy going by the name Rainbow Armadillo

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,480
 Time.

78
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,720
 Joey says you type something out you proofread it.

79
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,000
 You're proofreading it as you're typing it out like you're clearly seeing what you're

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,720
 writing down is what you want to say you submit it and when it comes through there's a spelling

81
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,520
 error even though you can verify once twice three times that you've spelled it correctly

82
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,120
 it's not spelled once you post it.

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:17,080
 And Joey says really the reasoning behind this that he's putting forth is it's to make

84
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,280
 you look dumb.

85
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,920
 There seems to be a hidden hand editing posts.

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,520
 But not in the sense like let's say you dropped some truth bombs right you are finally able

87
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,320
 to show ten reasons that the color orange is satanic.

88
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,480
 Which is an actual conspiracy theory but you finally have managed to get ten ways out.

89
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,400
 It's not like they'll make super noticeable changes they change it to only eight and people

90
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,880
 are like what were the other two.

91
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,480
 He says Joey's argument is that they'll change the spelling of words.

92
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:05,160
 They'll let the post stand they'll let the information stay but if you misspell a word

93
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,680
 especially in the headline so in Reddit you can't edit your headlines I've never understood

94
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,040
 that the technology is obviously there they won't let you edit the headlines websites

95
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,360
 like the xboard you can't edit it at all.

96
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,520
 It's just there the post is there you can't change anything about it and so if you're typing

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,560
 out something you're trying to expose the truth about something they'll just misspell

98
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,760
 a word this whether it's AI or human director or what have you it will misspell a simple

99
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,880
 word so anyone coming across information for the first time will go well this guy's an

100
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,600
 idiot this guy's an idiot he's saying that he can prove the science behind Kimtrails

101
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,320
 but he can't even spell the word plain correctly right.

102
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,840
 He forgot the P he forgot the P it's not a lane what is this it doesn't make any sense

103
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,080
 you totally discard the entire argument.

104
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,200
 And Joey says that this is an issue and it really really does work and it does because

105
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,360
 like I said I read a ton of stuff online I read more online articles and online posts

106
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,920
 than I do physical meat it's not even comparable I'm constantly reading to find stuff for the

107
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:24,120
 show and I see a ton of spelling errors and you just have to accept it I don't generally

108
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,560
 think that simple spelling errors are a sign of low intelligence in general I know that

109
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,120
 you can be typing quickly I make spelling errors I make pronunciation errors but there

110
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,040
 are a lot of people who do like there are a lot of people who don't like my show because

111
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,920
 of the pronunciation errors and I'm not even sure I'm pronouncing the word pronunciation

112
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,520
 correctly because they say well he's saying all this other stuff but if he can't pronounce

113
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,160
 aquapoco then I'm gonna discard all of it I've never been that type of person but also

114
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,920
 at the same time there might be like a subconscious thing like even if I go well no I'll still

115
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 read it even if it's misspelled even it has these grammar issues because I just come across

116
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,960
 it all the time I'm sure subconsciously it affects me and it might make me think the

117
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,200
 work is a little less well less thought out than if everything was spelled correctly and

118
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,880
 Joey saying like this is happening you can and people did reply and they say yeah I've

119
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,360
 seen that too and then people were joking around and misspelling stuff on purpose at

120
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,520
 least I think they were joking around but it's an interesting conspiracy theory and

121
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:39,160
 it actually makes a lot of sense I don't know how widespread it would be though I don't

122
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,320
 know how widespread it would be I don't know if it was like every time you talked about

123
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,120
 flat earth or something like that it would misspell words like that I don't know how

124
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,440
 widespread because I do see a lot of misspellings but I couldn't say like oh all people who believe

125
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
 in this conspiracy theory misspell things or anything like that but it's definitely possible

126
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,920
 you know we've been talking we talked a lot about AI yesterday we've talked a lot about

127
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,120
 bots in the past on the shelf but some of those episodes on the show notes it would be it would

128
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,800
 be super easy to implement and once it's there like once that reddit headlines there you

129
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,880
 can't edit it it's that misspelling is going to stay and everyone I should say everyone

130
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,720
 but a lot of people who come across that information especially for the first time they're going

131
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:29,640
 to disregard all of it because you can't spell earth you had a couple people you had a couple

132
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,800
 people mention that when they use their phones to watch videos of just normal everyday things

133
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,520
 on YouTube totally fine but when they start watching conspiracy theory content their phone

134
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,360
 dies very quickly that's an interesting comparison that's a pretty interesting thing if that

135
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,160
 was provable and they actually you could test it yourself I guess I could have tested it

136
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,760
 but that's an interesting theory and that was actually put forth by someone online going

137
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,960
 by the name morningstar360 and this morningstar dude he also said and again again an interesting

138
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,600
 comparison I can be on Amazon I can be on Walmart shopping forever right it's not an

139
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:15,440
 issue but once I start posting stuff about posting stuff that counteracts what the mainstream

140
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,440
 media wants you to know my phone gets hot and my battery dies pretty quickly these actually

141
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,840
 would be easy things to implement it would not shock me in the least if any of this stuff

142
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,080
 was true you could you could test you could test the cell phone thing by watching some

143
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,560
 rumble videos versus watching just some regular YouTube videos and you could also argue I

144
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,640
 would also argue with that you could say websites like rumble or band.video or whatever Alex

145
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,000
 Jones website they may not be as optimized as YouTube so you could say well that it is

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,520
 actually consuming more energy to consuming more battery power to keep those videos going

147
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,880
 that's definitely possible that's definitely possible rumble is definitely not as optimized

148
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,720
 as YouTube but it would be interesting to test that theory the the on the fly editing

149
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,920
 thing would be harder to test because it doesn't happen every single time but it wouldn't have

150
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,640
 to it could happen just enough to discredit the person writing the post because people

151
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,960
 openly mock you no matter what your point of view I get it right and it doesn't bug me

152
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,440
 I get it where people go I really like your video but you mispronounce this word so the

153
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,480
 whole thing is just throwing out the whole thing is just there's my chant chantix video

154
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,040
 about the smoking cessation drug that may cause you to kill yourself was a really good

155
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,880
 episode but I called it chantrix the whole time and mispronounce the whole time that's

156
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,320
 a fair that's a totally fair argument you mispronounce you mispronounce the main thing

157
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:52,760
 in it so every it was hard to even listen to because that was such an obvious error and

158
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,120
 so I could see people running into that online and if that was me making a mistake I didn't

159
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,080
 I didn't check how to pronounce the word I thought maybe it was maybe it was a Mandela

160
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,280
 effect I don't know but super interesting you could easily program it in that if certain

161
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,440
 posts are put up 10% of them will have a misspelling in them and it'll just disregard the argument

162
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,120
 it will disregard the theory and if it was your very first time coming across that theory

163
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,440
 you'd be like I don't even know how to spell I'm just going to disregard all of it in the

164
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,880
 videos I don't know how true that is but that would be easy to program in as well you just

165
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,200
 put it in an update on the phone and make it hard to go you know it's so funny a lot

166
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:39,640
 of people we've talked about my explosive growth on YouTube due to my shorts my YouTube

167
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,360
 shorts I'm going to start doing the YouTube shorts again I never really talked about

168
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,520
 this on the back end I was having pretty explosive growth on tiktok where I was getting like

169
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:57,160
 10,000 views 100,000 views on videos on these one minute long true crime videos the YouTube

170
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:03,000
 one lasted longer like I was getting that that spike was there longer tiktok it was

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,800
 growing and growing and growing and growing and then I did a video a one minute long video

172
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,720
 about a guy we talked about it on the show a guy trying to kill another guy so he could

173
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:22,240
 join the Illuminati and it was like someone just turned off a spigot on tiktok like I

174
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,920
 it was day after day of growth on tiktok and it was still a true crime story but it mentioned

175
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,080
 the word Illuminati once or twice and then it dropped it went I was going from 10,000

176
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:43,840
 to 20,000 to 100,000 views and then it was 300 not 300,000 300 views 400 views 300 views

177
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,880
 on my videos it was like someone just put the spigot over there very interesting it's their

178
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,800
 platform right they're going to do what they're going to do I still am going to be producing

179
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,800
 tiktoks and YouTube shorts because for me it's just more content that I get to do that

180
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,880
 I love and it's free advertising for the show but yeah it was just interesting like that

181
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,280
 was it that totally shut that spigot off and I don't think there was a human there who

182
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,760
 did it I think the AI had if you talk about these topics we're going to shut you down

183
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,080
 interesting interesting the way it's all set up Rico and Aucalpulco let's go ahead and

184
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,800
 talk to the keys the world famous carboner copter we are leaving behind this government

185
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:38,880
 facility take us all the way out to Arkansas this is a story of a family young family living

186
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:48,400
 out in Arkansas they live out by the Ozark Mountains they're not actual they're not actually

187
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,000
 like people from the wrong turn movies they're normal they're normal people who live near

188
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,120
 the Ozark Mountains I'm sure there are normal people that live in the Ozark Mountains but

189
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,920
 they're they're near enough to them that they can often go fishing and hunting and hiking but then

190
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,640
 they come back to normal modern society when they don't have to worry about being caught by wrong

191
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:19,760
 turn in bread mutants it's a good family it's a family of four you got a mother and a father

192
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,800
 older son and a younger daughter this story was posted online we don't know what this guy's real

193
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,560
 name is we're going to go ahead and call him Sam and Sam's just enjoying life it's the year 2007

194
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,080
 everything seems to be going great and Sam is one of those kids who never really believed in the

195
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,680
 paranormal nothing believe it he would hear stories about it obviously he's 13 years old in 2007

196
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,200
 so he's heard ghost stories and seen spooky movies and stuff like that and he's heard of people and

197
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,120
 he's met people who 100% believe the paranormal is real he always figured they were either

198
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:02,480
 making up the story making it up is a scary story or they were mentally ill they thought that he

199
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,080
 thought that these people actually were sick mentally sick and I might need some medical attention

200
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,240
 and it's interesting one thing I like to do when I get the opportunity when I

201
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,280
 find these types of stories online is I try to look at their past posting history this was posted

202
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,040
 by someone going by the name opaque obscurity everything else that I could find that this

203
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:31,120
 person posted was video game related counter strike global offensive modern warfare fallout type

204
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,880
 stuff so that tends to make these types of stories more believable this totally could be made up

205
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,840
 but the other day I found someone who had two encounters with the black eyed children and I

206
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,160
 go okay I think I think you're making it up I think you're making it up the last two posts were

207
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,560
 two separate stories about black eyed children and one of them gave you a special amulet and I was

208
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,160
 like okay yeah totally made up but generally when someone tells it once in a lifetime paranormal

209
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,720
 story and the rest of the time they're talking about pretty mundane things it does make you think

210
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:11,280
 well no maybe this is legit Sam is a member of this very normal family living in the shadows of

211
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,240
 the Ozark mountains well one night Sam's in his bedroom and I don't recommend this I think this

212
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,200
 is one of the creepiest things you can do he sleeps with his bedroom door open apparently

213
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,560
 I'd never do that never do that you have a baby in the other room you're like ah

214
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,480
 I should be keeping an ear out for this baby but Jason told me to sleep with the door closed I just

215
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,960
 think I honestly think there's something bad about it so like I do think it's not spiritually safe

216
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,840
 I'll say that but anyways I've no I've nothing to back that up I also find it extremely terrifying

217
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,080
 you'd have as many boundaries between yourself and the unknown as possible he sleeps with his

218
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,600
 bedroom door open and his bedroom looks out into the living room of the house well this particular

219
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,080
 night he's in his bed he's fast asleep and he begins to have this dream that he's being watched

220
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:13,040
 there's an unseen presence around him staring at him and in the dream he feels himself

221
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:20,800
 overcome with panic it just completely washes over him and he's trapped and he can't figure out

222
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:28,480
 where this thing is at but he can feel its oppressive gaze upon him and in the dream he begins

223
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,680
 screaming out for his mother he's crying out for his mother to come and save him and while he's

224
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,760
 doing that he begins to hear this laughter this laughter again coming from nowhere something

225
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:51,360
 is relishing in his torment his terror his pain well sam wakes up sam wakes up and he's laying in bed

226
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,640
 and the first thing he sees when he wakes up is the living room his bedroom door is wide open

227
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,400
 so when he wakes up the first thing he's looking at is out into the living room

228
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,000
 and in the darkness of the living room he sees a shape laying on the couch

229
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,440
 now there are some specifics here that he doesn't really lay out i don't know if the couch is facing

230
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,760
 him or facing away or facing sideways we don't as far as like building a picture i don't know

231
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,960
 which way it was laid out but i guess that's a minor detail because on the couch is a demon

232
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,920
 whether whatever direction the couch was facing sam can look on the couch and he sees a demon and

233
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:47,840
 the way he describes it is as a shadow man-esque figure so it had the body of a human shadow

234
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:56,640
 but there also seemed to be a weird flowing movement to the the shadowy form almost if it was

235
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:04,240
 also enveloped in some sort of dark energy that was kind of undulating and where the face would be

236
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:16,800
 on this shadowy figure the face was skeletal sam's sitting in his bed and he's looking at the living

237
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:25,200
 room and he sees this shadowy figure laying on the couch with a skeletal face its eyes were bulging

238
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:33,520
 out of the bony sockets surprisingly crystal blue eyes shockingly blue staring through the darkness

239
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,560
 staring at sam and somehow impossibly i mean obviously we're talking about a demon here

240
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,880
 but somehow the skeleton's mouth was smiling at sam

241
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,000
 now skeleton itself could not smile that's all facial muscles right it's a demon it's some sort

242
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,800
 of demonic figure it's able to do the impossible i mean it is this shadowy figure moving around

243
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:10,880
 on the couch i'm like what skeletons can't smile you had this rictus grin bloodshot eyes with piercing

244
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:26,640
 blue irises a moment passes and then another and another and suddenly the skeletal figure darts down

245
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:36,560
 darts out of view behind the couch and that's when sam finally snaps out of it right this obviously

246
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:43,600
 was a huge shock for him he sees this figure move out of view sam jumps out of bed begins screaming

247
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,400
 bust through his parents bedroom door completely freaking out tells his mom and dad what he saw

248
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,120
 what's interesting is he says my dad

249
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,920
 being a devout christian took it seriously

250
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,400
 because i didn't believe in the paranormal right i was never one to ever really talk about the

251
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,440
 stuff i thought it was fake so when i'm coming into the bedroom saying i saw something in the

252
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,960
 living room saw some sort of entity in the living room father takes it seriously him and the mother

253
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,200
 go and they wake up their daughter wake up their younger daughter and they all go into the living

254
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:33,520
 room and the father opens the bible up and begins reading a verse sam goes i don't know what the

255
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,080
 verse was but it had something to do with demons and my father was reading this and then

256
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:47,120
 my father shouts out in the name of jesus christ i command you to leave my family alone if you want

257
00:22:47,120 --> 00:23:00,720
 one of us take me leave my family alone sam said that the family stayed up together that night and

258
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,120
 we're just kind of talking about things and then his dawn grew closer they went to bed whether it

259
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,080
 was a dream a nightmare that sam had had or whether it was some sort of real entity who knew sam

260
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,240
 thought i mean in the end he didn't really believe in any of this stuff fast forward a couple months

261
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,480
 and his father gets sick

262
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,280
 he gets sick and he's not getting any better

263
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:38,480
 so he goes to the doctor and the doctor diagnoses him he has cancer

264
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,520
 now sam doesn't actually name the type of cancer that he has but i think i was able to find it i

265
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:55,680
 think i was able to figure it out because what it seems to be that his father had osteosarcoma

266
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:02,320
 and the reason why i think that's what it is is because sam said my father got a type of cancer

267
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:14,160
 that is extremely rare and it's something that is almost 100 seen in adolescence osteosarcoma

268
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,800
 is that it's basically a cancer that strikes kids and teenagers

269
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:26,160
 and it happens when you're going through a growth spurt as your bones are rapidly growing during

270
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:34,800
 adolescence there is a very very very rare chance that this cancer can happen but for a grown adult

271
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:43,440
 a father of two kids to get a form of cancer that tends to only happen when bone growth is going on

272
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,320
 it's odd to say the least

273
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,640
 sam's father says okay let's do the treatments let's do whatever it takes i want to be here with

274
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,280
 my family he starts chemotherapy he changes his eating habits he begins working out he is trying

275
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:10,160
 to live the healthiest life he can to counteract the negative health effects of not just the

276
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,080
 chemotherapy but the cancer itself he's making these huge changes to his life he wants to stay with

277
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:23,680
 his family but sam starts to kind of put things together here and obviously you can chalk this up

278
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,960
 to depression and and really trying to figure out things and trying to make sense of the chaos of the

279
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,520
 the universe but he's like i had a vision of the skeletal creature in the living room

280
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,480
 and before that i had the nightmare that i was being watched by something i couldn't see

281
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,760
 and i see the skeletal creature in the darkness smiling at me

282
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,320
 and then my father says if you want one of us take me leave my family alone and then my father

283
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:02,640
 comes down with a form of cancer that affects people in my age group and sam kind of is kind of

284
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,760
 seeing this parallel he doesn't really want to say it out loud he doesn't really want to give it any

285
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:16,720
 power but he does acknowledge in his mind that maybe there is a connection between those it was

286
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,680
 there for him but his father said if you want one of us take me

287
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:34,720
 now the doctors they estimated that sam's dad had a year to live despite their best efforts and

288
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,400
 despite his best efforts as well remember he's eating healthy he's working out and all this stuff

289
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:49,280
 they say you probably have a year left but it's year three at this point it's year three and he's

290
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,600
 been fighting at the father's been fighting at this whole time and the family is staying together

291
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:03,600
 they're with him on this journey they want him to pull through but year three is the turning

292
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:13,360
 point for this at this point the father has had his leg amputated but at this stage the cancer

293
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,600
 has spread and he doesn't want to be a bother right he doesn't want to be a bother but he

294
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:27,680
 does want to be around his family as he spends his last months weeks days on planet earth

295
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:35,120
 but he doesn't want to bother anybody he decides to not sleep in the bed with his wife he thinks

296
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,880
 that he's just too distracting he needs needs his own place so he can rest and he can make sure

297
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:52,400
 that his wife has a good night's rest as well so he begins spending a bulk of his time on the couch

298
00:27:53,920 --> 00:28:00,080
 in the living room that's where he sleeps that's where he hangs out during the day

299
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:13,360
 and sam sam and his sister and the mom they do what they can for dad but at this stage it's obvious

300
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,400
 that he is in a steep decline and sam he can't say when he first realized it

301
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,560
 he can't say the moment that he knew but at a certain point it began happening

302
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:39,040
 every time he looked at his father as his father had laid on the couch and had lost so much weight

303
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:46,080
 as his dad who he'd always looked up to as being the strongest man he'd ever known

304
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:55,040
 as he became weaker as his body features became more skeletal when he would look over and glance

305
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:01,760
 at his father laying on the couch and his father would look back at his son and weakly smile

306
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:11,040
 sam realized that he never really noticed how how shockingly blue his father's eyes

307
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 were until he saw them nearly bulging out of his near skeletal sockets

308
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,440
 it's an interesting story there's a couple different ways you could look at it the father did end up

309
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,720
 passing away shortly you know he lived for the three years after the diagnosis he passed away

310
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,040
 shortly after sam and made this realization that his father now living on the couch for all

311
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,080
 intensive purposes looked very similar to the demon he had seen in the living room that night

312
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,240
 now unfortunately wasn't the end of the story when the father passed away the

313
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,720
 family the mother fell into a deep depression the family fell into crisis bills weren't getting

314
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,760
 paid and they lost the house and sam said it took me a couple of years i'm an adult now i mean

315
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,320
 obviously the story took place back in 2007 so what would that be 15 years ago right he's 28 he's

316
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,240
 around 28 29 he goes i took me a couple years to kind of get myself back on track so i mean the

317
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,720
 family did continue to go through crisis from this it's such an interesting story if it's true

318
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,320
 right sam insisted that this story was 100 true it could be fake could totally be made up

319
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:33,280
 but it's an interesting story and you would have we talked about this a little bit last week and i

320
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,600
 kind of mentioned i kind of did a teaser for this episode where we look at the idea of illnesses

321
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:47,840
 caused by spirits that's what people used to believe for hundreds if not thousands of years right

322
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,640
 and the medicine men weren't necessarily saying here take this it'll cure your gout it was take

323
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,880
 this it'll keep the angry spirits away from your kneecap like even the medicine even the herbs

324
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,320
 that were used were done in a spiritual sense for thousands of years i would argue that medicine is

325
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,560
 far i i think i think china may have had a different view of their form of medicine but i'm talking

326
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,520
 mostly like in the western world at least that's what it seems to be it wouldn't have been until we

327
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:26,080
 got into maybe the enlightenment right 17 1800s and that's when we started seeing medicine as a

328
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:34,400
 thing i take an aspirin to reduce inflammation that helps the inflammation in my back so that's

329
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,240
 like a scientific thing and i'm not arguing that oh well they believe that for thousands of years

330
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,280
 therefore that's true but like i said on friday's episode what if some of it is again i'm not saying

331
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:53,680
 that your back hurts because of a ghost but what if and you know that's funny that i say that because

332
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:00,240
 i did a whole episode about that about solar plexus clown gliders where i did encounter a

333
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,760
 you might just just listen to that episode but i encountered something and then i had like this

334
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,920
 unbearably bad back pain from such a minor injury it shouldn't even registered i'm sitting in an

335
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:21,040
 uncomfortable chair in a courtroom for like an hour or two and i do think that there is a combination

336
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,240
 i do i do i don't think that everyone who suffers from a pain or a sickness it's related to the spirit

337
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,240
 world but i think some of it and i think even if the sum of it is one or two percent that's a huge

338
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,040
 amount if you took one or two percent of people who suffer from back pain was caused by some sort of

339
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,040
 spiritual force and i'm not saying don't take medicine for it because the medicine probably

340
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:50,080
 will work but also look at the whole picture i think that's why it's called holistic medicine

341
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,920
 isn't it because you're looking at the whole picture i could be wrong i don't think everyone

342
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:59,280
 who's a gambling addict or a porn addict has a demon attached to him but i think some do

343
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:06,960
 right one or two percent people you're an alcoholic you have these vices you're trying

344
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,920
 to get rid of i don't think everyone who's an alcoholic it's somehow attached to the world of

345
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:19,920
 the demonic but some of them do right and i think the problem is i think 99% of the time

346
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,720
 you could handle it just in one way but there is a portion of the population i would believe that

347
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,000
 they do also have to look at the spiritual answer i think the problem is before they only looked at

348
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,440
 the spiritual answer and they're like oh you have a toothache that means a leprechaun's living in your

349
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,880
 mouth here eat these cloves it'll go away and it wouldn't because there wasn't there wasn't a

350
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:48,160
 leprechaun in your mouth and the cloves are ineffective but i think to say it's only medicinal

351
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,400
 and you're not looking at that so i i think the story is interesting in that fashion

352
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:00,400
 where you had what was in this house was coming for sam and the father took the brunt of it really

353
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:07,120
 took the whole thing right and got this rare form of cancer there's also the other option that i was

354
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:19,120
 thinking that it's not necessarily a demon he saw but the future right i mean the connection to the

355
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:26,960
 dream having the bad nightmare may have been completely unrelated that he was really glimpsing

356
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,760
 the future and what he saw that chaotic energy surrounding that couch was just

357
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,600
 the turmoil of all of the emotions that he was eventually going to be facing and it became

358
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,960
 he saw the future so there was no way to avoid it his father was going to become that skeletal

359
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,080
 figure laying on the couch not as some sort of demonic thing but he was looking basically

360
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:59,520
 three years forward and seeing that thing and in this case i think it would make more sense that

361
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,560
 he was seeing the future i honestly think when i say stuff like i think demons are connected to

362
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,880
 illness i think that i i don't have youtube i don't have youtube comments anymore unfortunately

363
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,360
 so we don't get that tit for tat we don't get to talk about the episodes after they're done and i do

364
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:21,920
 miss that but youtube is just such a beast when it comes to the censorship stuff i i think that

365
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:31,520
 people are more reticent is that the word people are more cautious or people would call me out more

366
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:38,160
 when i say things like i think some illnesses are caused by spirits i think there's a lot of people

367
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,800
 who would disagree with that theory just on its head and that's totally fine obviously you can

368
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,800
 disagree with me but where are you gonna do it where are you gonna do it you can't do it on youtube

369
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,800
 anymore um i think people i think i'd get pushback from that i honestly think people would be more

370
00:35:52,800 --> 00:36:01,280
 willing to accept that he was looking into the future or that this if you believe the story

371
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,880
 that this particular story may have had a demon causing the cancer but it's super rare it would

372
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,040
 never happen ever ever again but i think by making the statement that i think some illnesses

373
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,360
 or vices right are caused by demonic influences that i think i would get pushback on that and

374
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:26,720
 fair enough right it does sound insane it's it sounds backwards is what it does when i say that

375
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,440
 i think the fair argument goes no that's what we used to think we're better than that now but

376
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,160
 maybe i'm wrong maybe there are a lot of people out there who could say no i do think there are

377
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,440
 certain illnesses especially illnesses that just seem to devastate not just the person who has it

378
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,360
 but the whole family around them eating disorders is one of those things right eating disorders

379
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:59,120
 gambling addictions cancer where it's such a slow burn for the most part it can really really

380
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:06,960
 devastate everyone around them that there's something particularly dangerous about that as

381
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:14,560
 opposed to your appendix explodes it's so sudden it's so painful hopefully you make it you probably

382
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:21,200
 will you get to the hospital or diverticulitis right where you get a little piece of food stuck

383
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,760
 in a fold of an intestine and it festers and it's super painful and stuff like that i've had friends

384
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:36,960
 who have gone through that that doesn't seem to have the same oomph as your loved ones addicted to

385
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:44,080
 pornography you know what i mean if you've had diverticulitis i'm sure you're like jason it's

386
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,280
 a hundred times worse i wouldn't i wouldn't mind if my entire family was addicted to porn as long

387
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,360
 as i don't have to go through that again pornography addiction and gambling addiction they just are

388
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 like such family devastators they were just reading the story the other day about a former

389
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:07,920
 police officer who got caught he his house got raided because he was watching child porn

390
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,600
 and his he was like 70 years old and his wife goes i thought she i thought he was just playing

391
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,600
 solitaire he was that was her actual quote he was on the computer all day long and she thought he

392
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,800
 was just playing solitaire all the time like talk about a nuclear bomb going off in that family

393
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:32,240
 because now the wife the screw him but now the wife is like what do what do i do like do i defend

394
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:40,400
 him do i just take his pension and run like what happens now like imagine living your entire life

395
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,600
 you're a 70 year old woman and the fbi kicks down your door what no no he's just playing solitaire

396
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,320
 the next few years of her life are going to be like court dates and stuff like that she didn't

397
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,440
 sign up for any of that i don't know i don't know again i think people could push back on that

398
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,480
 but in this particular case i think it's one of the two things and it's it's one of the two things

399
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:14,560
 it's either time travel or a demon caused cancer they're both fantastical right they're both pretty

400
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:22,880
 fantastical but in the end it's just a tragic story because it could have just been a coincidence

401
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,720
 it could have been a waking nightmare that sam had there could have been nothing paranormal

402
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:38,880
 about it whatsoever and it could have been a giant coincidence but sam a man who never believed that

403
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:50,720
 the paranormal was even possible now does he now 100 believes that demons are real it's just a tragic

404
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,680
 story really any way you look at it because what we're looking at here is a son who lost his father

405
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,480
 right a son who lost his father in such a horrific way that it changed the way he looks at the world

406
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:12,320
 sam's father sacrificed himself to save his son and sam had to watch sam had to watch firsthand

407
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:19,040
 the effects of this demonic influence like at the end of the day sam goes i didn't believe in the

408
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,200
 paranormal now i believe demons are real and i watched my father give up his own life to save me

409
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:34,880
 and i watched my father day by day by day look more and more and more like the demon that came to

410
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:44,560
 claim my life so now i know that demons are real i saw the effects of one on the strongest man i

411
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,680
 ever knew i saw what it could do to a human being it broke him down so completely by the end of his

412
00:40:51,680 --> 00:41:00,560
 life my father looked like that demon and no matter how much i hope no matter how much i pray

413
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:09,760
 the last time i saw my dad he looked like that skeletal figure smiling at me from the couch

414
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:18,240
 it even took that from me it didn't just take my father's life it took the memories of the strong

415
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:29,920
 man i knew growing up and turned him into this thing not only took his life but it took the memories

416
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,040
 too i try my best to remember my father as the man who would lead us on hikes

417
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:45,760
 and taught me how to cast a fishing rod and showed me how to hunt through the forests

418
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,640
 in the Ozark mountains i try my best to remember that version of my father

419
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,360
 but in the end the only way i can remember him

420
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:07,920
 is as the skeletal figure smiling at me from the couch
