1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
 was a conspiracy theorist killed

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,760
 before he could reveal his secrets

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,060
 and the fascinating story of the medical, edible mummy.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,100
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,200
 Hey everyone, thanks for coming back to Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,420
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,260
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,740
 I hope you're having a great day.

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,800
 Little sore, back's a little sore.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,760
 I don't want you to always think

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,840
 things are going super perfect for me.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,440
 I've got a little heating pad on me.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,840
 I know I always sound kind of upbeat

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,960
 unless I'm talking about a story

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,160
 that really kind of irritates me,

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,840
 but you know, everything's not always perfect.

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,740
 Things are generally very good though.

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,520
 And I hope everything's going good for you guys as well.

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,960
 Now we have a lot to cover today.

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,000
 We did something unusual where we actually had a part two.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,600
 This is a part two.

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,360
 The first, just a brief rundown,

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,160
 so you don't have to go and listen to yesterday's episode.

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,200
 And again, I don't think everyone listens to every episode.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,840
 Just listen to the episodes that are interesting to you

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,960
 or the most current episode.

28
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,800
 That's fine with me.

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,000
 If you want to go back and binge, totally awesome.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,880
 But don't ever feel like you have an obligation

31
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,040
 to listen to all 55 episodes that we're at.

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,680
 So a quick recap.

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,080
 Yesterday I talked about the Super Soldier Program

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,180
 and John Storm in particular.

35
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,680
 So the Super Soldier Program is a program run,

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,200
 okay, it's not true,

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
 but anyways, I was talking like it was factual.

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,400
 Super Soldier Program was allegedly a program run

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,080
 by the US government where they kidnap children.

40
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,680
 They do all sorts of testing on them

41
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,600
 and break their bones to make their bones stronger

42
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,280
 and make them into the Super Soldiers.

43
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,240
 Then they release them back into the world

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,920
 with little to no memory of all of the training.

45
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,520
 And then through hypnosis or psychic techniques,

46
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,600
 all of your memories are unlocked

47
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,600
 where you are actually a soldier fighting for the government.

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,640
 Sometimes they fight against aliens

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,080
 and sometimes they fight against humans.

50
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,520
 John Storm at least, and he was who we profiled yesterday,

51
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,200
 his whole Super Soldier story

52
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,320
 and just the insanity that is involved in it.

53
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,560
 Just the delusion.

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,880
 He's kept it pretty basic

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,840
 where he says he was created by the US government

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,160
 and he fought in Vietnam.

57
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,280
 And he realized it was like just an unnecessary war.

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,000
 So he broke the programming

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 and now he's on our side as homo sapiens, as normals.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,800
 He's going to save us.

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,920
 And he was the perfect fighting specimen,

62
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,440
 but now he looks like he's 80 years old.

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,000
 He has back problems and narcolepsy

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
 and needs insulin shots.

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
 And his narcolepsy is so bad,

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,920
 he sleeps through his insulin shots.

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,200
 That's the story of John Storm in a nutshell.

68
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,080
 Insanity, insanity.

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,760
 Oh, and he also knows Peter Parker, the Spider-Man.

70
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,360
 He completely is like, "Oh yeah, I know Peter Parker.

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,160
 "He's a black guy and he has the powers of Spider-Man."

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,240
 Okay, anyway, he's just so bizarre.

73
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,400
 So if any of that interests you, that was the last episode.

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,280
 But I wanted to cover that

75
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,960
 because a big part of the super soldier community

76
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,640
 is paranoia.

77
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,920
 So these people were created by the government.

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
 And like I said, some of them believe

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,280
 that they were created by the government to fight aliens.

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,280
 One guy was talking about how he remembers

81
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,400
 psychically sniping aliens in Afghanistan.

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,760
 Other ones say that they float around in the astral realm

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,720
 and they meet aliens and they're like,

84
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,760
 "We are one of the 151 races that live on your planet."

85
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
 And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

86
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,120
 And I almost kind of have to gloss over that insanity

87
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,320
 'cause it gets even weirder.

88
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,280
 So the problem is that they believe

89
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,800
 the government created them.

90
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,560
 So they're incredibly hostile and paranoid

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
 towards the government.

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,040
 And by extension, any authority figures,

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,600
 mostly like psychologists and psychiatry, obviously,

94
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,080
 the medical profession.

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,680
 So you had John Storm yesterday I was talking

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,720
 where he was saying that his pharmacist and doctor

97
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,160
 were trying to kill him.

98
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,720
 And then when he left the pharmacist, a car hit him.

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,560
 And this was all proof that the government was after him,

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,680
 even though they pay him disability checks.

101
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,720
 Somehow the government also hates his guts

102
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,200
 and wants to stop John Storm.

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,920
 No update on Spider-Man though.

104
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,600
 No update on whether or not the government's after Spider-Man.

105
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,720
 But anyways, let's get into today's story.

106
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,280
 Okay, so let's talk about Max Spears.

107
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,720
 Now Max Spears was a conspiracy theorist

108
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,000
 who in 2016 died.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,200
 It's really the only details that we can confirm.

110
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,920
 Everything else seems to be up for grabs.

111
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,880
 He was in Poland to be at a conference

112
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,080
 to speak about him being a super soldier.

113
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,720
 And he was a big conspiracy theorist,

114
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,760
 he believed in the Fourth Reich.

115
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,960
 He believed there was a secret city underneath London in LA

116
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,480
 that controlled people's minds.

117
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,720
 He believed that the Bushes were reptiles

118
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,600
 and the reptilian overlords

119
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,120
 and all these crazy conspiracies and things like that.

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,040
 And he was a super soldier created by the US government.

121
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,800
 Or British government maybe, I don't know.

122
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,600
 Reptiles, it's reptiles all the way down.

123
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,840
 Anyways, he goes to Poland to be in this conference.

124
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,280
 He dies.

125
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,520
 Original report, he had black liquid on his lips.

126
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,640
 That report later became,

127
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,760
 he had two liters of black liquid.

128
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,920
 He was soaked in this mysterious black liquid.

129
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,960
 There are reports that he was kidnapped by a satanic cult drug

130
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,200
 to put in a coma for two days, allowed to go home,

131
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,320
 died later.

132
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,920
 There are reports that at the scene of his death,

133
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,560
 when the police and the coroner

134
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,480
 were still investigating his death,

135
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 the police and the coroner left.

136
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,960
 And a satanic cult came in, called up his mother

137
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,160
 and performed rituals over his body.

138
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,760
 If some of these details are sounding a little far-fetched,

139
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,960
 it's probably because they're completely made up.

140
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
 I don't think he was kidnapped by a cult.

141
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,320
 Let's take it apart one by one.

142
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,760
 Let's do this relatively quickly,

143
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,040
 'cause it's an irritating story for me on multiple levels.

144
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,520
 But we'll get to the key point of it.

145
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,200
 But anyway, so let's say that you're the evil Illuminati

146
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,360
 and this guy has information you want.

147
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,400
 You're able to kidnap him to a cult compound

148
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,680
 in the middle of Poland.

149
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,520
 You put him in a coma for two days, you take him home.

150
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,240
 But Jason, they wanted us to find the body

151
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,840
 'cause they would send a message to other conspiracy theorists.

152
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,080
 No, it wouldn't.

153
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,480
 Him disappearing would be far more terrifying

154
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,920
 to anyone investigating conspiracies

155
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,420
 than finding him and his buddy's couch in Poland.

156
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,240
 Far more terrifying because then your imagination would run,

157
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,840
 is he like some sex slave in Saudi Arabia?

158
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,160
 Is he in a red room somewhere?

159
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,000
 They found his body.

160
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,880
 Apparently the satanic cult kidnapped him,

161
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,600
 was successful in that, drugged him, was successful in that,

162
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,440
 took him home, dropped him off on a couch,

163
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,840
 died a couple of days later.

164
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,320
 That's according to the girlfriend.

165
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,480
 The mother says that as the police were still investigating

166
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
 his murder at the house,

167
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,640
 cult members were in the house

168
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,040
 and they were saying satanic, horrible rituals.

169
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,720
 I mean, I'm gonna read these to you

170
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,480
 and you're going to be shocked,

171
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,400
 shocked that the media could even report

172
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,600
 such satanic phrases.

173
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,920
 Check these out.

174
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,780
 Put milk by his side.

175
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,040
 Get garlic and put flowers and put vinegar.

176
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,880
 Oh my God, I can't believe I just read those out loud.

177
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,040
 This house is now haunted 100%.

178
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,560
 According to his mother, those are satanic phrases.

179
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,600
 She said it sounded like rituals going on,

180
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 some sort of satanic rituals.

181
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,200
 I don't mean to mock a mother who lost her child,

182
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,960
 but I think there's two things going on.

183
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,760
 One, she's just as delusional as her son was

184
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,040
 and she believed he was a super soldier,

185
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,880
 sent, created by the aliens

186
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,640
 and yet will destroy the aliens.

187
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,200
 Or it's all about money, book deals, pay pals, go fund me's.

188
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,700
 Because even today, even today,

189
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,000
 the story is that the British government

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,720
 took his cell phone and his laptop

191
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,420
 and when they gave it back to the lawyer

192
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,680
 and her, the mother, they were wiped.

193
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,320
 They were wiped clean.

194
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,640
 What does that mean?

195
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,760
 That's not a legal term.

196
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,040
 It's not even a technical term.

197
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,880
 Is the desktop wiped clean?

198
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,360
 Is the hard drive reformatted?

199
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,480
 You know, if I gave my, if someone took out

200
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,400
 my mom's laptop and she turned it on and it said,

201
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
 "Would you like to install Windows 10?"

202
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,480
 She's going to know immediately

203
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,840
 that the computer was actually reformatted.

204
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,280
 She's gonna be like, "There was nothing on it at all.

205
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,160
 "Nothing on it at all."

206
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,040
 If they gave it back to her and it had a fault

207
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,280
 that had the folder that said,

208
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,360
 "Dead Rabbit Radio is missing," she would never know.

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
 She would never know.

210
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,040
 If you are the secret Illuminati reptilian overlords

211
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,240
 and you take, I feel really heartless

212
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,840
 talking trash about this dead kid,

213
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,240
 but I think it's important.

214
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,640
 If we take, if they have control of that laptop

215
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,920
 and it has information on it,

216
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,760
 that will be completely detrimental

217
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,160
 to the reptilian overlord alien plan,

218
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,440
 they're going to either conveniently lose the laptop,

219
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
 conveniently destroy the laptop,

220
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,200
 and they'll just tell the mother,

221
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,080
 "Well, we accidentally lost an evidence locker,"

222
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,000
 or remove the files they need removed.

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,680
 I don't see the point of simply wiping it clean

224
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,200
 and then handing it back to somebody

225
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,720
 who's obviously going to know it's wiped clean.

226
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,000
 I think she's making these details up.

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,160
 I think that they're making these details up.

228
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,200
 And I actually have something that leans in that direction.

229
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,760
 The original report that the friend made

230
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,880
 that I found online was that Max Spears

231
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,980
 did not have two liters of liquid covering his body.

232
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,800
 He had a black liquid coming out of his mouth.

233
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,560
 The story evolved to be covered in two liters

234
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
 of black liquid.

235
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,800
 If you walked into someone's house

236
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,200
 and they had a little bit of black liquid on their mouth,

237
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,760
 you would not mistake that for two liters.

238
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,640
 And the same thing, you would not mistake two liters

239
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,400
 for a little bit of black liquid on your mouth.

240
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,560
 The stories are changing, the stories are morphine,

241
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,240
 they're becoming more and more dire.

242
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,000
 There are reports, I'll include the link,

243
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 and people say, "Well, maybe it wasn't the mother

244
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,960
 posting this, you never know online."

245
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,280
 But there are reports that the mother

246
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,080
 initially never even reported the tweet,

247
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,960
 the text message, I should say,

248
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
 where he tweeted her and says,

249
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,240
 "Mom, if something happens, you know, investigate."

250
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,040
 And the early reports, that wasn't even reported,

251
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,000
 that got reported later.

252
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,600
 So it seems like the story has become

253
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,640
 more overly dramatic as time has gone on.

254
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,240
 What is most likely in this situation?

255
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
 Now, this is where it ties back to John Storm

256
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,520
 and it ties back to the Super Soldier program.

257
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,680
 Is that he had medical problems,

258
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,520
 he had an opioid addiction that had become

259
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,360
 a heroin addiction.

260
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,120
 At the time, it is believed he was clean of heroin.

261
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,060
 However, he says that he was kidnapped and taken to a cult

262
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,720
 and he was given drugs and he was asleep for two days.

263
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,080
 And truth be told, if I had a history of cheating on my wife

264
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,400
 and my story was I got kidnapped and taken to a brothel

265
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,320
 and I banged like 50 women, but it was totally

266
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,520
 against my will and I only came twice.

267
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,840
 If someone who has problems with heroin addiction

268
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,800
 says they are kidnapped, taken to the middle of nowhere,

269
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,660
 given drugs and slept for two days,

270
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,680
 it's a little suspicious.

271
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,840
 I'm sorry, my girlfriend, I didn't call you.

272
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,960
 I was kidnapped by St. Worshipers and they drugged me.

273
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,580
 But I have no proof of that.

274
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,500
 That's just a, it's probably not what happened.

275
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,080
 He probably went to a flop house.

276
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,660
 God, I'm really shitting on this dude.

277
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,740
 I think the problem with this story is what makes me mad

278
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,340
 about the story in general.

279
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,260
 I feel really bad just talking trash about a dead kid

280
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,900
 and talking trash about his mom.

281
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,340
 I honestly do, but I think that they're using his death,

282
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,300
 his natural death.

283
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,900
 I think he had an ulcer.

284
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,420
 I think he had a peptic ulcer

285
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,520
 and he believed in all that super soldier nonsense

286
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,320
 that the doctors were out to get him

287
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,440
 and the medical establishment was out to get him

288
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,960
 and the government was out to get him

289
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,960
 and he had stomach pain and he wasn't taking care of it

290
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,040
 because they're all evil reptilians

291
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,400
 and he died of a completely preventable disease.

292
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,360
 That's what I think.

293
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,200
 I think when they say it's natural causes,

294
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,160
 that would cause the black blood to be on your lips

295
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,040
 because he's coughing up blood, not two liters.

296
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,880
 But you know what I mean?

297
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,080
 I think he, I think that's what irritates me about this.

298
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,580
 I think we had a young man

299
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,540
 who had some mental health issues obviously

300
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,820
 and it was related to either self-medication

301
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,180
 of the heroin use or just the heroin use in general.

302
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,860
 He had a mom that obviously seems to promote that.

303
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,020
 She encourages that lifestyle, that super soldier stuff.

304
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,100
 Dude, if I was walking around talking

305
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,020
 that I was a super soldier,

306
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,540
 my mom would slap the shit out of me.

307
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,180
 And especially if I died, she wouldn't say,

308
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,940
 oh no, he was really a super soldier.

309
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,460
 The mom, I think, kept that delusion going.

310
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,440
 She obviously has a similar delusion

311
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,920
 that the world is out to get these people

312
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,960
 for seeking out the truth.

313
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,600
 All of the stuff that he was talking about,

314
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,120
 Fourth Reich and secret cities

315
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,520
 underneath LA and Los Angeles

316
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,640
 were controlling your brain.

317
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,120
 Bush and their royal families, they were reptilians.

318
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,960
 This is all common knowledge in the conspiracy field.

319
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,080
 And the fact that the son,

320
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,320
 the son British newspaper is publishing this stuff

321
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,960
 should tell you it's nonsense because if it was true,

322
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,600
 the son would never publish it.

323
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,200
 Oh no, no, he was working on another story,

324
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,380
 connecting the Illuminati and powerful people

325
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,220
 and celebrities.

326
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,900
 There's a thousand websites about that.

327
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,500
 He was exposing nothing that can't be found anywhere.

328
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,500
 He dies a natural death and it is being exploited

329
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,620
 and turned into a myth for either money

330
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,420
 or to further your own delusion.

331
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,300
 I think it's a little bit of both honestly.

332
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,980
 I think people who already believe

333
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,300
 in this super soldier nonsense,

334
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,540
 they bought into it right away.

335
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,220
 You can read the forums of the day he died.

336
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,580
 And at first they're like, no, he's just in a coma, it's okay.

337
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,020
 And then John Storm's like, ah yeah,

338
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,460
 we gotta be extra paranoid now.

339
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,020
 They're taking us super soldiers out one by one.

340
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,780
 And that's why I had to do that whole John Storm episode.

341
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,700
 He ran in this crew.

342
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,340
 I think people are delusional.

343
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,840
 And the day Max Spear died,

344
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,020
 they're already exploiting it for their delusion.

345
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,020
 And I'd be shocked,

346
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,820
 shocked if the mother's not trying to get a book deal

347
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,740
 or a movie deal.

348
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,780
 I don't feel good talking trash about dead people

349
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,340
 and dead people's relatives.

350
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,540
 That might be, this might be the episode,

351
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,780
 not the one where I said

352
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,620
 that I would not record street gangs for crimes.

353
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,660
 This might be the episode where you say,

354
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,100
 damn, Jason, you're kind of scummy.

355
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,480
 But I hope it gets through where my scuminess is coming from.

356
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,920
 I'm not trying to mock the dead.

357
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,080
 I'm trying to mock the beliefs

358
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,200
 that I believe led to his demise.

359
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,720
 And they're just still ongoing.

360
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,440
 If the mother is still saying,

361
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,840
 oh no, the government wiped the laptop,

362
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,680
 which again, give me specifics.

363
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,240
 Tell me that there was no operating system on it.

364
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,680
 What does wipe the computer mean?

365
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,280
 The desktop was clean?

366
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,340
 Tell me specifically what it was.

367
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,600
 I'd be more likely to believe you, maybe,

368
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,540
 because I've seen the story shift so much.

369
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,860
 So I'm not trying to mock the grief the mother went through.

370
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,800
 And the mom may be trying to make sense of her son's death

371
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,040
 by believing in the delusion.

372
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,220
 It may be the only way for her to deal with it

373
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,620
 is to believe that her son was murdered

374
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,580
 by the reptilian Illuminati overlords.

375
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,460
 Does she believe her son was a super soldier

376
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,220
 who was kidnapped by Alene's Winoose Kid?

377
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,280
 I don't know.

378
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,120
 I don't know.

379
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,160
 I'm sure, like I said, I'm sure there's a book deal

380
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,220
 or a movie deal or something coming down the pipe.

381
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,800
 I believe it feeds into the delusion.

382
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,440
 I believe people are making money off of it.

383
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,660
 I think it's scummy.

384
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,640
 I think it's only going to lead

385
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,720
 to more disasters in the future

386
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,480
 where we have more young men and women who now have proof,

387
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,420
 proof that the Illuminati is out to get them

388
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,320
 and they're not going to seek the help that they need,

389
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,120
 either physically or mentally.

390
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,320
 Because I'll admit, when I heard this story back in 2016,

391
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,920
 it was very alarming.

392
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,620
 My first inclination was, oh man,

393
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,260
 maybe he did know something we weren't supposed to know

394
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,540
 and they killed him for it.

395
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,800
 But Illuminati reptilian aliens do not exist.

396
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,360
 So looking into that, and of course, again,

397
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,860
 if they did exist, they control everything.

398
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,460
 So these stories shouldn't exist.

399
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,120
 He dies to cover up these stories.

400
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,540
 He dies because he's exposing these stories.

401
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,220
 But in his death, these stories are exposed.

402
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,640
 It doesn't make any sense.

403
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 So yes, people do get killed for discovering stuff.

404
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,920
 Generally, they get run off the road

405
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,280
 or they get a bullet in the back of the head.

406
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,800
 They don't spit up alien goo.

407
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,920
 They don't get kidnapped

408
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,120
 and then return to their place from where they were kidnapped.

409
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,120
 And their murderers are not reptilian alien overlords.

410
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,880
 You know what, I honestly, this story is so irritating to me.

411
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,760
 This is gonna sound kind of cheap,

412
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,700
 but I'm gonna end the episode now

413
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,720
 because the other story I wanted to do

414
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,340
 was actually kind of lighthearted.

415
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,060
 But this story really pisses me off.

416
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,020
 And here's a little secret.

417
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,740
 I've recorded this episode.

418
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,140
 This single story, this is the fourth

419
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,920
 or fifth time I've recorded it.

420
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,300
 And it pisses me off every single time I do

421
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,720
 because it makes me mad

422
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,540
 and it makes me kind of, makes me scummy

423
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,020
 that I have to take this position

424
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,080
 and I'm kind of pissing all over this family.

425
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,540
 But again, I think it's dangerous.

426
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,680
 I talk about cults like sun gazing and we laugh,

427
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,260
 but I think this stuff is dangerous

428
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,100
 because it feeds into a delusion

429
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,720
 that makes people not seek mental health or physical health.

430
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,200
 If you believed your doctor, you know what?

431
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,040
 I'm done.

432
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,380
 We're gonna go ahead and end this episode.

433
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,340
 I hope you guys had a good time.

 And at the end of the day,

439
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,100
 I have no remorse about releasing this episode

440
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,240
 because again, I think it's dangerous belief.

441
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,820
 It has serious consequences.

 I'm glad you listened to it.

446

 I have great ideas.
