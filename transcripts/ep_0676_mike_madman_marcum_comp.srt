1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
 We've talked before about haunted video games or how open world games are becoming too smart

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,520
 This time we're gonna talk about it again

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,120
 And I've brought proof

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,080
 And then we finish insanity week by taking a look at the story of Mike Madman

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,360
 Markham, is it possible that a young man goofing off on his porch with a few scraps of electronics?

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,960
 Actually built a working time machine today on Dead Rabbit Radio

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
 *Movie about to be played*

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:40,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carventer. I'm having a great day

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover so first off

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,640
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command in his own personal Pope Mobile. It's all decked out has the bulletproof dome. I'm testing it

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,200
 I'm shooting at it. It's Father Dovey everyone give a round of applause to Father Dovey

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,200
 He's waving from his Pope Mobile

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,120
 Father Dovey step on out of that step on out of that protection even though I still have a gun aimed at you

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,320
 You're gonna be our captain art pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon or if you don't have a pimped out car

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,380
 Like the Pope that's fine too. Just helps spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,920
 And look at this cool fan art Friday. We got something different today for fan art Friday

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,720
 I got this from the patreon discord server

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,840
 This is from little graze destiny to clan the Dead Rabbit Society

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,000
 Isn't that dope look at that little flag that he made oh?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I want to see what you do is running in a battle with that logo and

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,600
 Oddly enough he posted this on discord. I don't know if he was planning this look how many members are currently in the clan

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,680
 Spooky 30 if you're driving you're like you're driving and you can't look at the cover art. It's 13

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,840
 There's 13 people currently in the clan. He's playing on Xbox

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,480
 So if you're into destiny - he's like - and my clan's gonna get over on if you're into destiny - and you're playing on the Xbox

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,240
 I think clans are I don't play destiny - I

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,600
 Don't get to play anything

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,080
 But if you do maybe little gray, maybe you'll be part of this clan with that dope look at that

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,920
 That's dope. Those are the battle flags apparently. I don't know if like on they're on the shoulders or something like that

29
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,480
 I don't know anything about destiny - other than that. I'm now in it. So thank you little gray

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,600
 Father doobie, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the oars to the dead rabbit robo. We're leaving behind dead rabbit command

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,120
 We are headed out to a little coastline in the middle of

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,880
 Minecraft splash

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,280
 Splash

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,920
 I don't have time to play video games anymore. I really really like them, but I just don't have time to play them

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,400
 So I'll read a lot of video game websites video game magazines

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,720
 Because I like the culture and I watch video game streamers. I watch home record do dead by daylight

37
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,200
 I watch a lot of Minecraft streamers dream bad boy. Halo George not found. I really like fruit berries. I think he's the most clever

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,200
 Minecraft player and recently he was taken on alumina who is arguably the best Minecraft player in the world

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
 Don't let your eyes glaze over yet

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,480
 I know this is like your nephew is cornered you at Thanksgiving and it's telling you about Minecraft unlike him

41
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
 I have a point this this story actually goes somewhere. I

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,520
 Was recently watching this really bizarre video clip

43
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's gonna be in the show notes and I know most of you guys can't stop you're doing like driving or working

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,880
 To watch a Minecraft stream, but it's queued up. It's in the show notes. You click on it

45
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,840
 It'll take you right to where it's going on. This is a server

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,120
 This is a private server the only people in the game are alumina and fruit berries

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,600
 Illumina is digging for treasure and he's afraid at any point because this is competitive Minecraft that fruit berries is gonna sneak up behind

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,000
 Them and kill him so he's looking around. He's trying to watch the six while he's digging for this treasure

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,920
 He turns he sees fruit berries in full enchanted iron armor again

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,600
 Do not let your eyes glaze over just yet

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:56,360
 He sees fruit berries in full enchanted iron armor jump into the water behind them and this is gonna be bad news for alumina

52
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,520
 He's not ready to take on full enchanted, but then the video cuts to fruit berries. He's underground

53
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,280
 Mining iron and the camera actually because you can change the camera angle in Minecraft

54
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,200
 We see a view of fruit berries. He has no armor at all. He's wearing his default skin

55
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,280
 Now alumina goes, uh, did you just jump in the water because they're playing like this game basically of hide-and-go-seek and

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,040
 Fruit berries is like what no not me and it's kind of coy

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,200
 But we as the audience saw someone jump into the water

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,920
 Alumina saw someone jump into the water

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,600
 This is a private server with two players on it

60
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,180
 There was a third player in full enchanted iron armor

61
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,720
 jumping into the water

62
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,000
 I've watched this video over and over and over again. I've done the slow motion

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,080
 I actually was taking screenshots of it and magnifying it this

64
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,600
 Person this character should not be here. It is not fruit berries

65
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,640
 There was a third player there

66
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,840
 There was no third player on the server

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,800
 Someone in fully enchanted iron armor

68
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,640
 jumped into the water just as

69
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,480
 alumina turned around and

70
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,960
 It's not like they go at the end of the video. Whoa, who was that was this some sort of spooky thing?

71
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,360
 They talk about it briefly because again, it's like hide-and-go-seek so fruit berries is thinking if alumina is confused. That's totally fine

72
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,700
 But it definitely was not alumina and it definitely wasn't fruit berries who or what was this thing?

73
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,360
 If it was a lark they would have kept bringing it up

74
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,680
 They would have mentioned it in another video

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,560
 The that's halfway through the video. They never bring it back up because so much of the game is to do misdirection

76
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,360
 But we see it too

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,800
 You might think it's some sort of glitch you might think it's a minor thing and maybe it is maybe it is

78
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,720
 But if you guys are if you guys are familiar with Minecraft at all

79
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,800
 I definitely recommend you checking out the video and see if you can identify it because it is not one of the two players

80
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:15,120
 It doesn't make sense and this is what creeps me out about games like Minecraft. They are vast infinite worlds

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,760
 And when you're walking over the hills, who knows who knows what's going on underneath the ground

82
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,640
 And when you're underground

83
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,000
 Who knows if another lone wanderer is traveling the world above you and you'll never meet them

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,040
 They're not supposed to be there though. You don't want to meet them

85
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,600
 So check out this video if you're familiar with Minecraft. I want you to check it out

86
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,040
 You're not familiar with Minecraft. Ask your nephew. They'll talk to you about it for three hours straight and then watch this video

87
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,260
 It is creepy simply because it shouldn't exist. It shouldn't be there in the video

88
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:55,160
 There's another thing I want to share with you this one this one actually works for our podcast your driver your car

89
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,160
 You're doing your homework like Jason. I can't watch the video right now

90
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,360
 It is queued up and it'll be ready to go when you watch it

91
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,920
 But I do play video games when I get my two week vacation from the show and last vacation

92
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,240
 I played state of decay - that's all I did. I played

93
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,960
 50 60 hours of stated decay - and two weeks that I had off

94
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,320
 I got really used to the zombies and the maps and the AI of the characters the AI of the zombies

95
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,920
 When you really dig into a game for 60 hours over a short period of time like that you really know the game

96
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,920
 But it is an open-world game

97
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,100
 Stuff can always throw you a bizarre curveball, but not like this

98
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,460
 Was on the state of decay - subreddit and it's you

99
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,200
 posted a question

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,760
 Does anyone recognize this sound and I'm gonna play it for you right now

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
 *Birds chirping*

102
00:07:45,760 --> 00:08:02,520
 That is not a sound that any of the zombie characters make in that game

103
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,560
 At all

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,720
 The scene is his character at their home base. It's nighttime

105
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,160
 And you hear that bizarre creature sound now

106
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,240
 I want to be playing that sound if I go hey that sound plays all the time. That's the sound of a barrel

107
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
 That's the sound of a screamer

108
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,920
 That's that is not a sound that is played at any point in the game state of decay one or two

109
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
 What is that

110
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,000
 Now the obvious answer is some sort of unused audio file that got triggered

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,400
 No one on the reddit knew what it was no one posted no one recognized the sound on the reddit either

112
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,600
 But it could be some unused audio file that got triggered in this one person's game

113
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,080
 When we have video games when we have these sound even though they're monster characters in state of decay

114
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
 It's a zombie open-world game

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,480
 Those zombies have recognized the sounds and the reason why they have recognized sounds and recognize silhouettes

116
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:21,840
 They don't do things that are too unpredictable. So the player knows they're in the area every time a feral shows up a certain sound is given

117
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,880
 Makes it scary, but it also gives the player an edge

118
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,440
 If the feral's may know noise if you're just walking through a department store and then something one of the most powerful zombies was on top

119
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
 Of you it wouldn't seem fair

120
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,520
 So you have these recognizable sound this is not a sound in the game

121
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,240
 This is not a sound that I experienced at any point in the 60 hours that I played no one else on the subreddit recognized it in

122
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,640
 Real life you can say this is the sound of a dog. This is the sound of a horse

123
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,840
 Ha ha ha ha and that's true. Those are the stereotypical sounds that a horse makes

124
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:02,360
 But a dog in an event like a dog on a ferris wheel is not gonna make stereotypical barking noises a

125
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,720
 Dog going down the slide is gonna sound different than a dog on a trampoline. You know what I mean in real life

126
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,240
 There's so many variables that'll change the way we make noises

127
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,840
 But in video games everything is programmed a feral coming at you in the middle of a field

128
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,720
 It makes the same sound as a feral in close combat at your home base. It is programmed that way. What is this noise?

129
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:39,920
 Was there something else in the darkness?

130
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,800
 surrounding the space

131
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
 Making that noise

132
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:53,000
 What I'm getting at is that what if this sound isn't part of the program the language? It's a new sound

133
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,720
 It's developed this new creature type in the darkness

134
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,160
 You're running this game

135
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:07,920
 Thousands to tens of thousands to twenty thousand hundreds of thousands of times all these different players starting it playing it

136
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,120
 Stopping it over and over and over again. It's almost like a fluke in evolution in

137
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,120
 This particular game at this particular time. There was a new creature type

138
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,800
 outside the fort

139
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,240
 One the programmers didn't create but it formed itself and

140
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,040
 made that noise and

141
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,920
 Then when the game was shut off this evolutionary fluke

142
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,600
 Was deleted with it as well and when you bring the game back up it is back to its normal programming

143
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:49,680
 Open-world games are so fascinating to me and I think with the computer processing power we have and the more

144
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,560
 Complicated these games get the more realistic these games get we're going to see more and more of these

145
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,320
 Paranormal events

146
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
 Inside our video games. There's also the chance

147
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,720
 There's also the chance that someone is going to come along and explain both of these very very easily to me someone goes

148
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,520
 Oh, no, no, that is this audio file. It was on this form and stuff like that

149
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,640
 That's very possible. It's interesting when we're talking about

150
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,280
 computer-based mysteries

151
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,560
 They are easier to find answers to so I don't like you guys to kind of dig into these and see if you can figure out an

152
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,080
 Answer for them, but as far as I can tell these are both stories. I've sat on for a while. I

153
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,800
 Had I found the state of decay thing weeks ago. It's pretty much right right after my vacation ended

154
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,000
 So I've been waiting to tell these stories, but yeah, and it's you thanks for letting me use the sound clip as well

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,680
 Check these out see if you guys can figure out an answer for him because I think it's just terrifying

156
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,000
 And I think we're gonna see more and more paranormal events in open-world games

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,400
 People are always talking about San Andreas GTA San Andreas having Bigfoot having these UFOs having these events and they were urban legends

158
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,020
 We may be moving past the point where they're urban legends and becoming reality

159
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,560
 Father do be put down that controller. I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Carvener copter

160
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,000
 We're gonna leave behind this Minecraft world

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,920
 I guess technically went to state of decay - after that, but we're leaving behind both of those

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 We are headed out to

163
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,800
 Standbury, Missouri

164
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:27,880
 Father do be land that Carvener copter at Standbury, Missouri. It is 1995

165
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,680
 The gin blossoms are pumping out great music third-eye blind is doot-doot doing its way around America

166
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,840
 I think is that too early for both those fans? I say link Pearl Jam was still the lead band doesn't matter

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,040
 Doesn't matter we have our flannel shirts tied around our waist our ripped jeans and our long hair

168
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,200
 We're walking through Standbury, Missouri. We're about to meet Mike Madman Markham

169
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,200
 Mike is currently in school. He's getting his degree in electrical studies electrical engineering

170
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,200
 You're like, there's no such thing as electrical studies. He's not a super villain. He's doing something with electricity

171
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
 He's also a rogue inventor

172
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,320
 So he's taking his two passions putting them together and he's building all these things at home

173
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,920
 And one of the devices he puts together is what's known as a Jacobs ladder. You've seen them most likely in movies

174
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,680
 There's two metal rods and you have a little bit of electricity

175
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,560
 Go and it goes up the rod you guys have seen this a hundred times in horror movies

176
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,920
 So he builds one of these on his porch

177
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,640
 but what he what he's using to actually make the electricity to power it he's using a

178
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,800
 laser from a CD player and

179
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,260
 He's running this little test and he's just watching the electricity

180
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,960
 And he notices something different he's obviously had experience with Jacobs ladders before

181
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,320
 He notices it's producing a bizarre haze as well

182
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,320
 He said it's like when there's a hot day and you see the sidewalk kind of shimmer from the heat waves

183
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,000
 He's looking at that the Jacobs ladder has formed this little vortex

184
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 He picks up a metal screw

185
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,440
 He throws it through the vortex

186
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,300
 And it would disappear for just a half second a blink in time

187
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,520
 But then it would reappear sitting on the ground a few feet away

188
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:21,880
 He looks at that and he goes that I must have not seen something right that breaks all the laws of physics

189
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:29,400
 He picks up another metal screw and he throws it through the vortex disappears for half a second and then reappears on the ground

190
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,920
 He thinks I need to grab my camera

191
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,840
 Go grab a camera to document this get a camcorder, but the CD player at that point catches on fire

192
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,720
 So he had to shut down the whole experiment

193
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,960
 What he thinks he's done is invent a time machine

194
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:53,620
 He thinks what's happening is he's throwing the metal screws through the vortex and the reason why they're disappearing is they're moving forward in time

195
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:00,280
 And then teleporting as well to another location. He goes. Okay. This is dope, right? I broke the laws of physics

196
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,120
 I've invented a time machine what I need to do now is make it more powerful

197
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,360
 So he starts looking for ways to increase the voltage of this thing

198
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,920
 I mean he's using a laser from a CD player. He decides he actually needs some transformers some giant electrical transformers

199
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:23,160
 There are 13 thousand dollars each though. He can't afford to get these

200
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,680
 Transformers so he actually starts scoping out a local power plant and sees

201
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,240
 You know just laying around just laying around six transformers

202
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,700
 They're each about 300 pounds and he realizes well, maybe I'll only need three of them

203
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,040
 But when he's putting his plan together when he goes to the power plant he realizes I'm just gonna steal all six of them

204
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,400
 Let's just take all six of them and let's make this machine as powerful as possible

205
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,680
 He takes these transformers back home sets them up

206
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,080
 He's getting ready to run this experiment. He basically wants to build a bigger version of this thing

207
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,200
 But he doesn't have a lot of money. He doesn't have a lot of resources

208
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,560
 He doesn't have enough money to throw parties

209
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,720
 So one night him and his buddies are over there. They're drinking beer. They're wild and out as the kids said in 1996

210
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,480
 One of his friends is jumping up and down on his couch and goes hey Mike go get me another beer

211
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,240
 Mike goes, oh, you know, okay fine. Just get off my couch, right? He goes into the kitchen

212
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,480
 He gets him a beer and then when he's coming back

213
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,200
 The couch is gone

214
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,600
 Mike's like, where's my couch at?

215
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,320
 They're like, what do you mean? He goes you were just standing on the couch. Where's my couch? Where did my couch go?

216
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,640
 The friends had no idea what he's talking about and Mike goes dude

217
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,640
 She was just jumping up and down on my couch my couch. Well, didn't you guys realize that I didn't have a couch and

218
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,120
 None of his friends know what he's talking about

219
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,840
 Mike thinks this is some sort of practical joke

220
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:53,000
 But he realizes that one the couch is nowhere in the house to the back door the place where you could really sneak the couch out

221
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,800
 Is blocked by six stolen transformers and three they never find the couch

222
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:07,080
 He ends up hooking these transformers up to this invention and while he's powering it up

223
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,760
 Of course something goes wrong, but not deadly wrong just kind of funny wrong

224
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,000
 He ends out knocking out the power to the entire neighborhood

225
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,840
 The police are already looking for someone who broke in who stole these transformers the fact that the whole neighborhood went dark

226
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,800
 It's a pretty good idea that the perpetrator is there and Standberry is not a big town to begin with so the police very quickly

227
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,680
 Zone in on Mike madman Markham. They arrest them for theft

228
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:40,600
 At this point it goes from being a local crime story to major newspapers are picking it up

229
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,760
 The New York Times are at an article about this guy a young man who stalled

230
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:51,560
 Transformers to build a time machine. There's a goofy slice of life person of interest story

231
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,120
 People loved it and it actually came to the attention of Art Bell host of coast to coast a.m.

232
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:05,640
 The granddaddy of all paranormal radio podcasts. Everyone will always be in debt. It's a good old art Bell

233
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,680
 Art Bell invites

234
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:14,480
 Mike to call into the show he wants to talk to him wants to talk to this young kid who claims that he invented a time machine

235
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,960
 And Mike tells the story that I just told you

236
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,720
 And it's funny because it's a small town Mike's arresting officer the cop who caught him that day

237
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,080
 Also called into the art Bell show and was talking to him

238
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,720
 It was a really fun story this young kid claims that he invented a time machine

239
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,480
 Knocks out the power to the city that sounds great. It's a great prologue to any fun movie

240
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,760
 And people really get behind the story of Mike people recognize something of

241
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,620
 Themselves in Mike just a guy who has a dream but doesn't have the resources

242
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,560
 To make that dream happen because he's on the art Bell show people he gives that he's like

243
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,760
 Here's my phone number guys call me. I want to hear all your ideas scientists are calling them and saying this isn't a good idea

244
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,160
 This is why I wouldn't work, but he knows what he saw but people believe in him

245
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,760
 They begin donating money to him. They begin donating equipment to him

246
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,720
 And he's actually able to start working on a larger

247
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,280
 Time machine

248
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,760
 He calls back in about a year later in 1996. He calls back into the art Bell show and

249
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,980
 Tells art listen. I'm about 30 days away from getting this machine working 100%

250
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:33,320
 It's far bigger. Thank you so much to all the listeners who made this happen. I was able to afford a machine

251
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,120
 That will allow me to walk inside of

252
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,360
 I'm gonna try the time travel thing myself and he said he actually changed it up a bit now

253
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,360
 It works on rotating magnetic fields. I'll be able to time travel myself. He goes. I'm gonna bring my phone with me, too

254
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,560
 So I'll still be able to contact you guys and our bell goes

255
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,160
 Let me know before you go in the machine because I want to be able to document the experience

256
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,280
 I think it would just be a once in a lifetime thing or if the time machine works several times in one lifetime

257
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
 Because you just keep going back and forth

258
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,680
 At this point Mike gives out his address as well. Come on down and visit

259
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,360
 Let's chat. He's very open guy

260
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,320
 He's giving out his phone number. He's giving out his address

261
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,880
 He wants to kind of make this a community driven thing

262
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,040
 But around 1997 people start to notice that Mike is

263
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,400
 Gone

264
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,760
 He's not responding to any correspondence. No one can get ahold of him

265
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,680
 No one's heard from him

266
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,040
 He's vanished off the face of the earth

267
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:44,120
 The story goes that to this day Mike madman Markham is still missing

268
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,720
 but after all of this happened a listener called into the art Bell Show and

269
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:58,720
 Told this story. He was going through old newspaper accounts and he found a mysterious death in the 1930s in California a

270
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,880
 Man was found crushed in a metal tube

271
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,760
 It was unknown who the man was or how he ended up in this metal tube squished

272
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,840
 But the officers found an odd device

273
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,800
 Laying next to the man

274
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,880
 They didn't know what it was but a modern-day person reading that article would identify what they were describing

275
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,520
 as a cell phone

276
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,920
 Very very interesting story

277
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:32,560
 About a man who was trying to invent something and I found out about this from a new website

278
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,520
 They might have been around for a while, but they recently come on my radar called Planet Today

279
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,240
 They posted this story. Thanks for posting that I read it and I go very very interesting story

280
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,800
 But I could already taste that there was something missing from the story

281
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,960
 The ending I go that's not the true ending to the story

282
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,480
 It's interesting because we have all this documentation. He was on art Bell twice. There are recordings of him on art Bell

283
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,200
 You have to be a coast-to-coast AM plus member to listen to them

284
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,600
 They've been taking a lot of their stuff off of YouTube lately, but

285
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,160
 He's not a completely made-up figure for the internet. He actually did exist

286
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,160
 We actually have documentation that he's working on this stuff. There's news articles about him working on this stuff

287
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,560
 And then you think well he went missing but that could be anything did he actually go back in time?

288
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:27,960
 I immediately dismissed the whole 1930s thing and for from a narrative standpoint if you guys are going to fake something

289
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,280
 It would have been more interesting if before

290
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,280
 We even knew about mad Mike Markham if they had said it's weird in the year

291
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:42,280
 1989 someone called into art Bell and said there was a man squished in a tube and he had a cell phone because if time travels involved

292
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
 Why would the call take place after?

293
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,080
 Mike had disappeared so just from a narrative standpoint if you guys are ever trying to pull a hoax

294
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,280
 It's better to add that layer of

295
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,120
 Confusion to it because it makes it more legit, but I

296
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,040
 Didn't buy that at all. It's not that I didn't buy the fact that he built a working time machine. I actually was still

297
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,160
 willing to suspend disbelief for that

298
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,300
 But that was just too clean of an ending so I really started digging into this story

299
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,000
 When you look up Mike Markham online

300
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,640
 You see a lot of forum posts about this and there's a lot of theories about what happened to him because he actually did disappear

301
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,280
 That is true

302
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,960
 Theories are that it was all a hoax to begin with none of this story was real which we know isn't because there was versions of it in the newspaper on

303
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,640
 Coast to coast a m all that the government kidnapped him because they wanted possession of the time machine the government had him killed because he knew too much

304
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,880
 They actually did time travel and he died or he did time travel and he was successful

305
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:47,720
 There's a kind of the most common theories going around on my journeys looking into the story. I found a website called paranormalists

306
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,920
 There was a poster named Himalayan hermit who said I don't know why this is such a big mystery

307
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,880
 Nexus magazine did a write-up on this guy. They found them. They know what happened to him

308
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,440
 so I had to find this Nexus magazine article I can't post it in the show notes because

309
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,840
 You have to pay for it. It cost me a dollar twenty-two. It was one of the best dollar twenty twos

310
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,400
 I've spent doing the show. I'll put the link in the show notes so you can buy the article

311
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,040
 But we have an answer to this for years for years

312
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
 People had not heard of this guy since

313
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,600
 1997 and that is where the story ended and to this day that Planet Today article was brand new. That's how they ended it

314
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,120
 We don't know what happened to him. He was in this tube

315
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,240
 Nexus magazine solved the story of what happened to Mike

316
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,920
 Madman Markham and it's it's awesome. Let's move on

317
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:47,000
 This article is written by Jason Offit and I'm pretty sure we've covered him before because he's written about shadow people

318
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,320
 He's written about black-eyed children. I tried going through my notes. I couldn't verify it

319
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,240
 But I'm sure we've covered Jason stuff before he wrote this article in Nexus magazine. It was volume 18 number five

320
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,480
 It'll be in the show notes the to buy the article if you'd like to and again, I suggested it's a really well-written article

321
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,560
 Here's what happened

322
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,760
 After that first interview with Art Bell he moved away. He moved to Kansas City, Missouri

323
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,040
 So all of his friends everyone he knew in school. He'd moved away from them

324
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:21,360
 So right there that would explain one of the reasons why you could disappear so easily if I went missing in my hometown

325
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,440
 Hundreds of people would wonder right away. They wouldn't have no I they would immediately realize that something was off

326
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
 But if I moved away

327
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,240
 It could be weeks before it filters back to all my friends and family

328
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,600
 What happened?

329
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
 But he moves to Kansas City, Missouri

330
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,480
 The other articles that were saying that he was getting donations to help build his time machine

331
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,960
 This Nexus article goes into great detail. Someone gave him warehouse space

332
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,920
 He got ten thousand dollars in financial

333
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,640
 Contributions and he according to him he was interviewed in this article. He is alive and well

334
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,520
 He got millions of dollars worth of equipment from people

335
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,360
 So he ends up building this massive machine in this warehouse

336
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,360
 It's over 60 feet high

337
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,600
 And he has everything he needs to power it

338
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,920
 He turns it on and he creates this vortex there's this tube and

339
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:28,920
 It's five feet in diameter and he's up on this cherry picker and he's watching this machine activate

340
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,800
 This is a life-size

341
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,920
 Time travel machine, but he still has to test it

342
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:41,000
 He's thrown metal screws through it. He's throwing items through it now. He has to test it on

343
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,480
 guinea pigs

344
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,960
 So he begins dropping guinea pigs out of a cherry picker

345
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,880
 into this vortex

346
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,480
 Doesn't hit the ground that just disappears

347
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,640
 Throws another one in doesn't hit the ground it just disappears

348
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:09,480
 But he doesn't see him walking around the warehouse floor he doesn't know where they're going or when they're going he hopes

349
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
 They're not just getting vaporized

350
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,880
 But he does start to notice

351
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,840
 Out in the parking lot around the warehouse

352
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,320
 Guinea pigs guinea pigs walking around the parking lot

353
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,920
 So he's realizing that he's dropping them in and they're appearing outside of the warehouse

354
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,240
 It's successful

355
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,400
 This time machine works

356
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,560
 I would say at this point

357
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:44,080
 I don't know if you've necessarily invented a time machine, but you may have simply invented a teleportation device either one would be revolutionary

358
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,400
 But he still thinks that when he's throwing these things into the vortex

359
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:56,280
 That there is a period of time passing and it seems to be relative to the size of the thing that that kind of is what his thought processes

360
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:02,800
 And he's also thinking sure this works on metal screws in organic stuff. It works on tiny things like guinea pigs

361
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,960
 But what about me and is it painful?

362
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,120
 But he realizes he has to test this on himself

363
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,880
 So one day he gets in that cherry picker

364
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,720
 He goes up

365
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,900
 It's a 60 foot drop from the top of that cherry picker to the warehouse floor and

366
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,880
 He has to fall in a five foot in diameter

367
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:38,360
 Cylinder and he is thinking okay. I'm not afraid of heights. I love roller coasters. I'm a big adrenaline junkie

368
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,720
 however

369
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,160
 If I panic and I hit the side of this thing

370
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,160
 Who knows what's gonna happen?

371
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:53,280
 It's now the year 1998 and he's up in this cherry picker. It is time to test the machine on

372
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,840
 himself

373
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,080
 There's no camera set up. There's no friends. There's no observers

374
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:07,400
 Just a man and even if there was you think someone would try to stop him, but there's a man in this cherry picker and he

375
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,320
 leaps out and

376
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:18,140
 Falls in towards the vortex of this massive machine that he has built

377
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,360
 There's a bright flash a

378
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,200
 loud crack a

379
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,240
 Thudding sensation that almost knocks him back. He says it's like a flashbang grenade going off right in your face

380
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:41,240
 It took him a long time to remember what happened Mike is standing in the middle of a farm

381
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:47,600
 He doesn't know where he's at. He doesn't know how he got here. He doesn't know who he is

382
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,360
 Mike is standing in this farm with no memory whatsoever

383
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
 He just kind of looks around

384
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,200
 Just can't figure it out

385
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,800
 He's in Fairfield, Ohio the year is

386
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,240
 2000

387
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,000
 He is two years later and hundreds of miles away from where he started

388
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,880
 Mike's time travel machine is successful

389
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,760
 But he doesn't know it. He doesn't even know who he is

390
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,520
 And because he has no memory of anything he ends up making his way into the city of Cincinnati

391
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,240
 Barely scraping by he ends up staying at a homeless shelter

392
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,200
 Taking on odd jobs trying to make ends meet and trying to remember who he is

393
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,960
 And he starts piecing things together over time. He begins to remember who he is

394
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:50,080
 He remembers a warehouse in Kansas City. He remembers what he was working on now two years have passed

395
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:57,120
 Since he jumped out of that cherry picker. He makes his way back to Kansas City, Missouri. The warehouse is empty

396
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,600
 He said millions of dollars of equipment were gone all of his logbooks all of his notes

397
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,520
 gone

398
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:13,560
 He says even without the notes I could rebuild the machine, but you don't understand this machine

399
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:19,840
 Costs I wouldn't have been able to do it without all the generous donations of this equipment and

400
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,440
 I don't remember who gave it to me. I cannot for the life of me remember who donated

401
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:36,120
 This equipment it wasn't all from one person several people were sending stuff over and I can't remember who it was his memory never fully

402
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,240
 returned

403
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:46,720
 He went back to Ohio where he continued to work odd jobs just kind of scrape by he would also Google himself

404
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,120
 Look up articles and he said one of the funniest things that he saw regarding this story

405
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:59,480
 Was that some man was found dead in California crushed in a metal tube with a cell phone? He goes that wasn't me

406
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
 I don't know who that was

407
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,400
 But it wasn't me

408
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:10,280
 When this article was written in 2011 Mike was alive and well continuing to work jobs in Ohio scraping by

409
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:19,720
 And he would love to rebuild this machine sometime, but he is just worried on paying rent and keeping himself fed

410
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,200
 And he ends the article by saying listen, I would love to rebuild this machine. I remember how to do it

411
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,120
 But right now I'm just struggling to pay rent keep food on the table

412
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,280
 It's a lofty dream

413
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:39,480
 Maybe someday I'll be able to rebuild it but for now I have more pressing matters in the present day to deal with

414
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,400
 Then to look into the future and see

415
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,360
 What may be you didn't say that eloquently you didn't say that eloquently, but he said that

416
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,120
 That is the whole story of Mike madman Markham

417
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,760
 And

418
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,240
 It sucks that this version isn't out there

419
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,080
 I think part of the reason why it's not is because of the paywall

420
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,640
 Everything about that ending is better than the time travel one it turns out to not be a hoax

421
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,200
 Like if we trust him out his word right he totally made up this last version of the story

422
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,960
 He's the only witness to any of it, but the one where he goes back in time and ends up in the crushed tube at the cell phone

423
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,040
 It doesn't really I guess on a sci-fi level it kind of makes sense

424
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,200
 But this version's better isn't this version one because it's a definitive answer

425
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,920
 It's from the man himself telling the story and it still has the elements of sci-fi it still works and all that stuff

426
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,020
 I think it's a better ending. I still have some questions about it though

427
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,440
 Why didn't he just call art bell again?

428
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,560
 That's what I don't understand when I was reading the story. I thought well, okay, this is interesting

429
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,620
 It's very fascinating story. Thanks for sharing it Mike

430
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,320
 But how come you didn't call art bell when you came back two years later?

431
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,160
 Even if it had been two years later imagine like the melee airheart showed back up and she's like oh

432
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,680
 They don't want to hear about me sure I've been gone for a hundred years and I like just as good as the day I left

433
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,800
 But I don't want to bug anybody like he should he should call art bell or if he's still alive now

434
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,320
 This article is from 2011 he was 22 back in 96, so he's gonna be that much older than me

435
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,200
 Why doesn't he contact coast to coast a and why doesn't he contact me actually?

436
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,960
 Well, he doesn't know I exist yet. Maybe he'll Google this

437
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,240
 But I mean he could contact these people now and clear this up. It could just be that he's kind of over it

438
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:25,640
 It could be that there's a little bit more to the story that we're not we don't know about

439
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,840
 Who knows but that was my thing when I was reading the story after I got done

440
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,040
 I go he could even though he doesn't remember the people who donated the equipment to him fair. That's fair enough

441
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,400
 He knows art bell

442
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,400
 And because he references them several times in the article

443
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,680
 So why doesn't he call him up again?

444
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,600
 But that is a personal decision that Mike is making and it could just be that he does want to build the machine again

445
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,560
 But all the attention may have just been a little too much who knows

446
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:59,680
 But for me this was a perfect way to wrap up insanity week because we've talked about a lot of insane stories and insane people

447
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,280
 This week. This is insanity that becomes

448
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:11,160
 Creativity this is that type of insanity that borders on the line of world-changing genius

449
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,400
 It takes an insane man to jump out of a cherry picker

450
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,920
 60 feet off the ground

451
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,440
 believing they will be safe and sound in a

452
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,680
 Time machine that they invented out of donated parts

453
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,040
 But that's the type of insanity that helps people

454
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,560
 That's the type of insanity that can actually change things

455
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,760
 So I wanted to end insanity week on a high note

456
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,240
 Wanted to cover someone who yes, we buy all definition of the word would say they were insane

457
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,600
 But this is that type of insanity that the world needs that drives the world forward

458
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:56,520
 But you're also probably wondering what happened to all the parts all the logs all the notes that were in that warehouse

459
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,840
 Well, someone cleared it out. It's possible the person who was leasing the warehouse hadn't heard from Mike and

460
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,000
 Stopped paying the lease and it was all taken off to the city dump

461
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,040
 Or it's possible that a government agency was observing Mike's progress

462
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,360
 They watched him jump into the portal and they realized this

463
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,040
 thing worked

464
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:25,040
 So with his notes they carefully disassembled this device and took possession of it

465
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,520
 It's possible that they rebuilt it, but they needed to test it for themselves a

466
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,680
 Government agent got in that cherry picker

467
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,320
 Sweat dripping from his brow

468
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,560
 They all saw that Mike disappeared into the vortex, but they don't know what happened

469
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,240
 Was it successful or he was he vaporized into a billion atoms

470
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,320
 this agent jumps and

471
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,880
 As he's falling towards the vortex he panics he hits the side of the metal tube and

472
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,600
 Both him and the cylinder that holds the vortex

473
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,160
 Disappears in an instant

474
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:10,040
 The government agents carefully disassembled the machine and lock it away

475
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,920
 Maybe they can figure out its secrets some other time, but for now

476
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,720
 It's too dangerous to even test

477
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,740
 And what happened to that special agent?

478
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
 well in the

479
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,380
 1930s

480
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,220
 There was a crushed cylinder with a man inside of it

481
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,780
 Maybe that wasn't Mike

482
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,780
 Maybe it was one of the men

483
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,220
 Who stole his time machine?

484
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:47,020
