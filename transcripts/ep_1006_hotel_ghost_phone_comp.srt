1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 When a young sheriff's deputy responds to a call of a domestic disturbance, he's expecting

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,440
 the worst, but he never expected the paranormal.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,720
 And then we travel to California.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,800
 As a hotel burst into flames, one man stayed behind to save everyone else.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,440
 The question is, is he still there?

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:33,440
 Stay on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,640
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,960
 Hope you guys are staying warm, cause I'm not.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,160
 But somebody who's always warm no matter the weather outside.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,080
 Everyone stand up and get on your feet for one of our live stream contributors, Rudy

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
 Jazz.

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
 Woohoo!

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,720
 So walk on in, walk on in Dead Rabbit Command, Rudy Jazz.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:06,280
 Rudy also a long time Patreon supporter, long time listener and always tune in for the Patreon

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,120
 live episodes.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,440
 Everyone gets to hear those episodes, they're not exclusive to the Patreon people, but if

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,880
 you support the Patreon you can listen to it live.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,200
 It's basically an extra 20-30 minutes of me going, "Uh, I don't know how to end this

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
 episode."

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,720
 That's pretty much what they hear.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,480
 And they hear all the bad jokes like, "Edit out."

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,160
 And yeah, it's about 20 minutes.

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,040
 That makes up an additional 20 minutes of the show.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
 Me burping a lot.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,720
 I guess I'm probably not selling it well.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,000
 You're like, "Oh great, I don't feel bad about not supporting the Patreon anymore."

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,960
 Rudy Jazz, you're gonna be our captain or pilot today if you guys can't support the

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
 Patreon.

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,320
 If you guys don't wanna hear me go, "Uhhh," for 20 minutes that's totally fine.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,920
 Just help spread the word about the show.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,080
 That helps out so much.

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,600
 Rudy, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Hare Hovercraft.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,000
 We're gonna glide on out of Dead Rabbit Command.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,960
 Take us all the way out, too.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
 Tennessee.

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:00,960
 Voooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:12,800
 Gliding over the land that we know is America.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,800
 Specifically, we're headed out to Pickett County, Tennessee.

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,040
 And there we're gonna meet a young Sheriff's deputy.

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,160
 He didn't give his name online.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,120
 We're gonna go ahead and call him Chris.

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,920
 Chris said he'd been working for the Sheriff's office for a while and they deputized him

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,640
 in 2021 so he hasn't been an officer for long.

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,160
 And since he was the newest guy on the block, they had him handling all the basic calls.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,920
 They were kinda giving him the grunt work.

48
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,520
 Well, one of the most dangerous phone calls that I don't know why they gave this one to

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,040
 him, one of the most dangerous phone calls any officer can get.

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
 They hate him.

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
 They hate responding to these.

52
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,880
 It's domestic disturbances, domestic violence calls.

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,880
 Because generally what happens is why you also, uh, personal advice here.

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,240
 Be very, be very, very leery about interfering.

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,440
 If you ever are like walking out of a bar and you see a guy and a girl fighting, it can

56
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,520
 go south really quickly for you because you get in the middle.

57
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,400
 You just have a knee-jerk reaction, right?

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,240
 To watching a dude punch a woman.

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,200
 And so you walk up and you push that dude and then that woman has you in a chokehold

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,520
 and she's clawing her eyes out.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,400
 That dude's punching you in the stomach because no matter what has gone on in their lives

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,560
 to bring him to the point where this man and this woman are trading blows in the middle

63
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,760
 of the street, it's horrific to watch.

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,640
 I mean, don't get me wrong, it's horrific to watch.

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,800
 The second, third party shows up.

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,040
 That couple is so deeply in love and they will brutally, they will brutally beat you

67
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
 down.

68
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,920
 Doesn't happen that way all the time, but it happens that way enough that police officers,

69
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,400
 I've had a lot of friends who have worked in law enforcement and they hate these calls.

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,720
 Because of that, they show up, they hear someone's beating on the other person and they're

71
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,480
 like, "Oh, we gotta go and settle this."

72
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,080
 And the next thing they know, they're fighting two people at once.

73
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,320
 They're trying to arrest one person.

74
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,520
 "No, no, I love them, I love them, I don't want them charged."

75
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,640
 And then it can get super bad.

76
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,800
 So the fact that they sent this rookie, the fact that they're like, "Oh, let's go send

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
 Chris after it."

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,840
 He handles all the basic calls, including the most dangerous ones.

79
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,920
 We don't want to do.

80
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,320
 He gets sent after this domestic violence call, domestic disturbance call is actually

81
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
 what it was listed as.

82
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,760
 And this is in March 2022.

83
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,200
 He set it out to the area.

84
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,880
 He listed it called Dale Hollow.

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,640
 This is a huge area in Pickett County.

86
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,160
 It's huge.

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,640
 Sometimes it's just referred to as Dale Hollow Lake.

88
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,840
 So I don't know exactly where this was at.

89
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
 If you want to reenact this, you might not want to.

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,720
 Not the domestic disturbance part, obviously, but the event we're coming up to.

91
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,080
 He gets the call and they go, "There's a domestic disturbance out by Dale Hollow."

92
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
 Go solve it.

93
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,640
 Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

94
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,720
 He has his sirens on.

95
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,400
 He's flying down the road in his cruiser.

96
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,520
 He gets to the house and begins to order whoever's in the house.

97
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,920
 This is the Pickett County Sheriff's Department.

98
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,160
 Come out of the house with your hands up.

99
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,800
 I repeat, come out of the house with your hands up.

100
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,280
 What happens is he turns and he sees a man come around like the north side of the property.

101
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,920
 He didn't come out the front door.

102
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,560
 He kind of comes around to the side and Chris has his gun drawn now.

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,720
 It's a super dangerous situation.

104
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,640
 He has his gun drawn and he's pointing it at the man.

105
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
 Get on his stomach.

106
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
 Get on his stomach.

107
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
 Get on the ground.

108
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
 Get on the ground.

109
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
 And the guy's like, "Uh."

110
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:46,240
 He's getting down on the ground and then about 20 yards to the south, he sees a woman

111
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
 coming around the corner.

112
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
 Get down on the ground.

113
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
 Get down on the ground.

114
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
 Show me your hands.

115
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,880
 Get down on the ground.

116
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,720
 But they begin in very, very panic tones in their voice to tell the Sheriff's Deputy to

117
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
 tell Chris, "We're in danger.

118
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
 We're in danger.

119
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
 We're all in danger.

120
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,160
 We got to get down on the ground.

121
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
 Get down on the ground.

122
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,560
 Both of you on the ground."

123
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,360
 Chris says in his narrative, he goes, "I am able to diffuse the situation.

124
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,680
 They're starting to calm down."

125
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,120
 He says the suspects were disarmed, "disarmed."

126
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,240
 He doesn't specifically say they were coming around with any weapons, whether they were

127
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,080
 firearms or melee weapons, but he says they were disarmed.

128
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,280
 And he was in the process of putting them in handcuffs, because at this point, again,

129
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,680
 you want to de-escalate this.

130
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,400
 He would have been yelling at him for five minutes pointing the gun at him.

131
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,200
 Now they're on the ground, you want to cuff them and now you can get the sight of the

132
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,120
 sword, because it's just Chris out there.

133
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,960
 And while he's in the process of doing this, taking them into custody so we can question

134
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:57,520
 them and find out what's going on, Chris suddenly flies 30 yards through the air, lands on his

135
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,560
 back.

136
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:10,040
 He's getting to his feet and he's like, "What the hell was that?"

137
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:17,480
 He said it felt like the air around him imploded and he was propelled backwards, which is

138
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,560
 a weird combination.

139
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,640
 An explosion is what blows you backwards.

140
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,720
 An implosion is everything that comes inside, but he's saying the air felt like it imploded.

141
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,960
 Then he flew backwards and he can't figure out what...

142
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,400
 He goes, "The only thing I can think of was someone launched an artillery shell at us."

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,680
 He goes, "We're under attack.

144
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,280
 That's his first thing.

145
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,560
 Someone launched some sort of artillery at us.

146
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
 We're under attack."

147
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
 And he radios it in.

148
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,760
 He goes, "I need everyone out here.

149
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,640
 Everyone of you or an law enforcement get out here as soon as possible.

150
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,240
 I'm under attack."

151
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,120
 And he radios in when you show up at this location, engage all hostile targets.

152
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,880
 I mean, basically imagine you're another cop sitting in town.

153
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,000
 You're just drinking a cup of coffee and all of a sudden you hear this guy, you hear the

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,400
 rookie being like, "I'm under attack.

155
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,880
 I'm under attack.

156
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
 Kill everything.

157
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,200
 Kill everything that's out here."

158
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,800
 Well they take it seriously because they don't know what's going on.

159
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
 Sure enough you had the state police, the county sheriff show up, you had law enforcement

160
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:33,120
 officers of all stripes show up to this house in Dale Hollow, but all that they found was

161
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,400
 Chris and two suspects.

162
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
 There was no one else there.

163
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,920
 There was definitely no one lobbying artillery at them.

164
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,920
 And when they got there they started to ask, "What happened?

165
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,360
 Why did you call us?

166
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,480
 What was going on?"

167
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:56,880
 And he said, "I just kind of didn't really tell them what had happened."

168
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:05,080
 He said, when he posted this he goes, "Listen, I was not going to risk my career or my pension

169
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,160
 over this.

170
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,600
 Like I was not going to tell them about what I felt because at this point he realized they're

171
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,640
 not under attack.

172
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,000
 He can't really explain what's going on."

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
 So he kept his mouth shut.

174
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,960
 He didn't say anything.

175
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
 He didn't tell them.

176
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,680
 Now I don't know how he wiggled out of the fact that he said everyone get down here and

177
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,440
 engage all hostile targets.

178
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
 He could probably just say, "You know, I'm new.

179
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
 I'm new."

180
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,000
 That's a rookie mistake.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,040
 And he goes, "Listen, I've seen a lot of things.

182
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,640
 He's been an officer for over a year at this point so he's probably going to see a lot

183
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
 more things this time."

184
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,880
 And he goes, "I've seen a lot of things and I'm not easily frightened but I mean I didn't.

185
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
 I was terrified.

186
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,240
 I had no idea what was going on.

187
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,680
 I didn't know what could have caused that."

188
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,640
 But I think he's not telling the whole truth in his post.

189
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,280
 He's leaving out some interesting details.

190
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:09,440
 I think what he saw there was so frightening he wasn't even willing to post it online because

191
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,360
 I'll say this.

192
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,080
 When I saw this Reddit post I read it and I go, "This is going to be gone in an hour."

193
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,200
 And what I do most of the time is when I find stuff on Reddit because I know how quickly

194
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,240
 like mods can delete things or the user can delete things, I'll make an archive of it

195
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,080
 which is basically it'll make a link that will never go away and it'll have a snapshot,

196
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,000
 it'll have this archive of it so at any point somebody else could find it so I can find

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
 it so I can go back and look at it.

198
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,520
 With this one I read it and I go, "This is going to be gone in an hour."

199
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,360
 And I didn't archive it because I looked at this guy's account.

200
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,160
 He has like 94,000 karma.

201
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,280
 He's been on the platform for years posting and all I was looking through his posting history

202
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,680
 and posting about recipes and his favorite kind of car and all this regular stuff and

203
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,360
 then this popped up.

204
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,640
 I go, "He's going to delete it and I'm going to let him delete it."

205
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,520
 What I did was I took a screenshot of it and erased his username so it can't be traced

206
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
 back to him.

207
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:23,040
 I mean I guess you could probably go how many rupees are in Pickin County, Tennessee or

208
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,920
 wherever it was at but plausible deniability right?

209
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,640
 I took a screenshot and so that'll be what's in the show notes because I like giving you

210
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
 guys the show notes.

211
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,800
 I'm not always able to do that but just for other researchers.

212
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,640
 Now the reason why I say that I think he's leaving stuff out of his narrative is one,

213
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,120
 he never tells us, obviously he would have talked to these other two people about what

214
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,800
 was going on before the other officer showed up.

215
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,880
 He had them in custody like they're sitting there under his control.

216
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,480
 It's not like they're running around the farmhouse.

217
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,320
 He never reveals what he asked them.

218
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,840
 That's very telling even if they didn't tell him anything.

219
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,560
 They say, "We don't know either."

220
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:16,520
 You would include that in the narrative and then he has this line in his post.

221
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,440
 He's talking about how terrified he was and everything like that.

222
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:28,600
 He said, "I do know that I was prepared to kill every last one of them had they crossed

223
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,320
 that line."

224
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,880
 Now that sentence makes no sense in comparison to everything else he's writing.

225
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,080
 Taking a look at it, I do know I was prepared to kill every last one of them.

226
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,440
 So who's he referencing?

227
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,680
 You could say the hypothetical people that are shooting near artillery shell, but I think

228
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,680
 he saw something there.

229
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,000
 He left that detail out because he just couldn't write that down.

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 He couldn't say that.

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,720
 I do know that I was prepared to kill every last one of them.

232
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
 Had they crossed that line, what is that in reference to?

233
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,160
 Was it a physical line?

234
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,520
 Had he basically scoped out an area and said, "If they get any closer I'm going to open

235
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,560
 fire on them."

236
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,840
 Or was it some sort of metaphorical like if they implode the air around me, but again

237
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,880
 then who's they?

238
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,520
 I don't believe it's in reference to the two people who were there already.

239
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,440
 And again remember it's a domestic disturbance call and they're at opposite ends of the house.

240
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
 They're coming around different ends of the house.

241
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,560
 The story could totally be made up.

242
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
 We always have to say that.

243
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,040
 I'm almost going to stop saying that because we say it all the time.

244
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,520
 But if the story is true, it is truly what we consider high strangeness.

245
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,040
 Things like is it ghost?

246
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,440
 Is it aliens?

247
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
 Is it cryptid?

248
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,920
 No, it's none of those.

249
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,880
 I mean, I think there's information missing.

250
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,960
 It could be alien.

251
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,080
 It's interesting the amount of information we do have.

252
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
 It's a lot of information.

253
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080

 It's a lot of information.

370
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 It's a lot of information.

371
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
 It's a lot of information.

372
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,080
 I don't agree with it.

373
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
 That's the way that it is, though.

374
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
 Rudy, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonic hopter.

375
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:35,080
 We're going to leave behind Pickett County, Tennessee, fly us all the way out to California.

376
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,080
 As we're flying out there, I just as a sigh, I'll have to find the article for the show notes.

377
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,080
 I don't remember the exact date of any of it off the top of my head.

378
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,080
 But when I was doing that narrative of the police officer trying to get the people when

379
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,080
 I was talking to the radio, there was this video.

380
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
 It came out.

381
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,080
 It was shortly after the Las Vegas massacre when that guy, what was it, Stephen Paddock?

382
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,080
 We still never figured out anything about his motive.

383
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,080
 But Stephen Paddock opened fire on all those people in Las Vegas.

384
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,080
 Maybe like a week later, there was a police officer who got a call to a hotel.

385
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
 I don't remember what state it was in.

386
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
 I remember watching the video, though.

387
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
 It was quite chilling.

388
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,080
 He got a call to go to the hotel.

389
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
 There was a man with the rifle.

390
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 He was aiming it out of the window of the hotel.

391
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:27,080
 So this police officer shows up with his body cam footage and he's in the hotel hallway

392
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,080
 and he's yelling at the guy to come out of the hotel with your hands up.

393
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,080
 Put your hands up, hands up.

394
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,080
 And the guy walks out of the hotel and his hand, he's terrified.

395
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
 His hands are up.

396
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,080
 And this police officer then begins to shout at him.

397
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
 If I remember correctly, right, I'll put in the show notes.

398
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
 Maybe someone will watch the video.

399
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,080
 I don't recommend watching the video, but maybe someone will watch the video.

400
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,080
 But I remember watching it and the commands the officer was giving him were so...

401
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,080
 Get down on the ground, get down on the ground, get your hands up.

402
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
 Don't move, don't move.

403
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,080
 Get on the ground, get on the ground, don't move.

404
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,080
 Come towards me.

405
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
 Hands up.

406
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
 Hands up.

407
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,080
 And it was just like, what in the world are you doing?

408
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,080
 Like, what do you, how do you react in that situation?

409
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,080
 And this guy is now on all fours and he's sobbing.

410
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 And the officer is yelling these commands at him.

411
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,080
 But it's such so tragic.

412
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
 It was so tragic.

413
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,080
 I'm watching this video.

414
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,080
 As he was crawling on the ground, as the man was crawling on the ground,

415
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
 he has like his hands out in front of him.

416
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
 He's crawling on the ground.

417
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
 He's sobbing.

418
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,080
 And this officer is pointing this, it's, it's like, you know, nowadays police officers have like these M16s.

419
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,080
 And the man's crawling down this hallway, sobbing.

420
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,080
 And as he's crawling, his pants are starting to come down.

421
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,080
 You know, like when you're crawling on the ground and your pants aren't buckled or whatever,

422
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
 your pants can start to slide down.

423
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,080
 He clearly reaches down to grab his pants to pull them back up.

424
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,080
 And this officer sends like seven rounds through his body like that.

425
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
 Kills him.

426
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,080
 And it, it was just such a tragedy.

427
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
 So the gun wasn't real.

428
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
 It was a BB gun.

429
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,080
 And this kid, I keep saying he's a kid, you know, he's in his early 20s, right?

430
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,080
 I'm 46, so everybody is a kid if you're under the age of 30.

431
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
 I'm gonna watch the whole video.

432
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:37,080
 It's like a, you're like, Jason, wow, this, this episode turned real dark real fast.

433
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,080
 It was a body cam and it was almost like a rifle cam.

434
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
 It was just like so close to it.

435
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,080
 And listen, I get it from the cops point of view.

436
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,080
 People have guns in the back of their pants.

437
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,080
 People, if you're going to have a concealed pistol, he doesn't know it's a BB gun.

438
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,080
 He just gets to report a week, even maybe a couple of days after Las Vegas massacre.

439
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,080
 There's a gun poking out of a hotel window.

440
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,080
 People keep guns in their waistbands, but dude, I mean, like a mat, like it's such an instinctual thing,

441
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,080
 like as your pants are falling down to reach and pull them up.

442
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
 And just let them up, dude.

443
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
 Let him up.

444
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
 He's nuts.

445
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
 It was nuts.

446
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,080
 And so it is one of those things, like when you're dealing with police, they will give you commands that don't make sense.

447
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,080
 Hands up, don't move, get on the ground, get on the ground, don't move.

448
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,080
 And you're like, what in the like, what do I do?

449
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
 They say you, you strike a pose, not like a little model pose.

450
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,080
 You keep your hands visible in the air and you go, I am afraid to move.

451
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
 I am afraid to move.

452
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
 I am not moving from this position.

453
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,080
 And you make yourself like clearly not a threat.

454
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:57,080
 Because if they do that, they're so amped up that they're yelling out all of these various commands and you like, what do I do?

455
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,080
 Do I not move or do I get on the ground?

456
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,080
 So you've seen, you know, people said, give that advice, you make a perfect, you have your hands completely up.

457
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
 Don't put them behind your head.

458
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,080
 I'm completely up standing up pose and say, I'm too scared to move.

459
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
 I'm too scared to do anything.

460
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,080
 I'm going to assume this pose.

461
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,080
 It's crazy.

462
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
 I assume I listen.

463
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,080
 I mean, like I feel sorry for that young man and his family tremendously feel sorry for them.

464
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,080
 Daniel Shaver was his name.

465
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,080
 He was Daniel Shaver.

466
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
 26 years old was the man that was killed.

467
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:43,080
 He had the he had pellet gun and the officer who shot him was named Philip Brailsford.

468
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,080
 And he was found not guilty by Jerry.

469
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
 They did have a case.

470
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
 It happened January 2016.

471
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,080
 This whole thing went down.

472
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,080
 Anyways, yeah, and he had previously been investigated for body slamming.

473
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,080
 He had previously been investigated for body slamming a teenager.

474
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 He walked on that.

475
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
 Crazy story.

476
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,080
 Crazy, crazy story.

477
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,080
 Well, Rudy, keep playing this Carpenter copter.

478
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,080
 We're going to cheer us up a bit with the story of a man who died in a fire.

479
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,080
 [Demonic voice]

480
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
 I didn't think about it.

481
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
 This story takes place in a hotel.

482
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,080
 I didn't even I didn't even mean to segue into that.

483
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,080
 I just go, oh, yeah, they reminded me of that.

484
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,080
 This the the shooting took place in Mesa, Arizona.

485
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
 But we're not in Mesa, Arizona.

486
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,080
 This hotel we are at.

487
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,080
 Paso Robles in California.

488
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
 Paso Robles.

489
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
 And it's the late 1800s.

490
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,080
 We're standing in front of El Paso de Robles Mineral Spring Hotel.

491
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,080
 You guys are all depressed.

492
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,080
 Jason, man, seriously, you just told a super disturbing story.

493
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
 And now you expect us to walk around an old timey clothes?

494
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
 Well, yeah, you know, cheer up.

495
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
 Cheer up, I'm going to tickling you.

496
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
 Come on.

497
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
 Don't worry about that man and his family.

498
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
 Come on, buddy.

499
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
 Come on.

500
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
 I'm all wrestling you.

501
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
 I'm throwing you in the Mineral Springs laughing.

502
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
 Yeah.

503
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,080
 Anyways, it's a mineral spring hotel.

504
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,080
 And back in the 1800s, this, I mean, this was like a huge resort.

505
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,080
 You'd have people travel from all over America.

506
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,080
 They'd hop on the train and be like, cancel all of our plans for the next month.

507
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:29,080
 Honey, we're riding across the rails to go to California specifically to go to this hotel because they had these mineral springs in the area.

508
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,080
 And at the time, you know, nowadays you still have this, but mineral springs were definitely considered like a curative.

509
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,080
 You could go there and all your ills could be cured, which if you think about it, one, it doesn't really work.

510
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:49,080
 But secondly, some guys suffering from leprosy and he's like in the mineral pool and he's like, ah, I can feel the lesions washing away from me.

511
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,080
 And you're like, ah, I just had like a slight cough.

512
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
 Get away from me.

513
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,080
 The El Paso de Robles Mineral Spring Hotel is a beautiful resort.

514
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:09,080
 And for whatever reason, somebody thought it would be good to advertise the hotel as fireproof.

515
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,080
 Like that was something they said they'd come out at our hotel, hot mineral springs.

516
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,080
 We got an indoor tennis court and it's fireproof.

517
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,080
 I'm like, what? Why'd you have that last part?

518
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,080
 I hope all hotels are fireproof and I've really thought about it before.

519
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:32,080
 But generally when you say something is something proof, you're, it's called foreshadowing.

520
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
 That's what we call it.

521
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
 Nah, not foreshadowing.

522
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
 It's just fireproof.

523
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
 Well, anyways, the hotel burned down.

524
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,080
 The hotel burnt down, but it took a while.

525
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
 It burnt down in 1940.

526
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,080
 So if you're going to say it's fireproof, you know, 60, 70 years, it's a pretty good time.

527
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,080
 I think you could count it as fireproof at that point.

528
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:59,080
 And what's interesting is at this point in the story, it's this early in the story that the narrative diverges.

529
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
 I did a lot of research on this one.

530
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
 So I thought it was really interesting.

531
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 So the story I'm going to tell you is the most agreed upon version of it, but you'll find a ton of different versions on this story.

532
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,080
 It's December 19th, 1940.

533
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,080
 It was 9 p.m.

534
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,080
 And at this point, it was called the Paso Robles Inn.

535
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
 It was a much shorter name.

536
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
 It caught on fire.

537
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,080
 And at the time, there were 200 guests in attendance.

538
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,080
 So it was a really fancy hotel even in 1940s, but this fire broke out.

539
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,080
 And at the time, there was no 911.

540
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,080
 911 wasn't started until 1968.

541
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,080
 And it wasn't, I remember 911 when it came out in California.

542
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,080
 It was like the early 80s.

543
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
 Really early 80s.

544
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,080
 I remember they'd run commercials saying, "If you're in an emergency, call 911."

545
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,080
 I don't know if that was the actual song, but they had to advertise to us.

546
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,080
 You could call 911 because it was fairly new.

547
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
 It took a long time for it to catch on.

548
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,080
 In 1987, only 50% of the United States had access to 911.

549
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
 That's a little trivia for you.

550
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:14,080
 But for the people, that's trivia for us, but for the people trapped in this burning hotel, they're like, "Oh, who do we call?"

551
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,080
 They go, "The fire department. Do you know their number?"

552
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,080
 No, nobody knew the fire department's number.

553
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,080
 You would have to call that firehouse.

554
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:29,080
 So the night clerk of the hotel, J.H.M.Sley, decided that he was going to call.

555
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:40,080
 He didn't know the fire department's number, but he was going to call every room in the hotel to warn them that there's a fire going on.

556
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,080
 So he's inside room 1007 and using his phone back then.

557
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,080
 [imitates phone ringing]

558
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,080
 He's using the rotary phone and he's like, "Guys, the place is on fire."

559
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
 They're like, "Ah!" and then he hangs up.

560
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,080
 [imitates phone ringing]

561
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
 "Hey, place on fire."

562
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,080
 "Ah!" and he just does this over and over again.

563
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:10,080
 Well, while he's doing that, he's like, "I hope I got everyone because I'm in the middle of having a heart attack."

564
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,080
 And he's like trying to dial him and he's like, "Ah, fire."

565
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:22,080
 Fire and although he died of a heart attack, no one died in the fire.

566
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:29,080
 He was able to warn enough people by phone, by calling their rooms.

567
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,080
 Everyone is able to get out, but him.

568
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,080
 He died of a heart attack in room 1007.

569
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:43,080
 That's a good way to go out. You go out a hero, man.

570
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,080
 Let's fast forward quite a few years.

571
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,080
 And at this point, the inn was rebuilt.

572
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,080
 It was rebuilt using some of the bricks from the Burn Down Hotel.

573
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
 Let me figure. That's save a little bit of money.

574
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:04,080
 And then there was an earthquake, but a few years after the original Inferno,

575
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,080
 there's a clerk at the front desk and all of a sudden...

576
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,080
 [imitates phone ringing]

577
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
 ...picks it up.

578
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
 Pastor Robles in.

579
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,080
 Most fireproof hotel in town.

580
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,080
 Our new one. Our new one's even more fireproof.

581
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,080
 "Hello?" the night clerk says.

582
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,080
 "Hello?"

583
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,080
 Is there anyone in there?

584
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,080
 You need to meet...

585
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,080
 ...the hotel's fire.

586
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:53,080
 [phone ringing]

587
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,080
 The clerk's like, "What in the world was that?"

588
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,080
 How would you get back to work after that?

589
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,080
 He's like, "Oh, time to do my taxes!"

590
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
 I'd be like, "It's time to change my pants!"

591
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,080
 Good thing my work has a functional laundry mat.

592
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,080
 I'm out. I'm taking a break, dude.

593
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,080
 What was happening was they were getting phone calls to the front desk,

594
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
 warning them that the building was on fire.

595
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,080
 And the first time they got it, they were like,

596
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,080
 "I don't know, the building's on fire!

597
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
 My reputation will be in fireproof! It's ruined yet again!"

598
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,080
 But they would check the building, there'd be no fire.

599
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,080
 This happened on and off.

600
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
 They would get these phone calls,

601
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
 and it would warn them the building's on fire.

602
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,080
 Well, one night...

603
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,080
 Now we're fast-forwarding quite a few years.

604
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,080
 Post-1968, for example.

605
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,080
 The night clerk's sitting there.

606
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,080
 This phenomenon had been going on for a while,

607
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
 but we don't know what it is.

608
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
 A prank?

609
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
 The night clerk's sitting there one night,

610
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
 and he hears roaring down the street,

611
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,080
 "Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

612
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:25,080
 "Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

613
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,080
 So there was a fire at Paso Robles Inn. They kept getting these phone calls.

614
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,080
 Until eventually 911, again, if it was one call or multiple calls,

615
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,080
 we're not for sure, but 911 initiated a backtrace of the phone call.

616
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,080
 It was coming from Paso Robles Inn,

617
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:50,080
 and it was coming from the phone in Room 1007.

618
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,080
 There was no human that was making those phone calls.

619
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,080
 It was coming from Room 1007.

620
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
 Sometimes the story says that the room was locked.

621
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,080
 I don't know if it's like a side room for...

622
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
 Because the night clerk was in there.

623
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
 I don't know if it was actually like a room you can stay in,

624
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,080
 or like an office type of room,

625
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,080
 but they say the room was locked.

626
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
 No one was in there. No one was actually making these phone calls.

627
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,080
 And yet the front desk was getting them,

628
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,080
 and then once the 911 line was established...

629
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,080
 So if this story is true,

630
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
 what's the state of it today?

631
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,080
 Like at this point, does the 911 office have a picture of the Paso Robles Inn

632
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,080
 stapled to their board and it says, "Do not respond to calls from here?"

633
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,080
 No, the answer is actually far more interesting

634
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,080
 than the phenomenon continuing, right?

635
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
 To say that, "Oh, it happens to this day."

636
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
 It's actually way more interesting than that.

637
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,080
 According to reports, this happened.

638
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
 The front desk was getting the calls,

639
00:31:52,080 --> 00:32:00,080
 and the 911 was getting the calls until the hotel decided to switch from analog phone lines,

640
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
 which is the phone lines that I grew up with,

641
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,080
 to T1 digital phone lines.

642
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
 So they're sending a digital signal.

643
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
 You could cram more information through it.

644
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,080
 They're used obviously for internet access, T1 lines.

645
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,080
 And you would need less lines for more phones

646
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,080
 because you can move more lines, more information through the lines.

647
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,080
 So it's just an economic thing and a speed thing.

648
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:32,080
 So when they upgraded from analog to digital, the call stopped.

649
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:39,080
 Which is beyond fascinating to me.

650
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,080
 It really is.

651
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
 When we look at stuff like white noise,

652
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,080
 when we look at the phenomenon of ghost, of the dead talking to us,

653
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:54,080
 I can almost guarantee there is a difference in how it is processed,

654
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,080
 how this information is processed in.

655
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:07,080
 And I'm talking about like an analog wave may be easier to pick up a ghost voice than a digital wave.

656
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
 Or a digital...

657
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,080
 I mean, you can look at the way that the pattern is repeated, and they're completely different.

658
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
 There's a huge difference between analog and digital.

659
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:21,080
 And I'm wondering if, for whatever reason, the ghost can't speak on that digital spectrum.

660
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,080
 It's not picking it up.

661
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,080
 Which is fascinating to me.

662
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,080
 It's funny because this idea that the more technologically advanced we become,

663
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
 the less superstitious we become.

664
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
 First off, I don't agree with that.

665
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,080
 I don't agree with that at all.

666
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,080
 I think the more technologically advanced we become, people feel less open about talking about their superstitions.

667
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
 Because they're going to get mocked.

668
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,080
 Mockery is probably the greatest weapon against the open-minded.

669
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
 It really is.

670
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,080
 You can be totally open-minded, but you don't want to tell anyone because you're afraid.

671
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
 You're going to mock.

672
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
 You're afraid someone's going to make fun of you.

673
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,080
 And so, I'm wondering if let's extrapolate this out and wrap the episode up like this.

674
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,080
 Right now, we went from the analog technology.

675
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,080
 So, tape recorders and old-timey phones, phonographs, stuff like this.

676
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,080
 We moved to the digital and that basically made it harder for the ghost to communicate.

677
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:30,080
 But what if, as technology continues to advance, we end up creating a form of technology that makes it easier for them to communicate?

678
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,080
 We don't even mean to do that.

679
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:45,080
 The phenomenon of the orbs, those little balls that appear in photos, those little glowing balls that appear in photos, a lot of people say those are spirits.

680
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
 A lot of people say that's just dust.

681
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,080
 But those never appeared before the invention of the digital camera.

682
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,080
 You don't find those on old photos.

683
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,080
 You do not find those in old film photos.

684
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,080
 They only appear on digital cameras.

685
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,080
 So, if it's a paranormal event, the inventor of the digital camera didn't make it.

686
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,080
 Didn't go, "Well, you know, it's going to take a lot of pictures. You can store them on a little chip."

687
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
 And ghosts.

688
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,080
 "Take pictures of ghosts!" People are like, "What? What's up with that last part?"

689
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
 He's like, "Yeah, I invented it."

690
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,080
 Not just because it's snazzy and it can fit in your pocket money.

691
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
 It can take a picture of a ghost.

692
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
 Easier. You're like, "What?"

693
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,080
 I'm wondering if that march towards technology will make it easier to find.

694
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,080
 Long time ago, I did an episode about the ghost phone. This guy was inventing this device to talk to the dead.

695
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,080
 I get... I like signed up for his email list.

696
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,080
 He's still moving forward with that. He is 100% for sure he's figured it out.

697
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,080
 Could you imagine?

698
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,080
 We talk about like if aliens come down. That's a common thing.

699
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:56,080
 We go, "What if aliens come down tomorrow? How would that affect society? How would the Pentagon react?

700
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,080
 How would society react? How would a religion act? How would you act?

701
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:17,080
 What would happen if two months from now someone comes out with a ghost phone and goes, "No, try it. Try it yourself."

702
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:25,080
 You can talk to any ghost you want. You're like, "What? Try it. Here. This is not a fraud. This is not a fraud. I'm putting this down."

703
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
 Pick it up.

704
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,080
 Pick it up.

705
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,080
 And you can talk to the dead.

706
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:39,080
 That would be way more earth-shattering than aliens showing up.

707
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
 I really think that would...

708
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,080
 Because then you would simply ask a ghost, "Are aliens real?" And they're like, "No."

709
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,080
 I float it all around.

710
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:55,080
 There's some fun guy on some planet. There's some like lizard. Not lizard people. That would have been cool.

711
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,080
 But there's just like lizards walking around on Alpha Centauri 8.

712
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
 Stuff like that.

713
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
 But I mean like spaceships? Nah.

714
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,080
 What? Okay. Can you tell me?

715
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,080
 Would you ever stop using that phone?

716
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:16,080
 First off, of course, you would talk to all your loved ones. You'd be like, "Hey, hey, how's it going? Man, missed you."

717
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:21,080
 But then eventually you'd be like, "I wonder what Mark Twain's up to right now."

718
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,080
 He has like a thousand phones at once. He's like, "Ahhh."

719
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,080
 It would change. It would totally be the craziest thing.

720
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,080
 It would be insane. It would change.

721
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:38,080
 For obviously, your first question would be like, "What's it like? Which religion is right?"

722
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
 That would be your first question.

723
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:49,080
 If aliens showed up, religions would totally be like, "Eh, they're Catholic too. Look at their ships. It looks like a giant pointy hat."

724
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,080
 They would totally just co-opt it or try to convert them.

725
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:00,080
 We'd be trying to sell them stuff and buy things. Assuming they were peaceful, right? We would try to have commerce.

726
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,080
 We would do all these things that humans do.

727
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,080
 We'd figure out a way. We'd adapt.

728
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,080
 If you could talk to ghosts, it would be the biggest seismic shift in human history.

729
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,080
 I mean, I don't even know how... You'd be like, "Okay, well...

730
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,080
 I'm a ghost now since I know what it's like. Since I get floated around.

731
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:29,080
 I'm riding the lizard on Alpha Centauri 8. I'm like, "Woo! This is way better than you might've heard of."

732
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,080
 I'm armwrestling Mark Twain.

733
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,080
 I mean, the world would... It would be so insane.

734
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,080
 I actually never thought about that until I started going off on this.

735
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
 Never even popped in my head.

736
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,080
 I originally was just going to talk about how technology would affect the dead or something.

737
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,080
 That's what I should write in my notes and how I'm riding lizards on an alien planet.

738
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,080
 Yeah, it would be insane. And who knows if that technology is coming?

739
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:04,080
 Not necessarily the Soul Phone, the Ghost Phone, whatever. I'll put his updates in the show notes and that episode as well.

740
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,080
 But I mean, just like, imagine if a new tech... They have that new diet lot.

741
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,080
 They have that new weight loss pill. It's supposed to be diabetes medicine.

742
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,080
 And now they're thinking it might be the best-selling drug of all time because you take...

743
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:21,080
 It's an injection. It's like $13,000 a month, but you lose like 30% body weight.

744
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
 You get super slim.

745
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,080
 They didn't set out to make that. They were trying to set out a drug for diabetes.

746
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:37,080
 Who knows? Like, imagine if tomorrow someone brought to you a device that 100% was not a fraud, could contact the dead.

747
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:43,080
 And it's not just for you, right? It's not just your buddy being like, "Hey, you know, what were you doing last weekend?"

748
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:48,080
 And you're like, "I was sitting around watching YouTube for eight hours. Well, I invented a device that could talk to the dead."

749
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
 You're like, "Oh, you overachiever."

750
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,080
 It's like out there. It's like he's doing the talk show circuit.

751
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,080
 And he's been at the White House. He's traveling the world and he's showing off his phones.

752
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,080
 And then in three months, you can buy your own. You can have a phone sitting at home and you can talk to the dead.

753
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:12,080
 He goes, "I just was trying to invent a new blender. I was just trying to, like, make something else.

754
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:19,080
 But then I realized that at a certain frequency, I heard an old relative go, "Johnny, is that you?"

755
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,080
 You're like, "What? Johnny, it's Aunt Esmerelda."

756
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:34,080
 What? She's like, "It's Aunt Esmerelda, you deaf fool. Listen to me. I'm from the dead. I'm a ghost. You're talking to me."

757
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,080
 What? That's all he says. He makes the breakthrough of a lifetime. He just keeps going, huh?

758
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:45,080
 That would be amazing. That would be so awesome. And it would be earth-shattering.

759
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,080
 No religion could... Well, one religion would be fine, right? Which everyone was real.

760
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,080
 They go, "Oh, yeah, no, we totally miffed that one. That was the real religion."

761
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:04,080
 But every other religion would be like, "Well, they'd go, "This isn't true. Don't listen to your dead relatives. Listen to us."

762
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,080
 And you'd be like, "I don't know. I mean, I kind of knew that person when they were..."

763
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:14,080
 It's so funny. Now I'm just going off ranting, but people would think it was like demons and stuff.

764
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:20,080
 You would have people who would say that. You'd have people who would say it was demonic and they were trying to mislead you.

765
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,080
 But I mean, like, it's Mark Twain. It's Mark Twain over there.

766
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:30,080
 It's Mark Twain. You're talking to America's greatest author. He's saying wise stuff.

767
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:38,080
 So is it possible that the phantom caller of Paso Robles in is still making the phone calls?

768
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:45,080
 We just can't hear them anymore. That there's a lost soul still sitting in room 1007,

769
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:51,080
 picking up the phone and dialing the number, trying to warn people that the building's on fire,

770
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:59,080
 but he doesn't know that he was the only death during the inferno.

771
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:10,080
 And if moving from analog to digital made it not that he stopped making the phone calls, but that we stopped hearing them,

772
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:20,080
 what will happen when technology advances again and again and again?

773
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:27,080
 To a point where his voice cannot only be heard, but is heard more clearly and more strongly,

774
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:39,080
 and you can communicate back to it. How would society react to that? How would you react to that?

775
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:47,080
 Could you ever truly trust the voice of the dead? Or would in the back of your mind,

776
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,080
 would you think this was some sort of demonic trick?

777
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:57,080
 We may not know the answer to that question, but as technology keeps marching forward,

778
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,080
 we may be forced to have an answer for that question.
