1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Secret service agents hot on the trail of a counterfeiter make a horrifying discovery.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And then we travel to Helltown, Ohio.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 A city steeped in rumors.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 But how many of them are true?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Is the town hiding horrible stories of Satan worshippers, ghosts, and serial killers today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I'm a rock big gal.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm a rock big gal.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm a rock big gal.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I'm your host Jason Carbenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I went to the Indotronautics dude today.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Found out that I need a root canal.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Are they going to pull the tooth?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Those are my choices.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I have $11 in my wallet.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I have $11 until next Wednesday.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 And I took some cans down to get them recycled.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And I found $5 bill on the ground.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 So after I did my grocery shopping and finding the $5 bill and recycling those cans, I have $11.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And the reason why I'm saying that is I always say I'm having a great day.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It doesn't mean things are perfect.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 It doesn't mean things are perfect.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 But need a root canal?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 That's just the way it goes.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 You only got $11?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 That's just the way it goes.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Don't let that stuff get you down.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Because I don't.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And that's the best way to look at things.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 It really, really is.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Positive thinking, even when you're in a situation that doesn't seem very fun.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Just go with it, man.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Just go with it.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Because being negative about the situation helps nobody.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I'm going to get the root canal done next Thursday.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And next week, I'll get paid.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I can make $11 last week.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I can actually because I've been in this situation before.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 So just keep your head up, guys.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I am having a great day.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And I really do hope you guys are having a great day too.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Let's get started with the episode here.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Oh, also I saw it in-game last night.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And it was super boring.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 But I'll talk about that maybe on a bonus episode or something.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 But let's go ahead and get started with the story here.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Let's go ahead and hobble board the carpenter copter.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 You got some money for fuel?

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 You're going to have to pay for the gas on this one.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Because I only got $11, guys.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 So after we go to the helicopter gas station, I'm buying all these snacks.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I was like, "It's cool, right? If I buy these?"

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And you're like, "Fine, Jason. Buy your keto snacks."

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 "These are their extra expensive keto Doritos."

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 "Why don't they have those, dude?"

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Anyways, so I'm buying all these.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I'm buying a bunch of beef jerky.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And you're like, "Fine."

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Putting it on your credit card.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 We're hobble board the carpenter copter.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And you're like, "Wait, it didn't need any gas."

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And I'm like, "Hehehehe, just wanted my snacks."

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 We're going to hobble board the carpenter copter.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 We're going back in time to the fabulous year of 1979.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Three years after I was born.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 So imagine three-year-old Jason boogying down to disco music,

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 as we're talking about this story.

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Florence, Kentucky.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 It's July 13th.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And there's a bank teller just doing her job counting money.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And she discovers a counterfeit bill.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Now, counterfeit bills, a quick little side note.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 You guys know what counterfeit bills are.

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 They're fake money, but just a couple little tips here.

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 One, counterfeiting is one of the easiest crimes to get caught for.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 90% of all counterfeiters are caught within the first year of operation.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Generally, what they do nowadays is that when you make a counterfeit bill

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 and when it's detected by the Secret Service,

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Secret Service has two jobs, protect the president,

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 and investigate counterfeit money.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And when the Secret Service gets their hands on a counterfeit bill,

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 what I've heard is that they then scan the bill

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 and get every fingerprint they can off the bill.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And if your fingerprints show up on enough bills

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 and there's no re-- like, if you're a bank teller,

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 if you work with a cash register, things like that,

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 your chances of handling more than one counterfeit bill is higher.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But if you are like a mechanic or you work at a call center or something like that

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 and your fingerprints keep-- or you're unemployed

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 and your fingertips keep showing up on counterfeit bills,

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 they're gonna flag you.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Now, a lot of times they may or may not have your fingerprints in the system already,

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 but in the most case, they do.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 But in the most case, they do.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And in the most case, they do.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And in the most case, they do.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And in the most case, they do.

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000

 And in the most case, they do.

254
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And in the most case, they do.

255
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And in the most case, they do.

256
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And in the most case, they do.

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And in the most case, they do.

258
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And in the most case, they do.

259
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And in the most case, they do.

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And in the most case, they do.

261
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And in the most case, they do.

262
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And in the most case, they do.

263
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 The store junior was left open one day,

264
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 and he went to go lock it, and he looked inside,

265
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 and he never said anything about what was in there.

266
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Secret service agents are like, "Okay, that's enough suspense.

267
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Show us where it's at."

268
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 So they get to the store junior, open it up.

269
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 $52,000 in counterfeit bills are sitting in there,

270
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 which is kind of what they expected.

271
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 They found a bunch of cash papers,

272
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 so stuff to make even more counterfeit bills.

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Another police badge,

274
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 but what starts to concern them

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 is they find a ton of sex toys in there.

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Now, nowadays, people have sex toys just sitting out.

277
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Like, you'd be walking to some girls' house,

278
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 there's like a vibrator sitting on her bed stand.

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Like, people aren't ashamed of that stuff anymore.

280
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 You walk down the street, some guys just like waving a dildo in your face.

281
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 But back in the 1980s, like,

282
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 if you had sex toys, you were considered some sort of deviant.

283
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And, I mean, you could say people,

284
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 people, if they're waving it in your face today,

285
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 would be considered deviant behavior as well.

286
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 But back then, you look, you walked into someone's house,

287
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 there's a giant dildo on the floor,

288
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 you'd be like, "What are you doing?"

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 So, that's where the Secret Service agents came in.

290
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 They came in, they find these giant dildos, these whips,

291
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 all these sex toys, and they're like,

292
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 "Dude, it's 1983, I didn't even know this stuff existed."

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So, at this point, the Secret Service agents were sword fighting

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 with these giant dildos.

295
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 The boss was like, "Guys, put that stuff down,

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 you have a job to do." They're whipping each other.

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 "Hey, look at me, I'm Indiana Jones."

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Guys like, "Oh, I kind of like this thing."

299
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 The boss is like, "Get it together, guys."

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Secret Service agents. But anyways, after the sword fight,

301
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 after the Aero Flynn sword fight,

302
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 where they're like swinging along, they're dressed in leather chaps,

303
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I like this suit better than my, "Take it off, Henry, take it off, do your job."

304
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 After all, I have to line the move for what's coming,

305
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 because as they're processing the evidence,

306
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 they find an audio tape, and they're like,

307
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 "Oh, I wonder if this is like the new Starship album."

308
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Or, I think at that point, they were still Jefferson Airplane in 1982,

309
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 but, "Hey, let's put in this cool tape,

310
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 maybe we'll listen to some tunes as they're driving down the road."

311
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 They put it in, and it's a woman screaming for her life,

312
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 begging to die, just completely like flipping out.

313
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 The agents are like, "Ugh, that is, okay,

314
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 this case has gone in a totally different direction."

315
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 This woman is just screaming and begging to be killed

316
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 as she's being tortured.

317
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Secret Service say, "There's a little bit outside of our jurisdiction."

318
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 They end up, this is so bizarre, they end up contacting the FBI,

319
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 and they said, "Hey, listen, we have this guy in custody,

320
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 he's not saying anything.

321
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 We were able to find this storage unit full of all these sex toys,

322
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 and one guy starts pulling out of his pocket,

323
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 the FBI just like, "No, I know what a sex toy is,

324
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 just put that back in your pocket."

325
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 We also found this audio tape of a woman being tortured in his possession.

326
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 So we would like you to take over the investigation

327
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 and find out, like, is this guy a serial killer,

328
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 kidnapper, rapist, and the FBI said, "No."

329
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Because they go, "There's no victims."

330
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Like, you have an audio tape and you have some weirdo in custody,

331
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 but there's no victims, so we're not going to help you investigate.

332
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So this is why this case is still talked about in Secret Service circles,

333
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 is because, one, they masked, he was a master counterfeiter,

334
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 but two, this was a, like, a murderer criminal investigation

335
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 they had to take, which they normally don't,

336
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 so they still talk about this case all the time.

337
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Secret Service is like, "Somebody needs to investigate this guy.

338
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 We're not just going to get him on the counterfeiting."

339
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 They had to look into violent crimes that took place around the times

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 and places where they know the molepasser was,

341
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 because he was passing the counterfeit bills,

342
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 and they identify him at this point as Mike DeBartlebin,

343
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 and he had already been arrested in the past.

344
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Now that they know who he is, they can find out his rap sheet.

345
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 They found out that he'd been arrested for sodomy, for kidnapping,

346
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 for attempted murder, and for counterfeiting,

347
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 so they're like, "This is the right guy,

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 and we believe he's done something else."

349
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 The storage unit, they found photographs of women,

350
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 and some of them they could identify, some of them they couldn't.

351
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 He had five ex-wives, and they were able to track him down,

352
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 and one of them was the woman on the tape,

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 and she goes, "Yeah, that was like a script he gave me.

354
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Like, I was acting," and they were like, "That allowed them to go,

355
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 'Well, that's good that a woman didn't actually suffer this,'"

356
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 and the wife was kind of like, "Well, this was a fantasy he had,

357
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 so he did tie me up and was like, it was aggressive sex,

358
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 but he had me read this script out,

359
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 so it probably was some sort of sexual thing,"

360
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 and the cops are like, "Well, that's great,

361
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 but it's good that you're alive.

362
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Like, hearing that tape is so horrible,

363
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 we can't imagine somebody actually going through that."

364
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 But the thing is, is that through the course of the investigation,

365
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 they did match him up to several brutal rapes,

366
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 and at least one murder, possibly two.

367
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 They did find a real estate agent bound up in the attic of a house,

368
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 and she was tortured and stabbed and so on and so forth,

369
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 so they finally said, "This guy is a sadist.

370
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 This guy is aggressively raping women, he's murdering women.

371
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 We think we have enough to put him away."

372
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 He goes to trial, and they don't charge him with the murder,

373
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 because they could never prove they found the real estate agent

374
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 tied up in a sadistic manner in an attic of a house she was showing,

375
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 and he was in the area, and people thought,

376
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 "Yeah, I thought I saw him with her, like, showing the house,"

377
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 and stuff like that, could never prove it.

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 He goes to trial, he's convicted of six cases of kidnapping and assault,

379
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 sentenced to 375 years, he's dead now, he died in 2011.

380
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 He never, ever, ever admitted to anything.

381
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 He was stone-faced about the whole thing.

382
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 So they don't know how many people he possibly could have killed.

383
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 They do know that he was an aggressive sexual sadist,

384
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 and they do know, they believe that he killed at least that one woman,

385
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 if not many, many more.

386
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 They were just able to kind of tie him to two murders,

387
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 but he was doing this mall passing thing for so long,

388
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 plus he had this history of this, plus he had these, they don't know.

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 They don't know, he just never, ever, ever admitted to it.

390
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 As far as I know, he probably never even admitted that his name was Mike.

391
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I think that story's interesting.

392
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I came across this story years and years ago,

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 I read at least two true crime novels on that case.

394
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 I found it fascinating because I like police work.

395
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I like the idea, and it's probably one of the best, like, investigative stories,

396
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 where the cops are just kind of clueless.

397
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 They're kind of, not clueless, I don't want to say clueless,

398
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 it makes them sound bumbling, but they do kind of bumble onto this case.

399
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 They're looking for a guy who's ripping off, you know,

400
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Claire's, who's ripping off Hot Topic, and they find a possible serial killer,

401
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 but to this day, they don't know how many people he may have killed.

402
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I just find that story fascinating, because it's basically,

403
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 it seems so mundane on its surface, a financial crime that actually hid a very dark secret.

404
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And you gotta wonder, you really gotta wonder how many of those storage units

405
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 you're driving by those storage places all the time,

406
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 how many of those storage units hold dark secrets like that?

407
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 It could be all sorts of horrible things in there.

408
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 It's just, it's creepy.

409
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 It'd be the perfect place to hide your murder kit away from your wife or your family.

410
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And just, you go there, there's 24 hour ones, you go there late at night under your alias,

411
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 open it up, pull out your kit, pull out your tools, and go and wreck havoc on people,

412
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 and then just put them back.

413
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And everyone else just drives by that storage unit every single day,

414
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 having no idea what was hiding in there.

415
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Because the secret service agents didn't.

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 They just kind of stumbled across a giant collection of dildos,

417
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 and a tape that caught a serial killer.

418
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

419
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Our next story, we are going to Helltown, Ohio.

420
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Now I know what you're thinking, can I find Helltown on a map?

421
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Is it the actual name of the city?

422
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 No, it's not. No, it's not.

423
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 But it's a very, very interesting story.

424
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Let's hop into Jason Jalopy, because it's kind of in the same area, I think.

425
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Kentucky, Ohio, it's not that long of a drive.

426
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I don't think, hey, can we go to the gas station?

427
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 I was just joking.

428
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 So anyways, we're getting into Jason Jalopy.

429
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 It's powered by, powered by grease from McDonald's.

430
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 So it just smells like french fries as it's driving down the street.

431
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 But we do have to go to McDonald's.

432
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 You're like, "Damn Jason, so I'm eating a bunch of keto fries."

433
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 They should have those. They don't.

434
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 "Meating a bunch of meat with no buns."

435
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 You're like, "Great."

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 We're driving down the road.

437
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You're like, "Jason, just set up a Patreon account.

438
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 "Could boomin' food off of me."

439
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 We're driving down the road, and we're going to Ohio.

440
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Now, this place is, we call it Helltown,

441
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 but it's actually a collection of towns.

442
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 All in Summit County, Ohio.

443
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 So there's like Boston Township and Boston Village and a couple other towns,

444
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 but kind of absorbing all of that is this place that's been named Helltown.

445
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It was founded back in 1806.

446
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Again, the town leader wasn't like,

447
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 "And I do decree this town is known as Helltown."

448
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 It was just this collection of townships.

449
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 But in 1974, that hippy Ford, President Ford, environmentalist, said,

450
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 "You know what? Let's go."

451
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And I don't know anything about Gerald Ford,

452
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 but I just love that his action to beautify the nation caused this story.

453
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 He said, "You know what? We are going to have national parks.

454
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 "We are going to create a national park service,

455
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 "and the US government's going to buy huge parcels of land to beautify America."

456
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And everyone's like, "Yay!"

457
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I mean, because who doesn't want to go to national parks?

458
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 It is a treasure to have these giant places where you can go and enjoy nature

459
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 and drive your ATV and hunt.

460
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Oh, wait, you can't do that stuff there?

461
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Just walk around with a look at trees? That's fine.

462
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I don't have an ATV or hunt, but you have these huge, untouched, pristine parts of America.

463
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It's a great thing, right?

464
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 So anyways, he enacts this, and everyone's like on board, "Yay!"

465
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 But what they don't realize, and this is where the story starts to get really weird for me,

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 and not in a weird sort of like debunk skeptic way,

467
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 but I didn't know this would happen.

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 When the National Park Service created Cuyahoga Park,

469
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 they actually took this entire pristine part of land,

470
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 but they also took a huge chunk of these towns and said,

471
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 "This is now National Park territory. Move."

472
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 People are like, "What? They're going to go, 'Here's some money for your house?' Get out."

473
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 So, and people were like, "Uh, no, I don't like the National Park thing anymore, but it was too late."

474
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 The government owned that land.

475
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 They gave you "fair market value" for the house, and you were gone.

476
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And people would post signs around town saying, "Now we know what the Indians feel like,"

477
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 because they were getting driven off of their land.

478
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 The government was like, "This is just the way that it is."

479
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I find it weird that the National Park cut into these towns.

480
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 But what happened was, people had to leave,

481
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 and you had like other houses where people were allowed to stay

482
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 because it was outside of the zone, outside of the park.

483
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 But at these houses, basically, the government would walk up to the house,

484
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 kick everyone out, put a sign on the door that said, "No trespassing,"

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 and then go to the next house, kick everyone out.

486
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And the goal was to smash the houses down and let nature reclaim it,

487
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 so it could be part of this beautiful park.

488
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 But, the government being the government, they didn't do that part.

489
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 They didn't do part two.

490
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 So, these houses just would start to slowly fall into disrepair,

491
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 and you'd have burned out houses, some houses would catch on fire,

492
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 and you would have basically two streets of normalcy,

493
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 and then you'd go two more streets, and it would just be like a ghost town,

494
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 these derelict houses just rotting away.

495
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And that's when the conspiracy theories started.

496
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 See, people said, "No, no, no, no, there's had nothing to do with the national park."

497
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 What happened was, there was a chemical spill in the area,

498
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 and to cover it up, the government said, "Oh, no, that area is also part of the park.

499
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Everyone get out, get out. The government agents are in gas masks and stuff like that."

500
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 They're like, "Go, go, go."

501
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And people are like, "What are you talking about?"

502
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 People are slowly turning into mutants.

503
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 So, to cover it up, they added those parts of the town to the national forest.

504
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 So, that's where the conspiracies began.

505
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 For a while, it was known as mutant town,

506
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 and they believed that the no trespassing signs and all of that stuff

507
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 was to keep people from going near the chemical spill.

508
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Now, that's one of those conspiracy theories that there's no proof of,

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 but it's also one of those conspiracy theories that it would require government-level knowledge

510
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 to find out if there was a chemical spill.

511
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Do I personally think there was a chemical spill there turning people into mutants?

512
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 No, it'd be awesome, but it's unlikely.

513
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I think they probably just did buy up that land.

514
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 But, you know, it's kind of awesome to think that maybe somewhere out there,

515
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 the Colostus is walking around a national forest.

516
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Nowadays, though, people aren't too worried about mutant town.

517
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 People are worried about the mother of sorrows.

518
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 No, not a heavy metal band, it might be,

519
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 but mother of sorrows is what the local group of Satan worshipers are known as.

520
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Apparently, there's two churches in the area.

521
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 And one of them is adorned with upside-down crosses.

522
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And so people believe that church is being actively used by Satan worshipers

523
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 to try to bring the dark one back to Earth.

524
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 The upside-down cross was used in Gothic architecture.

525
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 It's actually the cross of Saint Peter, I believe,

526
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 because when they went to go kill Saint Peter, they said,

527
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 "Hey, we're going to crucify you."

528
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And he said, "Please crucify me upside-down. I don't deserve to die like Jesus did."

529
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 So the upside-down cross in Christianity represents humility

530
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 and not being as good as God.

531
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I don't think most people know about the Saint Peter idea of it,

532
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 but anyways, they're saying that that's why that church has upside-down crosses on it.

533
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Great cover story if you wore the mother of sorrows,

534
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 which again, that's a pretty badass name for a cult.

535
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 But the mother of sorrow apparently operates in this area.

536
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Now, because part of it is a national park and it does have these houses,

537
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 it would be the perfect area.

538
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 You could turn any of those houses into a trap house, sell drugs out of it.

539
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 You could turn any of those houses into a cult meeting places,

540
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 because they're basically off limits to everyone.

541
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And if you're already doing something illegal, like child sacrifices

542
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 or animal sacrifices and stuff like that, or selling drugs,

543
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 you don't care. You're not going to be like,

544
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 "Oh, I want to kill all these kids."

545
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 No trespassing. Come on, guys. Let's go to another house.

546
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 You have those legends of these worship, these Satan worshipers,

547
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 there'd be a better term for them.

548
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Satan worshipers just in general, not the actual Satanic church.

549
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 You'd have these Satan worshipers in the area.

550
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 You'd have these nefarious people.

551
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 There's a story which is one of those stories that I like.

552
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 It's actually really creepy.

553
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And then we get to the school bus.

554
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 We get to the school bus. No magic school bus.

555
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 You're not going on a ride with some red-headed teacher

556
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 traveling into people's nostrils or whatever they do on that stupid show.

557
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I never like that show. I just know that they always like fly around.

558
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Anyways, I keep wanting to say magic school bus.

559
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 It's a regular school bus sitting out in the middle of the forest

560
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 in an abandoned house.

561
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And apparently, this is one of the versions of the story.

562
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 The school bus was driving through the forest on a field trip

563
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 and a woman comes running down the street and says,

564
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 "My baby, my baby, my baby's so sick. You need to save him, bus driver."

565
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Bus driver's like, "That's a weird accent, but you know, I'm going to help.

566
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 I will help you, weird lady."

567
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 So he pulls the bus up to their house.

568
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 The bus driver goes, "Hold on, kids. I'm going to go save this other kid.

569
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 You guys, you can fend for yourselves."

570
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And at that point, a bunch of satanic worshipers creeped out of the forest.

571
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 It was a trap, you see.

572
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And before the bus driver could do anything,

573
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 they attacked the bus and they rocked it and they killed all the kids.

574
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Not just by rocking it. They went in and killed the kids, right?

575
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 There's another version of the story that this one's a little more outlandish.

576
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 That one's just theatrical.

577
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 But you figure, you know, 20 kids versus 10 sane worshipers,

578
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 it's, you know, they're not going to do very well.

579
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 This one has a single serial killer versus a bus of 20 kids,

580
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 and the serial killer hijacks the bus and kills the kids one by one.

581
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And then if you go to the bus today, you can see the image of a man

582
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 sitting in the back of the bus smoking a cigarette,

583
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 and you just see all of these dead kids staring straight ahead.

584
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 That's spooky. A spooky, spooky image.

585
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 But one human, one adult versus 20 of anything will most likely lose.

586
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 One adult versus 20 chickens, one adult versus 20 squirrels,

587
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 unless he's like gassing them.

588
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 One adult versus 20 school-aged kids, one of those kids is Dennis the Menace.

589
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 One of those kids is Bart Simpson, and that, just one of them will wreck that dude.

590
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And most likely, he can rally the other two.

591
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 I don't think one adult could kill 20--

592
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 I'm not-- wait, I'm not sure. I don't want to put this to the test, but, I mean,

593
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 if they're on a school bus, they're probably-- I'm going to get into the weeds on this one.

594
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 They're on the school bus. They're probably what?

595
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 First, second, third grade. If they're going on a field trip into the forest,

596
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 you don't take a bunch of kindergarten kids in there,

597
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 so they're probably like second or third grade, I'd say.

598
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 You'd have at least another adult on there.

599
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 One adult versus, say, 20 third graders, I don't believe could kill them all.

600
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 I just don't think that's possible.

601
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 But anyways, it doesn't matter, because neither of those stories are true.

602
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 It turns out that the guy-- the bus is real. It's actually been moved away at this point.

603
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 But the guy-- it wasn't parked by an abandoned house.

604
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 The house was being repaired, and the guy bought the school bus

605
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 so him and his family could live in it while the house was being repaired.

606
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And then they left, and the school bus just got rotted and rotted,

607
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 and then as people will do, they made up legends about the school bus.

608
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 So, you go Jason. So what's the point of this story?

609
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 You're kind of saying, you know, this, and then you're saying, like,

610
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 this is the logical answer behind it?

611
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 This is why I think this is interesting.

612
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 I think there is something behind the legends of this town.

613
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 We've talked about this before. When I talked about it, did that episode on Stole, Kansas,

614
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Ariana Grande and the Seven Gateways to Hell was the name of that episode.

615
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 That was a long time ago.

616
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And this town is known for being haunted.

617
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 This town's known for having all of this, because it doesn't-- it's not really a town.

618
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 It's more like a geographical area, but people still live around there.

619
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 They do very aggressive policing to keep people out of that area.

620
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Very, very aggressive.

621
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 They don't let people walk around late at night.

622
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 There's supposedly haunted graveyard that has, like, 24-hour surveillance.

623
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 There's constantly cops surveilling people who are out of towners coming in, looking around.

624
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And I think it's one of those things that the people of this area could actually make money off of this.

625
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 They could have haunted ghost tours, and they could be like,

626
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 "Come, we'll walk through the National Park. It's free."

627
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 But you charge them five bucks to do a walking tour of all these creepy houses.

628
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 You could turn it into a boon for the community by embracing the ghostliness of it.

629
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Because if people are already going there for free to check out this stuff,

630
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 you can find a way to monetize it and say, "Welcome to Hell Town," and, like, rename the place,

631
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 like, actually name your town Hell Town, and promote the hell out of it,

632
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 and get people there and make money.

633
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 But the residents there are actively pushing against that.

634
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Even though these legends are very widespread in the area, they try to shut them down,

635
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 and they're like, "None of this is real. Mother of Sorrows doesn't exist.

636
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Forgive me, Mother. I will pray to you tomorrow."

637
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 It doesn't exist. There's no such person.

638
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 "Please forgive me, Mother of Sorrows. I will sacrifice the cat tomorrow."

639
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And you're like, "That's a weird press conference. Why do you keep getting on your knees and whispering?"

640
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 "I'm not. I'm not."

641
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 You're casting a magical spell on you.

642
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But they should promote this stuff, because they could say, like, most haunted house tours,

643
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 you go on the haunted house tour and they're like, "Well, we might not see a ghost today,"

644
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 but, you know, just they don't have to be like,

645
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 "Oh, yes, you're a real killer. Killed a bunch of kids in there."

646
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 But you could still talk about it and become a tourist attraction,

647
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 because nearby is actually a ski lodge.

648
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And it was so funny, because as I was doing research for this, research for this show kind of sprawls out.

649
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 I started researching the ski lodge and apparently it's just a bunch of hills.

650
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 There's no mountains and people were like, "Yeah, I went here to go ski,

651
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 and Ohio doesn't have any mountains in this area."

652
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 So I was just like going down a hill.

653
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 And one of the reviews was me and my daughter were at this resort, at this ski lodge,

654
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 and the bathrooms were closed. Done, done, done.

655
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 I should play some scary music right now. This is a true scary story.

656
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Me and my daughter were at this lodge, right, and the bathrooms were closed.

657
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Apparently Bloody Mary had broken out.

658
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 It was on the loose, so they closed the bathrooms.

659
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And then all that was available was the porta-potties.

660
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Yes, the spooky, spooky porta-potties.

661
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And when I took my daughter to the porta-potties and looked out at the snow-covered hills that people were skiing down,

662
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I opened the door up with the creek.

663
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 [Groans]

664
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And there the toilet was so filled up you could actually see the poop higher than the toilet seat.

665
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 urine and feces had gathered to such a mighty amount that the smell overcame both of us.

666
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 But my daughter had to go to the bathroom so bad.

667
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 She couldn't even sit on the toilet seat without her butt touching the poop of previous people.

668
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Yes, I give this resort one out of five stars.

669
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 So TripAdvisor and all people using TripAdvisor be warned the legends of Helltown are true.

670
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 It's not just a place of ghosts and myths and monsters, but a place of poop and pee and broken dreams.

671
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 So yes, yes, the area does seem to have its problems.

672
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 I'm not going to name the resort because I don't know. I mean, that was a real review.

673
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Obviously, that's not exactly what she wrote.

674
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I'm not going to name the resort. The resort did get a bunch of other good reviews.

675
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 But the point of the story is that the area is real and it does have economic business.

676
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 That whole thing has to just go into this next thing.

677
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 It does have economic purpose. So why aren't people promoting this?

678
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Is it because the mother of sorrows is real?

679
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Is it because this group of worshipers of the dark one don't want that attention?

680
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 It's really easy to make a statement like that. I have nothing to back it up.

681
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 But human greed is a really hard thing to overcome.

682
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 It's a very, very easy excuse for why people do things.

683
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And so when someone says, "No, don't want your money," it does seem suspicious.

684
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 But who needs a little bit of tourist money when the mother of sorrows provides everything you need?

685
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
