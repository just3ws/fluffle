1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 are porn stars unwitting psychosexual vampires

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,200
 and when madness and demonic possession collide today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:17,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,000
 I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,520
 I hope you're having a great day.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,600
 Still really hot, but we're not going to go into that.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,040
 We've got some great stories for you today.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,840
 Now, I do have to say I usually lecture you guys on watching porn,

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,000
 but I'm not going to do that today because we're going to be talking about porn.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,400
 And I don't want to get bogged down with that.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,000
 And I wanted to get it out of the way right away.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,200
 I've already said it enough.

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,760
 I think you guys know my view on it, how it is health wise.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,600
 So we're going to be covering the story about our porn star,

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,760
 psychosexual vampires.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,560
 Here's a spoiler alert.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,440
 I changed my mind while I was doing my research on this one.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,960
 Changed my mind.

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,320
 Second one, second story, maybe the first story.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,320
 I don't know the order yet.

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,920
 Is about demonic possession and insanity.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,320
 You know, what's funny is that when I was growing up, I wanted to be an exorcist.

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,320
 I thought that would be the coolest job.

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,720
 Kind of travel around fighting evil.

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,960
 It's like pure evil.

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,920
 There's no gray area with demon.

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,880
 It's not like they're like, but I have a wife and kids at home.

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,720
 Like they're just a monster thing.

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,000
 But I'm not Catholic.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,960
 So, you know, that was kind of hard.

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,400
 I don't know.

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,920
 Latin, you know, couldn't really do that.

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,960
 Plus, I'd probably be really susceptible to like some hot demonic chick.

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,680
 Like I would probably be like, other priests, why don't you leave the room?

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,160
 I'll take this demon on one on one.

37
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,800
 And they're like, but sir, we should be in here.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,120
 It is Kate Upton, by the way.

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,680
 And I was like, no, no, I got this one.

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,240
 I got this one, guys.

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,720
 Here, just go.

42
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,920
 Give me like five minutes.

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,160
 I'll have this demon out of her.

44
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,120
 But yeah, so there was a couple of obstacles to me being an exorcist.

45
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
 But I always thought that'd be fun.

46
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,320
 I remember when the internet was first coming out.

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,240
 I always keep saying that.

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,320
 Like, it was this miracle as a kid.

49
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,960
 I think it's a miracle that I can just record this podcast.

50
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,840
 Every time I'm uploading it, I'm like, wow, I can do this.

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
 This is amazing.

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,840
 This technology will never cease to amaze me.

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,240
 But I found an English copy of the exorcism rights and I printed it out and I put it

54
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,720
 in a binder along with like all this other info on demons.

55
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,440
 And it's funny because like looking back on it, like I'd be any, any help against

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,800
 the grand, great architect of hell is just some chubby little college freshman being

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
 like, I'll stop you.

58
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,480
 Here, let me scroll through my binder of internet printouts.

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,080
 Take that, Balbarath.

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,800
 But you know, it's just that fantasy.

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,680
 I did watch a lot of Angel and Buffy, too.

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,520
 I'm sure that played a big part in it.

63
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,240
 I remember whenever when I watched Angel religiously, I watched both of the shows.

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
 Angel was better, by the way.

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,320
 But I remember every time I got done watching Angel, I'd be like, I should now roam the

66
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,040
 streets looking for evil.

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,360
 To both of this in perspective, I'm in my early twenties at this time.

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,200
 I'm not like some 15 year old kid.

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,960
 I was young when I watched X-Files and that got me into that like hunting monsters as

70
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,280
 well. But you know, whatever, eventually you become older and you become skeptical,

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,960
 which I think are good things.

72
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,400
 You should be skeptical.

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,680
 I don't think you should believe everything.

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,600
 I think this podcast kind of shows that.

75
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,800
 I have fun with these stories, but I don't believe everything.

76
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,600
 But again, the porn star story did change.

77
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,680
 I changed my mind in the middle of research in it, which hasn't happened during this

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,760
 podcast yet. Let's go ahead and do the demonic possession story first.

79
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,640
 It's a little heavier, so we'll get that out of the way.

80
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,920
 So there was a show, this story is back from 2010.

81
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,480
 And again, it's one of those articles that I found at the time and I was like,

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,240
 that's interesting.

83
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,400
 And I bookmarked it, but I didn't really have any outlet for sharing this information.

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,640
 It just kind of stayed in my bookmarks for about a year.

85
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,960
 So now I can share this with you.

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,280
 There was a show back then called Ugly Betty about a girl, a young girl.

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,560
 I watched a couple of episodes of Ugly Betty.

88
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,440
 That was pretty much my only experience with it.

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,160
 I did watch that other show, Jane the Virgin.

90
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,200
 But I think that might be a little racist.

91
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,320
 The only thing those shows have in common is they have a Hispanic lead.

92
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,840
 So but maybe it's a shared universe and I just don't know about it.

93
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,840
 But anyway, so this guy, this actor who was on Ugly Betty,

94
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,480
 I don't think he was a regular on the show.

95
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,480
 This young man, one night he's sleeping in his bed and God comes to him.

96
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,680
 And he goes, the young man says, is my life over?

97
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,720
 And God's like, yes, your life is over.

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,120
 And then he's like, I remembered going to the Mason Lodge earlier in the week

99
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,280
 and a guy tried giving me something and I wouldn't take it.

100
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,520
 I wouldn't take it from him.

101
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,160
 And then I was writing on the subway home and everyone started talking about

102
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
 mothers and moms and he says he felt like the knee.

103
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,480
 He felt like Neil from the Matrix.

104
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,600
 He felt powerful and he could hear people's thoughts,

105
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,400
 which I don't remember Neil being a telepath, but whatever,

106
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,640
 maybe in those other two crappy movies.

107
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,400
 And then he hears him talking about moms and mothers.

108
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,160
 He goes home and his mom's like, hey, can you go help me in the kitchen?

109
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,040
 I'm watching Ugly Betty.

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,120
 I don't know if she was doing that.

111
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
 But anyways, I'm watching Jane the Virgin.

112
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,080
 He goes into the kitchen.

113
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,680
 He looks in the pot to help her cook and he sees that she's boiling chicken.

114
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,000
 And he thinks this is a tannic ritual.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
 She's boiling these chickens as a sacrifice.

116
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,000
 So what does he do?

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,320
 Goes into his bedroom, lights some candles, grabs a dagger,

118
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
 grabs a three foot long sword,

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,120
 walks back out into the living room, begins chopping at his mom.

120
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,800
 She's screaming. The neighbors call the police.

121
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,080
 He hears the police banging on the door.

122
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,960
 He's following her from room to room, slashing along the way.

123
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,520
 And he goes, I wanted to take my time killing her

124
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,560
 because I wanted her to make things right with God.

125
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,520
 And he also said that he knew the police.

126
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,640
 God wouldn't let the police get into the house until he was done.

127
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,880
 And sure enough, that happened.

128
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,240
 The door came down after he had got done killing his mom.

129
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,880
 Now, I don't think it was because God was, you know,

130
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,240
 put his shoulder against the door.

131
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
 He had a three foot long sword.

132
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,760
 He was going to kill her when he wanted to kill her.

133
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
 Anyways, so he got arrested, obviously.

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,720
 And even in the last of the interview, he was, or the police interview,

135
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,160
 he was saying, well, she was a demon.

136
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,440
 And you don't understand that my culture believes in demons.

137
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,760
 So I mean, this is what happened.

138
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,400
 This, you know, she was possessed by demon or her voice change and all this stuff.

139
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,120
 I always think it's interesting because insanity,

140
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,280
 insanity is one of those interesting things where it preys on your belief system.

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,520
 If he's, let's say me, I'll put myself in a situation.

142
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,400
 If I'm walking down the street.

143
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,560
 And I see a little girl on the street corner wearing a all white dress

144
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,120
 with a long black hair and she's like, oh, la, la, la, la, la.

145
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,800
 She's kind of sitting there.

146
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,840
 My first inclination is going to be that's a ghost.

147
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
 That's a ghost.

148
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,680
 My second inclination is going to be I might be going crazy right now.

149
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,080
 Now, that's probably a bad example, because I'm sure little girls

150
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,320
 do stand out in the street corner and do that.

151
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,600
 But let's say like, let's see.

152
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,240
 And she was floating a foot off the ground.

153
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,200
 So it's definitely not just like a young teenager.

154
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,960
 She's floating a couple of feet off the ground.

155
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,680
 My first inclination is going to be like, that's a ghost because I believe in ghosts.

156
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,360
 I'm skeptical, but I believe in ghosts in general.

157
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,560
 My second inclination would be like, I'm crazy.

158
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,360
 I'm going crazy.

159
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,480
 Now, if I was walking down the street and I saw a shape shifting reptilian

160
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,920
 look at me and like stick his little fork tongue out at me.

161
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,880
 My first inclination is going to be I'm crazy.

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,880
 My second inclination is going to be I'm really crazy because I don't believe

163
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,160
 in shape shifting reptilians.

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,160
 I don't believe that there's reptilians walking among us, wearing

165
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,720
 business suits, that can change shape.

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,280
 I'm not saying, you know, I believe all that other stuff about aliens and stuff like that.

167
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,280
 But my first, my first inclination would be like, I'm having some sort of mental breakdown

168
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,320
 because I don't believe in shape shifting reptilians or gnomes or anything like that.

169
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,360
 The insanity praise on your belief system.

170
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,000
 He believed in demons.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,040
 It was part of his culture.

172
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,360
 He said, we believe in demons.

173
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,080
 He believed in demons.

174
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,440
 So his insanity, he believes in demons and God and the Freemasons are bad guy.

175
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,960
 The sword he had was a Freemason sword and nobody knows how he got it either.

176
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,240
 Cops think he stole it.

177
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,560
 He says he didn't.

178
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,880
 But I mean, again, he's insane.

179
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,760
 But it took.

180
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,280
 He basically, it's like gozer from Ghostbusters, where it takes.

181
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
 You choose the form of your destructor.

182
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
 He believed in these hyper religious imagery.

183
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,680
 And so when his mind began to break, it broke in that direction.

184
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,160
 So for me, it would be something like it goes like gangstalking.

185
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,000
 I don't believe in gangstalking.

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,480
 So if I start looking around and I start seeing people kind of following me, my first

187
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,800
 inclination is going to be.

188
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,200
 Someone must think that I owe them money.

189
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,000
 Somebody for me, that would be, and then if I would never go, oh, no, it's the CIA

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,040
 trying to drive me crazy.

191
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,120
 I would think someone must have mistaken me for somebody.

192
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,880
 Someone must think I owe them money.

193
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,960
 That's assuming I'm observing enough even to notice people watching me.

194
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,360
 But people who are already paranoid, who believes that the government is constantly

195
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,160
 keeping track of everybody and they start to lose their sanity.

196
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,960
 It'll break in that direction.

197
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,760
 So I think it's just, it's a tragic story.

198
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,760
 The mother died.

199
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
 He's in prison for the rest of his life.

200
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,720
 He obviously has a mental illness.

201
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,520
 You know, best case scenario is he's better now on medication, but then he has to live

202
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,640
 with the thought and those, with those images of him, you know, killing his mom with

203
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,600
 that sword and then, you know, just crazy.

204
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,880
 But I think that's, that's the takeaway on that, that your belief systems can turn

205
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,480
 against you when your brain begins to turn against you.

206
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:00,280
 Our next story is our corn stars unwitting psychic sexual vampires.

207
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,800
 And, you know, again, I start off these stories with the hypothesis that it's real.

208
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,480
 I'll always give it a fair shake.

209
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,840
 And then it almost within 10, 20 minutes of research, I will go, this is fake.

210
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,520
 And then I just find more information.

211
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,720
 Maybe it's confirmation bias, but I find more information that makes me question

212
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,320
 the veracity of the story.

213
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,520
 This one, it was on the conspiracy list.

214
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,440
 I saw it, I go, well, that's funny, but I'll pretend that it's real for the sake of

215
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,760
 research. I began looking into it and I was like, yeah, that's not really feeling this.

216
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,120
 And so the idea is, is that when you get these young women to do corn, you have a

217
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,720
 million men watching her do this.

218
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,840
 And they're watching it all times of the day.

219
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,040
 They're watching it on cornhub.

220
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,600
 They're watching, they're coming up with conspiracy theories about the all

221
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,160
 seeing eye being a butthole.

222
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,240
 And you know what's funny?

223
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,560
 Actually, while I was, while I was picking out the cover art for that episode, I was

224
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,440
 like, this does kind of look like a butthole.

225
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,480
 I know it's not a butthole because I, it was from the Renaissance era, but it does

226
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,360
 kind of look like a butthole.

227
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,040
 I was, it does.

228
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,720
 Anyway, so as I was all the, let's go back to the story.

229
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,640
 So you're, all these guys are watching these women.

230
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,160
 They're masturbating to it.

231
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,840
 And basically what's happening is their sexual energy is leaving their body and

232
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,040
 going into this young woman's psyche, even though she's separated by time.

233
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,360
 I mean, this video was shot a year ago.

234
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,320
 She separated by time.

235
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,520
 She separated by distance.

236
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,720
 She's getting all these vibrational waves pushed onto her.

237
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:38,800
 And that's why porn stars tend to get a little crazy, tend to have depression

238
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,760
 issues and they have to do, they don't have to do drugs, but they do drugs that

239
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
 cope with the issues and stuff like that.

240
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,240
 Cause they're basically getting bombarded with all of these, all of this sexual

241
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,280
 energy from across the globe, every time someone masturbates to one of their videos.

242
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:59,640
 So I saw that and I was like, okay, you know, maybe not, but, and then I thought,

243
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,600
 you know what, I'm actually going to do some more research on psychosexual

244
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,600
 energy because this, that idea has been around for thousands of years.

245
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,880
 When we look at stuff like the Kamasutra and Tantric meditation and all of this

246
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,640
 stuff, it's all about, not all about, but it's a huge part of it is.

247
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,480
 Controlling the sexual energy and releasing it in a positive way to basically

248
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,120
 build up your spirit and you abstain from sex, you indulge in sex.

249
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,880
 These are all things you do to keep your spirit, your energy flowing.

250
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,240
 And I was looking more into that.

251
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,200
 And then I started to think, we talked about this on the despair code episode,

252
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,320
 how I believe that you can manifest things into your reality.

253
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,120
 You have a positive outlook on life and you, it doesn't work all the time,

254
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,280
 but if you have a positive outlook on life, your life tends to be more positive.

255
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,680
 Now, to be fair, part of that is you're only kind of observing the positive and

256
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,400
 you're only bringing in positive information.

257
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,080
 You have a negative outlook on your life.

258
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,800
 Your life tends to be more negative.

259
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,600
 And again, that doesn't necessarily mean magic.

260
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,920
 Just means you're looking for the more negative stuff.

261
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,240
 But then another thought came to me when I walk into a room and I know this

262
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,640
 irritates people, but when I walk into a room, I try to be the positive person.

263
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,840
 Hopefully there's other positive people there.

264
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,800
 And I complain and I gripe and stuff like that, but I try to keep it under control.

265
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,280
 I try not to whine too much about stuff because I've learned something as I've

266
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,880
 gotten older.

267
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,000
 If you walk into a room in your pot, let's say everyone else in there is

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,400
 neutral and you walk into a room in your positive, the room will become more

269
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,960
 positive.

270
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,080
 You walk into a room and you're negative and you're complaining.

271
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,520
 The room will become more negative.

272
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,320
 If you walk into a room full of negative people and you're positive, it's

273
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,120
 going to piss a couple of them off, but it actually still will change the mood

274
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,960
 of the room.

275
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,600
 Your energy that you put out affects other people.

276
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,320
 And I can see that on a one-on-one basis.

277
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,560
 So I try to be a more positive guy.

278
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,880
 I try to be more lighthearted and stuff like that, which is helpful because I

279
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,120
 actually am like that.

280
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,720
 I have depression issues, nothing extreme, but, you know,

281
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,320
 this kind of the same depression issues everyone else has.

282
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,800
 Actually, you know, my depression gets kind of bad every once in a while, but

283
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,800
 it's just more of just kind of like a type of depression.

284
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,200
 Like I just want to sit at home and watch "Edley Betty" all day long.

285
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,160
 But anyway, so I mean, so I started thinking about it.

286
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,120
 I go, maybe there is something to this.

287
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,760
 Maybe there is something to this.

288
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,280
 And I found another article that stated that it wasn't just porn stars that

289
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,440
 this happens to, this happens to anyone in the public eye.

290
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,440
 Movie stars, singers, celebrity authors, whatever, politicians, is that people

291
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,480
 are constantly feeding them with positive and negative information.

292
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,400
 Positive and negative energy would be a better term for it.

293
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,480
 And if you're not psychically built for that, it can affect you negatively.

294
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,480
 Now, like I said, I'm pretty skeptical.

295
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,560
 I'm not a big fan of psychic powers in general.

296
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,600
 But I think you also just can't dismiss that we put out, we as living beings,

297
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
 put out energy.

298
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,760
 So I'm going to walk into the house.

299
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,720
 They're super grumpy.

300
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,280
 Animals will feel that.

301
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,440
 Animals will feel the grumpiness.

302
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,080
 The people will feel the grumpiness.

303
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,360
 I honestly think a lot of I've gone into houses that I felt uneasy on.

304
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,600
 And I don't think the house is haunted.

305
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,560
 I'll ask afterwards when I leave with my friend, I go, are they having

306
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,400
 marital trouble?

307
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
 And the friend will be like, yeah, they're not doing too well, because

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 you can just feel it.

309
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,760
 You can feel that energy in the house.

310
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,880
 They don't have to say anything.

311
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,600
 They can put on their best face, but it's like a battery.

312
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,320
 It charges.

313
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,000
 So if I believe that is possible, if I believe you can charge a room

314
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,920
 with positive or negative energy, why, why couldn't this happen?

315
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,080
 Why couldn't it be that when I'm masturbating, thinking about who's

316
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,360
 a porn star, Alexis, Texas?

317
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,760
 I'm showing my age.

318
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,840
 If I'm sitting and I'm thinking about Alexis, Texas, and I'm masturbating,

319
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,000
 watching her videos, I'm sending my energy out to her.

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,280
 And maybe the ones that stick around, maybe the ones who make it in the

321
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,480
 business and really succeed doing it, like a Jenna Jamison.

322
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,520
 I don't even know if she still makes movies.

323
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,280
 I think she's a producer now, but because they're built for that.

324
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,920
 And the actors who can, who can take it because they can, they're built for

325
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,760
 taking in that kind of raw psychosexual energy.

326
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,440
 Whereas the 18 year old girl, who because her boyfriend broke up with her,

327
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,120
 decides to do a double penetration scene.

328
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,400
 She now all of a sudden a million men are thinking about her all the time.

329
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,360
 They're imagining her face and her body.

330
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,120
 Even when they're not watching the video, they're obsessed with her.

331
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,800
 They're creating almost, one of the articles was even saying that we create

332
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,840
 thought forms of these people, artificial versions of these people.

333
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,880
 We're basically throwing our energy at them and they are taking it in.

334
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,200
 And she doesn't know how to deal with it.

335
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,320
 She's not a trained actor.

336
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,760
 She's not a celebrity.

337
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,280
 She wasn't built up to be this.

338
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,360
 She just shot a video and got paid $2,000 and it's out there forever.

339
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,960
 And for the rest of her life, this is going to be going on.

340
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,280
 I'm, I honestly don't know where I fall on this one.

341
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
 No, that's not fair.

342
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,720
 I do know where I fall on this one.

343
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,440
 I'm leaning towards possible.

344
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,840
 You may go, well, Jason, you, you're, you know, saying all this other stuff

345
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,080
 and you're like, oh, that's impossible.

346
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,920
 That's impossible.

347
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,360
 Ong's hat and da da da da da.

348
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,400
 But I got to be fair.

349
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,880
 I could just do be, be like, oh, no, I'm way too smart to fall for that.

350
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,600
 I'm a skeptic and but I'm not a skeptic and I got to be honest with you guys.

351
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,960
 I looking into this and I'll have all the links below.

352
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,000
 Or in there.

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,720
 I don't know if it's below because it's a podcast, but.

354
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,880
 I could see this one actually being true.

355
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,200
 I can see this one actually being true when you begin to obsess over somebody

356
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,400
 and you're giving them that psychic energy.

357
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
 I remember a long time ago when I was looking into the exorcism stuff,

358
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,560
 I was really into like researching magic as well.

359
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,120
 And there was that love spell where they was simple.

360
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,440
 This is going to sound surprisingly simple where you masturbate

361
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,360
 right before you orgasm, you say the name of the person you're thinking about.

362
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,280
 And if you do that enough, they fall in love with you.

363
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,800
 I mean, I think the I think it's more likely for you to become obsessed with them.

364
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,320
 But what if you are throwing out that sexual energy to them?

365
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,080
 And they either pick up on it and they go they reciprocate.

366
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,120
 They don't know why it's hitting their unconscious or they start to get really

367
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,440
 creeped out by you because for whatever reason, now they're having an image

368
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,680
 of you in their head that they didn't have before.

369
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,880
 As you're throwing out that psychic energy.

370
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,600
 I don't know.

371
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,160
 I don't know.

372
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,880
 I think that this could be possible, honestly.

373
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,200
 And it would be interesting if it was.

374
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,200
 Would be interesting if it was because it would allow some

375
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,800
 connection between people that have never, ever met before.

376
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,880
 But, you know, I could be wrong.

377
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,040
 I could absolutely be wrong.

378
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,160
 This is probably the one that, you know, I always go,

379
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,320
 well, if someone presents me with more evidence, I'll believe that, you know,

380
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:33,160
 the cabbage wasn't fake or I'll believe that that donkey really was a zebra.

381
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,640
 This one, someone would have to kind of.

382
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,120
 Convince me the other way and say, no, you're you're an idiot.

383
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,240
 That's not how energy works.

384
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,840
 So that's now how, you know, the people aren't psychic and blah, blah, blah.

385
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,400
 But, you know, that's just where I'm going to stand right now is that I think

386
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,880
 that it is possible that they are unwitting psychosexual vampires.

387
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,120
 They don't go out with the intention of draining you of energy.

388
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,760
 And that's the other, that's the other side effect.

389
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,160
 That's where the vampire comes from.

390
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,800
 You're putting your energy on them and it's messing with them.

391
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,040
 But it's also leaving you.

392
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,200
 That's why you feel hollow afterwards.

393
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,760
 There are certain certain fantasies or sex acts you can do that.

394
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,320
 I'm not judging you.

395
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,640
 You know what they are.

396
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,760
 There are certain sexual acts that you can do and you're like, oh, man,

397
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,000
 I that felt really good.

398
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,040
 I had a really fun time and there's other stuff that I've personally done.

399
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,280
 Afterwards, I'm like, oh, why did I do that?

400
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,480
 It was terrible.

401
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,080
 And now I feel bad about myself.

402
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,920
 And, you know, you you get over it.

403
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,640
 But I think that that may be part of it, too.

404
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,600
 That may be part of it, too, that it's actually it is draining you of that energy.

405
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,920
 And because you feel drained, you need more and it creates that feedback loop.

406
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,280
 It creates that I need more.

407
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,160
 So I'm going to do it again.

408
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,720
 I need more. So I'm doing again.

409
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,960
 One last thing I think it's interesting about sex and the brain and things like that.

410
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,600
 You can have whatever fetishes you have, but I'm going to tell you right now.

411
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,480
 This is just the way the brain works.

412
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,160
 If let's say for two weeks, maybe it's a month, I don't know, but let's say for two weeks.

413
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,240
 Every time you masturbated, which for me would be like 23 times in two weeks.

414
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,880
 But if every time you masturbated, you thought of a four leaf clover.

415
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,880
 Eventually, you would develop a four leaf clover fetish

416
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,880
 that your brain can be trained to find things arousing.

417
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,400
 If you connect pleasure with it, your brain will then begin to seek out.

418
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,840
 Seek out four leaf clovers.

419
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,520
 It's super weird how we can hack our own brain like that.

420
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,400
 I think there's better.

421
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,520
 I mean, it'd probably be better if you were like masturbating, thinking about doing your homework

422
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,240
 or masturbating, thinking about like cleaning your room.

423
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,920
 And then you're like, oh, God, I totally got to clean my room.

424
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,280
 I can't hold back anymore.

425
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
 But I mean, you could really do it about anything.

426
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
 And you can honestly do it the reverse.

427
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,640
 If there's a particular fetish or something that you don't want,

428
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,160
 you just stop thinking about it. I know that's that's rough.

429
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,720
 And I'm speaking of fetishes here.

430
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,120
 I'm not speaking about like sexuality or anything like that.

431
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,440
 But if you have a big foot fetish and you don't want a big foot fetish,

432
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,480
 just quit thinking about feet.

433
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,760
 Think about something else while you're masturbating.

434
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,840
 That's advice from Uncle Chase.

435
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,080
 But don't think about the podcast.

436
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,280
 Wait, if I masturbated while thinking about the podcast,

437
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,320
 would I then be lending my psychosexual energy?

438
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,640
 I don't think you want to know if I'm thinking about this podcast

439
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,760
 while I'm masturbating 23 times in the next two weeks.

440
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
 That actually sounds kind of low.

441
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,560
 How many times would that be a day?

442
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,680
 That's a little over one a day.

443
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,400
 Yeah, it's probably a little low.

444
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,080
 You can hit us up at Facebook.

445
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,840
 You're like, I don't want to talk to you at all after this episode.

446
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,600
 You're talking about being an exorcist.

447
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,120
 You're talking about pretending you're Angel.

448
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,640
 And then you're talking about masturbating about four leaf clovers and podcasts.

449
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,440
 But if you do, after all that, if you do want to get in touch with us,

450
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
 dead rabbit radio@gmail.com,

451
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,600
 hit me up on Facebook at Facebook.com/dead rabbit radio.

452
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,960
 We have our Twitter handle, which has my real name at Jason O. Carpenter.

453
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,880
 So we got all that.

454
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,680
 We got all that logo by Ash Black,

455
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,960
 who probably this point also doesn't even listen to the show.

456
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,320
 This episode has been shut off by a million people by now.

457
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,840
 But if you haven't, this is Dead Rabbit Radio,

458
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,120
 the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

459
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,200
 You don't have to listen to it every day,

460
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,040
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

461
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,720
 You're probably not.

462
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,200
 But we will be back tomorrow with another episode,

463
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,160
 where it's day three of our sex conspiracies.

464
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,680
 I'm having fun with this little series,

465
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,920
 and we got some other cool series coming up,

466
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,960
 along with our just regular, regular episode stuff.

467
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,320
 Well, have a great day.

468
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,960
 I will see you tomorrow.

469
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,200
 And I promise I will not masturbate until, I don't know,

470
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,240
 an hour after this podcast is done.

471
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,600
 I think that's fair.

472
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,480
 Maybe not at all.

473
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,120
 Maybe not at all.

474
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
 It's kind of hard in this heat.

475
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,000
 So we'll see.

476
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,720
 I'll talk to you guys.

477
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,440
 You guys are never going to listen to this again.

478
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:23,520
 Have a great day, guys.

479
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:33,520
 Bye.
