1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 When a group of travelers are exploring the country of Brazil, they come across the village

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,080
 that possibly hides a dark secret. And then we travel to Britain to find out the answer

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:23,840
 to the question, "Can you get possessed by a demon by eating Chinese food today on Dead Rabbit Radio?"

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:35,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carvener,

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,760
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys have a great weekend.

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
 I hope you guys have a lot of fun this weekend, whether you're just staying inside,

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
 whether you're working, or whether you're going out. I just hope it's an awesome weekend for you.

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,760
 I hope it's an awesome weekend for me as well. Let's go ahead and get started with the episode here.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,520
 Let's hop on board the Carvenercopter. We're headed off to Brazil. We're also going to be like

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,040
 walking through the jungles and stuff. So make sure you got on like your little tan outfits,

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,280
 your little Indiana Jones hats, and all that stuff. We all have whips. We're all whipping each other.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,040
 You're getting a little too into this journey. Like we're all wearing explore clothes. You're wearing

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
 full gimp suit, leather gimp suit. You're like, "I heard you're bringing whips, Jason." Like, "Yeah,

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,200
 yeah, we're talking Indiana Jones whips." That's a helicopter flying. That's not us whipping you

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,240
 a bunch. We're flying off to Brazil. Now we land. We're walking through a clearing and we're like

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,680
 chopping down bushes and stuff. We're just in someone's backyard. He's like, "No, my world-famous

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,080
 tomato plants are cutting them down." And then after we get through that, we actually go into the

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,960
 jungle and we're using machetes and we're chopping stuff. And the date is February 5th, 1923. And

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,040
 we come across a little village. Now this village's name is Hor Verde. Hor Verde. Now let

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,400
 me spell that for you, okay? H-O-E-R Verde. And I know some of you are going, "Hmm, but no questions

21
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,320
 just yet. No questions just yet." Population 600. Walking through the village, suns,

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,880
 shining through the canopy and there's like bananas on the ground and stuff. There's running water

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,680
 somewhere nearby. We can hear it. But no people. Hmm, that's kind of weird. I mean, you figure

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,200
 600 people, you're gonna see at least like a dude walking by. Maybe a baby crying, but nothing.

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,360
 So we just start kind of like going through doors. Hello? Hello? That was the biggest building. Has

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,000
 an echo. And then we go into smaller buildings. Hey, is anyone here? There's like pots and pans in

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 the kitchen and there's like a bed. We're all taking little naps. Wake up a couple hours later.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,440
 What? There's still no one in town. So then we're just standing in the middle of this village

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,760
 and then the camera pans out and it's just us standing in the village square and the camera's

30
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,720
 like going up and we get a full shot of the village. There's no one in the village but us

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,000
 and the camera pans out. Goes into the clouds. In real life, what happened was that, well,

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,880
 that's an interesting phrase in real life, but the story is this. A group of travelers, not us,

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,920
 not much any wielding maniacs and one of us wearing a gimp suit. And supposedly in real life,

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,240
 a group of travelers were traveling through Brazil. They intentionally went to the village of

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,440
 Por Verde and it was completely empty. There's no one there and they went and they called the cops.

36
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,600
 We were just kind of goofing off in town. They went and called the cops. The cops showed up

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,480
 totally empty. Still, nobody's there. And as the cops are kind of investigating it, they went into

38
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,000
 the schoolhouse. There was like a local schoolhouse and all the chalkboard was written a message.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,440
 There is no salvation. And then also in the schoolhouse was a gun, a revolver that had recently

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,320
 been fired. What's interesting about this story, and that's pretty much the whole story, is there's

41
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,680
 been a lot of theories about this, but very little, very little verification of really any of it.

42
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,520
 The people who talk about this story, because it's kind of passed around in the paranormal world,

43
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,440
 still kind of obscure though. Whole town gets abducted by aliens. There's some sort of paranormal

44
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,800
 event, aka Roanoke, where everyone just kind of disappears one day, interdimensional portal,

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,800
 time shift Mandela effect. And then skeptics go, well, you know, in that area, there are like

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,840
 guerrilla forces and the whole town could have been caught up in some big drug thing. They all

47
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,840
 owed the same drug dealer money and he's like, "Ahh!" and he just takes the whole town out.

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,480
 Or they got kidnapped for slave labor or whatever. So the skeptics go, "Well, it's probably just

49
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 guerrilla warfare. In 1923, you had like bandits running around." But really, there's another

50
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,840
 layer of skepticism to this. This town doesn't exist at all. Now this story does take place in

51
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,080
 1923. And if it did just disappear, it wouldn't exist today. But people have said, the name doesn't

52
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,440
 even make sense of the town. Verde, we know is green. But the word "hor" means something, but

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,120
 H-O-E-R, that's not a word. I mean, it is a word, but it's not a word in Spanish. It's not a word

54
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:09,680
 in Portuguese, but "hor" is basically someone who hoes stuff with a ho. So I mean, the green ho,

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,240
 the green hoeing dude, the green guy who hoes stuff, like the name of the town, logically doesn't

56
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,840
 make sense. So it's not that. It's interesting because you have the paranormal, people say aliens

57
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,360
 did it, and then you have the skeptics saying guerrillas did it. But really, the question should

58
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,880
 be, does this story exist at all? And it's one of those stories that when you find it,

59
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,920
 it's repeated almost verbatim, which makes you think that it's creepypasta or it's fake.

60
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,280
 But then there's even a more bizarre layer to this story. So you can question whether or not the

61
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,840
 town actually- you can question if the town existed or not. You can question if the town existed.

62
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,240
 Did the people really disappear from it? Or is that an urban legend? If they did really disappear

63
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,640
 from it, why did they- why did they- right? That's the most important question. Where are they?

64
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,520
 How did they disappear? The earliest- but at this point I'm kind of thinking, okay, it's an urban

65
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,280
 legend, it's viral marketing for some stupid movie, whatever. But then we just add another

66
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,800
 wrinkle on this, and this is really the end of the puzzle. So this is the last layer of this

67
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,400
 hoar onion, hoar whore or whatever. This is the last layer of the green onion. The earliest mention

68
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,560
 of this story online is not in some creepypasta book, it's not on 4chan, it's not in some

69
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,680
 wacky mysteries of South America book. It's on a Vietnamese website, which is completely bizarre.

70
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,320
 And the Vietnamese website reports it as fact. The article- it's a news website, the article is called

71
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,280
 "Missing. Mystery has no solution," which is kind of the definition of a mystery, but

72
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,960
 it's a Vietnamese news website that talks about this story. And that was in 2006, was the first

73
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,400
 time I ever found any mention of this. And they also say the story happened somewhere else's

74
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,720
 well. So now let's hop back on board the Carbonacopter, we're headed to the Congo,

75
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,480
 specifically to the Stomu Village in the Congo. So we're in the Congo, the year is now 2001,

76
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,920
 and there's a bunch of you and Relief Workers. Like quick cuts of them getting their, I don't know,

77
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,240
 they have guns probably, but they're probably lame guns, they're not American guns, they're like

78
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,640
 built by a little piece of built by each country, so they like fall apart, not like our American

79
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:54,640
 made weapons. Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-

80
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:02,320
 fight. We win, we all go to the village of Stomu, Stomu Village in the Congo. So we're walking

81
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,000
 into the village, we each have a UN Relief Worker in a headlock, giving them a noogie,

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,280
 taking off their helmets, rubbing their hair. You take that, take that peacekeeper. But when we

83
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,400
 get to Stomu Village, just like whore or whore Verde in Brazil, it's completely empty. Now this

84
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,400
 village, no animals, no people, no people that look like animals, just an empty village and

85
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,320
 we're like, what? This time they find a different message. Same, they find a message, so that part

86
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,720
 of the story is same, but it's a different message. This time the message says, run now!

87
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:42,560
 Exclamation point, it's dot, dot, dot. Now, if I'm being possessed or chased by drug dealers,

88
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,840
 or both, if I'm being chased by possessed drug dealers, I may right run now. Technically,

89
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,920
 that's a given, because that's probably what I'm doing. I don't, if I'm running and you stop to

90
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,440
 right run now, who's that message for? Is it for people who are just walking by and they're like,

91
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,560
 oh, why is the whole town just a bit, oh, run now and then they take off running too? But whatever.

92
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,760
 That I wouldn't, if a bunch of like monsters are breaking into my house, I don't think I'm going

93
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,880
 to take the time out to write, it's dot, dot, dot. Like you would just leave, right? Like why,

94
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
 even if something was breaking out your door and you're having to resendance, are you going to

95
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,960
 take the time to write dot, dot, dot? You either finish the sentence or you don't. So now that's

96
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,200
 a whole other weird angle to this. So this article is on a Vietnamese news website. If you look at

97
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,280
 the website today, it's talking about the state of union, it's talking about coronavirus. This is

98
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,160
 an article that was published back in 2006. It was kind of an article that was just kind of an

99
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,520
 overview of missing, weird missing stories. They talked about the 3000 troops that went missing

100
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,040
 in China. We covered that a long time ago. So it was kind of like an odd news story, but it was

101
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,480
 weird because that was the first reference of the Hoa Verde village incident. I couldn't find

102
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,440
 anything online before this article in the Vietnamese newspaper. And the only reference I

103
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,640
 found of the Congo missing people. So the question would be this, is it possible that some Vietnamese

104
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,280
 writer was like on a deadline and someone's like, we're tired of covering real news. You need to

105
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,640
 come up with a story about weird missing people and you got 5000 words to fill. Do it Parker!

106
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,000
 Vietnamese Peter Parker. And he's like, oh no. And he's like typing and he's like,

107
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
 well, I know the story of Roanoke because that's in this article. And I know the story of the

108
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,000
 missing battalion World War I. Oh no, I only got 4500 words. Better make something up.

109
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,880
 Missing villages in Brazil and Congo. Like why are these referenced in this article? And they're

110
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,120
 referenced kind of like, oh, you remember this story. Like, you know the story of Roanoke, but

111
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,440
 remember this story too, even though nobody remembers these stories because they never

112
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,880
 really existed before this article. It's possible that they're made up by Vietnamese Peter Parker.

113
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:53,600
 Or, you know, the option is that these stories are true. And you go Jason, if a village of

114
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,160
 600 people disappeared in 1923, I think it'd be bigger news than being published 100 years later

115
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,560
 or so on the Vietnamese website. I don't know why I keep hammering the fact that it's me. I guess

116
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,120
 the, because that just seems so out of place, right? Like you have a parent, it would be like if

117
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,880
 the New York Times ran an article on some paranormal event, which they do from time to time. They do.

118
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,280
 And it sticks out like a sore thumb. But if the New York, but if a Congo newspaper

119
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,600
 ran a blurb about a haunted inn in Sacramento, it would be even more bizarre. Or am I just,

120
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,080
 is that just some weird belief that I have? I don't know. It doesn't matter. The point is,

121
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,280
 is that it's possible that these stories are true. And that's why they were published so

122
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,720
 matter-of-factually in the Vietnamese account. Because, again, they're stated as if people

123
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,240
 who follow this stuff should already know about it. But as far as I can tell, these are the first

124
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,960
 time these stories have ever been mentioned. So is there an epidemic? I guess two isn't an epidemic,

125
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,840
 but is there a string of people just disappearing from villages? In America, we focus so much on

126
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,960
 people going missing, walking down the street, or getting kidnapped out of their houses.

127
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,440
 But it could be missing the forest for the trees. In other parts of the world, entire populations

128
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,160
 could be disappearing. And it's just kind of swept under the rug. It's so bizarre, it can't be true.

129
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,760
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Now, our next story kind of falls into that same

130
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,000
 category. Something that's so bizarre, it doesn't seem like it can be true, but this is one of those

131
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,800
 stories we have a lot of court records for. We're headed off to Britain. Let's hop on the

132
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,680
 rabbit row boat. We're going to leave the Congo. We're going to row all the way up to Britain.

133
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,880
 And it's August 22nd, 2016. So fairly recent story. We're headed to infield in north London.

134
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,720
 A posh little place, I think, I don't know, I've never been there. I only know about it because

135
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,880
 of the infield haunting, aka the big hoax that the Warrens were involved in. That's a shock, right?

136
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,160
 The Warrens, Edelorraine Warren, involved in something that turned out to be fake. I'm

137
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,000
 shocked, shocked. But anyways, infield haunting, we're not going to investigate that now. It's

138
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,240
 just as much people pretending ghosts were chasing them around, making them quote unquote

139
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,680
 levitate. There's a photo of a girl jumping, jumping off of her bed. And someone took a photo

140
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,280
 in midair and go, look, she's levitating. It's, it's funny that it lasted as long as it did.

141
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,960
 They made a Conjuring movie based on it. One of the most fake hauntings ever. But anyway, so

142
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,080
 as I'm grumbling about that nonsense, we're walking through infield, we see a house. It's a 1.3

143
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,520
 million pound house. So in real money, a million dollars, a million plus, and we see the cops.

144
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:41,600
 Oi, let us in. We got a 999 call because we don't have 901 over here. 999. Oi, let us in.

145
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,200
 And eventually the cops open the door, or they just like break the door down. Now this is recorded

146
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,080
 on body cam footage. So in the trial, they were able to view this footage. Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi,

147
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,080
 the cops are walking into the house. And there is a group of people standing around a body.

148
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,080
 There's a little body laying on a bed and these people are standing around the body.

149
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:10,400
 Now the cops are quietly, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi. The body cams are recording this. You see a man

150
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:18,000
 in this grainy police body cam footage. He is released right now in the name of Jesus.

151
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,480
 People standing around the body. They're actually saying stuff. They weren't mumbling, but no corpse

152
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:35,280
 shall be taken from this place because there is no corpse in this place. Cops are getting closer

153
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,920
 to this assemblage. We call that name back to the land of the living in the name of Jesus. Jesus.

154
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:51,120
 So flashback, just a couple days. Nine days. The IFFE family. You have a mom and a dad. You

155
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,720
 got five sons. And one of those sons is Kennedy IFFE, 26 year old young man. Now these dudes are

156
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,400
 Nigerian immigrants. The dad, Dr. Kenneth IFFE, PhD in mineral engineering. There's a photo of

157
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,720
 him meeting Queen Elizabeth. Very, very well connected family. Very, very wealthy family. So

158
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,120
 why are they chanting around Kennedy IFFE's body? Well, like I was saying, we'll go back nine days.

159
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,680
 Want to give you that little intro for the family. Going back nine days, August 13th, 2016.

160
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,880
 Everyone's still alive. Nobody's creepily chanting on body cam footage. They're out

161
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,360
 eating at a Chinese food restaurant. They're not job of the hut.

162
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:42,000
 Dude, that's one thing I miss about Sacramento is the Mongolian barbecues. Now I know

163
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,040
 Mongolian barbecues different than Chinese food, but so hungry for Mongolian barbecue.

164
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,880
 Anyways, they're at a Chinese food restaurant. Actually, they also don't have any all-you-can-eat

165
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,680
 Chinese food restaurants over here, which are also spectacular. If you haven't guessed the past few

166
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,920
 days, I'm off keto because yesterday I was talking about eating a bunch of cookies and going to

167
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,680
 Bavaria and eating a bunch of strudel. And today I'm talking about Chinese food. So anyways,

168
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,720
 forget my dietary issues. They're eating Chinese food and it's all you can eat buffet. So hungry

169
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,160
 for some chow mein. And then after the meal, Kennedy goes, "Oh, man, I don't feel so good."

170
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,160
 And everyone's like, "What'd you think? You're at a Chinese food buffet?" And he's like, "Oh,

171
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,560
 I know that, but this is different than the normal sickness that all humans feel.

172
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,160
 Eating unlimited amounts of Chinese food. My throat hurts. Oh, my stomach. Oh,

173
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,080
 they're like, that's weird. We didn't think we went to a Taco Bell. He's like, "I know,

174
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,480
 I know it's Chinese food, but it totally feels like a hundred Taco Bells rolled into one.

175
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:55,600
 And then I can't breathe. I can't breathe." Now, let's say you're out with your loved ones.

176
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,360
 Let's say you're out at a restaurant and there is a total stranger sitting next to you

177
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,480
 eating Chinese food. Okay? You're at a Chinese food restaurant. Otherwise it'd be weird if you're

178
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,000
 at like a McDonald's and a guy's eating Chinese food. But you're sitting there and he starts going,

179
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,760
 "Oh, my throat hurts. I can't breathe. Oh, my stomach." Even a total stranger, you would turn to

180
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,640
 women and say, "You want me to call 999? You want me to call the ambulance?" Because obviously

181
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,600
 something's wrong. You're having a reaction in some sort of way. Now, he could say, "No, I'm good.

182
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,800
 I'm good. You're like, "No, dude, you're totally not, but I'm going to call them anyways." This family,

183
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,520
 apparently according to all the reports that I read, do nothing. They just kind of go home.

184
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,120
 He's all turned in blue in the back seat of the cab. They just take him home. That was August 16.

185
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,560
 Now, people and the family starts to say, because this is all again court, this all was in court,

186
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,960
 families start to say, "He starts acting weird after that." Now, it could be, you know, I would

187
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,440
 be acting weird if I couldn't breathe as well, if my stomach hurt and I couldn't breathe. But he

188
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,000
 was acting a little more weird because we're going to jump ahead to August 18th. So now,

189
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,240
 five days have passed since his meal at the Chinese food restaurant. And he starts to act by all

190
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:24,960
 definition like a possessed man. It's coming. Six, six, six. It's coming. The mark, the mark,

191
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,480
 the mark is on us all. The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire. And they're like, "Okay, this guy's

192
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,920
 definitely acting weird." Demonically possessed. Now, let's back up again here. This family,

193
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,800
 that's super well connected, that's super wealthy. One of the groups they're connected to is the

194
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:49,600
 Jesus Sanctuary Ministries, which is a church that's some of the area likened to a cult. Now,

195
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,200
 I haven't done a lot of research on Jesus Sanctuary Ministries myself, but that's kind of was the

196
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,560
 view of members of the court and members of the community. These people had some weird,

197
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,080
 religious beliefs. So now you're kind of getting that full picture of when you're eating Chinese

198
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,600
 food and all of a sudden you can't breathe, maybe that's God's will that you should stop

199
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,920
 eating Chinese food. Maybe it's that this guy's possessed. Not that he has a medical problem,

200
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:23,360
 but a demon has infused him. So Kennedy Ive, the mark of the beast, and then he starts going,

201
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,680
 "Now you're like Jason, okay, is this basically, is this story about a guy who ate bad Chinese food

202
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,000
 and died a couple days later and you're just stretching it out super long and you're adding

203
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,560
 in the 666?" No, no, I'm not. So that all is just kind of weird, but then it gets really bizarre.

204
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,840
 He starts walking around the house and he'd be like, "You're like people of the I family would

205
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,440
 just be hanging out in the living room." Because that's what you do. One of your family members

206
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,120
 is possessed, right? You think one of your family members is possessed, you're not willing to take

207
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,760
 them to the hospital to find out if there's something wrong with them. You're just watching

208
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,600
 TV, you're watching Love Island, and Kennedy walks in and he's like, "Oh, my stomach." And they're

209
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,680
 like, "Not again with the stomach. Come on, they're eating more Chinese food. They're like,

210
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,960
 "Do you want some more Chinese food?" He's like, "Bleh." I think I got...

211
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:16,400
 I mean, it's bad enough. Imagine it's all bad enough, like you get food poisoning eating at a

212
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,360
 restaurant, you never want to eat there again. But then you're like, "Your family does." Which is

213
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,760
 kind of a jerk family. But if you get possessed by a demon at a restaurant and they're still eating

214
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,400
 the food, that restaurant's still even open. There's something wrong with society. But anyways,

215
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,320
 he walks in the living room, they're all eating Chinese food. He's like, "Ugh." And he starts

216
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,560
 complaining that there's a seed in his stomach. He can feel like a seed growing inside of him.

217
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,520
 He falls down on the ground. "My stomach, I can feel it inside of me. It's hard." Like a giant

218
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,000
 sunflower seed. "I can feel it inside of me." Now, again, that's concerning, right? But it's only

219
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,320
 even five days since he ate Chinese food. So you're thinking maybe he just has a really bad case of

220
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,680
 food poisoning. But then he starts walking around knives. So at this point, you should be like,

221
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,080
 "This isn't food poisoning, right? It's possible this guy's having some sort of mental breakdown of

222
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,120
 the MSG, like messed with his head. It's possible that he was possessed by a demon by eating too much

223
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,680
 Chinese food. Would it be a Chinese demon? Or is that just racist to even think? Or would it be like

224
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,000
 an Italian Latin demon, like a classical demon? Or would it be like a Chinese demon who like

225
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,320
 sucked the blood out of your butthole? Actually, I think that's a Japanese demon. But anyways,

226
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,480
 my point is that would it be a demon related to the food that you ate? Because otherwise,

227
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,560
 I would only eat Italian food. Because the Latin demons seem to be cooler than the Native American,

228
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,080
 like, "Oh, I'm a coyote. I pull tricks. Lame." And then the Japanese demons just suck blood out

229
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,160
 your butthole. And I'm pretty sure there's a Chinese demon that does the same thing. No thanks.

230
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,440
 At least the Latin demons give you like fame and power. The other ones just like give you

231
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,320
 hymroids. Where it was like, "Oh yeah, yeah. So anyways, this guy starts walking around. Kennedy

232
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,000
 starts walking around knives complaining about seeds in his stomach and in the mark of the beast.

233
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,040
 And he can't breathe. And they still don't take him to the hospital." And then he says, "Oh,

234
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,920
 that's it guys. The seed, it's opening up. It's opening up." Which would basically ruin your

235
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,040
 afternoon. Like, it's already bad enough that your brother or your son is possessed by a demon.

236
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,560
 But now when he's talking, "Oh, here it comes, guys. Here it comes." And you're trying to watch

237
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,880
 television or finish your Chinese food. Trying to open your fortune cookie. And he's saying,

238
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,640
 "Oh, I can feel the seed opening up. It's breaking inside of me." And then he gets his knife out

239
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,320
 because the demon is in his penis. And he has to chop it out before the demon rips his penis in

240
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:51,200
 half. So they still don't call the cops. And they still don't take him to the hospital. He's now

241
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,160
 saying there's a demon that hatched out of a seed and it's inside of his penis and he has to chop

242
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,280
 it off. The next day, August 19th, they don't do anything yet. His dad's walking around the house.

243
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,160
 "Hey, Kennedy, why are you carrying that knife? Oh yeah, I forgot. You're possessed by a demon.

244
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:11,520
 There's a monster in your genitals." And Kennedy bites his father. And then

245
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,400
 pulls his pants down and puts the knife to his own penis and threatens to cut his dick off.

246
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:24,160
 So now the family goes, "Okay, this has gone on a little too far." So they go to a church, of course.

247
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,560
 Now, you can believe, definitely, but I would also have him go to jail or mental hospital and

248
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,160
 talk to a priest. But anyways, they go to the priest and the priest goes, "Got to do an exorcism,

249
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,480
 bro." Like, this is what happened. He ate some Chinese food. He got a demon in him. The demon

250
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,280
 hatched. Then it's in his penis. There's no debate that none of this is true. Like, basically, it's

251
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,840
 like, yeah, what he's explaining is actually happening. You got to tie him down. You got to do

252
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,520
 an exorcism. Family has to stand around him. Pray, pray, pray. Don't let him up. Now, that's what they

253
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,400
 do. Now, I think you can start to do the math here. This happened on August 19th. He bites his dad,

254
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,520
 tries to cut his dick off. They go to a priest. The priest says to do an exorcism on August 19th.

255
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,000
 On August 22nd, the cops are coming through the door. For three days, no food, no water, tied to

256
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,640
 a bed, writhing, and also possibly suffering some sort of physical illness, because this was very

257
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,600
 quick. August 13th. By August 19th, he's tied to a bed. So he could have had some sort of horrible,

258
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,120
 okay, to be fair, there is no flu where you're like, "Oh, I got a headache. I feel a little sick.

259
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,680
 I want to chop my penis off." You know, the normal symptoms. Like, he could have had the start of a

260
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,840
 flu, could have been possessed by a demon. Who knows? But the fact of the matter is, family does

261
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,680
 nothing, but pray over him for three days. They don't feed him. They don't give him any water. He

262
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:50,880
 needs to get weak for the demon to leave, and he dies. Now, they called the cops. They look at

263
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,640
 this guy, their son, their brother, and they go, "Well, he's dead. Let's call the cops, but let's

264
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,800
 also try to bring him back to life." So when the cops come through the door, they're actually still

265
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,440
 praying over him and believing their prayers can bring him back to life, which, unfortunately,

266
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,720
 is not the case. Kennedy Ife, dead at 26 due to starvation, malnutrition. That sucks, because

267
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,200
 if you think about it, his last meal was Chinese food from a buffet that was possessed by a demon.

268
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,240
 Like, that was his last meal. He wasn't eating out. He wasn't like, "Oh, I think I have a demon in my

269
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,600
 penis, but I really want to get this foot long from Subway." Actually, I'm sure that he did eat

270
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,440
 between that. Otherwise, he would have died sooner, but who knows? Who knows? Anyways, the point is,

271
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,800
 is that exorcism gone wrong. Cops start investigating this. Now, they make the ties to the local

272
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,320
 church. They find a book called "Anger, Madness, and the Demonic," and the British police, the

273
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,160
 prosecutor, the crown, is basically thinking that they were trying to pull some sort of satanic

274
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,680
 ceremony. They're not really going with the "These are legitimate members of a religion. These people

275
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,200
 are part of some weird cult. This was something that they had planned. They were arrested. All of

276
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,960
 them were arrested and charged with manslaughter, false imprisonment, and death of a vulnerable adult."

277
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,400
 Which is interesting, because generally that means somebody who is mentally incapable,

278
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,800
 someone who has a physical disability. These articles didn't specify that. It could be he was

279
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,560
 vulnerable just in the last stages of his life. It's just weird. Normally, that would be like

280
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,880
 if you took advantage of someone who was deaf or blind or mentally disabled. That's a vulnerable

281
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,760
 adult. An old person, a super elderly person, that would count as well. Anyways, they all get charged

282
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:44,400
 on these charges. Trial goes, 2016. They're all arrested. Now, remember, they admit to this stuff.

283
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,920
 I guess you can see where this is going. They admit to this stuff. They said that he was possessed

284
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,760
 by a demon, a demon in his penis, tried chopping it off. They didn't go to the cops. They went to

285
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,120
 the priest. The cops walk in. They call the cops. The cops walk in while they're trying to resurrect

286
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,920
 this kid. There is no debate about the sequence of "they weren't like, 'What? No, I just came home.'

287
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,720
 And someone else was exercising him. And when we got here, they ran out the back door. It was a

288
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,520
 bunch of other people. It was a bunch of other people. It wasn't us. We're the good people."

289
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,400
 They admit it's all this. 2019, everyone's acquitted. Everyone gets off with absolutely

290
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,880
 no jail time. Now, they might have been in jail during the trial, but I don't even think so.

291
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:31,680
 Nothing. That's weird, right? That's a bizarre ending to the story. No, they—it was manslaughter.

292
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,160
 They tied this guy up for three days and prayed over him and never contacted

293
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,400
 any authorities. You could go, "Well, Jason, you know, like Christian scientists in America,

294
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,160
 or, you know, they're all over the world, but Christian scientists don't believe in medical

295
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:51,840
 stuff, you know, like blood transfusions. So, is it religious freedom versus the law?" Well,

296
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,640
 really, yeah, that does happen. And they get charged for it. If you refuse to give your kid

297
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,520
 a blood transfusion, you can get charged for it. You can go to jail. And America has religious

298
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,040
 freedoms, a lot of other parts of the world. And I don't know what Britain's religious freedoms

299
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,920
 are, but a lot of other parts of the world that doesn't—that doesn't qualify. And even in America,

300
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,880
 where that's the First Amendment is the freedom of religion, you can still get charged for practicing

301
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,920
 your religion if it causes the death of somebody else. Which makes me think this. How well connected

302
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:30,560
 was this family, really? How wealthy were they? The photo with the queen? This sounds impressive.

303
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,360
 I mean, she's not Barry Bonds at a baseball card convention. It's not like you can just walk up to

304
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:43,040
 her, give her 20 bucks and take a photo with her. But I would have assumed that either you're super

305
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,680
 famous and you hang out with the queen, or one day you just happen to—if I—there was a photo of me

306
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,840
 standing there next to Ryan Reynolds. You wouldn't think that I could then pick up the phone and be

307
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,000
 like, "Yo, what's up, our dog? When we hanging out?" You would think, "Oh, he must have just caught

308
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,080
 him at a opportune moment." So, I didn't really put any—when I read that about him taking the

309
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,240
 photo with the queen, I was like, "Oh, well, okay, souvenir shop. It's a cardboard cutout."

310
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,000
 This guy was—I won't say that he was murdered, but it definitely was manslaughter. And they had

311
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,440
 all these other charges just in case the manslaughter one wouldn't fit. They could go, "Well,

312
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,600
 maybe we'll get false imprisonment." None of these charges stuck, which makes me think how well

313
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:27,520
 connected was this family. How well connected are they today? Is it possible that they use their

314
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,280
 connections to say, "Hey, listen, can you make these charges go away?" You know, it's a tragedy

315
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,840
 that my son passed away, but putting me in my family in jail is not going to help. Can you

316
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,600
 make a couple phone calls to get these charges dropped? Someone goes, "Yeah." These phone calls

317
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,960
 start getting made. Trial goes on, but in the end, behind the scenes, everyone knew how it was going

318
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,480
 to play out. Sounds pretty likely, honestly, because those are hard charges to dodge, especially

319
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,920
 when everyone's kind of admitting to the sequence of events. The motive really would have been the

320
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:11,360
 question. But the bigger question is this. Was it the Chinese food that put the demon inside Kennedy?

321
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,360
 Was it—well, I guess the question is, was Kennedy possessed? But let's assume,

322
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,600
 for the sake of this story—because he could have just been having a mental breakdown,

323
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,360
 and that's tragic—but let's assume, for the sake of the story, being paranormal, that

324
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,920
 he was possessed by a demon. It wasn't mental breakdown. It wasn't bad Chinese food. Well,

325
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,480
 it was bad Chinese food. It was basically him getting possessed by a demon because he ate food.

326
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,160
 It really opens up a whole can of worms, or a can of chow mein, because the question is this.

327
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,520
 I'm sure a lot of people ate Chinese food at that restaurant that night. I—okay,

328
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,360
 no, no. Before I go on with this, I want to assure you I have not lost my mind. But again,

329
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,040
 let's follow this thread, or let's follow this noodle. I got a hundred of these. If a bunch of

330
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:07,280
 people ate Chinese food at that restaurant that night, and—oh, dude, check this out. Okay, check

331
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:14,960
 this out. The Chinese food restaurant. The food is infested by demons, this particular restaurant,

332
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:24,240
 right? And that night, everyone got possessed by a demon. But Kennedy was the only one who was strong

333
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,280
 enough to fight back. Kennedy was the only one who could feel the transformation taking part inside

334
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:40,880
 of him. Maybe he was the one who knew what was going on and was trying to stop it, while his family

335
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,400
 were the ones who were possessed and had no idea that they were possessed.

336
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,440
 If they all ate at the same restaurant, shouldn't they all be possessed?

337
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,680
 How many other people were at that restaurant that night, eating that food?

338
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,040
 What if demons had found another way instead of using Ouija boards or Charlie Charlie?

339
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,200
 They found a way to enter our food supply. We wouldn't be looking at demonic possessions,

340
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,200
 we'd be looking at demonic infestations. And it would be the perfect way to take over.

341
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,720
 Because then you wouldn't have a father call someone up, an old business partner, and say,

342
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,640
 "Hey, could you help me get out of this bind?" You would just have that father say to his old

343
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,840
 business partner, "Hey, I'm in some trouble right now. How about we go out to dinner,

344
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,640
 my treat, and we'll discuss how you can help me take care of this situation I'm in."

345
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,680
 And the implication is that they went to the Chinese restaurant. That was the implication.

346
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,320
 What if everyone who eats at this restaurant is possessed by a demon?

347
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,760
 And that's how they were able to dodge the charges. And those people are slowly taking

348
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,000
 over Britain and then eventually the world. So the next time someone invites you out to a

349
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,200
 "all you can eat Chinese buffet," be a little suspicious. They may not be trying to get you

350
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:13,280
 stuffed full of egg rolls and pot stickers. They may be trying to get you stuffed with the demonic

351
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:21,760
 entity inside of you. And a few days after eating that oh-so-delicious meal, you find yourself standing

352
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,800
 in the bathroom with a knife ready to chop off your own penis.
