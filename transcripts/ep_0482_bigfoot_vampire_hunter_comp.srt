1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 When a man has a coughing fit, no one expects a tumor to pop out of his mouth.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 We travel back to the Civil War to take a look at a time when soldiers may have been blessed by an angel.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 And then we take a look at a bizarre story involving a shepherd, his family, and a murder hiding in the woods.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Is the murderer Bigfoot or something far more sinister today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so we're gonna get started right now.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Amalia. Amalia, thank you so much for supporting the show.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Really, really is awesome. You are going to be our pilot, our captain this episode, and I'm sending you out a sticker.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just hope you get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 We also have a merch store, and join us on the Minecraft server. That's always fun playing.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I'm gonna be taking a pretty long vacation soon. I'm actually recording my episodes in advance right now.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I'm actually gonna have three weeks where the episodes are gonna still be playing. I'm gonna have new episodes coming out.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But I'm recording them all in advance. When I'm on actual vacation for three weeks, it'll be the longest vacation I've taken since I started this show.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 It'll be fun, and you guys will have episodes. I think we'll have one week of repeats, but everything else should be fine.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 So, Amalia, let's go ahead and hop inside that Dead Rabbit Roadboat. We are gonna start off by rolling all the way from Oregon to China.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 [Sigh]

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Probably should have picked a better vehicle, but we'll get there eventually.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 We're headed back to the year 2019. It's March 2019. We're in Hunchun County. That's in the Hu Bai province in China.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And we get out. Our arms are super muscular. Errrr! From rowing all the way from America to China. We're walking around. We're super buff.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 But we're not here to like push people over. We're here. We put on our lab coats to be doctors. We're just super muscular doctors.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And when we get to China, we're gonna walk around China a bit. We're going to this dude's house. Now, we don't have his name.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 This is a medical case. They don't really reveal people's personal information. When it comes to these types of cases, we'll just call him Michael.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Michael is a 63-year-old man. We're gonna walk in to his house. We're super rude. We don't even knock. He's like, "Ugh!"

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 He's shocked. But then we put on our invisibility cloaks and he just thinks he was having an illusion.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 He has actually worse problems and a bunch of strangers appearing in his house. Michael is sitting in his house and starts...

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 [Coughing]

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Trying to clear his throat. Something's wrong. He can't figure it out. But he's not gonna go to the doctor, right?

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 [Clears throat]

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 He's just gonna work. He's just gonna work it through, right?

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And then one day, he's dealing with this throat issue, but one day, he gets super drunk. Way more than a normal human drunk, right?

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 But he's just, you know, dealing with it. He has this lump in his throat. He just figures that maybe he is always nervous.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 So he also, on top of that, he seems to have a serious drinking problem because one day he gets, according to my notes, super drunk.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I don't know what the difference is between being drunk, very drunk, and super drunk, but for some reason I wrote down super drunk.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 So let's imagine it is Kryptonian levels of alcoholism. He ends up going to throw up because he's not a Kryptonian.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 He drank as much as Superman, but he's not Superman. He goes to throw up and he feels a horrible pain in his throat.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 [Groans]

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And then he feels it. He feels it at the top of his throat.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 He feels a chunk of meat.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Sorry, Amalia. Amalia, seriously? She's in the corner.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Why did I have to be on this episode? We're holding her hair back. Sorry, Amalia.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 He feels a chunk of meat in his throat. He tries to cough it up and it's stuck. It's stuck in his throat.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Just telling the stories. I feel like something's stuck in my throat.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 He's trying to cough it up. He can't. He reaches into his mouth.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 He feels it. He says it's about five inches long. He starts to tug on it.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 There's something in his mouth that shouldn't be there.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Something gross and slimy. And he's like, "That's weird. I didn't eat a Taco Bell yesterday. I remember getting drunk."

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 But I don't remember eating a chalupa. And he's pulling it. He's pulling it and it pops out.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 It pops out of his mouth. And he said it looked like a longed, forked tongue.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And it's actually now hanging out of his mouth. So what do you do?

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 You're coming down from a insane drinking binge.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 You're thankful that you need Taco Bell. So you're like, "Oh yeah, that's fine."

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 But, and you have like a piece of meat sticking out of your mouth.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 He can't, he's yanking it. He's trying to pull it. It won't pop out.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So he does the next alternative, right? He does the next best thing.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 He pushes it back into his throat. He begins drinking a bunch of water. He's like poking at it.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I imagine he gets like a plunger. Eventually it goes back into his throat.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I'm sorry for my remaining listeners. I'm sorry.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And then, then he goes to the doctor, right?

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Because it's one thing to have like a lump in your throat in a couple days, whatever.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 But when it comes out and you can actually look at it and you can feel it, how slim it is, he goes to the doctor.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 The doctor looks in there. "Doctor, I'm assuming doesn't believe him at first."

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 He's like, "And then Doc, after my incredible drinking binge, something came out of my body."

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 The doctor's like, "Let's run a couple tests on your liver before you take a look at this quote-unquote forked tongue in your mouth."

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 After they basically flesh his liver. It was a tumor.

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 He had a benign tumor that had been growing in his throat and it was getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And then one day he coughed it up and panicked and he pushed it back in and they did take it out.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 He doesn't have it anymore. They took out the tumor. As far as we can tell, Michael is totally fine.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 He may still have a drinking problem. Hopefully not. Hopefully he's like, "I'm swearing off liquor."

69
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 But, but interesting little note here. It was a benign tumor.

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 He said it was like a long forked tongue. What if...

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Alien hybrid, right? He's a half reptilian.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 That's why he could drink. Maybe he really is from Krypton. That's why he could drink so much.

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 So Michael, hopefully you're not the first wave of an alien invasion.

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Hopefully you were just a man with a benign tumor in your throat.

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 And hopefully you are now... Maybe you're just having a drink after work instead of getting quote-super drunk.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 But disgusting story. Disgusting story. And I just want to share that with you.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 That one had actually been in my notes for a long time. It's one of those stories that I was like,

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 "Well, I could tell it, but a lot of people will probably get disgusted by it."

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 It was one of those stories. Amalia, are you ready to take off? She's nodding her head.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 She'll be anywhere but this story. Let's go ahead and hop in the carbonar copter.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And you see me with a little thing in my pocket. Amalia is like, "Is that the tumor dude?

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Are you bringing that guy's tumor with me?" I was like, "What? I keep mementos from all my stories."

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I'm holding the tumor. I'm all... swallowing it. Tastes like benign.

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Let's go ahead and leave behind China. We're in the carbonar copter now.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 We are flying out to old, timey America. We're going back to the time of the Civil War.

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 You know, it's funny. When I first started doing this podcast, if you had told me I would do a lot of Civil War stories

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 and a lot of Bigfoot stories, I'd been like, "Nah." But it turns out that's the case, right?

88
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So as we're flying out over the Civil War, we're flying specifically over to Shiloh, Tennessee.

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Let's put on our Union outfits. Let's put on our blue outfits. Put on our little hats on.

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Because we're going to join the Union in this fight against the Confederacy.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 The helicopter's flying. It morphs. Now it's like gray scale.

92
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And it looks like an old, timey helicopter. It looks like a heliotrope or whatever you used to call it.

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It looks like one of the Da Vinci's machines. We're flying over the battlefield in old, timey fashion.

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 It's April 6th, 1862. We're in Shiloh, Tennessee. We're flying over this... It's not a battlefield yet.

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 The Union troops are just kind of hanging out in the area. And unbeknownst to them, we see 40,000 Confederate troops headed towards them.

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 How does 40,000 of anything sneak up on you? But the Union, apparently they're all napping at the same time.

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 40,000 people come over the hill. There's a massive battle. It's the Battle of Shiloh.

98
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 It goes from April 6th to April 7th. Union and the Confederacy.

99
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 [mimics gunfire]

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 We're shooting at each other. Cannonball's going everywhere.

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Within these two days of battle, 16,000 wounded.

102
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And they're just like laying there. "Oh, I got shot in the stomach. Buh! Buh!"

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 "I'm going to pull out that little tumor. I'm going to stick it in the wound. You'll be okay."

104
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Now, for the other 15,999 people, I need more tumors. Stat!

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Doctors like, "What? He's just holding two saws?" He's like, "No, I'm just going to cut these people up."

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 "Okay, but if I can get more tumors, I can patch up all these bullet holes."

107
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 There's a deal with a cannonball in his stomach. I'm like, "We're going to need a bigger tumor for that one."

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 But anyways, what happened? This is very interesting. So you got people laying in the mud. They're all shot up and stuff like that.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 It's 16,000s a lot. So it's not like, you know, it's going to take a while.

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I think even modern medicine, it would take a while to treat 16,000 wounded.

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Now, some of them just were like, "Ah, I got a splinter in my hand when the gun did that."

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Some of them were grievously wounded. Some of them were like, blown up and had like, missing limbs.

113
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And other people were just like, "Ugh, I drank too much sassaparilla and it's making me gassy."

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 "I'm just going to lay down in this mud for a while." So you had a whole gamut of injuries.

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 But what happened was they were treating people that first night, right?

116
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 There's a battle that starts on April 6th and then the sun sets.

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And you have people who were shot were just kind of laying in the mud, laying all over the battlefield.

118
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And it takes time to get to these people, but some of the people were laying in the mud and they're bleeding.

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 They're trying to hold their blood. They're trying to hold their body parts in.

120
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And they look and the ground is glowing around them.

121
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 They're like, "What in tarnation is this?"

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And then they notice that their wounds are glowing too.

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 [Metallic sounds]

124
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And you'd have the doctors, medics come out and find the people, bring them back to where they can treat them.

125
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 The doctors are also seeing these people with glowing wounds.

126
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And they started to notice something. There's 16,000 people dead.

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 The people who had glowing wounds, they survived for when they were more likely to survive.

128
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 If they did survive, they healed faster.

129
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And there was no gangrene, which really is what got you back then.

130
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 The little metal fragment going through your body.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 That will kill you.

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 But if it doesn't kill you instantly, a lot of times it was the gangrene, it was the infection.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 These people who were glowing didn't get gangrene.

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 They survived. They tended to survive better and they healed really quickly.

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 But not everyone was glowing in the battlefield. That would suck if you're laying there and you're not glowing.

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Everyone else around you is glowing and you're like, "Oh, I feel left out."

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 They're all making fun of you. They're all dead.

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 "Dead guy."

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 "Dead guy." You're like, "Oh, you're right. I am dead."

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Now, this was like an old Civil War story. They called it "Angel's Glow."

141
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And no one really knew what to make of it.

142
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It was written down in the contemporary accounts of the time.

143
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Battle of Shiloh, a couple of soldiers were glowing.

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 It was just like a... They didn't really know how to classify it.

145
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Was it like a fairy tale? Was it a folk legend? Who knows?

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 In 2001, two teens in the area decided to do this experiment.

147
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Billy Martin and John Curtis decided to look into this old, tiny case.

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 What was this? Was this real? Was it a miracle? What was it?

149
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 What they did was they took a bunch of samples of the soil around the battlefield of Shiloh.

150
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 What happened? Part of... These are the...

151
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 It turns out to be a real thing, but it needed to have certain things going on.

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 One, it was really cold. It was April 6th and April 7th. It was really cold that time of year.

153
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 So a lot of them got hypothermia, which just slowed down disease overall.

154
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 But in the soil of Shiloh, there is actually a bioluminescent bacteria

155
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 that's attached to flatworms, which are all over that area.

156
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 When the bacteria got into the wound, it basically stabilized it.

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 It allowed no gangrene to go there.

158
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So you needed not only the really, really cold weather,

159
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 but you also needed this bacteria present.

160
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And there was just the flatworms all over the dirt,

161
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 and they probably got tired of the war going on.

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 They're like, "Well, it's flat. I mean, the cannonball is going to roll over it

163
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 and going to make it more flat."

164
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 They probably didn't carry their way.

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 That, and they're not super sentient.

166
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 But the idea is you needed the super cold temperature and the bacteria,

167
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 the bioluminescent bacteria that's attached to the flatworms,

168
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 with both of those elements together, depending on where you were at in that battlefield,

169
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 depending on whether or not you got enough of that glowing bacteria in your wounds to save your life.

170
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It would be a thing like if you were laying there and you saw your buddies glowing,

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 you may want to scoop up some mud and rub it all over your wound.

172
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 I wouldn't necessarily recommend that in all cases.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 But it turns out that there actually is a scientific reasoning

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 for why these soldiers weren't dying of normally fatal wounds.

175
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 They just happened to get shot in the right spot.

176
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Not like, "Shot in your liver as opposed to your heart,"

177
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 but they fell in the soil where there was a lot of these worms,

178
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 where other people may have been shot in the shoulder and were sitting up,

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 and they weren't laying in the mud and it wasn't getting this,

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 the right amount of bacteria in there, the good bacteria,

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 and then they would die of gangrene in their shoulder.

182
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Very, very bizarre story.

183
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 A mystical legend that actually has a scientific explanation.

184
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So thank you Billy Martin and John Curtis for letting us know the secret to the Angel's Glow.

185
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I wonder if, like modern medics, they should have a little pack of mud.

186
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Someone's like, "Medic! Medic!"

187
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And there's some guy running across the battlefield and he starts throwing mud on GIs.

188
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And they're like, "Oh, yes, yes."

189
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And then their skin looks so nice and they have that glow.

190
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And they're ready to go.

191
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 I wonder if they've been able to package--

192
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I patent that. I patent that idea, dude.

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 DARPA, don't take that.

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I patent--packs a mud from Shiloh. Don't--don't do that.

195
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I mean, do it, but give me credit. I want a penny for every ounce of mud.

196
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 But Amalia, let's wave goodbye to those two young kids, Billy and whatever the other dude's name was.

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 I put my notes away. Bye dudes.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 John--he's--he's wiping away his tears, I forgot his name.

199
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Bye Billy, bye John.

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 We're saying goodbye to them. I've left behind my lucky tumor,

201
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 but I don't think we're gonna need it. We're actually headed out to Kyrgyzstan.

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 The year is 1990.

203
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 [mimics helicopter sounds]

204
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Helicopter, we're back.

205
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 We're no longer an old-timey helicopter, we're the sleek, battle-hardened,

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 carpenter-copter that you all know and love.

207
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 We're flying out to Kyrgyzstan.

208
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Now, this story is from a--

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 originally it was published in a newspaper called Literature Kyrgyzstan.

210
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Every source I found of this story online--

211
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I originally saw this and think about it docs.com, but then I look for other references.

212
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 They all repeat the story verbatim, which generally makes it suspicious.

213
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 But, let's take a look at this story. Let's pretend--let's pretend this story is 100% accurate.

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I think it's an interesting one.

215
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Molly, let's bring that carpenter-copter nice and low.

216
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Flying over the beautiful hilly landscape of Kyrgyzstan.

217
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Once we land, we're gonna meet a shepherd.

218
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 He comes out, "Hey, people, I'm coming for--

219
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 apparently I sound like Santa Claus for some reason."

220
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 We're like, "Hey, I'm sitting on his lap."

221
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 You're like, "Jason, get up. It's not really Santa Claus."

222
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 "My name is Omusha. I am a shepherd."

223
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 As you can tell from this flock of very loud sheep behind me.

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Here is my beautiful wife, and my young son is in the house.

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 He's playing Nintendo 64.

226
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 But, let's know why you're here.

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I know why you're here. You're here to talk about the monster on the rock.

228
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And so, here's the story that's been going around through this newspaper article,

229
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 "Kyrgyzstan, Literature Kyrgyzstan."

230
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Out in the middle of Kyrgyzstan, you had Omushu, his son, and his wife.

231
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And they're eking by. It's not the most lucrative business,

232
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 but, you know, a shepherd's gonna do what a shepherd does.

233
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 He's gonna shepherd.

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And he has a bunch of sheep, takes them out in the pasture, lets them eat,

235
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 throws them in at night, puts them in the fence, goes home,

236
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 kicks his feet up, and dreams. Counts sheep.

237
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Counts sheep literally falls asleep on the job all the time.

238
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 But one day he's sitting there. He's out in the pasture.

239
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And he hears his wife, "Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!"

240
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And he's like, "That's weird. Normally she only makes that sound when I'm with her."

241
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 He turns around and he sees her panicking, pointing up at a rock,

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 a massive rock that overlooks the pasture.

243
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And he follows her finger up to the rock,

244
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 and he sees on top of the rock a massive hairy creature staring down at them.

245
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Once he got the attention of Omushu, it jumps off the rock and runs into the forest.

246
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And the wife goes, "Listen, I don't ask for much from this marriage, okay?

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I knew what I was getting into when I married a shepherd, but please, that is too far."

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Like, I didn't think when I took the vows that there would be a monster involved somewhere.

249
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Can we leave? And Omushu goes, "No, look at this. It's so beautiful.

250
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Look at all these sheep are grazing peacefully.

251
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 I mean, sure, yes, you do have the occasional eight foot tall monster on the rock,

252
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 but I will go hunt it. You know, I'm good at two things.

253
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Sheeping and shooting. So he walks into his house, he gets his rifle.

254
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So it's always at the ready.

255
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Now, he does go out into the woods a couple of times.

256
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 He's trying to track this thing down. He's walking around.

257
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 He's looking for it. He's looking for any giant other rocks he could be hiding on.

258
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 He can't find any evidence of it, but the classic evidence of a big foot, he finds footprints.

259
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 He finds footprints. Hmm.

260
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So the creature was out here, he thinks to himself.

261
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But then he just goes home because he can't find the like what he's supposed to do,

262
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 just hang out at the footprint all day long.

263
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 He's sleeping in it. He's curled up sleeping in it.

264
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 A couple of days later, he's out of the pasture again, kind of forgotten about it.

265
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I mean, I guess if you're in the middle of Kyrgyzstan and you're a shepherd,

266
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 you got more important things to worry about.

267
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 You can't all, I think honestly, like being a big foot hunter, like having the time to go out and hunt big foot

268
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 means you don't really have much else going on.

269
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I don't know of many people who like work at a factory 40 hours a week.

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 They're like, but the weekends belong to big foot.

271
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Like if you're actually going out and hunting big foot, you probably, that's probably your main job.

272
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 So you had other things to do. You have to do some sheep stuff.

273
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 But one day he's out in the pasture and his wife starts freaking out again and he's like, oh, what?

274
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 He kind of knows what it is, so he doesn't even waste time to turn to her.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 He looks up at the rock and there's the creature, but see, he had been prepared this time.

276
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 He really didn't seem to mind the creature at all, but he's probably more upset at his wife screaming all the time.

277
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 He pulls his rifle out, which he had at the ready and he takes a shot.

278
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Creature jumps off the rocks, runs into the forest.

279
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 She's like, can we please leave? He's like, ah, come on.

280
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Tell you what, I know what's going to happen. I hit it.

281
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Tomorrow morning I'm going to wake up. I'm going to go check out that rock because it was kind of dusk at this point.

282
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And there's probably going to be a body 30 yards in the forest because I got it good.

283
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I'm not going to worry about it. You don't worry about it, whatever.

284
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 The next day, sure enough, he went out there and the rock did have a blood trail leading away from it.

285
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 So he knew that he shot it.

286
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 He begins walking following the blood trail.

287
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Eventually it dries up, but he figures it's not coming back.

288
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Whatever it was, it's not coming back.

289
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 A couple of days later, he's walking through his pasture. Sheep are just walking around.

290
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 He sees a lump in the field.

291
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Hmm, that's weird. I don't remember leaving any lumps out here.

292
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 He checks his mouth. No, it didn't spit up any tumors. Hmm.

293
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Let's go see what this lump is.

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 He's walking closer to it. He realizes it's not just a lump.

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 It's the body of his son.

296
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 There's an interesting detail to this because when he goes up to the body of his son, the son's dead,

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 but the line that's used repeatedly is there is no violence showing on the body.

298
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 He wasn't bashed up. He wasn't beat up. He wasn't torn in half.

299
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Sorry, that's a little gruesome, but I mean, we're talking about a bigfoot creature here.

300
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 None of those things, that's not what killed him.

301
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 I'll get to the cause of death in a bit, but for dramatic reasons,

302
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 we're just going to have the father bring the child back to the house, the grieving mother.

303
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And Omushu swears at that point, he's going to kill this creature.

304
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 However long it takes, grabs his gun, grabs some supplies, goes into the forest,

305
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 and is trying to track this thing down.

306
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Now, a couple nights pass. He's spending nights in the forest.

307
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 He can't find it. After about three or four nights, he goes,

308
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 "I gotta go back, get some more supplies from home."

309
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 So he comes back home, he sees a sheep in the pen, walks into his house.

310
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 There, his wife lays.

311
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 No violence done to her body. She's dead nonetheless.

312
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Omushu gets ahold of a friend of his, another shepherd named Shappak.

313
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 He goes, "Shappak, this thing killed my son, killed my wife.

314
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 I gotta kill this thing. I gotta do whatever it takes.

315
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I need you to watch my sheep while I'm gone. I will be back. I will be back."

316
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Shappak's like, "Sure, dude, no problem.

317
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Omushu grabs his gun, grabs his gear, goes off into the forest."

318
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 And Shappak does honor this debt.

319
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Stays in the house, watches over the sheep.

320
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And one morning Shappak wakes up, get ready to do his thing, go tend those sheep.

321
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 The sheep are agitated, making a lot of noise.

322
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 "Baaah, baaah." The sheep go, "Baaah."

323
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 You won't believe that was me, that was not a sound effect machine.

324
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 "Baaah."

325
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Anyways, Shappak goes, "Whoa, those sheep sound incredibly realistic."

326
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 He sees they're agitated, they're in their pin.

327
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 He opens the gate, he walks in.

328
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And there, in the middle of all the sheep, lies the body of Omushu.

329
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 No violence done upon his body.

330
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But he is very clearly dead.

331
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And that's where the story ends.

332
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And the story is set up to be that this creature, this Bigfoot creature,

333
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 is killing this family one by one.

334
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 There's a very interesting detail I left out of this.

335
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 First off, before I get to that detail, I think we should be...

336
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 It's very, very, very rare we come across a story of a Bigfoot killing somebody.

337
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 We've done stories where people have found bodies in areas where there have been Bigfoot activity.

338
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 But it's very rare when we find a story where Bigfoot actually is assaulting people.

339
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 We have this story with a guy who went into the other dimension

340
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and there was a Bigfoot-type creature waiting there for him.

341
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And it said, "Gotcha!"

342
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 That was an old episode. That one was really good.

343
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I don't remember what episode that was. It might have been interdimensional Bigfoot.

344
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 We have that one.

345
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 We have the one about all the Bigfoot sightings in the Southwest, American Southwest,

346
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 where you had the Speedway monster was out there.

347
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And you had bodies being found.

348
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 You had it because at this point, the Spaniards and the indigenous people had stayed out of a certain region.

349
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And as more Europeans were showing up there, getting horribly mangled down there.

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 But you had Bigfoot sightings and then these bodies.

351
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 As far as I can remember, and you guys know this show more than I do, honestly,

352
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I can't recall a time that we've actually had a Bigfoot kill somebody, or even really assault somebody.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 We've had Bigfoot sightings and then people die. And I could be wrong. We may have covered that.

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 But even if I have covered it, it's extremely rare.

355
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And here we would have a case over a period of time of a Bigfoot creature showing up repeatedly

356
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 and taking out a family one by one.

357
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 So that in and of itself is rare.

358
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 But this is what makes this story super interesting. Here's the detail I left out.

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 The way that they died.

360
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 The father, the son, because the father, the mother, and the son were all found dead.

361
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 No violence done upon their bodies, the phrase used.

362
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Two puncture marks in their neck, blood dripping out of the puncture marks.

363
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 That's not a Bigfoot kill. That's not a Bigfoot kill.

364
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 What are Bigfoot's known for? Their size, their strength.

365
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 People say when they hear these things, it sounds like trees rending in the pitch black night.

366
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 It's massive creatures. They've been known to throw rocks.

367
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Puncture marks in the neck. Obviously that makes you think of a vampire.

368
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 If you got attacked by a Bigfoot, I don't think there's much left of you.

369
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I think a Bigfoot attack would be similar to a gorilla attack.

370
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 You're lucky if you keep your genitals in your face.

371
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 That's the first thing they would go for, just as an ape-like species.

372
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Now Bigfoot is me Bigfoot. Me not want to grab genitals.

373
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 But in a fight response, as a human when we fight, we go to disable generally.

374
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 We're punching for the face, we're punching for the head.

375
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And if it's really bad, you're punching for the neck.

376
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 But I mean, if you're in a real, real bad fight, you're going to grab the genitals.

377
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 You're going to go and put out an eye.

378
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Like if it's death, if you lose this fight, you're going to die.

379
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 You're going to try to do some real damage to them.

380
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Grab the balls and twist. Apes, that is their default thing.

381
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Apes aren't going to stand up and box you, right?

382
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 They're just going to start ripping you apart.

383
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Ripping humans apart. They rip off your face. They pull off your genitals.

384
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 You think a Bigfoot would at least have some of those instincts as well.

385
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 If there's one attack you, you could literally just pull limbs off.

386
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 But whatever the case, you definitely don't think of it being a stealth attack.

387
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 An attack with no damage to the body.

388
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Those stories that I told where they found the people in the American Southwest,

389
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 they were horribly mutilated.

390
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Bodies that they were finding in the brush.

391
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Nothing like, it looked like Lestat took him in the night.

392
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Looks like his last moments were about terror and ecstasy.

393
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 No, their explains were broken. They were being killed supposedly by Bigfoot.

394
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 So these don't really seem like Bigfoot attacks.

395
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 So I have a hypothesis, and I think this might be going out there,

396
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 but we've covered a lot of weird Bigfoot stuff.

397
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Let's put this into another perspective.

398
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Bigfoot was not the adversary in this story.

399
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Despite the fact that he was being hunted, despite the fact that he was shot,

400
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 "Ugh, me only want to save family, but while it wound through liver, make that difficult, uugh."

401
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Wandering through the woods.

402
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 What if it was there to protect that family from a vampire?

403
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 It wasn't he, he didn't escalate it when he shot Bigfoot.

404
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 He didn't escalate it so the Bigfoot came back to kill his family.

405
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 The fact that he shot Bigfoot made it impossible for him to save Omusha's son.

406
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Far-fetched, absolutely, right? Absolutely far-fetched.

407
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 But it actually, if the story is true, right, it could totally be made up.

408
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 If the story is true, it most likely is made up.

409
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 But if the story is true, these definitely aren't the hallmarks of a Bigfoot kill.

410
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Or an ape kill, or the kill of someone who's eight feet tall and 800 pounds.

411
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 It's the attack pattern of a vampire.

412
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 If you get killed in your sleep, you don't go, "Michael Myers must have done it."

413
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Like, you have certain rules with this stuff.

414
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 What if there was a vampire watching over that hurt?

415
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And actually, a vampire wouldn't make sense as well, because it could feed off the sheep.

416
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 That's why it would be in a pasture area to begin with.

417
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Remember, none of these people were seen to be killed.

418
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 The bodies were discovered the next day.

419
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 As if the attacks took place at night.

420
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Bigfoot's not there killing these people.

421
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Bigfoot's trying to save this group of shepherds from this vampire.

422
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And it failed, because it was being hunted, it was being pursued.

423
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Interesting story, interesting piece of the lore,

424
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 because it would actually add another wrinkle to the story of Bigfoot.

425
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 The reason why Bigfoot is always out there, always hidden, isn't trying to hide from us.

426
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 But it's trying to sneak up on the things that are actually trying to take us out.

427
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 It would add a whole other layer to the idea of high strangeness.

428
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 That's where we usually see Bigfoot and UFO and ghosts and stuff like that.

429
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Generally, in a similar area, where you see one, you tend to see the other,

430
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 it's possible that Bigfoot is there to protect us from those other crazy things.

431
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 He's not a furry foe. He's not an elusive enemy.

432
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 He's a protector.

433
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 But we treat him as something that we can either hunt, chase, capture, or kill.

434
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 When we should just be like, "You do you, because I know you got my back."

435
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Do we have an ally in the war against darkness?

436
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And is that ally our eight foot friend, the Sasquatch?

437
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 It would make sense why he's seeing all over the world.

438
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 It would make sense why he's so powerful.

439
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 There's no way a vampire could bite through a Bigfoot's neck.

440
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 I can't believe I said that sentence out loud.

441
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 But you know what I mean? It would be built for combat.

442
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Plus, it would have the skills of disappearing on command, of being incredibly elusive.

443
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 It does fly. Bigfoot's having sighted flying UFOs as well.

444
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 The world of the weird, a lot of times we try to contain it by going,

445
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 "This is a ghost sighting. This is UFO sighting. This is a Bigfoot sighting."

446
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 It may all be connected. And there may be battle lines drawn.

447
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Bigfoot may be on our side.

448
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 At the end of the day, it may come down between humanity and Bigfoot

449
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 versus the forces of evil, the demons and the darkness and the plagues of humanity.

450
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 We'll be standing there side by side with our furry friend.

451
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 But if we keep hunting him, if we keep pursuing him,

452
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 he may not be there when we need him the most.

453
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
