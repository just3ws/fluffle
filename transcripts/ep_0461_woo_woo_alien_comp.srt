1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Forest Fin's Treasure, I know you guys have been waiting all week for this episode.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Forest Fin's Treasure has been found. How do I feel about it? I feel great! I feel great, honestly.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 We'll talk about that in a second. Is it possible that there's actually a PlayStation 1 game that can cause you to commit suicide?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 And then we take a look at a trio of friends driving home from a camping trip.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Everything seems normal until they see a car approaching them from the distance. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. Now I promised you some more Forest Fin stuff on Monday.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 We'll get to that in just a second. First off, I want to give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Elkie.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Elkie, thank you so much for supporting the show. That really, really helps out a lot. I have a prize.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 A surprise? It's kind of a prize. For our Patreon supporters, we'll be getting into that tomorrow.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 But, Elkie, I'm going to ding up those little keys, jangle them in front of you. We're not getting in.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 You know what? Yeah, let's hop into Jason the Lappy. Let's actually leave behind Hood River, Oregon.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Let's drive out to New Mexico where we meet an old friend of the show. A man I always believed in.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 A man I never lost faith in. Forest Fin. Forest Fin.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Now, first off, I want to say thank you so much to Beatrice Leva. I'm pretty sure I'm pronouncing that name wrong. Leva.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 She's the first person who got this to me. I was getting ready to do some recording. She sent it to me. Awesome.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Shout out to her husband, Timothy Leva, as well, fan of the show. Leva family seems to be fans of the show.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Really, really appreciate you guys listening to the show. I appreciate all you guys listening to the show.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Now, if you're a new listener, let me give you some brief background to this story.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 About 10 years ago, there was a man named Forest Fin. He wrote a book called The Thrill of the Chase.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 The thrill of the hunt, I think it was. The thrill of the chase. It had a poem in it and it had all these clues.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And if you figured out the clues, you would find a treasure that was valued at about like $2 to $5 million.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Now, I recorded an episode, like episode 60, 70? And I tell the story and then the very, like the last 30 seconds of it, I go,

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 "I don't think it's real. I think it's just this man. He's trying to like add a little whimsy to the world."

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I wasn't bad-mouthing him. I immediately started getting negative feedback on that video and concentrated negative feedback.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Now, I didn't tell you guys the whole story. I didn't tell you guys the whole story. And I'll get to that in a second.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 But let's finish up this narrative. So, I doubled down. That tends to be a lot of times what I do when I feel like I'm a bad person.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I felt like these guys were very cultish. They actually were called the fanatics. Like, they're fanatics for forcefulness.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Don't make- If you're going to start an organization, don't sound like a bunch of lunatics. Yeah, we're the crazy murderers.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We help old women across the street. Yeah. So, anyways, the fanatics start attacking me and telling me how I'm wrong and all of a sudden, that's fine.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 It turns out that I was wrong. I was wrong. So, within the past- This is where it gets weird. In the past couple days, apparently,

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Forrest Finn has acknowledged that his treasure was found. The hunt is over. And he goes, "Well, I have a little bittersweet about it because it's over.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Like, the thing's over." And I got that email from Beatrice and I go, "I was wrong. I was wrong. And you know what? I'm totally fine being wrong."

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I've made mistakes on this show before. Now, I could double down again and say, "I believe that it's fake until I see proof.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I want to see a photograph. Maybe he's just faking it. He is facing some lawsuits over it. Some people are claiming fraud that there was no treasure.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 So, it's possible that this is him trying to get out from underneath that. But I personally believe now that Forrest Finn hit his treasure.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Because the world is so insane, his own followers now, there's a civil war. Some of them- If you go to the subreddits, which I have relished,

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I'm swimming in their subreddits right now, they are adamant that it was all fake to begin with and they wasted their lives and they demand compensation from Forrest Finn.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 It's insane. Everything flipped. Now, I believe the story and half of them don't. Because here's the thing.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I go, "Okay, whatever. It's fine. I'm on episode 461. I don't have time to keep rehashing the same episode."

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 But they've spent the last 10 years looking for this. And they're saying, "I don't see a photograph of the treasure chest."

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And here's the thing. The guy who supposedly found it doesn't want to be revealed. And that's fine. You come flush with cash.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You don't want people to know, especially the IRS. But people are saying, "That's fine. Don't tell us. But at least tell us the location."

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Because I've spent 10 years trying to solve this riddle. I want to see how close I was. Or if I had it and if I had gone out last winter, maybe I would have found it.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Forrest Finn said, "The guy's from the east. Like the east coast." And I was reading this thing on Reddit and they're like,

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 "Maybe the man from the east means he's facing west, which again would place in Colorado."

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I'm like, "Just- It's done, guys! There's not a riddle in the press release! You weirdo!"

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 What are you doing? It's over. But they can't acknowledge it's over. There's a split.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Now here's the thing. You go, Jason. You did the story. This is probably the one story I've addressed the most.

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Right? On a show about ghosts and aliens, for whatever reason, a 77-year-old's treasure hunt keeps popping up.

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Well, guys, I'm going to- I did not let any of you know this. This was behind-the-scenes stuff. So my inner circle knew about this.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 The Forrest Finn, the Fanatics, a couple of them invaded my private life. I did not reveal that to you.

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I did not want to get you guys upset. I did not want to start a war and I don't give attention to trolls.

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 They- But the war's over now, right? I admit that I'm wrong and they didn't get the treasure.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 So I'm pounding that a win. If one of them got the treasure, I might be a little more shaking my hand in the wind.

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But they tried to get the YouTube channel shut down. They made a concentrated effort filing false complaints against me.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And back then, my channel only had, like, what, six, seven hundred subs?

58
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So by the grace of God, the channel stayed up. And then they attacked the podcast host.

59
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 If you listen, if you look at a lot of the early show notes, I was going through Podbean. Don't go through Podbean.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Because they almost canceled the show. A couple of complaints against that podcast host in their terms of service,

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 they said you can't say anything mean about anyone ever.

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So if you're doing a movie review show and you say that Michael Bay sucks, first off, you're wrong.

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But secondly, if someone complains, they can cancel your show. The show came so close to having all episodes just wiped.

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 They would have just wiped the server. And it was ridiculous.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 The Forest Finn people were saying that I was about to be sued in federal court. That Forest Finn had filed-

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I mean, they're lying. That Forest Finn had filed a lawsuit against me and that Podbean was going to be brought up on charges for all this stuff.

67
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 One of the guys tried making up this false alter ego of this cool kid in Sacramento. It was super bizarre.

68
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It was the whole thing was weird, right? So that was going on. That was going on.

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And that was really pissing me off. But I didn't reveal any of that to you guys.

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Really, I didn't reveal that to you guys because I didn't want them to know that they were getting under my skin.

71
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And I didn't want you guys to know because I think you guys would have gone to the mattress with the Forest Finn people.

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I don't think they would have even expected. And I'm not asking you guys to do that now, but...

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 I was just like, I'm thinking, these guys, who do these guys think that they're mo-

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Who do these old treasure hunters think that they're messing with?

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 It's like the Fertilees versus the Goonies. Where are the Goonies? We'll always win, dude.

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 But anyways, it's over. Don't go straight up Goonie on them. Please.

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 It's over. We won. They didn't win the treasure. Now they think it didn't exist.

78
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 But anyway, so that is now. You now know the full complete saga of the Forest Finn story.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 A small group of them actually trying to cancel the show, almost succeeding.

80
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I said the treasure didn't exist. Now I'm wrong. But the people who said I was wrong back then now think that I was right.

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 But now I'm wrong because I agree with him. So that is the scope.

82
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 We probably won't talk about Forest Finn anymore. But you know, I've been getting emails for the past couple days being like, did you hear?

83
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And I appreciate those emails. Again, I take this as a win. Not only because the people who were attacking me didn't get the treasure.

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 That's all like, that's super funny to me. But, and again, not attacking me by saying I'm stupid. That's fine. You can say that stuff.

85
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 The people who were personally attacking me and trying to ruin the business that I've created, not just for myself, but for you guys.

86
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Though, criticize me all you want. But when you take it out of the realm of criticizing and actually trying to hurt me financially, that's something different.

87
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 The thing is, is that I'm happy that the treasure was real. Right? Doesn't that make it such a nice ending to the story?

88
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 It makes it such a nice ending story. But you know what? I'm going on way too long talking about this. I think we've wrapped it up perfectly fine.

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Thank you, Beatrice. Thank you, Timothy. Thank you, the Lavey family. Elkie's ready to get back in the car and drive away, as I'm sure the rest of you are.

90
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I hope you enjoyed this behind the scenes look. And what was going on. Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy. Let's go for a ride into our next story.

91
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Elkie, we're driving away from Arizona. He's like, "Thank God he's hitting the pedal to the metal. We are leaving."

92
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 We're leaving behind Arizona. We're leaving behind all those poor, ignorant saps that had combated me.

93
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 You're humble host. I'll admit that I was wrong, but I'm not going to admit that those guys aren't total pieces of garbage.

94
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 They're sitting there in their raggedy old clothes and I'm taking off in my car.

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 We're going to Japan. Now this is a story that was recommended to me via email from a user known as Mitty Fresh. I don't know, user?

96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 As a person, known as Mitty Fresh. So thank you, Mitty, for sending this over.

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And I got most of my information from a YouTube channel, ultra-healthy video game nerd.

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Very, very obscure story. Not a lot of sources on this. Couldn't mean two different things.

99
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 But we get the Jason Jalopy to a cruise ship. Actually, let's hop in the Dead Rabbit rowboat now.

100
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Elkie's like, "Dammit, he's throwing. He's throwing the rowboat." We're rowing across the Pacific. We're getting to Japan.

101
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 It's 2002. There's a small video game company called Media Entertainment. They've done a couple video games at this point.

102
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 We're walking around the streets of Japan, eating Pockies and stuff. We walk into this video game place and they're working on a game called Kawai Shashin.

103
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 All little computer programmers type it and stuff. I don't know how you make video games. They're just using an actual typewriter.

104
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 They're like, "If we type fast enough, the words come to life." They're typing out, they're doing programming and stuff.

105
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Now they're coming up with a game for the PlayStation 1. It's called Kawai Shashin. It literally means scary picture.

106
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 In this game, you play a paranormal investigator and her job is to perform exorcisms. It's like a series of missions.

107
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Each story has a backstory. It's like me and my cousin were walking down the street eating a bunch of Pockies and then a ghost showed up.

108
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Then you're given a level and you're given a grainy photograph. It's a digitized photograph. They're real photographs that are turned into PS1 graphics.

109
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 In the photo, there's going to be ghosts "hidden" because I was watching on this gameplay footage. It's totally obvious where the ghosts are.

110
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 You move a little cursor around, you hover on the ghost, you click it, and then you play a quick time event game where you have to hit the buttons in a certain order quick enough.

111
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 You exercise the ghost. You do that to a couple different photos and then you're on to the next level, which is a new photo, new backstory and things like that.

112
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Pretty basic game, pretty basic find a picture game. It's very obscure. It wasn't a huge hit. The game company went out of business shortly after this game came out.

113
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 That in and of itself isn't suspicious. Game companies go out of business all the time. Even when they have huge hits, even when they make great games, they can still go out of business.

114
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Now, here's the thing. The story has pretty limited resources as far as like, there's not a lot about it in English, about the story in English.

115
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And it could 100% be a lark and the reason why there's not a lot of resources on it is because the scary story, the creepypasta hasn't taken off yet.

116
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 That's definitely possible. The other possibility, the possibility we're going to look at, the spooky possibility, is that there's just cultural barriers and it's not something that a lot of people want to talk about in Japan.

117
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And it's slowly leaking out into the Western press. I guess that's what I am now. I'm now the Western press. And also ultra healthy video game nerd.

118
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 So here's the backstory to this game. Apparently, they knew this was their first scary game, but scary games for the PS1 and Japan were pretty commonplace.

119
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 I mean, it wasn't their number one seller, but you'd get them.

120
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And media entertainment wanted to try their hand at this video game genre. So they say, "Let's do this scary picture." They come up with the thing.

121
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And originally, the director of the project, we know the initials of K. Koa. We don't actually know the full name of this lead developer.

122
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Again, this is where it starts to look like creepypasta territory. But K. Koa goes, "Let's get photos from actual haunted places." Put them in our game.

123
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So K. Koa and the rest of his team go around. They go to these shrines. They go to these places that are rumored to be haunted and take photographs.

124
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 But the thing is, they just look like photographs of buildings. Creepy buildings, sure. But they don't give them the exact level of spookiness that K. Koa wants.

125
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So what he does is he contracts with a local paranormal researcher group to send photos that have already been taken of confirmed haunted places that these paranormal investigators have vetted.

126
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 They get about 30 photographs of these locations. And there would be like a wisp of smoke in one area, or you'd see maybe an orb in this picture.

127
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And it still wasn't enough. So what K. Koa and his team did was they begin cutting and pasting the pictures together. They'd go, "This is a really cool thing, a mist. But let's move into this picture where it'll pop more."

128
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And then let's actually draw a spooky face over this mist. So this is an actual haunted picture. But we're going to clip it. We're going to put it in this other picture.

129
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Then we're going to magnify it and actually draw a spooky face on it to make it extra scary. So they're actually taking the proof of ghosts, cutting and pasting and drawing over them and then inserting them into their video game.

130
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And once all the photographs are processed, they're in the game. People start play testing the game. And you'd have the team there, working on stuff, and you'd hear a scream in the hallways.

131
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 "Ahhhhhh!" And now they're screaming because you're like, "Jason, are you really telling us a creepy pasta story? Hold on. Hold on." They hear a scream in the hallways.

132
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And then you have incidents where one of the debugger, one of the people working on the debugging team, just flips out in the middle of working on the game, flips out, starts screaming, running around, faints in that order, doesn't faint and then run around, goes to the doctor.

133
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 One of the lead designers of the game doesn't come to work the next day because he cut his thumb off. And people go, "What were you doing?" And he goes, "I don't know why. I remember cutting my thumb off, but I don't know why."

134
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 So the ledger starts to grow in the office that both the debugger and the lead developer who had these incidents were both working on level 6, which was the level it was a photograph of a train station.

135
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So people did not want to work on level 6 anymore. They actually created a skip code in the game so you could skip level 6 specifically.

136
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 But of course you have to work on level 6. You have to have the game be complete. So some people were brave enough to do it.

137
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 What happened was the game was about to come out and one day K. Koa, the head of the team, calls in and says, "I'm not feeling good. I can't come into work today."

138
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And then the next day the head of the company lets everyone who's working on Kawaii Shishin know that K. Koa was found dead in a train station bathroom.

139
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 He hung himself and it was the train station the opposite direction of his house.

140
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 So I know that sounds weird, but here's his house and here's his work. He didn't go to work that day.

141
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 He took a train in the opposite direction and he hung himself the train stop after the haunted train stop in the photo.

142
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So basically the implication is that he didn't go to work that day. I'm trying to say this with a straight face because I know what all of you are thinking.

143
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Maybe I don't. Maybe you guys are super puzzled. He leaves his house. He doesn't go to work that day. He goes in the opposite direction.

144
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 He stops at the haunted place in the photograph. He goes to that train station and the next train station he hangs himself.

145
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And the game comes out. Doesn't do very well. The company goes bankrupt after the game comes out or goes out of business.

146
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 The reason why I'm laughing is because that story is almost creepypasta. I don't read creepypasta on this show at all.

147
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 But it's most certainly creepypasta. The reason why Jason talks so long about it is that it's creepypasta and that's one thing you don't do on the show.

148
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 This is what I find fascinating about this story. One, it's perfect. This is one of those stories. Normally I say let's assume it's real.

149
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 First off, let's assume that this story is fake. It's perfectly constructed to be a compelling ghost story because let's take a look at the elements here.

150
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 One, it's far in the past. 2003. We're talking about a story that's 17 years ago. Right now there's this big thing going on that Mario 64 is paranormal.

151
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Each person who plays it can see different symbols. I spent maybe 10 minutes looking into it and thought it was some of the dumbest stuff I had read in a while.

152
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 That's quite a high margin. You can find symbolism in anything. That's the point. That's the point of symbolism.

153
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 A game like Super Mario 64 or whatever it's called, have Mario World, Mario Odyssey, whatever particular game it was, anything that has hours and hours of content you're going to find.

154
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 You can cherry pick stuff out of it. I can take the animated Transformers to movie and find proof of the Illuminati in that movie if you spend a long enough time because it's an hour and a half of visual images and sound and stuff like that.

155
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Video games far more than an hour and a half. The problem I see with the Mario Brothers thing is one, it's too recent. But it does have a thing.

156
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 If you had a conspiracy theory based on a game that you could put into your console today, if you had a conspiracy theory based on Team Fortress 2, it wouldn't really last because anyone can check it within a minute or two.

157
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Mario 64, people who never played the game, haven't played the game in years, don't have a Nintendo 64 console to play that on. They can't verify the stupid stuff that's coming out of these theories.

158
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 So this story here, Kawaii Shoshin, you would need a PlayStation 1 and you would need a copy of a very obscure game. It's a very, very obscure game.

159
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Now, I'm not saying that I don't think MIDI created the creepypasta and I don't think Ultra Healthy Video Game Nerd created the creepypasta. They may simply be repeating it.

160
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 But it's perfectly engineered because it's an old game, it's an obscure game. It's not Red Dead Redemption 1 for the remastered copy you can get for a PC. You'd have to have a PS1, you'd have to have this obscure video game.

161
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 You'd have to be able to speak Japanese to really understand what the game is about in the first play. All of these things make it very limiting. So it's easy to talk about something that's more obscure and saying it's haunted versus...

162
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 That's easier to say than if you rent Jack and Jill on Blu-ray and you play it at 3 in the morning, Jack and Jill pop out and they start rubbing your head. That's obviously easy to disprove.

163
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 It's perfectly constructed, it takes place far in the past, we don't have anyone's real names. Oh, and here's another part of the story.

164
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 It's that people were so convinced this game was cursed they removed their names from the credits of the game.

165
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 So even if you were able to track down the people who worked on the game, it's built into the myth that "Oh no, no, no, but the people who got their names removed were the ones who experienced the supernatural events."

166
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 So it's perfectly constructed to be an interesting ghost story. I wanted to talk about it on that sense because it's just so perfectly constructed as opposed to this Mario 64 thing that's going around.

167
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And again, I could be getting the game wrong. It's a dumb conspiracy anyways, but this idea that you play it and it's mystical or you play it and it has symbolism or it changes to you, I've seen a couple different versions of the conspiracy.

168
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 It's far easier to disprove because you can get a copy of it, but you can never disprove symbolism, right? You can never disprove. It's like looking up in clouds.

169
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I could go, "That looks like a dog," and you go, "No, that looks like a cow." We can't convince each other either way.

170
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 But all that being said, if it is true, let's go back into the realm of Dead Rabbit Radio. If it is true, it's interesting because there's copies of it.

171
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Even though this game is obscure, there's copies of it still floating around out there. It's not so obscure that you would never be able to find it again.

172
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 You probably pay a little bit extra money for it and you'd have to track down a PS1. You may have one yourself, but then you could play it.

173
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And it's not something that it seemed to be that everyone who played it experienced this activity.

174
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 However, based on this legend, if you played it and you lived in Japan and you went to that train stop that's in that photograph, you may face the wrath of this ghost.

175
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And the implication is that the photograph itself wasn't haunted, but once they started manipulating the photograph, it pulled out whatever darkness was in there.

176
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 That's another interesting part of this ghost story.

177
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And it makes you think the next time someone is sharing haunted photographs when you're watching these scary YouTube videos or you're on a Facebook group or Instagram group or something like that and they're sharing these photographs.

178
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Who knows? Maybe the person who's sharing that photograph didn't think it was spooky enough.

179
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Felt they needed to run it through a filter or add a little extra mist into the photo.

180
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Are they possibly also awakening something dark in that photograph? Who knows?

181
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Photographs are supposed to capture the soul, but maybe they're really going to capture yours.

182
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 To be fair, I had no other... That was bad, but I had no other way to end that story.

183
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 But this, now I'm pointing at Elkie. He's too scared to keep driving, but he's going to have to keep driving.

184
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 That's the thing, when you're a Patreon supporter, you got to drive his around.

185
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Let's leave behind Japan. We're not taking the train. We're not taking the train. We're driving.

186
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Let's get in the carbonicopter, actually. We can't leave. It's an island.

187
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 To get in the carbonicopter, we are flying out to Tennessee.

188
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Because you're the only ten I see. Because I'm looking at Elkie. Elkie's like, "What are you talking about?"

189
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Puts up a little partition between us. It's 1985. I got this from the Think About It Docs website.

190
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 It's a great website. We've talked about this before. And they got it from a book called Phantom and Monsters by Lon Strickler.

191
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 It's summer 1985. Little leaves are still on trees. I don't know. It's not fall yet. Little leaves are still attached to trees. They're green.

192
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Car's driving down. Route 49. Southbound Route 49 towards Dover, Tennessee.

193
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I dare anyone living in this area to take part, to go out there. I dare you.

194
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 We're at the land between the lakes, National Recreation Area.

195
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Now, we don't have any names for these people. They gave their initials in the story. So I'm going to assign them names.

196
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 We're going to have Ricky, Justin, and Tony.

197
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Three buddies driving through land between the lakes, National Recreation Area. They're headed home.

198
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 They're driving down the road. It's early evening. Our helicopter's up in the sky watching all this stuff. I'm not going anywhere near this thing.

199
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 They're driving down the road. It's early evening. Now, Justin's driving.

200
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Ricky's sitting in the passenger seat. He's humming. He's humming to John T. Tune.

201
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And Tony is in the back just chilling.

202
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Car's driving down the road.

203
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Now, the road's coming up to a slight curve.

204
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And they see coming in the opposite direction an old style sedan. It's gray. It's older.

205
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 And it's driving towards them. They're about to pass each other. And the sedan starts to slow down so slow that Ricky starts to think,

206
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 "Oh, they want to tell us something." The person driving this car wants to say something to us.

207
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 They're driving. They're slowing down because the corner's coming. But the other car's slowing down much, much slower than it needs to.

208
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And Justin and Ricky are sitting there. Tony's nearly oblivious to this whole incident.

209
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 But Justin and Ricky are sitting there. And as they see the car get closer, they see the driver in the other car has bushy, bushy hair.

210
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Just imagine animal from the Muppets. Just now, not magenta, normal colored hair.

211
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 But I don't know why he's making that death ray sound. That's the hair frizzing out. Bushy, bushy hair.

212
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Whoever it is is also wearing a set of glasses.

213
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Now, their car starts to slow down a bit too. Curious, right? If someone's coming up alongside you and they're slowing down to say something,

214
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 you're going to slow down a little bit as well. And as the gray sedan gets closer and closer, the driver of that car is staring dead on at Ricky and Justin.

215
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And that's when they can tell that the driver of the car had big eyes.

216
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Now, not gray alien, one third of the head eyes, not a giant black orb, just larger than a human's eyes should be.

217
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Precious moments type of eyes. Cartoon big eyes. Inhumanly big eyes.

218
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And the cars get slower as they're just starting to pass each other.

219
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 At that point, as the cars are just starting to pass each other, Ricky realizes that the driver of the sedan is looking right at them,

220
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 and not in the sense where he's staring at them, his face.

221
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 The driver's face in the other car is actually getting closer to them.

222
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 It's stretching out the window. The neck is distending and getting longer and longer, impossibly long,

223
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 until the neck is hanging outside of the car's window and it gets closer and closer.

224
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Both cars seem like they're almost stopped at this moment. It's not human.

225
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 This creature's head is now leaning completely out of the car, almost to Ricky and Justin's car.

226
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And that's when the head actually begins to turn like a clock. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

227
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Until its head is completely upside down.

228
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Now, Ricky is looking at a face of a man hanging three, four feet out of a car upside down.

229
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And then, to make things worse, to make things even more disturbing, the face begins to shape shift and begins to let out a cry.

230
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Justin slams on the gas. Speeds out of there.

231
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Tony has no idea what just happened. Tony's in the back seat and Justin and Ricky are thinking,

232
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 "What did we just see?" They begin comparing notes. They know what they saw.

233
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 They saw the car slow down. The head extend out of the car. It turned. It twisted till its face was upside down,

234
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 making loud woo-woo and howling noises at the same time.

235
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Its eyes were impossibly big. Its face began to contort and distend.

236
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Ricky's almost in tears. Justin is panicking. He's driving faster and faster.

237
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 And Ricky begins begging Justin, "Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please

238
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Ricky begins begging Justin, "Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, turn around." What? Turn around. Turn around.

239
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Justin can't figure out why Ricky wants the car turned around. Ricky begins pleading.

240
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 I don't know what that was, but we have to kill it. We have to kill it now. Turn the car around. I'm going to shoot it.

241
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 We're not turning it. Turn the car around. The car keeps barreling down the road faster and faster and faster.

242
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 We're not turning it away from the creature. Ricky wants to turn it around because he knew something.

243
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He knew something deep inside. He knew that thing shouldn't exist. He knew that thing should have never been on this earth,

244
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 and they let it get away. Later on, when Ricky was being interviewed by Lon Strickler, he says, "I fear the day."

245
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I run into that thing again, and I regret not killing it on the spot. I live in fear that someday I'll look up from reading a newspaper and I'll see it in front of me.

246
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Or I'll be driving down another road, and off in the distance I'll see a beat-up old sedan headed towards me.

247
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Or I'll be walking into my bedroom and I hear something rustle under my bed, and then I hear a familiar noise.

248
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 [Lon Strickler's voice]

249
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And then human noise. I should have killed it right there.

250
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 He's the one who told the story to Lon Strickler, and he says, "Listen, I know this sounds ridiculous.

251
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 This probably sounds like creepypasta. Interview my buddy Justin." And Lon Strickler went to Justin, and Justin goes,

252
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 "I will confirm this story happened, but I'm not answering in another word. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to think about it.

253
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I will confirm that my buddy's not insane, and it did happen, but don't ask me anything else."

254
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And then Tony, they go, "We don't know if he just was completely oblivious to what was going on, or if he was paralyzed, or if he was put to sleep."

255
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Like, he basically, it wasn't like he was like, "Shucks, guys! What are you so panicked about?"

256
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 It's he's reading an Archie and Jughead comic book. Like, he had zero reaction to it at all.

257
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Like, he couldn't even perceive the danger that was going on.

258
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 While the two people in front of him, one, it stunned into silence, and he never wanted to talk about it, and the other one,

259
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 it stunned into violence. He wanted to turn around and kill the thing there and then.

260
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Sometimes the creepiest stories don't involve haunted houses or spooky subway stations.

261
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 We expect terror when we go into dark places.

262
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 We expect bad things to happen when we listen to local legends about the haunted insane asylum.

263
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Or just the regular insane asylum.

264
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 So for those of you who don't go ghost hunting, who just like hearing spooky stories,

265
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 who prefer to read about the stuff or listen about the stuff or explore these type of topics during the bright of day,

266
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 don't be so sure that you are safe.

267
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Don't be so sure that you won't encounter something like this.

268
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 The world of the paranormal has no rules.

269
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 So whether you're purposely going to a haunted train station, or just enjoying an evening drive,

270
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 always be aware that these things can get you at any moment.

271
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 You may think you can avoid them by avoiding the darkness, but eventually, the darkness always gets what it wants.
