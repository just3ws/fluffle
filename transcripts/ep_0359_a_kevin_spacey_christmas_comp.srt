1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 A bizarre new holiday tradition has started, apparently.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:13,280
 I guess from now on, Kevin Spacey is going to put out mysterious videos every Christmas.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:21,160
 And then we travel to Hood River, Oregon, where Bigfoot was spotted on the freeway.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,080
 Or was he today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:35,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,800
 I hope you guys had a great Christmas.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
 I did.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 No snow.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,080
 Stayed at home, watched some movies, got caught up on the Mandalorian, played some video

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
 games.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,320
 It was a fun Christmas thing.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,960
 But speaking of Christmas.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,320
 Oh yeah, and also dude, you want to talk about like aggressive bots?

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,360
 Here's a little behind the scenes stuff.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,240
 If you listen to the Christmas episode, it's still up on YouTube.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,440
 They haven't gotten that yet.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,480
 But if you listen to it on the podcast for in the first hour, I sang quote unquote saying

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,480
 "Sleigh bells, sleigh ride."

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,960
 It was some Christmas song.

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,200
 And within 40 minutes, the video was taken off of Facebook for a copyright claim.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,120
 So when I say "sing," I sang like the first two lines of a song, a Christmas song, and

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,840
 I messed the one of them up.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,480
 And yeah, within 40 minutes, the video got taken out from Facebook, which is fine, whatever.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,960
 I didn't know the song had a copyright.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,960
 I thought it was a super old Christmas song.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,080
 I had to go and re-edit the podcast.

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,800
 The YouTube version still has me singing that song, but it's only a matter of time before

30
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
 they think.

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,840
 It's weird how quickly the bot can find that.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,400
 Because I don't think someone working for NBC, which is the copyright holder, was listening

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,360
 to the podcast for maybe.

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,440
 If it's a bot though, I'd like to say just hear this next episode of this podcast we're

35
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,840
 going to have, because I think it would be great.

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,520
 I wonder if how many notes it takes to trigger the bot.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,520
 Who knows?

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,240
 I guess we'll find out if it gets me when I go just hear those stories that we're about

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
 to talk about.

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,960
 The first story is a new Christmas tradition.

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,200
 So let's all cuddle around the fire.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
 Come here.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 I'll hold you.

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
 I'll swaddle you.

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
 I've been swaddling you guys lately.

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
 Come here.

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
 Yeah, get on my, come on.

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
 I put a little blanket.

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
 We got a shared blanket.

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
 We're drinking cocoa.

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,960
 I'm drinking keto cocoa, which is just water.

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,360
 It's just brown water, toasting to each other.

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
 We're sitting around the fireplace.

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,880
 It is time for a new Christmas tradition.

55
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,800
 Apparently this is a thing now.

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,320
 We're going to sit right here.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
 Hold my cup.

58
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
 Hold my cup of hot cocoa.

59
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,120
 My cup of hot brown water.

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,720
 Hey, let me get my YouTube video set up here.

61
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 We are going to watch the newest Kevin Spacey Christmas video.

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,960
 This is so bizarre.

63
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,400
 So last Christmas, he released a video called Let Me Be Frank, and I did an episode on it.

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,480
 It's one of my most watched episodes on YouTube.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,000
 And it was just people who were like, "What?

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 You're an idiot.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
 Kevin Spacey's member of the Illuminati."

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,820
 Yeah, yeah, sure.

69
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,680
 But anyways, I was just like, "This guy's a lunatic.

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,880
 He releases this video like five, six hours later.

71
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,240
 He gets charged with sexually assaulting some 18-year-old dude in New York, and we'll get

72
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
 into all that."

73
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,960
 But anyways, so that was weird.

74
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
 That whole thing was weird.

75
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,320
 And then this pops up.

76
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
 And also heads up to Chris Kay.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,320
 He's the founder of the Golden Rabbit Brigade.

78
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,720
 I was wondering whether or not to cover this story, because I just thought it was a weird

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
 thing.

80
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,920
 And he's like, "Hey, you know, here's some weird details."

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,560
 So I looked into it a little more.

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,800
 So thanks, Chris.

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 This is the video.

84
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,680
 This is the transcript, because I don't want to get demonetized.

85
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
 Here's the video.

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
 This is him.

87
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,120
 So we're sitting in front of a fireplace, and it's very meta, because we're watching

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,360
 Kevin Spacey sit in front of a fireplace as well.

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
 And this is what he says.

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,400
 You didn't-- and the only reason I'm reading all of this, because I think there might be

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,880
 some clues to what I don't know.

92
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,440
 This whole thing is so bizarre.

93
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,600
 Let me just read it to you.

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,880
 "You didn't really think I was going to miss the opportunity to wish you a merry Christmas,

95
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
 did you?"

96
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,960
 And you're like, "Jason, that's the worst Kevin Spacey impression possible."

97
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,920
 I'm not-- he's doing his character Frank Underwood from House of Cards, who has this

98
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
 weird southern drawl.

99
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,480
 It's still a bad impression.

100
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,520
 Not excusing it, but don't-- I don't want you to think that's how I imagined Kevin Spacey

101
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
 talking.

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
 Okay.

103
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,440
 "You didn't really think I was going to miss the opportunity to wish you a merry Christmas,

104
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
 did you?"

105
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,720
 "It's been a pretty good year."

106
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
 Okay.

107
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
 That's important.

108
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,640
 We're going to get into that.

109
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,000
 It's been a pretty good year, and I'm grateful to have my health back.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,080
 And in light of that, I've made some changes in my life, and I'd like to invite you to

111
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,680
 join me.

112
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,640
 As we walk into 2020, I want to cast my vote for...

113
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,040
 More Good in this world.

114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,480
 He does start doing these pauses at key points here.

115
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,280
 Ah, yes.

116
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,880
 I know what you're thinking.

117
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,400
 Can he be serious?

118
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,160
 In this point, he pokes at the fire.

119
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,520
 There's another pause as he's poking at the fire.

120
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
 Ah, yes.

121
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,600
 I know what you're thinking.

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,560
 Can he be serious?

123
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,040
 I'm dead serious.

124
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,880
 And it's not that hard, trust me.

125
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,560
 The next time someone does something you don't like, you can go on the attack.

126
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,360
 But you can also hold your fire and do the unexpected.

127
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:43,400
 You can kill them with kindness.

128
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,120
 And then that weird musical cue you just heard is in the video.

129
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
 That wasn't a joke.

130
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
 That wasn't something I edited in.

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,920
 The weird creepy evil musical cue happens right after he says "kill them with kindness".

132
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
 So I...

133
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,480
 That was not a funny gimmick that I was doing.

134
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
 Now, let's...

135
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,960
 So this is super bizarre.

136
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,440
 So when he came out with the first video, people thought this was the thing.

137
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,600
 He was releasing it to let the elite know that if you have me thrown in jail or if I

138
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,640
 get punished, I'm going to spill all my secrets.

139
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,480
 It was a warning shot to the Illuminati.

140
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,200
 In the video, he was holding a mug that he got from the Tower of England gift shop.

141
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,920
 Anyone can buy these, by the way.

142
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,560
 But it was a sign that he was threatening the Queen of England.

143
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,600
 If he goes down, everyone goes down all this stuff.

144
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,360
 And it's funny because now we know that Prince Andrew was tied up into Epstein.

145
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
 And that wasn't...

146
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,480
 People who followed Epstein knew about that back then, but now that's public knowledge.

147
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,880
 So that can be tied back into it.

148
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,840
 All these people that knew of him, he knew of stuff, Kevin Spacey.

149
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,520
 All the people he knew about Kevin Spacey's dollyances.

150
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
 He knows about them.

151
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,480
 And if I go down, you all go down stuff like that.

152
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,480
 People saw it as a threat against the elite.

153
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,880
 Now he says in this, "It's been a pretty good year."

154
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,840
 And it actually has for Kevin Spacey.

155
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,640
 Now Kevin Spacey, all the charges against them are alleged.

156
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,760
 But he started off the year in not a very good spot.

157
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,760
 Because in 2017, he was accused by actor Anthony Rapp of sexual assault when Anthony was only

158
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,160
 14 years old.

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,960
 And this was really one of the big gets for the Me Too movement was Kevin Spacey.

160
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,920
 And funny looking back, they didn't get many.

161
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,160
 You got Harvey Weinstein.

162
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,680
 You got Spacey.

163
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,720
 And then Bill Cosby.

164
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,320
 And now R. Kelly.

165
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
 Stuff like that.

166
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,040
 But it's kind of winded down since then.

167
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
 Matt Lauer.

168
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
 That one was creepy.

169
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
 With the door.

170
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 He had the door.

171
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
 He'd press it.

172
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,200
 But these guys are like super villains, really.

173
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,520
 Women would come into his office and Matt Lauer would hit a button.

174
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
 Allegedly.

175
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
 And the door would shut behind him.

176
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,960
 Charlie Rose got caught up in this.

177
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,160
 So there was a lot of big dudes who got netted up in this.

178
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,440
 But for the most part, maybe what like 5, 10 people total went down.

179
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,400
 Kevin Spacey I think was the only one who was gay who got caught up in this.

180
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,440
 George Takai came real, real close.

181
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,920
 But people were like whatever.

182
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
 People kind of dismissed that.

183
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,120
 Which sucks for the guy who accused George Takai.

184
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,240
 So I just want to get all that out of the way.

185
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,440
 Let's get into the actual interesting conspiracy stuff in it.

186
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,880
 So it has been a good year for Kevin Spacey.

187
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,840
 When he released that last video, like I said, that same day he got indicted for sexual assaulting

188
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,760
 this 18 year old dude.

189
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,160
 And those charges have been dropped.

190
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,200
 Because what happened was the dude wouldn't turn over the cell phone because the defense

191
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,480
 lawyers wanted to see what was on the cell phone because they were texting each other

192
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
 back and forth.

193
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,080
 Allegedly Kevin Spacey groped this dude.

194
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,180
 And so they go we want to see your cell phone.

195
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,240
 We know you were texting throughout the night.

196
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,040
 The dude throws the cell phone away.

197
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
 You can't find the cell phone.

198
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,560
 The mom admits when she goes to the police that she had personally deleted text from

199
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,800
 the phone.

200
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,480
 Kevin Spacey denied it when the young man took the stand.

201
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
 He took the fifth.

202
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,000
 And so all the charges were dropped.

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,800
 So it was that part of it was a good year for Kevin Spacey.

204
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
 He's been charged.

205
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 He's had like 20 accusations in one theater group alone.

206
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
 Young men coming forward and saying, so he was kicked out of his theater in England and

207
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
 all that stuff.

208
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,080
 But this was really the only charge, like legal charge that he was facing as of right

209
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
 now.

210
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
 Anthony Rapp when he reported it.

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
 And so this happened to me when I was 14 years old.

212
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
 That was it.

213
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
 He didn't have any charges or anything like that.

214
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
 He was just coming forward.

215
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,080
 He felt that it was time because all these other people are coming forward with all those

216
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,280
 experiences with older people in power.

217
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,420
 So this was the only criminal charge he was facing.

218
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,880
 So it has been a good year.

219
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,360
 However, there's been some other odd things that have happened this year.

220
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,080
 Now for one, the biggest, the one that everyone obviously probably knows about at this point

221
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:54,040
 is he released this video on the 24th and on the 25th, one of his accusers committed

222
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
 suicide.

223
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,360
 So a day after he released the video, one of his accusers committed suicide, suicide

224
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,240
 like Epstein.

225
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,520
 We'll explore that in a second.

226
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,360
 We'll explore that in a second, but check this out first.

227
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,000
 That's not the only Spacey accuser to die this year.

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,320
 Let's go back to September 2019.

229
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,320
 An unnamed man who accused Kevin Spacey.

230
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,160
 It was a masseuse who accused Kevin Spacey of kissing him against his will and forcing

231
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,040
 him to grab Kevin Spacey's genitals was currently involved in a lawsuit with Kevin Spacey.

232
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,040
 I don't believe it was a criminal charge, but was currently engaged in a legal matter

233
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
 with Kevin Spacey.

234
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,840
 September 2019, this unnamed man dies.

235
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:45,200
 And within like a couple weeks, Kevin Spacey's lawyers motion to have the suit dismissed.

236
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,320
 And people are kind of like, yeah, we get it, you can do that, but you know, generally

237
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
 it's up to 90 days you can do that or whatever.

238
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,840
 They moved on it really quickly.

239
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
 That was done.

240
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,840
 Now the question is, was how did this dude die?

241
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,420
 Now on Wikipedia it says this young unnamed man died of cancer, but I read article after

242
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,600
 article after article that just said this guy died.

243
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,320
 The only thing I could find saying that this guy died of cancer was a variety article.

244
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,120
 And if you look in the comments and all this stuff is in the show notes, when you look

245
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,920
 in the comments of the variety article, it says the original version of this article

246
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,960
 did not mention cancer.

247
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
 It was added later.

248
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,360
 That's what one of the commenters said.

249
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,600
 They were saying they were on the article earlier and it didn't say how he died and

250
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,760
 then was updated.

251
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,400
 In the variety article it says a source tells variety he died of cancer.

252
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,960
 It's odd because it says on Wikipedia he died of cancer.

253
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,280
 Every other article I read just said he died, he died, he died, he died.

254
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:48,440
 It wasn't until I typed in "Kevin Spacey, lawsuit, cancer, was I able to find an article

255
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,280
 that actually specified he died of cancer?"

256
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,800
 That's how hard it is to find that.

257
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,440
 So it almost is like the only people who say that he died of cancer is variety.

258
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,280
 It's weird because you would think if you had cancer, this might be bizarre, I've never

259
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,840
 had cancer, but if you had cancer you would either record all of your testimony up ahead

260
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
 of time.

261
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,880
 So if you died of cancer the lawsuit could still go through and then your family could

262
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
 reap the benefits.

263
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,360
 Or if it was a criminal trial, cops definitely want that information before you pass away.

264
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,440
 That should be enough.

265
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,840
 If you are dying of a disease and then you die they don't just go "pfft" trials over

266
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
 like you can leave evidence.

267
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,560
 So if he really died of cancer, which I mean it's not like you wake up one day and you're

268
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,520
 like "ooh my back hurts" and then you just die of cancer that day.

269
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,440
 It's a progression, it might be a couple weeks, but so that's weird.

270
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,360
 But it's possible he died of cancer, even though only one person reports that and we

271
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
 don't know who the person is.

272
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,720
 But that lawsuit's gone, young man has passed away.

273
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,400
 In 2019 as well, in other, this one was really weird because I didn't know about this one.

274
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,320
 I knew about the masseuse and I knew about the guy who just passed away, committed suicide

275
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,080
 just a day or two ago.

276
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,760
 But I didn't know about this one until I really started looking into this.

277
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,360
 2019, May, May 2nd 2019.

278
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,960
 So there's a woman or was a woman named Linda Culkin who actually accused him of sexual

279
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,360
 assault back in 2009, so way before me too.

280
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,000
 And on May 2nd 2019 in Quincy, Massachusetts, she walks across the street while traffic

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,160
 has a green light and is just ran over, killed on the scene.

282
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,880
 Now people were like, she's just like, she just walked into traffic.

283
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
 Suicide?

284
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
 Who knows?

285
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,600
 Accidental, daydreamin' and listening to music, who knows?

286
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,400
 But the fact of the matter is she walked while she had a red light, while traffic had a green

287
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,440
 light and she was killed on the scene.

288
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,400
 Now you're like, wait a second, Linda, that's a girl's name, why is she accusing Kevin Spacey?

289
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,080
 Kevin Spacey didn't sexually assault her.

290
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,280
 Back in 2009 she was a nursing assistant.

291
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,800
 And one of her patients said, you know, Kevin Spacey sexually assaulted me and she apparently

292
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 went nuts.

293
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,440
 This is a really, really weird story here.

294
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,120
 Never heard any of this before.

295
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,880
 2009, she gets this information, I don't know if I'll have time for the Bigfoot story,

296
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,000
 we're gonna see, because this is a really, really conspiratorial world we're going into.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,760
 So in 2009, she hears that one of her patients was sexually assaulted by Kevin Spacey, allegedly.

298
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,240
 And then, alleged everything, alleged everything, okay?

299
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,240
 So because we're gonna get even weirder stuff going on.

300
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:45,080
 So what happened was, she hears this story and she begins cyber stalking Kevin Spacey

301
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,280
 to the point where she begins calling in bomb threats, harassing him and his associates,

302
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,720
 and then mailing white powder to them as well, anthrax.

303
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,400
 Basically a terror campaign against them.

304
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,160
 She was actually, this whole thing went on back in 2009, she was doing this stuff, she

305
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:11,320
 was harassing him, she gets arrested, taken to trial, found guilty, serves 51 months in

306
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,080
 prison because of this.

307
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,900
 And that happened in 2014 when she got arrested and went to prison.

308
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,960
 So about a five year time span, she was involved in this terror campaign.

309
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,880
 Now she gets out, obviously, Cartes and Hitter in prison, she gets out, gets ran over.

310
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,280
 Now you'd have to think she's probably pretty validated when Anthony Rapp came forward and

311
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,680
 admitted that, and then you have all these other people admitting to the sexual assault

312
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,120
 allegations against Spacey.

313
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,280
 So she's like, "Oh, proof, but she dies this year too."

314
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:46,440
 So now you have three people who died this year who are connected to accusing Kevin Spacey

315
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,680
 of sexual assault.

316
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,440
 So when he says something like, "It's been a pretty good year," in his video, it has

317
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,980
 been for him, but not for those three people.

318
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,540
 But this is an interesting side note to this whole thing.

319
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,680
 Let's take a look at the actual, so we know what Linda's story was, we know about the

320
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,340
 unnamed masseuse.

321
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,940
 Let's take a look at this most recent guy.

322
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,140
 This guy's name is Ari Bin.

323
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,580
 Was Ari Bin.

324
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,900
 And he killed himself on Christmas Day, a day after this video was released.

325
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,000
 Now, obviously, that was one thing, Chris K. When I saw that too, I was like, "Well, that's

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,480
 suspicious," obviously.

327
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,820
 Let's take a look at Ari Bin and what's going on here.

328
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,100
 So Ari Bin was married to a Norwegian princess.

329
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,540
 And they'd been married from, I think, 2002 to 2017.

330
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
 They're separating.

331
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,940
 They had gotten a divorce in 2018.

332
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,140
 They had two kids together.

333
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,140
 And after this whole thing came out about Kevin Spacey doing all this creepy stuff, Ari

334
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,460
 Bin gave an interview with a radio station, a Norwegian radio station called P4.

335
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,700
 And this is the story that he told.

336
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,820
 He meets Kevin Spacey at a dinner for Nobel Prize winners or Nobel Prize nominees or something

337
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
 like that.

338
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,140
 High-level, high-falutin people, hobnob and doing rich people stuff.

339
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,340
 Ari Bin's there.

340
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,140
 He's still married to his wife this time.

341
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,660
 And here's his quote.

342
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,260
 We had a nice conversation.

343
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,460
 He was sitting right next to me.

344
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,540
 After five minutes, he says, "Hey, let's go out and have a cigarette."

345
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,140
 And then he takes me under the table in the middle of my balls.

346
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,940
 I got more than I bargained for.

347
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,780
 And then he starts kind of chuckling in the radio interview.

348
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,740
 And then he says, "Eh, maybe later.

349
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,180
 I had black hair back then and was 10 years younger, so was right up his alley."

350
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,180
 So first off, that's a burn, basically saying that, yeah, he likes him young and I looked

351
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,460
 kind of young back then.

352
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,100
 The guy's a total creep.

353
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,860
 But the idea of him just being like, yeah, you know, we're sitting there talking.

354
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,060
 He grabbed my balls and I was like, no, maybe later and just kind of blew it off as a joke

355
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,860
 and went on with my evening.

356
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,260
 That's important to this narrative.

357
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,540
 So yes, was he sexually assaulted?

358
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,340
 According to the story, did Kevin Spacey sexually assault him?

359
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,220
 Yes, just because you laughed it off doesn't mean it's not a sexual assault.

360
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,220
 Still sexual assault.

361
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,460
 The guy grabbed his genitals and was trying to get him to do something sexual and grabbed

362
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,460
 him in sexual spots.

363
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,580
 Still sexual assault.

364
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,060
 So the fact that he laughs it off doesn't make an okay.

365
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,380
 Shouldn't be grabbing people in the genitals.

366
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,100
 You really shouldn't be touching people at all unless you're comfortable with them.

367
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,780
 They're comfortable with you and all that sort of stuff.

368
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,660
 In the moment when someone does that or you're telling the story afterwards, you're like,

369
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,860
 yeah, that guy was a total creep, man.

370
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,940
 He reached down and he grabbed my balls and asked me to go outside.

371
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,700
 I was like, nah, that's cool.

372
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,060
 And then you laugh about it with your buddy.

373
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,580
 You're like, yeah, that guy's a total pervert.

374
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
 Still sexual assault.

375
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,820
 Just because he laughs about it after the fact, even telling the story years later, doesn't

376
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,060
 minimize it.

377
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:52,460
 What I think is interesting is classifying this guy as a Kevin Spacey accuser.

378
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,180
 I think it's putting him into people who are taking him to court.

379
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,700
 So the headlines that are saying Kevin Spacey accuser and most of the articles that talk

380
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,460
 about this don't say specifically how he's telling the story.

381
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,340
 Again, yes, it's 100% still sexual assault.

382
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,540
 I'm not denying that whatsoever.

383
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:17,260
 However, I would not place him in the same category as these men who are taking him to

384
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,820
 court or Anthony Rapp.

385
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,460
 That sucked.

386
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:28,220
 When I read Anthony Rapp's article about what Kevin Spacey did to him, it was really sad.

387
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,780
 That's going to be in the show notes and I really recommend people to read it because it's a

388
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:39,220
 really, really interesting read about a young man who is basically taking advantage of.

389
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,820
 And you're reading it first person.

390
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,180
 Very, very well-written, compelling, true life story.

391
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,260
 And I don't think Ari Bin fits into that.

392
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,820
 Yes, 100% sexual assault.

393
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,580
 And I'm not saying, oh no, it's okay.

394
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
 He laughed about it.

395
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,580
 I'm not saying that at all.

396
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,860
 What I'm saying is that the narrative is being constructed that people who accuse him of a

397
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,780
 crime are being killed.

398
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:08,060
 He has, like I said earlier, at least 20 people in one theater company who are accusing him

399
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
 of this.

400
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,180
 Now it's possible they're disappearing like ducks in a pond.

401
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,180
 That doesn't make sense.

402
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,620
 It could be that they're disappearing, or just disappearing.

403
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,900
 Doesn't need a metaphor.

404
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,460
 And we're not hearing about it, possibly.

405
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,060
 What I think actually happened here is terrible coincidence.

406
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,860
 And I know you're like Jason, not again.

407
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,140
 You use the coincidence card all the time.

408
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,660
 Hear me out.

409
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,180
 I think that Kevin Spacey made this, but here's, there's two ways to look at this.

410
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:43,820
 Kevin Spacey made a weird video and a man who's recently separated from his wife of

411
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:52,180
 15 years on Christmas kills himself, which unfortunately fits all the statistics.

412
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,020
 Male suicides are higher than women suicides.

413
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,980
 Suicides are higher in holiday times.

414
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,620
 Men who are suffering from emotional trauma separated from their kids are more likely

415
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,660
 to kill themselves and he's a middle-aged man.

416
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,980
 All of these things are risk factors for being a suicide victim.

417
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:18,340
 It's only, it would be what, his second Christmas away from his family.

418
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,940
 Statistically, if he was 22 years old, totally happily, if PewDiePie accused Kevin Spacey

419
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,220
 of sexual assault and then killed himself this Christmas, that would be super suspicious.

420
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,020
 That would be incredibly suspicious because he doesn't have those markers.

421
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,380
 But this guy did.

422
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,700
 It's absolutely unfortunate.

423
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,860
 I feel like this narrative is being constructed because the only thing is using that term

424
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,420
 Kevin Spacey accuser, commit suicide, is the narrative we're being told.

425
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,740
 Now there's two options.

426
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,740
 Like I was saying, there's one.

427
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,900
 Kevin Spacey releases a weird video and the next day someone who meets all the risk factors

428
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,820
 for killing themselves kills themselves.

429
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:06,820
 Or two, Kevin Spacey releases this video and somebody off to this guy, somebody killed

430
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,060
 this guy.

431
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,620
 That's not impossible.

432
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,740
 I'm not saying that it's not impossible.

433
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:19,740
 It's definitely possible, but I think it's unlikely because here's the key to this whole

434
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,240
 thing.

435
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,780
 We look at this all the time.

436
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,340
 They go, "Oh, the movie The Exorcist is cursed."

437
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,180
 And people died working on The Exorcist.

438
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,180
 Oh really?

439
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:37,740
 Yeah, the guy's uncle, the cinematographer's uncle, died in a car crash three years after

440
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,240
 the accident.

441
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,700
 Linda Blair is still alive as of recording this podcast.

442
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,160
 So if the main players are still around, is there really a curse?

443
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,440
 If Kevin Spacey is bumping off people who accuse him of this stuff, who's the number

444
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,760
 one accuser?

445
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,480
 Anthony Rapp.

446
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,880
 Still around.

447
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,560
 Still has a career as of the recording of this podcast.

448
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:11,880
 So the fact that these secondary or titiuary, is that the word?

449
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:19,360
 Because in this game, doesn't really play into the narrative.

450
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,720
 I personally think Kevin Spacey made a weirdo video and then this guy killed himself.

451
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,320
 I think that's the most likely scenario.

452
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,600
 Obviously, I could be wrong if they could be connected.

453
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
 Kevin Spacey could have been behind Epstein's murder.

454
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
 I'm sure Kevin Spacey and Epstein knew each other.

455
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
 Can't prove that.

456
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,360
 I'm sure they ran on the same circles, along with all these other open secret weirdos and

457
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,760
 Hollywood and things like that.

458
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,800
 I think a more suspicious thing is the woman who accuses Kevin Spacey and then gets thrown

459
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,440
 in jail for 51 months.

460
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,480
 And you have to wonder, was she really going crazy or was she actually onto something and

461
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,680
 the powers that be made her look crazy and have her thrown in jail?

462
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,040
 Now again, the most logical answer is the woman was crazy.

463
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,480
 The most logical answer is she heard this allegation, she actually did these things,

464
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
 and she went to jail.

465
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,880
 However, a conspiracy theorist could say, "Oh no, no, she was totally sane."

466
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,560
 She found out that these allegations were true and on a quest for justice, the powers

467
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,640
 that be to cover up for Kevin Spacey's crimes had her thrown in jail.

468
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,320
 My answer to that, again, is then why didn't the same thing happen to Anthony Rapp?

469
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,800
 Because he easily could have disappeared.

470
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,080
 He could have easily gotten a cocaine charge the next day and then that would have been

471
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
 it.

472
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,920
 Or heroin charge before he even came forward.

473
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,600
 He submits the article to the website that it was originally published for.

474
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,960
 That editor is plugged into the powers that be, calls somebody up, someone says, "Don't

475
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
 publish that article."

476
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,040
 And then Anthony Rapp ends up in some rehab center.

477
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,520
 If these people are as powerful as the conspiracy theorists believe, because they are either

478
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,320
 all powerful and control Katy Perry, you do this song, you put this in your video, or

479
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,080
 they're not.

480
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,760
 They're either scared of Kevin Spacey revealing this information about the Queen of England

481
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,000
 and they have the ability to start pulling the levers of justice to make sure that he

482
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 gets off.

483
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,080
 They're either that powerful or they're basically just ordinary businessmen who can maybe make

484
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,760
 a phone call to a judge in Iowa.

485
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,880
 It's one or the other.

486
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,720
 So if they can have this woman wrongfully accused or in a jail, why did Anthony Rapp's story

487
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 ever get out there?

488
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,880
 If they can kill a member of the royal family, married to a Norwegian princess, if they can

489
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,360
 have him executed on Christmas Day, why is Anthony Rapp still running around?

490
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,040
 Or any of these other people?

491
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,540
 Or Harvey Weinstein, like you can't tell me that Kevin Spacey has more political power

492
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:52,080
 than Harvey Weinstein, or more political power than Matt Lauer, who would be far more

493
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,960
 connected into politics than some actor who played one on television.

494
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,240
 So the conspiracy theorists are either works or doesn't.

495
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
 I find the story fascinating.

496
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,240
 Oh, and I have to say this too, Chris Kay pointed this out.

497
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,280
 I don't know how he discovered this, but apparently just to put this all in a bigger

498
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:16,840
 bow, no pun intended, there's an ornament on the set for the Kevin Spacey video and

499
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,200
 there's a little piece of tassel in front of it, so it makes it look like the letter

500
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,120
 Q.

501
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,040
 So pulling this all into the Q mythology as well, where you have Donald Trump.

502
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:37,080
 supposedly has an agent or an ally, somebody named Q, and maybe Trump himself, and maybe

503
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,640
 his son Barron, and maybe someone in the administration.

504
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,880
 I know almost everyone's been rumored to be Q at this point.

505
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,840
 Basically someone who, the story is this, that Donald Trump is going to throw all of

506
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,680
 the child-listing Democrats in prison and like the impeachment and the Mueller report

507
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,320
 and all this, like the Mueller report was supposed to be this, and now we're getting

508
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,760
 into all this nonsense.

509
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,200
 The Mueller report was supposed to be really, Robert Mueller was investigating the Democrats,

510
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,480
 it was a cover, see, and when the report came out it was going to indict Hillary Clinton

511
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,680
 and Barack Obama and all these people for like child-listing and human trafficking and

512
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
 all this stuff.

513
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,200
 That obviously didn't happen.

514
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,680
 And then, could you imagine if it had, if it had, but anyways, drain the swamp, Q is,

515
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,160
 Trump's really going underground trying to root out all the corruption in America.

516
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,720
 He has done a lot of stuff into human trafficking, trying to shut down human trafficking and

517
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
 stuff like that.

518
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,480
 So, but Q really builds into this whole thing, like there's an inner war going on in Washington,

519
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,000
 D.C. and to that, there probably is honestly, we see little blips of it pop up here and

520
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 there in the news.

521
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,120
 I don't really believe in Q being an individual or a movement.

522
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,440
 He originally started off posting stuff on 4chan or somewhere and it was floating up

523
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,960
 to 4chan, clues and codes and all sorts of stuff.

524
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,360
 That stuff's still around.

525
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,360
 But anyways, so now Kevin Spacey's video is getting brought into this Q mythology as well.

526
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,800
 So is he Q?

527
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,720
 Is he sending a message to the actual Q to say maybe I'm on your side?

528
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,980
 Because he does say that thing about what I'm going to do in 2020 is my vote is to be

529
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,200
 nicer or something like that.

530
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,160
 Is that him throwing a bone to the Trump administration saying yes, Q, see this little Q and I'm saying

531
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,200
 I'm not going to be anti-Trump this year.

532
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,760
 You and me will work together, help drain the swamp.

533
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
 I know who the Chalmolisters are.

534
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,000
 You know who you think they are.

535
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I can give you proof.

536
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,120
 Is it a message to them?

537
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,360
 Let's kill them with kindness.

538
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
 Let's work together.

539
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,600
 All of this stuff from a one minute Kevin Spacey video.

540
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,760
 It's horrible that a man died on Christmas Day and obviously millions of people died

541
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,520
 all over the world on Christmas Day.

542
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,240
 It's not just because this guy's famous and in the news makes his death more important.

543
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
 I'm just, it's suck.

544
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
 Maybe not millions, 100,000.

545
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,120
 What I'm saying is that, it's not the point how many people died on Christmas.

546
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,560
 That's depressing.

547
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,360
 It sucks that this guy passed away.

548
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,320
 I don't necessarily think Kevin Spacey had anything to do with it.

549
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,000
 I'm not going to say 100% he didn't, but I would, if I had to bet money, I would assume

550
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,680
 it was just a man who would spend his second, maybe even his first Christmas away from his

551
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,520
 family and he saw a future of him not with the woman he loved and the kids that he cherished

552
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:27,240
 and he killed himself, which is unfortunately very, very, very common for men and women,

553
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,160
 but the risk factor is a lot higher for middle aged men.

554
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,680
 It's middle aged single men.

555
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
 It's much, much higher.

556
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,360
 So, terrible tragic story.

557
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,920
 I personally, and I've talked about this before, whenever we have stories where people kill

558
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,280
 themselves and it gets wrapped up into conspiracies, Anthony Bourdain was the same thing.

559
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,400
 I think we look at, I think to look at them and go, "Oh, it's because of this, that or

560
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
 the other thing."

561
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
 It's just that it's just that it's just that it's just that it's just that it's just that

562
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
 it's just that it's just that it's just that it's just that it's just that it's just that
