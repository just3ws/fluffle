00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 The following episode of Dead Rabbit Radio contains imagery that most humans would find disturbing.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Listener discretion is advised.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Babies. No matter who you are or where at in life, we all started off as a little tiny baby person.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Now some of us have had great lives and some of us have had horrible lives, but if you're listening to this podcast, you haven't been cooked alive.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And now we're going to take a look at several stories, some may say too many.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Whether we're talking about a true crime story where a mother put her own baby in the microwave in the middle of the night, all the way to Thailand, where a man was mass producing cooked babies.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 This is a weird episode.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 The idea of being cooked alive as an infant should strike terror into the hearts of any well-meaning, well-adjusted human being.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 But it turns out it's terrifyingly common today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I guess I should say welcome weirdos for the people who listened to that intro and said, "Oh, this is how I want to spend a half hour of my life listening about babies being cooked alive."

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 You know, it's funny.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I debated whether or not to do this episode.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I actually thought about splitting it up over the course of several episodes.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But I figured if I listen, if I got to talk about babies being cooked, I want to get it done.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And I do want to talk about it because we're going to uncover a conspiracy theory in this episode that is so chilling.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 It makes Pizza Gate look like Watergate.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Which is fine because that was just some guys turning doorknobs and trying to steal some files.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Like the conspiracy theory we're going to talk about at the end of this episode is so bizarre.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Well, let's go ahead and get into this episode and you'll notice we don't have any Patreon supporter.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 There's no one going to be flying us around.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 You're going to be the pilot today, you.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Because I don't think anyone wanted to be a Patreon exclusive supporter on this show.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 So, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Let's leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 We are headed all the way out to Somerville County, Texas.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 The reason why we're headed out to Somerville County is we're going to start our macabre world tour here.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 It's such a bizarre set of circumstances.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And I wanted to give a shout out to Miguel Lexito.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Miguel Lexito posted, there's a subreddit called Creepy Wikipedia.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And they posted a page and it was "Baby's Cooked! Baby's Cooked to Death!"

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 There's a Wikipedia page for everything.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And it talks about the urban legend and it talks about some true crime cases where this has actually happened.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So, first off, let's go over the urban legend if you're not familiar with that.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 This is the story of there's a teenage girl who likes to party,

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 but you know, everyone thinks she's kind of a square.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 She's a big old nerd. She's basically a lady on the streets, but a freak in the sheets.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And when I say sheets, I mean sheets of acid.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 The neighborhood people think that she's a totally normal girl,

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 so she gets invited to babysit this baby while the parents are going on a date.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And as the parents are leaving the house, the mom turns around and looks at this young woman and says,

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 "And don't forget, put the turkey in the oven and the baby to bed."

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And then they get in the car.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And actually now I'm thinking about that's weird. Why did they invite a babysitter to also cook the turkey?

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Why are they going on a date if they're going to have a full-sized turkey?

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 But anyways, this was the setup of the urban legend.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 It's really like an anti-drug message.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So, the parents leave and then the girl goes,

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 "Oh yeah, totally. Put the turkey in the oven and the baby to bed."

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 So she's playing with the baby and then it's kind of boring, right?

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 She's drinking the bottle. She's like, "Ah, come on, this sucks, baby person. Do something cool."

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 But since the baby's kind of dumb because it's a baby, you can't do anything cool,

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 the babysitter does what she knows best. She does copious amounts of acid.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 "One pill makes you smaller."

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 She's eating it. She's just sitting there back on the couch watching Archie Bunker.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Dude, that would suck. Could you imagine doing acid back in the 60s?

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Nowadays, you can at least get stoned and watch the righteous gemstones.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 But imagine like back then getting stoned and you're like,

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 "Uh, all that's on is Archie Bunker's show or whatever that was, like the Smothers Brothers.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Maybe the only way you can tolerate those shows is with drugs."

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Anyway, she's doing a bunch of acid and halfway through a trip, she's like,

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 "Oh, I gotta do what my boss said. I gotta do those two things."

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 So eventually, the parents come back home from their date and they go out to dinner.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 They're like, "Ugh, man, that sure was a lot of food, but I can't wait to get home and eat that fully cooked turkey."

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 They were the original members of my 600-pound life.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 They come home and they open the door and they smell a scent that they're not used to.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's actually kind of repulsive. They're like, "Oh, where'd you buy that turkey at?"

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It smells super disgusting.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 They say to babysitter, she's still just kind of sitting on the couch,

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 kind of moving side to side to the theme song of "Mash."

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 She's like, "There's not enough drugs to make this show funny."

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And the parents come in and they're like, "Oh, the house is super stinky, but I don't know."

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And the mom goes up to check on the baby and when she goes upstairs, there's a turkey in the bed.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 A frozen turkey slowly thawing out in the bed.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And the mom starts screaming because she knows what this means.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 She runs downstairs and opens up the oven and inside of it is her baby.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 No!

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 [humming]

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 This is the episode where I totally get all these copyright strikes.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 That's the urban legend. I remember hearing that as a kid.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 It wasn't when that super scared me because I wasn't a baby.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And I think it was meant for older people.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 The moral of the story, urban legends tend to have these morals, right?

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 The moral of the story is this one is, one, don't do acid if you are babysitting.

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I think the moral of the story is don't do acid at all, but definitely don't do acid while you're babysitting.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And if you do hire babysitters, drug test them, I guess, as the lesson, or just be careful of who you're hiring.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So anyway, I wasn't scared that I remember hearing that story.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 It's like, "Eh, whatever."

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 So fast forward. It's an urban legend that pops up quite a lot.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I'm forward all the way to now I'm 46 years old. I think I am.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I'm 46 years old. I find this Wikipedia article and I go, "Oh, yeah. The roasted baby urban legend."

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I wonder if there's any truth to that.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 What's interesting, it's not odd that there is.

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Unfortunately, when you sit back and think about it, you go,

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 "Yeah, I could see somebody accidentally or on purpose cooking a baby."

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 You're like, "Jason, who could accidentally cook a baby other than a drug addict?"

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Well, stick around. Stick around.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Or don't. Or don't keep your innocence.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 What's really interesting is that this has only happened as far as we can tell, at least in America.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 This has only happened maybe six times throughout modern American history, six times.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And we're, I'm not saying that people haven't burned babies and stuff like that.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I'm talking about the idea of actually putting a baby in an oven.

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 It hasn't happened a lot. It really hasn't happened a lot.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 So let's take a look at some of these cases here.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 We're pulling up to Somerville County, Texas, and it's March 2016.

108
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And in that month, there's a woman named Tasha Hatcher.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 She's 34 years old. She's high on alcohol.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Look, look, look, look, look. Mary Jane.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Oh, the dubi hit so hard.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And methamphetamine. Oh, the shadow people.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 The shadow people. I don't know. I mean, she's injecting it maybe, maybe smoking it.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 She's, that's a bad combination. Alcohol, weed, that's one thing.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 But add that methamphetamine. And she's freaking out.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 She's running around the house. She shoots her cat, throws it in the oven,

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 cooking her cat. Then she takes her daughter, throws her in the oven.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 And now she's cooking both the daughter and the cat.

119
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And what's odd about this, odd about this other than the fact that she just did this horrible thing,

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 is she snaps out of it. She takes her daughter whose hat, she's still alive.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And Tasha is alive in this one. She pulls her daughter out, but she suffered some pretty bad burns,

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 and begins running around the neighborhood with her daughter.

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And Tasha, she's completely nude. She takes her daughter out of the oven,

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 is running around the neighborhood. She basically thinks she's a domino pizza delivery man.

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 She's running around the neighborhood, holding her daughter.

126
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 She goes to the neighbor's house and she says, "Something happened, something happened. I don't know what it was."

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Could have been the meth. Could have been the fact that I'm totally high, but my daughter got cooked.

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And the police show up and then she immediately starts like flirting with the cops.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Which listen, I've had some girls flirt with me that I really wasn't into,

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 but none of them were nude, holding their half-cooked daughter.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 So I can imagine how awkward the police were.

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 The girl is totally fine. The girl is absolutely fine.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 The mom got 20 years in prison for this. She half-cooked her daughter. She got 20 years.

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And remember this happened in 2016, so she's going to be in there for a while.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Here's a little sad, a sad addition to this story.

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 When I was going through it, I was looking through some of the news articles about this.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 They hosted a GoFundMe for the daughter who got a chart.

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 It only raised $150.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And I know you're reaching for your wallet right now. You can't donate this, but GoFundMe is cancelled now.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 But isn't that awful? You see all these other ones where people are like, "Oh no, my shoes fell off.

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Can you buy me new shoes?" And he gets like $10,000. This poor girl was thrown in an oven to buy her mom

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 with a dead cat inside the oven. Only got $150.

143
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Now let's drive to... let's drive just a little bit further. Now we're in Houston, Texas.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 In 2015, we're going to go back a little bit, there's a young girl, a little baby girl, 19-month-old,

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 named Jazaira Thompson.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And she is put into the oven, and unfortunately, Jazaira dies.

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 She is fully cooked alive in this oven.

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 What happened was... it wasn't her mom who put her in the oven. It wasn't a babysitter who put her in the oven.

149
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 The mom and the mom's boyfriend had a history of leaving their children alone.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 They have four children in total, and they have a history of leaving their children alone.

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 They live in this apartment complex. Jazaira's grandma lives in this apartment complex, right?

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 At any point they could ask grandma to come and watch the kids, but they're not doing it.

153
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Jazaira's mom and her boyfriend are gallivanting around town, and she leaves the kids home all the time.

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 On this particular time, the mother and the boyfriend went to Domino's Pizza

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 to go get some delicious food, and while they are gone, Jazaira's own three-year-old sibling

156
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 put her in the oven and turned it on.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And her other two siblings watched as they cooked a 19-month-old baby.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 The boyfriend and the mom, they got charged with child endangerment.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 They both got 12 years in prison for that. For leaving those kids alone, they got charged.

160
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And that, I think, is... I mean, honestly, I think the sentence could be bigger,

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 but definitely they should have been punished for that.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And here you go, Jason. This is interesting because we're starting to see a bit of a trend here.

163
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 The urban legend is about a babysitter. It's about an outsider coming in to your home.

164
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 It turns out, like I said, there's about five or six cases within the United States.

165
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 I'm not going to go over all of them. I'm not that grim of a person.

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 They're all family members. Every single time a baby has been cooked alive in an oven or a microwave,

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 in the United States, it's been done by a family member.

168
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Let's take a look at the earliest known account of a baby being stuffed into a microwave.

169
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Jason, please. Please don't. This is where we get those first two.

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 They're horrible tragedies. They're what we call local news stories.

171
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 But this next one actually sets some precedent.

172
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 This next story really delves into the true crime aspect of what?

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I mean, this is a fascinating story, so I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

174
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 To my non-existent listener, you can catch him in your ghost hand.

175
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 We're headed out to Rural, Virginia.

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It's September 23rd, 1999. There's a young mother named Elizabeth Ott.

177
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 She's 19 years old. And one month ago, she had a little baby boy, Joseph Luis Martinez.

178
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 She wakes up pretty early in the morning, like four or five in the morning.

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 There's a panic in the house. No one can find little Joseph.

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 They look everywhere for the kid. Can't find him. End up calling the police. The police show up.

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Now the police are searching the house. Joseph, Joseph, where are you?

182
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Everyone's looking around. And Elizabeth is like groggy. She just got woken up.

183
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Hey, your son's missing. She's looking for him. Everyone's in a state of panic.

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 One of the people searching for Joseph was his aunt.

185
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And as everyone's looking around, for whatever reason, for whatever reason,

186
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 maybe she had a gut instinct that this is where Joseph was.

187
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Maybe she wanted to warm up some coffee.

188
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 She opens the microwave and inside is the cooked remains of Joseph.

189
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 So they found Joseph and now it's a criminal issue. They begin investigating it.

190
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And what they discover is Elizabeth Ott in the middle of the night.

191
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 This all came out during the trial. Elizabeth Ott in the middle of the night woke up to feed her baby.

192
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And in the morning, they found the baby in the microwave and a bottle of milk sitting on the counter.

193
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 What she said is she goes, "Okay, this is the only thing that I could think of would happen."

194
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I took the baby and I took the milk and I wanted to warm up the milk on the microwave.

195
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 It's weird how closely this is to a fictionalized story.

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I wanted to warm up the milk on the microwave and feed it to my baby, but I have a history of epileptic seizures.

197
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And the only thing I can think of is in the middle of the night when I was groggy, I had an epileptic seizure.

198
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And I accidentally put the milk on the counter where I was going to feed my baby and put the baby in the microwave.

199
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And then I was got confused and I went upstairs.

200
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 It sounds so fake. It sounds exactly like the urban legend we've all heard.

201
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And this was her court defense she was facing charges of, I think it was manslaughter is what she was facing.

202
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 They started bringing in experts in neurology and epilepsy and things like that.

203
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And the experts were split on this issue. You had people saying, "This is completely impossible.

204
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 There's no way when you have an epileptic seizure, you have a hard time doing even common things."

205
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 They said, "Tying your shoes would be difficult."

206
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And I'm not talking like as you're having the seizure, anything is going to be difficult then,

207
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 but after the seizure, when you're in that confused state, they say, "Doing something complex,

208
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 which would be like driving a car, tying your shoes, making a meal."

209
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 You don't have those type of skills.

210
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 But then the other side, you had people for the defense saying, "I agree with the prosecution."

211
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It's so weird. They go, "I agree with the prosecution."

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 You shouldn't be able to do this. However, it could happen.

213
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 You had expert after expert saying, you had expert after expert using words like,

214
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 "Exceedingly rare" or "Highly unlikely." And that was the defense.

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Now those were the best experts the defense could, they go, "Listen,

216
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 it's a crazy world out there. Is it possible?"

217
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 It's highly unlikely, but it's possible.

218
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 You had other people saying that she was acting really weird the next morning,

219
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 apparently like her boyfriend, who was the father of Joseph.

220
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 As everyone was freaking out after they found the baby, they go,

221
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 "She was acting kind of weird and she told her boyfriend,

222
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 'Don't worry, don't worry, we can have another one.'"

223
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 People thought that was a little weird, was she trying to console her boyfriend,

224
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 or was, "Did she mean to cook her baby?"

225
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Someone also said she also was accused of threatening to kill her boyfriend's grandma

226
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 because the grandma was accusing her of murder. So who knows?

227
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 High tensions, who knows?

228
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 But actually, as all these court proceedings were going on, she ends up pleading,

229
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 "No contest." She gets 10 years with five years suspended.

230
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 So she only does five years in prison for cooking her baby alive.

231
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Now remember, she didn't deny it. She just said she didn't mean to do it.

232
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 What's interesting is a year later, again, this is exceedingly rare.

233
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 It's highly unlikely. A year later in Holland, a six-week-old girl is cooked in a microwave

234
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 one year after the case of Elizabeth Ott.

235
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Her argument? "Your honor, I have seizures. I had an epileptic seizure,

236
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and I went to warm up the bottle and I put the baby in the microwave instead."

237
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 She wasn't even charged in Holland. She faced no charges.

238
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It's interesting because you think Elizabeth Ott, she may or may not have meant to kill her child, right?

239
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It could be post-partum depression, she could be an awful human.

240
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 It could also have been an accident. It could have been exceedingly rare,

241
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 but it's either way, it's probably pretty likely she inspired the Holland incident.

242
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Because this would be an easy thing to get away with, right?

243
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Now that there had been precedent set, now they go, "Well, maybe it isn't exceedingly rare.

244
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 We had it happen in 1999. Oh, now we had another one happen in Holland."

245
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 If you wanted to get rid of your baby and you had a series of epileptic fits, seizures,

246
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 and you have a history of them, it's possible that would be a way to get...

247
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 It's horrible, though.

248
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Horrible, horrible story, but it's so fascinating how we have this urban legend turned, true crime,

249
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 turned precedent setting criminal case.

250
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And if that was it, if that was the only thing we were going to talk about as far as roasting babies,

251
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I actually would have put it into some other episode.

252
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I think that's very fascinating, but I would have tacked it on to another episode,

253
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 but I don't even think that's the darkest thing we're going to talk about, visa v. Cooking babies.

254
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 So strap in.

255
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And I'm going to toss you the keys of the carbonar copter.

256
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 We're leaving behind Virginia.

257
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 We're headed all the way out to Bangkok, Thailand.

258
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 [imitates car engine]

259
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And now we're in Bangkok, Thailand. It's May 18th, 2012.

260
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And in Bangkok, there's a man who comes to the attention of local authorities.

261
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 His name is Chow Hock Quinn. He's 28 years old.

262
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 He's a British citizen born in Hong Kong, whose parents are from Taiwan.

263
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 He's rested with a couple suitcases, and in these suitcases are six human babies that have been cooked

264
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 and then wrapped in gold leaf.

265
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 There's a lot of disagreement.

266
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 If you look at these articles, there's a lot of disagreement about what is going on here.

267
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 But I'll tell you this right now. There's photos.

268
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Be careful when you go through the show notes, because there are a lot of photos of this.

269
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Some of the articles specify these were fetuses.

270
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 These were fetuses.

271
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And you see like the little arms and the little legs and the big old head,

272
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 and they're wrapped in this gold leaf, and there's the police have taken photographs of them in these boxes.

273
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Some news articles call them fetuses.

274
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Other news articles say, "No, these are babies."

275
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And I'm not talking about the pro-life, pro-choice thing.

276
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 They're saying these babies were two to seven months old.

277
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Not in the womb anymore.

278
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 These are straight-up babies that had been delivered that had been cooked.

279
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 He had purchased them in Thailand. This is what they figured out by talking to Chow.

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 He purchased them in Thailand for $6,400.

281
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And then he was going to take them to Taiwan and sell them for six times their worth.

282
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 That is a business opportunity that you do not want to be a part of,

283
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 but you can't deny that turning $6,400 into $36,000.

284
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Do you like my math there? I've been working on it.

285
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 That's very profitable.

286
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 The question, "Why in the world does anyone want to buy a gold-covered cooked baby?"

287
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Black magic.

288
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Apparently, in this region, in Thailand and Taiwan, there's a thing called the Khuman Thong,

289
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 or the Golden Child.

290
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 This is an old tradition.

291
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And having possession of one of these golden childs makes you rich and makes you lucky.

292
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And makes you rich enough, you can buy a gold-foiled baby,

293
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 and it makes you lucky enough that you won't get caught when you do.

294
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 The idea comes from this classic tale from Thai culture called "Kun Chang Khun Phen."

295
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 It's this old epic poem from the 1600s.

296
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 It's a story-- I think we've covered a little bit of this on a past episode, but let's go over it again.

297
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 This is the story. There was a dude named Khun Phen.

298
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 He was this poor boy who was trying to win the heart of his sweetheart, Wan Thong.

299
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 And the story is basically the forest gump of Thai culture.

300
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 It takes place through all these national disasters and wars and politics,

301
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 and throughout it, you're seeing Khun Phen trying to bang Wan Thong,

302
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 and then there's these romantic rivals in the story.

303
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I'm pretty sure we've talked about this before, but in the story, I'll try to put the episode in the show notes.

304
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 You're like, "Jason, now I've had enough roasts and babes for a day."

305
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Khun Phen, at one point, he has to go into battle. He has to take care of something.

306
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And he uses-- he knocked up this chick, and the baby dies in the womb.

307
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And he cuts the baby out and uses his own stillborn child as a charm.

308
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 He cooks the baby. He wears it as an amulet,

309
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 and this baby actually warns him when danger is coming and gives him dreams of guidance,

310
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 helps him figure out where he needs to go through life.

311
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 So that's an old legend, and it's still going on today.

312
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 You can buy one of these lucky golden childs.

313
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 You go, "Jason, wait a second. You said that in the old legend, it was definitely a fetus.

314
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 It was a stillborn. They took out of the mom.

315
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Let's put a pin in that for right now." But that is correct. That one definitely was a fetus.

316
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 So it might lean more towards these are fetuses.

317
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 I've never seen-- I don't think I've ever really even-- I've never seen a newborn baby.

318
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 I can say that. I know, like, when they have the big head and the tiny body,

319
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 that kind of makes me think more of the fetuses, but still, we'll put a pin in that for a second.

320
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Nowadays, because everyone still wants the power of these golden childs,

321
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 but not everyone wants to carry around a cooked baby or can afford one,

322
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 you can buy artificial ones. There are these little statues that you wear as an amulet.

323
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 You go, "Okay, Jason, that's cool. I mean, like, I can understand that.

324
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I can understand people not wanting to actually buy a cooked baby."

325
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Well, when you get these little statues, you can buy them online.

326
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 What it is is that inside these little statues, they have a special powder for millionaire luck.

327
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 That's what they call it. You don't want any of that poor people luck.

328
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 You just want millionaire luck. But you're like, "Okay, cool.

329
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I'll probably just some stuff they swept up off the ground,

330
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 just some sort of gimmick, some sort of scam."

331
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 You can get any sort of dust and call it millionaire luck powder.

332
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 This is on the label. This is on the label of what it contains.

333
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 It also contains Nam-Man-Pri-Oil of a girl spirit mixed with fox oil.

334
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You're like, "Ew, fox oil! That's gross."

335
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 No, what is girl spirit oil? But again, maybe that's just like lavender,

336
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 and they just say it smells like a girl. I don't know.

337
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Let's look at the other ingredients, okay?

338
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Ash, powder of children, real hair of children, bone of children.

339
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 So these little harmless statues that you can buy online contain the ground up bone of children.

340
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Now it's possible again that they're making it up that it's just a bunch of stuff they swept up off the floor.

341
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 But it's also possible that it's not. The millionaire dust, the millionaire lucky dust, whatever.

342
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I'm always cautious when someone's telling me a medallion that can make me a millionaire.

343
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 They are not millionaires themselves.

344
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 But that aside, hair and ash and bone of children?

345
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 This dude who got busted carrying six babies, fetuses, wrapped in gold leaf,

346
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 trying to smuggle them into Taiwan, guess what his sentence was?

347
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 One year in prison and a fine of $64.

348
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And you go, "Jason, he didn't kill the babies, right? He's just doing the trade. You know, I'm just a drug dealer."

349
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 You know what I mean? He didn't kill the babies, he's just the middleman.

350
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 But I would argue that he is engaging in activity that's leading to the death of babies.

351
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 And you go, "Jason, Jason, your babies, fetuses, fetuses, babies."

352
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Like, if he's moving the fetuses, right, maybe these were supposed to be aborted fetuses anyways, Jason.

353
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And he's given them another life as a medallion wrapped around some dude's neck or to sit on a thing.

354
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 He's just facilitating it. It's not human trafficking, it's the trafficking of human remains, sure, but is he really that evil?

355
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I don't know why all of a sudden you become such a ghoul.

356
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 He said he worked for a syndicate.

357
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 So there was, this was an industry, this wasn't just him doing this.

358
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 $64.

359
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And a year in prison, and this has been publicized in the media that you can, for $6,400, you can buy six golden children and then you can sell them.

360
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So it's definitely, I mean, I'm sure there might have been people who got interested in this after reading these articles.

361
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 They're like, "Hey, honey, you know how to make some easy money."

362
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Back in 2010 in Bangkok, Thailand, there's this Buddhist temple in the Thonbury neighborhood of Bangkok,

363
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 where it is discovered there are 2,000 fetuses hidden in this monastery.

364
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 The authorities come in, investigate this, take possession of the fetuses, and they go, "What in the world is possibly going on?"

365
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And the monastery, the Buddhist monastery says, "Listen, this is what happened. These are illegal abortions.

366
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 These were abortions performed illegally.

367
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And the crematory that we wanted to take them to is not working, so we've been storing them here in our monastery until that's taken care of."

368
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 In America, that excuse might work. That happens often, unfortunately, where crematories don't work and bodies stack up in the freezer,

369
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 and then the freezer stops working. We've actually covered, I think, one or two of those on the show.

370
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 But Bangkok already has a problem with this tradition of taking fetuses and selling them.

371
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Some of these fetuses and some of the traditions, they specifically have to be done at a monastery.

372
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Some of the traditions say they have to be done at the baby has to pass through 7 different Buddhist monasteries before it is a golden child.

373
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 So we have a region where fetuses are desired.

374
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 We have a place where those fetuses are supposed to be to gain their power.

375
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And that's a lot of money. That's a lot of money.

376
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 If six fetuses can rack in 36,000, imagine how many 2,000 could.

377
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And here is the... You go, Jason. It's just a cultural thing, maybe. You have these illegal abortions.

378
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I would have just grabbed a shovel. After the first hundred, I would have been burying babies.

379
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 I don't know if that's against the Buddhist culture, but once you get from 100 babies to 500 babies to 1,000 babies,

380
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 if the crematory is not working, you've got to figure something out.

381
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 A funeral pyre. That. 2,000 babies. And here's the thing. In the West, we're like, "Oh my goodness, 2,000 babies in a Buddhist temple?

382
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Oh, that's awful. The crematory's not working." And then we find out when these articles break later,

383
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 when we go in 2012 and we find out about this other story with the guys smuggling babies, then it makes sense.

384
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 But in Bangkok, they know this tradition. This tradition has been going on since the 1600s, still completely whitewashed.

385
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 One guy. One guy got arrested for those 2,000 fetuses being in that Buddhist monastery.

386
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 One guy got arrested for that.

387
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Two chilling details before we go.

388
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 One, if you research this nowadays, you're getting sent to all sorts of places.

389
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 You're getting sent to newspapers local to Bangkok. And then you're also getting newspapers like BBC, CNN, the independent stuff like that.

390
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And what I discovered over and over and over again, the story is from 2010, but what I discovered over and over again, a lot of them, 404.

391
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 A lot of these news websites that have generally good archives, past 2001, or definitely past 2008,

392
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 websites have been really good. News websites have been really good about archiving their stuff.

393
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 When you go to look this up, 404. 404. Website not found.

394
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 There was one that said we no longer have the right to run this story. I think that was the BBC.

395
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 There was actually so many 404s that I started putting them in the show notes.

396
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Bangkok Post, the local news.

397
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 If you click on that to read about this Buddhist monastery one, 404.

398
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 The news article no longer exists. Now I found the news. I was able to find articles that are still around.

399
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 So that's weird. It's not the crime. It's the cover-up, right?

400
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Could just be a local news story. I mean, it's definitely an odd local news story, but the fact that you can't find resources on this, very, very bizarre.

401
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 2010 was not that long ago. But here's the other chilling part about this.

402
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 According to some of the legends of the Golden Child, the baby has to be re- to make the Golden Child, if it's the fetus, right?

403
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 If it's not the actual child after birth. The baby has to be forcibly removed from the pregnant mother.

404
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 It has to be an unwanted abortion to become a Golden Child.

405
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Now that's not true. There are variations of the legend, but that is one type of the Golden Child that has to be forcibly removed from the mother.

406
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 I've seen photos of aborted children. They don't come out in one piece. I don't mean to be graphic for remaining negative eight listeners.

407
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 They don't come out in one piece.

408
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 There's like a vacuum technique. There's like a hook or a scraping technique.

409
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Every single photo of these Golden Babies, they are completely intact.

410
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 They look like a little person. You can see the arms are attached to the body, the legs are attached to the body, the heads attached to the body.

411
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 They're wrapped in gold.

412
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 If these babies were abortions, they were removed whole from the mother.

413
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 It almost looks like a Caesarean abortion, which is accurate to the ancient legend.

414
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 He removed the baby with the Caesarean from the mother.

415
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 So you have at least the identity photographs of the 2000 ones in the Buddhist temple.

416
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 But you have these photographs of these six babies in these boxes. They are complete babies.

417
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 These, with my rudimentary knowledge of abortion, again, there might be another technique where you remove the baby in whole in one piece.

418
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 But I wouldn't understand the logic of that because the point is the term, the pregnancy is over.

419
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 So why would you want the baby to come out in one complete piece?

420
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 But these are.

421
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 So these are either children who were born, who were then cooked, and wrapped in gold leaf, or if they are fetuses, which is what the legend says, they were removed in one piece.

422
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Life is cheap. Life is cheap. It's an unfortunate factor when you have 7 billion people on the planet.

423
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And when you have an industry where you can make 6 times your profit, you're not going to wait around for a young mother to get involved in a situation or get over her head and she can't figure out what she wants to do.

424
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And she goes, you know what, I hate to do this, but I'm going to terminate the pregnancy. So she goes and she terminates the pregnancy and she goes to the right clinic and they remove the baby perfectly and then they sell it to you.

425
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 If you are a syndicate, if you are a criminal organization trafficking human remains, you are part of that chain.

426
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 You are going to get into the creation of human remains as well.

427
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 I have never in my life met someone who deals drugs, who has not thought of or gotten into the production of drugs.

428
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 I mean obviously meth dealers start off buying their meth and they start trying to make it as well.

429
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Or they get involved in an organization that directly makes it. A lot of pot dealers grow as well.

430
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 If you are a cocaine dealer, you can just go, oh I hope the coca plant season is great this year. I don't know. I'm just the distributor.

431
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 No, you want to have a hand in everything. And obviously if you are like a street dealer that's different with coke.

432
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 But you industrialize it. You make sure that you have the right amount of coke and more being produced all the time so you can meet the demands of your customers.

433
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And it would be the same thing with human trafficking. If people were buying gold leafed cooked babies.

434
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 And you are going to make six times the money you invested into it. You would make sure you always had those babies on hand.

435
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 You may even have a stockpile. You may even have 2,000 of them.

436
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 And you are not going to wait on the whims of these young women who are back against the wall and have to make this decision.

437
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 You are going to make the decision for them. You are going to farm these babies like Afghanistan was farming poppies.

438
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 You are going to industrialize it. And these stories 404.

439
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 These people get a year in prison. 64 dollar fine and they are back in the industry.

440
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Moving that product. Moving that little baby wrapped in gold leaf. And the person buying it isn't even asking. That's weird.

441
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 How is it if this wasn't a boarded fetus how is it all in one piece?

442
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Who was the mother? Where did this come from?

443
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 You just take that child and you put it on your mantle.

444
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 It's going to help you get richer this year. Your stocks are going to go up. Your business is going to be more successful because you have that golden child.

445
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 But to get that golden child. You have to kill the child.

446
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 You have to kill the mother.

447
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 And you have to support an industry that lives off of human suffering.

448
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 We can look at urban legends about the babysitter who put the turkey in the bed and the baby in the oven.

449
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 But if you want to look at the real depravity of humanity you don't have to make a story up.

450
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 The story of the babysitter putting the turkey in the bed and the baby in the oven sounds quaint now doesn't it. This is industrialized.

451
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Taking babies from their mothers.

452
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Cooking them. Covering them in gold leaf.

453
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 And selling them to the highest bidder.

454
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 And that is scarier than any urban legend.

455
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
