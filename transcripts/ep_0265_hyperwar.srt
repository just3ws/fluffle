1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A serial robber fleeing the scene of a crime tries to outrun the police by hiding in a zoo

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 with hilarious results.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 And then, did a sci-fi battle take place on Earth between the world's two greatest superpowers

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 10,000 years ago?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Was there really such a thing as the Finno Korean Hyper Ward today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 We've got a lot of cool stuff today.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 This is actually the last episode before I go home.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 There'll be an episode coming out tomorrow.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 There's not going to be any break, but this will be my last episode I'm recording in Sacramento

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 and hot, hot Sacramento.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I've spent the last three weeks in an air-conditioned apartment, not moving, sitting on a couch,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 like that big fat guy from Blade, just eating Chipotle.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I did- I would leave the couch occasionally to go get more Chipotle, but for the most part,

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 just sitting there.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And, uh, yeah, I have to go back and I have to start working out and go back on my keto diet.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And I've just been sitting around watching movies with my mom.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 We watch monster movies.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 We've seen 70 movies in three weeks.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 70 movies.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I'll tell you all about those later.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Sharktopus.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We saw Sharktopus.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And we saw Sharktopus versus Terracuda.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Saw some good ones.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 So I actually saw some really good ones.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 We actually saw some good ones.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So anyways, anyways.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But let's go ahead and get started with this last 104 degree episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 It's actually like 8 in the morning right now.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It's not too hot, but let's go ahead and get started here.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So let's go back to the year of 1997.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Third Eye Blind is rocking our ears and breaking our hearts with their killer alt rock music.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I love Third Eye Blind.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And, um, she's all that came out.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Cruel intentions.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Some movie involving hot actresses acting like they're in high school,

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 even though they're in their mid-20s, came out in 1997.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And it is July 18th.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 It's a sweltering hot summer day in Johannesburg, South Africa.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Chappies have been seen all over the place fighting prawns.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 It's just a chaotic day, but we're going to focus on a very specific man.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Isaac Moefo King is a robber by trade, and he's also the occasional rapist.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 So not a good guy.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 He's not the protagonist of our story at all.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And I should say now, this story was actually recommended by Justice via Gmail.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 So thank you, Justice.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Isaac Moefo King, serial robber/rapist, breaking into a house, pshhh, looking around,

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 rifling through stuff.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 That's me actually opening a drawer.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 How's that for some folly sound effects?

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Here's a drawer in front of me.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Looking for stuff.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Looking for stuff to rob because that's what he does.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Technically, it would be a burglary.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 The way it works is it's burglary if nobody's there.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 It's robbery if someone's there.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 But anyways, serial robber.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It turns into robbery because as he's rifling through these awesome desks, right,

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 some guy comes in and goes, "Hey, what are you doing in my house?"

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And Isaac turns around all slow motion.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 He's like, "Oh, that wasn't part of the plan."

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 So he starts running through the hot city streets, right?

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And he passes up District 9.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 He just keeps going and going.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So he runs past all of that nonsense.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 That was a great movie.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 But he runs past that great movie and...

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 [imitates car honking]

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Cops coming after him, right?

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 [imitates car honking]

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I don't think these are horns actually.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 But anyways, the cop cars are chasing this guy through the city of Johannesburg.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And he's like, "Where are we going to go? Where are we going to go?"

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 He looks to hide somewhere and it's a glass factory.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 He's like, "No, that won't work."

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 The whole building's made of glass.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 He turns another way.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He sees an aquarium, a jellyfish aquarium.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 He hides behind them, totally invisible behind the jellyfish.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 He's like, "Ugh, this won't work."

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And he sees the perfect hiding spot, Johannesburg Zoo.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 [imitates car honking]

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Pays for a ticket.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 He's like, "Yes, waiting for his change."

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 He's like, "Come on, come on.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 The cops are coming in their life.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Why are you worried about the cops?"

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 He's like, "Come on, just give him a change.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Hey, no, you left him any out.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 You give him any.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Then finally he gets into the zoo and he sees a wall.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 The cops are right behind him, jumps the wall.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 [imitates car honking]

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 There's a little combat roll on the ground.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 He's like, "Whew."

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So he ended up at the story.

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So let's go and move on to our next story.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Thanks, Justice, for the recommendation.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 No, actually, he combat rolls into the zoo over the wall, right?

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 He goes, "Whew."

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Got away from those guys.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 But what he doesn't realize is that he's actually just broken into another home.

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Another home.

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 You know, it's funny, because technically now I'm thinking about it.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I guess this is a true crime story or just a weird news story.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 No ghosts show up.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 There's no conspiracy.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I should let you guys know that right off the bat.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I don't know if you're expecting him to break into a haunted zoo.

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 But Isaac has made his getaway.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 He jumped the wall.

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 He dusts himself off.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And it is at that moment that he realized he just broke into another home on accident.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 He's so good at breaking into people's homes, he can do it accidentally.

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 But this home belongs to Max the Gorilla.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Max, a 400-pound western lowland gorilla, is just chilling there with his girlfriend, Lisa.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Just hanging out.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Beautiful, sunny, hot July day.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Chilling at the zoo.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Chewing on some wheat or grass.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 They're always chewing on something when I watch them in YouTube videos.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 They're always chewing.

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 But I don't know what they eat.

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 I don't think they're eating Big Max.

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 I'm sure they eat some meat.

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Like zookeepers throw meat over the fence.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 You know, he's chewing.

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 The Max is like, "Come on, man.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Chew with your arms closed."

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Lisa goes, "Wait, no.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 You can keep your arms open.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I don't care what you do with your arms."

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Lisa goes, "Chew with your mouth closed."

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Max is like, "Mmm, I'm just chewing along."

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And all of a sudden, he sees this guy in his house.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Now, it's weird because basically the story starts where the story ended, with Isaac in a house uninvited.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 The first guy chased Isaac out of the house.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Technically, Max was probably trying to do that as well.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 But Max was also trying to chase him out of his body.

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Grammatically, that may not make sense.

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 The point being is that Max tried to rip Isaac apart.

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And at this point, the police enter the zoo.

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 They're looking around.

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 They're looking at the Jellyfish exhibit.

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 They're looking around.

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 They're like, "Where could this guy be?"

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 They see, well, they hear the screams of a man.

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 "Help me, help me, help me, please, help me."

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And the cops run over to the gorilla enclosure.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And they see Max basically holding down Isaac, taking a big old bite out of his butt.

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Just "Arsh!"

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 He's chewer!

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Gorillas chew stuff when they're fighting.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 The first thing they want to do is bite into that beefy butt.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So the cops now have to save this rapist/rober.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Even though their job was originally to arrest him, now they have to save him from being dismalished by this 400-pound gorilla.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So the cops hop over the wall.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 The cops hop over the wall.

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Isaac at this point, because he is, you know, a professional robber,

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 he pulls a gun out and begins shooting Max in the face.

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 [imitates gunshot]

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 [imitates gunshot]

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 He shoots Max in the jaw and the arm.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 But that doesn't deter a 400-pound gorilla.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 It just makes him madder.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 So now he's really just laying into this dude.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 The cops run in to save Isaac.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Now they have guns too, but they're not going to start shooting this gorilla.

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Which, I mean, to be fair, I get it why you don't want to shoot a gorilla.

176
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But at a certain point, I'm sure this fight would have turned to where they would have to shoot the gorilla.

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 The gorilla, spoiler alert, the gorilla does not die in this story.

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 But the cops run in and they start to try to get Isaac away from Max.

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 They're like, "We gotta save this scum. We gotta save this piece of human debris."

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Max turns to them and bites them on the butt.

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 [imitates gunshot]

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Bites in a cop, an officer of the law on the butt, and then begins mauling the other one.

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 So it's a full-on fight. There's three officers.

184
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 There's Isaac and one 400-pound gorilla.

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 He's just laying waste to these people.

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Eventually, a zookeeper...

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 [imitates gunshot]

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 [imitates gunshot]

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 That's the sound of a drink dart being loaded and entering into Max.

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 He just kind of stumbles around a bit like he's had one too many at a frat party.

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 [imitates gunshot]

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Dust. Clouded dust. Pshh. Goes up.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Cops get Isaac out of there.

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Now, Max goes into surgery. The bullet in his face messed up his mouth a bit. Totally fine.

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 The bullet in his arm, they couldn't even get out. They're just like, "Don't worry about it. He's a 400-pound gorilla. He'll be okay."

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 The cops, the one, the cops got mauled, got bit on the butt. They're fine too.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 They went on to have distinguished careers, I'm assuming.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Nobody ever, they were never reported on what they did after this.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 So the question is what happened to Isaac?

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Malled by a gorilla, bitten on the butt, professional robber, serial rapist,

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 35 years in prison for his string of robberies and rapes,

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 5 additional years for shooting Max.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 But that's not where the story ends, no. Because I said this was just a true crime story.

204
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 But I lied. Because we know... I didn't lie. Just look down farther on my notes. I go, "Oh, there he is, to be concerned."

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Max died of old age in the year 2004.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 He died peacefully in his sleep, I'm assuming, at the age of 33.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 33, that's a Masonic number. That's not the conspiracy. I'm just making a joke.

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And butt, butt.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Isaac, scorn of South Africa. People did not like this guy because he shot Max the gorilla.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 No one likes it when you're blown away animals. They didn't like him for his occupation.

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 They definitely didn't like him that he shot a gorilla.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 He died one year after Max died in prison.

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 But that's not it. He died and nobody knows why.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 His family has been trying to get the prison warden people, the investigators of the prison, to really disclose what happened.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 But apparently this is what happened. He had some sort of drug overdose.

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And at first the prison investigators were saying everyone had mess hall and later on he went back to a cell and he began vomiting.

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And he died. Family is like, "That's awful." So he must have had some sort of medical problem.

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And they go to the prison and they talk to the warden and they start talking to people there.

219
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And then the story changes that he was in line for food, saw a cup full of pills, greased for it, grabbed it, swallowed it, and began vomiting right there in front of everyone else.

220
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 To this day, as far as I could tell, that case has never been solved.

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 But it's suspicious. I mean, sometimes you could say there's suspicious deaths.

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 But it makes it suspicious that one version of the events has him dying by himself in his cell.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And nobody knows why to, "Oh, everyone saw him do this thing in the middle of mealtime."

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And he began immediately throwing up then. And actually, how many drugs did you have to take to begin throwing up right after you took them?

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 So was he assassinated for killing Max? Did Max's ghost--Oh, there's a paranormal ankle.

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Did Max's ghost come back into prison and kill Isaac for shooting him in front of his girlfriend?

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 We may never know. Most likely not. Most likely that he killed himself and it was some sort of cover-up.

228
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 But who knows? It may have been Justice from Beyond the Grave from a 400-pound western lowland gorilla.

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 They should have done an autopsy and see if he had ghost bite marks on his butt.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 But anyways, forget the conspiracy part. Forget the paranormal part.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I just love the story of man versus nature and nature barely losing.

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Multiple people had to help take him down and everyone was okay. No gorillas died in the making of that story.

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So let's go ahead. You know what's funny? Let me say this real quick.

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 I got a lot of requests for YouTube monkey torture. It's actually this conspiracy theory that I covered really, really early on on the show.

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 I covered it in episode 52, which is the golf rumors episode of the podcast.

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And I didn't upload it to YouTube, so a lot of people on YouTube request that story.

237
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And the story is so old itself. I mean, that was almost--that was over 200 episodes ago.

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Let me talk about it real briefly here, because I got a lot of requests for it.

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 There is a community on YouTube of people who go to videos of little monkeys gorillas.

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Usually it's monkeys, but primates being hurt. I actually had someone comment on one of my videos from this community.

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 But let me tell you what it is, and then I'll go into that.

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 There is a community on YouTube that goes to videos of primates being hurt.

243
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Like usually it's like wildlife videos of them getting taken out of the trees by leopards, or it's just videos of--

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 it happened accidentally, like a monkey falling down a stairs while he's like a little monkey waiter carrying a bottle of champagne falls on the stairs.

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Sometimes there's videos of actually monkeys being hurt on purpose, like being cooked into like a foreign country, being cooked in a stew, or being hunted.

246
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And the YouTube comments will be full of people saying stuff like, "Oh yeah, those monkeys deserve it. I hate monkeys. They're so disgusting."

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Little monkeys just need to get their arms broken or their brains bashed in.

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 You're like, "What?"

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 There is a subculture on YouTube of people who wish harm upon monkeys.

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And it's funny because nobody knows why.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Nobody knows what-- even people who suffer from this, and I will call it suffering because it's quite a horrible thing.

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Even people who suffer from this don't know why they hate monkeys so much. They just don't understand it.

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 They just say, "The sight of seeing monkeys just drives them wild."

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 So here's one, actually.

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 This comment was on my video I did about the killer herpy monkeys of Florida.

256
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Quite a few episodes back, there is an outbreak of herpes among these little monkeys that were imported into this island on Florida.

257
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And recently, I got this-- so the video itself was maybe five or six months ago.

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Last month I got this comment on my video. I didn't upload it. I let it go into the spam filter, but I'm going to read it to you right now.

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It says-- and again, it's just a story-- it's a news story about how these monkeys have herpes, and if they bite you, you get herpes too.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And this is one of the comments.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 "Show some live action--" the grammar is terrible, by the way.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 "Show some live action, shoot them. We pay to watch money."

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And you'd think maybe it's like some sort of spam or AI bot-- I just think this person's stupid.

264
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 "Get that rat by the tail, swing him around real fast. Snap back, right fast. Pop that neck. Live action."

265
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 "Love watching these sons of a bitch suffer." That grammar is terrible.

266
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 "They are worthless shit. Took a real human baby off newborn, killed it, pulled its arms off."

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I don't know-- I'd like to see a citation on that. Not the video, but I'm sure this happened at some point, but I don't know what they're talking about.

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 "I would love to go in the park and kill every one of them damn rats, nasty filthy animals. I would like to get a razor blade and whack that sack off."

269
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 It's very-- and that's the tone that comes across a lot of these. They'll go into detail how they want these primates to be killed.

270
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 But yeah, it's a really bizarre, creepy subculture out there of people who believe in this stuff.

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 "YouTube monkey torture." There's a deeper dive. All the links for that are on episode 52 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

272
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And if you want to-- I don't suggest it, but if you want to read some of the links for your-- read some of the comments for yourself,

273
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 all of my show notes are on episode 52 of Dead Rabbit Radio. You can check that one out.

274
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's also the "Golf Rumors" episode, but yeah. Yeah, I'm all for investigating bizarre, unique subcultures,

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 but sometimes it pushes it just a little too far. They didn't do nothing wrong.

276
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I mean, it might have pulled the arms off a baby sometime, but every animal at some point has killed a baby.

277
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I'm sure penguins have killed babies at some point. Doesn't mean you have to hate all penguins.

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Doesn't mean you're watching "March of the Penguins" and being like, "I just can't wait to rip their beaks off and stab them in their eye."

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 You know, it's like every animal's killed a baby at some point. Okay. That was a-- sorry, Segway.

280
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last segment for the day. It is both interesting and relatively a short one.

281
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 It took me very, very small amount of looking into to get to the bottom of this.

282
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 This was a request from William via Gmail.

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 William wanted me to cover this story, and I looked into it, and it has certain keywords that you--

284
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I don't know if William's in on the joke, if William was like, "Oh, this is hilarious,"

285
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 or if William really thinks this might be real. I'm gonna lean towards he knows it's a joke,

286
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 or just wanted to know the origins of it as well.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Let's hop in the carbon decopter, 'cause we're gonna need aerial superiority.

288
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 We're going to need weapons, and we're gonna need the ability to go back in time, 'cause we are going back to the year.

289
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 8,245 BC. BC, not none of that BCE nonsense they teach at the universities these days.

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 We're talking BC. It's 8,245 BC.

291
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 We're flying through the time portal, and we are over anywhere in Europe,

292
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 because at this point in time in human history, forget all you knew about cavemen, or the cavemen weren't around.

293
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Forget everything you knew about Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age. We are in the age of the Hyper War.

294
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Giant robots moving across Europe, shooting laser beams, spaceships.

295
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Sounded more like a jet, but the point is Europe had erupted in what was known by historians as a Hyper War.

296
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 The most advanced technology that ever existed on the planet Earth existed then, but two great warriors couldn't split the Earth.

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 We're talking about superpowers that to this day are known as the superpowers.

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 The Finns, the Finnish, and the Koreans.

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And what I'm talking about is the Finnau Korean Hyper War.

300
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Both sides had amassed this huge level of mystical sci-fi technology.

301
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Stuff we had never even heard of before.

302
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 The ancient Finnish Empire was coming down from the North with space rays, anti-gravity vehicles, robots.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And the Korean Empire, also known as the Wann Empire, had built up their own arsenal of out-of-this-world inventions,

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 but they weren't out of this world, they were all invented by human hands.

305
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So the war continued until the year 6,172 BC.

306
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And it was almost like a stalemate.

307
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 It looks like, when we look at the historical record, it looks like the Finnish Empire came out on top,

308
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 but both sides suffered such heavy losses that it really set humanity back, thousands and thousands of years.

309
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 When we look at a template of human history, we can see humanity moving up,

310
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 and then the burning of the Library of Alexandria sets us back.

311
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Humanity headed up, and then the fall of Rome, and then the Dark Ages.

312
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 We always think, where would humanity be at if we had all the combined knowledge of all the previous cultures?

313
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Every time there's a massive war or natural disaster, we go back, and I'm talking like, global disaster,

314
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 like a mega quake coming soon on Sci-Fi Channel.

315
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 I'm talking about something like that, something so massive that it actually sets back humanity.

316
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Where would we be if we didn't have those things?

317
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 If we had the Dark Ages, the Bubonic Plate, we would be 400 years more advanced than we are now.

318
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 The Hyper War actually set us back thousands of years.

319
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 When we look at the record of mankind to go from Stone Age technology to this hyper technology,

320
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 and then to lose it all, it's staggering.

321
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Thousands of years, more than thousands of years to back.

322
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Now this theory has been put out by scholars of history.

323
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 This theory has been put out by people who make it their passion to investigate the history of the world.

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And you'll see infographics around saying this is the Finno-Korean Hyper War, and it will just be a...

325
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 That'll be that term. It'll be it set us back. Here's a graph of human history.

326
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Here's how far we're set back because the Finno-Korean Hyper War and so on and so forth.

327
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 But let me dive a little bit more into...

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I'm reading it. I've been... I get the memes.

329
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I'm not saying like I'm some sort of cool kid, but I understand the stuff to a certain point.

330
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And I think that there's two things going on here.

331
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 One, first off, I should say none of this is real. None of this is real at all.

332
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 It was an elaborate in-joke made up by the History Board on Fortune.

333
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 There was a bunch of Finnish people on history, on the History Board on Fortune.

334
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And they started seeing like they could go, "Oh, Italians used to be the most advanced people when we had Rome."

335
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And you would have the Africans say, "Oh, you know, the African community was so advanced when we had Egypt."

336
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And then you'd have the Russians be like, "Oh, Russia was so advanced when we had..."

337
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 There should be empty silence. But you'd always have these cultures going, "Oh, yeah, back in the day, my culture was the best."

338
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 And a couple, I would assume like only three or four Finnish guys on Fortune said, "When we were advanced, we had spaceships."

339
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 They basically made up this joke. It was an inside joke on the board saying, "Oh, yeah, the Italians used to have Rome, but the Finnish had warships."

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 We had spaceships lying around. And that coupled with... So that little bit of an in-joke, coupled with the real-life mystery that...

341
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 This is bizarre. The Finnish language and the Korean language are actually distant relatives.

342
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And no one can really figure it out. So the Korean... I'm going to read you this quote here because they can say it more succinctly than I can.

343
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 I can't even say the word succinctly. Here's a quote from somewhere. I didn't write down where I got the quote from, but it's in my notes.

344
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 In the show notes. "Korean language..." Oh, gee, I didn't even copy the face, the word "the."

345
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 "The Korean language is a distant relative of the Euro-Altic family of languages, which includes such diverse languages as Mongolian, Finnish, and Hungarian."

346
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 So it's not like there's a lot of similarities between it, but it's more related to Finnish than it would be to Latin.

347
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 So it's kind of a weird linguistic mystery. Did they meet at some time? Why is that language related to it and so on and so forth?

348
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 So they took that real-life kind of trivial... and I'm sure people have kind of figured it out, but it's still a bit of a mystery.

349
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 That little nugget of a mystery with the idea that at some point Finnish was the Finns were the most superior nation on the planet.

350
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 They created this joke called the Finno-Korean Hyperwold.

351
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And when you look at... there's an info... I talk about one infographic that shows like the timeline of the Earth, which is the most common one.

352
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 You'll see that floating around, because that one looks fairly legit. We'll get into that in a second.

353
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 But the first infograph I came across when I was researching the Finno-Korean Hyperwold looked like a Wikipedia sidebar where it showed like...

354
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Whenever you look up stuff on Wikipedia, they'll show like troop strength. Not anything. It's not a Britney Spears concert, but when you look up battles or wars,

355
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 it'll show like troop strength and casualties and losses and all that stuff.

356
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 In their version of that, on the side of the One Empire, you had Obi-Wan Kenobi in "20,000 Jedi Knights" and Jackie Chan holding a baby in a latter factory.

357
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 On the Finnish side, they had a great war hero known as Fred McFeely Rogers.

358
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And at some point, both sides or one side, I was unsure, used the Giza Mass Autism Array.

359
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Gave much of people Autism. So looking at that on its head, you would go, "This is obviously a joke."

360
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Jackie Chan was not walking around with a baby in a latter factory 8,000 years ago. As funny as that image is, it didn't happen.

361
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 "Jedi Knights" aren't real. Sorry, guys. There is no Giga Giza Mass Autism Array. All this stuff is made up.

362
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And so there's two layers to this joke. This is what's so interesting about this. There's two layers to this joke.

363
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 One is that, and it's obviously in jokes. We talked about Jackie Chan on this show before.

364
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 So obviously, I look at that and I go, "This is a meme. This is a joke."

365
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 So, here's the thing. Why am I talking about this?

366
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I got the request. Thank you again for the request.

367
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 But I didn't just cover it to say, "Here's a story. It's totally fake. It's a meme. Let's move on."

368
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 I'm covering this because throughout my research, I found people actually thinking this was a real thing.

369
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Going, "Was there really an ancient Finnish Empire? Was there really a time when..."

370
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 There may have been like an ancient Finnish Empire, whereas there was like some king kicking bricks around up there.

371
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 But as far as people actually wonder whether or not this thing exists.

372
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And it's funny because there's two stages. One, was there actually an ancient Finnish Empire and an ancient Korean Empire and did they fight?

373
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And the second one is, did they have a hyper war? Was it some sort of lost civilization hyper war?

374
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 It is a joke. It's 100% a joke. But it's out there into the mists of the Internet.

375
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And people have a problem. People have a problem.

376
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 One, humans seek novelty and they seek new information.

377
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And two, nowadays, it feels like humans are far less trusting of journalists and historians and the establishment.

378
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Whether or not that's a good thing or a bad thing overall, I don't know. I think it's too early to tell.

379
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 But we have a combination where people love novelty. They love new information.

380
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 They don't listen or like to authoritative figures in any sort of historical context.

381
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 You know what I mean? Like people will be like, "Well, that's just the mainstream historian industrial complex that's telling me that."

382
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I don't know. I'm just asking questions.

383
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I think that part of it is good to a point, but I think when you start questioning every single historical source because it doesn't talk about the Finnish-Korean hyper war,

384
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 you're going to kind of run into some issues. Like you do have to have a baseline of what history actually is.

385
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 But we're seeing this with the mud flood too.

386
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 The mud flood theory, which I covered on a previous episode, is that in the late 1800s, mud covered the entire planet

387
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 and it's been completely, no pun intended, covered up by the powers that be.

388
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And so for that to exist, you have to say that every historical authoritative, every historical book, every head of psychopathy, all that stuff is false.

389
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 All of it. 100% is false. And that's a really weird place to start when you're looking into history, is to go,

390
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 "Anything that's after 1880 is 100% false." Like what?

391
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And the mud flood, I think, I came to the conclusion on the episode. I think it's almost like a Psyop.

392
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I think it's people looking at photos and not being able to make heads or tails of whether or not mud conquered the world in the 1800s.

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 And so they made up this backstory. Or it could be some government or some agency or whatever wanted to see.

394
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And I've said this a couple times, want to see how a rumor can spread.

395
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 It's basically a psychological warfare operation. Like, can we invent the stupidest rumor?

396
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And it's tracked to see how fast it invades the Internet. I think Flat Earth is like that as well.

397
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I don't know who's doing it. And that could just be my own, I don't want to say paranoid, because they really don't care either way,

398
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 but my own conspiracy theory as far as that goes, if people are doing it or not, it doesn't really affect me.

399
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 I mean, it may down the road when everyone says that I caused the mud flood.

400
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 But I think that this is kind of the opposite. I think this is just a couple of kids goofing around on the Internet,

401
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 came up with a funny joke, shared it with their friends, and they thought it was funny and they kept sharing it over and over and over again,

402
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 and now it's gotten out of 4chan. And you have people who believe in stuff like the mud flood. Read it.

403
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And go, "What? Golly! The Koreans had some spaceships? That's why North Korea is being blocked in."

404
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Because President Trump doesn't want their spaceships to fly around. That makes sense.

405
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And then the fins. The fins. I don't know much about the fins, because they ain't in the news, but...

406
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Ah, it all makes sense now. I don't know why I do that accent. I actually have good friends with that accent who aren't idiots.

407
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 But the point is, is that the interest, the story is out there. It's floating around the Internet.

408
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And again, I don't think William was like, "Oh man, I wonder if the fins..."

409
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 I don't think that was William's intention when he recommended the story. And if he did, again, I don't care.

410
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 I don't really care what you guys believe in, because everyone has their own goofy beliefs.

411
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 So, but it's interesting how quickly this stuff can spread. How dangerous it can be.

412
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Sure, it starts off with stuff about the mud flood. It starts off about the fins and the Koreans flying around with spaceships,

413
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Jackie Chan, and with a baby in a ladder factory. But where does it end?

414
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I say I don't care whether or not mud flood is a Psyop.

415
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And it's funny, right when I said that I thought, because most of the show's off the cuff, right when I said that I thought,

416
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 "Maybe I do care. I guess I don't care whether or not it's a Psyop, but I am concerned about the end results."

417
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Because we are moving, all of these things are basically something happened in the past that's being covered up

418
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 by the power structure, the knowledge structure that exists today. That's the key.

419
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 But what if the people who are pushing these conspiracy theories on the public?

420
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Maybe it's not all a joke. But it's definitely not a joke to them.

421
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 They are pushing these conspiracy theories either to track how an idiotic idea can spread,

422
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 to how to fine tune a message, keep fine-tuning until you find the right psychological component so that most people believe in it.

423
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Because some of the conspiracy theories, like Flat Earth, is really caught on.

424
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Mud Flood's a little more complicated for people to understand, but that one's getting bigger and bigger.

425
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 What happens when these get perfected as a weapon?

426
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 What happens when someone sits down and goes, "These are the psychological components that we need for a perfect conspiracy theory."

427
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 We need government mistrust. We need a religious reason why they're being put forth.

428
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Flat Earth is all about the denial of God.

429
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 They're saying that's the reason why we're being lied about on Flat Earth, because only God can make a Flat Earth.

430
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 If you believe in a Flat Earth, you must believe in God. So there's a religious denial component to it.

431
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And you just keep looking at these things, and you're able to convince someone that what they are looking at, or what they can see,

432
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 is fake in a photograph or in a video, like Flat Earth.

433
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 You can show them that, and you can convince them that's fake.

434
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 You keep fine-tuning these conspiracy theories. You can get them to actually look at something in real life,

435
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 with their own eyes standing there and still go, "That's fake."

436
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Flat Earth, if you want to believe in Flat Earth, whatever.

437
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 But if someone actually is creating these things, the hyper-war thing was created as a joke,

438
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 but when people are actually creating these things as some sort of psychological weapon,

439
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 what happens when they perfect it to the point when you can look at me and they convince you, "I'm not human?"

440
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Because we may be going there, if this is being plotted out and planned,

441
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 that you could create a conspiracy theory that is so believable, quote-unquote believable to somebody,

442
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 that you can convince them of anything at any time, anywhere.

443
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Because right now people are seeing a little graph that says, "Finnocrian hyper-war in a timeline of humanity."

444
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And they're wondering if that's real, a multi-colored graph.

445
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 It's making them question what they know about history from that.

446
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 So between deep fakes, psychologically perfected conspiracy theories, and mass distribution of those two things,

447
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 right now someone's looking at a little graph and going, "I wonder if the Koreans had spaceships."

448
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Tomorrow they may be looking at something far more carefully crafted and say, "Nothing's true."

449
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Nothing's true except this video I have in front of me. I can't trust anyone but the people who sent me this link.

450
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 That's a dangerous world to live in, and we may be headed that way.

451
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
