1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080
 A mother's death may provide a clue of an upcoming AI revolution.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,880
 And then we traveled to Italy to meet a farmer driving through town on his motorcycle.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,440
 It was just another quiet evening until he saw the glass cage sitting in the town square.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:31,440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
 I'm your host Jason Carvin, and I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,360
 I hope you guys have a ton of fun doing whatever cool stuff you guys are doing.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,360
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started right away.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,840
 First off, coming in right now is one of our Thanksgiving livestream supporters that we

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,080
 had recently.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
 It's a Dead Rabbit command.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,800
 Everyone give it up for Joaquin Stick.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,000
 They're the name matches what he's doing.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 He's Joaquin, and he's Joaquin.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,560
 Joaquin, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,040
 You guys can't support the show financially.

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,680
 I totally understand, and it's fine.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
 It honestly is.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,240
 You can also go to our merch store and do all sorts of fun stuff there.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,440
 You can click on things and buy them.

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
 Wee!

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,800
 Joaquin, I'm going to go ahead and start off by giving you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,320
 After leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, we are driving all the way out to Hollywood,

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
 California.

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,680
 And as we're driving down there, I want to do an update for a story that I had done

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,760
 not too long ago.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,240
 I actually got some new information.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,040
 Episode 777.

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
 It was castaways from beyond the stars.

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
 It's a really cool story about a UFO that crashed on an island.

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,440
 We don't have any more information about that, but on that same episode, I covered the story

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:54,160
 about an anime convention, and it was called Anime Friends Brazil.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,240
 And apparently, there is an urban legend that a guy was so into cosplaying as this Naruto

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:06,680
 character who was a puppet ninja that he took a real corpse from his medical school

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,160
 and stuffed it into his costume.

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
 This doesn't make sense.

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,680
 Right now, you're trying to picture this guy walking around with his rotting corpse.

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,400
 Look it, we're wearing the same shirt as arms are falling off.

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,400
 No, it was like he had this casket or this urn strapped to his back, which is from the

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
 show.

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,520
 And it's supposed to be like this puppet drops out, and apparently this puppet was a homeless

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,840
 man's body that the guy who was dressing up as a Naruto, Naruto character, I'm totally

45
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,920
 butchering if people even listen to that episode.

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
 They're like, "What?

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
 I totally have lost you."

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,360
 The point is that there's an urban legend that a guy snuck a human corpse into an anime

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
 convention.

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,200
 And this one might be real, we actually have a screenshot of this magazine and I famously

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,960
 said, I've had, I have no joke, I have had people stop me walking down the street because

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,720
 a lot of people here in town know that this podcast, they listen to the podcast, they

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,720
 go, "Jason, you said recently, right when they start, I know exactly where they're going

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
 with this."

55
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,040
 In that episode, I said, "I don't speak Spanish, but I know a little bit of Latin, so when

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,200
 I'm reading this article about this Brazilian rumor, it does look like it mentions a little

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
 bit about a decaying body."

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,280
 And I got stopped multiple times and they said, "You know they don't speak Spanish in

59
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 Brazil, right bro?

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
 Is that like a bit where you do it a bit?"

61
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,680
 And I was like, "Eyes are going side to side."

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,320
 "Yeah, it's pretty funny, huh?"

63
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,480
 So they don't speak Spanish in Brazil, they speak Portuguese, right?

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,040
 And the magazine was not in Spanish, but this was interesting.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,520
 I was able to make out a couple of the words after getting, after getting publicly flogged

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:47,200
 for making that mistake, on YouTube, Hayan Cangiri on YouTube said, who does speak Portuguese

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,480
 and they're Brazilian, and they were able to translate the article.

68
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,320
 They said, "Listen, it was a weird angle from the photograph and it was blurry, but

69
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,560
 from what, this is cool, because this gives us more information.

70
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:06,360
 What the article actually says, what they can read at least, is that there was a rumor

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,840
 about an anime friend's convention where a guy was carrying a cadaver.

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,840
 In the article though, it says it was a small animal, likely a howler monkey, and then the

73
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,560
 convention organizers denied the rumors."

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,080
 Pretty much the summary that Hayan Cangiri gave.

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
 So that was awesome.

76
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
 Thank you so much for that.

77
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,080
 I wanted to give you guys feedback, wanted to give them that shout out.

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,120
 Bear, very interesting.

79
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,880
 So yeah, it does sound, I was thinking it was weird.

80
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,120
 Getting around 180 pounds of dead weight, whether or not you put it in a box, that's

81
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
 going to be an ordeal.

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
 That's a long day at the con.

83
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,560
 A little howler monkey, but that makes a little more sense.

84
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,360
 But I wanted to update that story and probably something to it, probably something stinky

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,880
 in there, but not a human corpse.

86
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
 So thank you, and that is a really cool update.

87
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,440
 I really like that story, because conventions are already really smelly places.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,640
 So if you can smell something over the normal smell of the unwashed nerds, then you know

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,280
 that it's bad.

90
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,280
 Then you know that it's bad.

91
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,840
 I spent many, many an hour at Magic the Gathering at, not at cons, but I'd go to a lot of comic

92
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,360
 book shops, play Magic the Gathering and G-Hod and all this stuff, these old card games,

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,800
 and yeah, the smell is quite unbearable.

94
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,440
 But we are done with that story, Joaquin.

95
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,280
 Let's go ahead and keep driving that Jason Jalopy down here to Hollywood.

96
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
 And we get out.

97
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
 We're walking around.

98
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,720
 We're not looking for Steven Spielberg's house.

99
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,240
 That is not what this episode's about.

100
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,520
 It's not a callback to yesterday's horrifying episode.

101
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,920
 We're walking around Los Angeles and we come outside a studio and it's like, has all the

102
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,760
 big posters of all the television shows that are going on.

103
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
 We're like, "Hey, look it.

104
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,760
 It's Will and Grace."

105
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
 We check our watches.

106
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
 We're like, "What?

107
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
 Is it 2012?

108
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,520
 Why is that still out there?"

109
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,080
 We're seeing all these television shows.

110
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,400
 Like this is where they filmed the set.

111
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,720
 We're standing outside and we're looking at this Will and Grace sign.

112
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 We're like, "Oh, that's kind of weird."

113
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
 That's still up.

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,680
 That's kind of weird that anyone watches the show in the first place.

115
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,280
 And we see kind of this hustle and bustle going into the studio.

116
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,680
 And going into the studio is the staff, the staff of this whole show.

117
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,000
 One of the people who's working on this show back when it was actually in production was

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,520
 a woman named Karen Ray Schick.

119
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 She's an assistant director.

120
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,800
 She's had a very, very long career in Hollywood.

121
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,520
 The very first show that Karen worked on is one of my favorite shows growing up.

122
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,920
 I don't know how well it holds up, but I remember just being thoroughly entertained by this show.

123
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
 So hats off to you, Karen.

124
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
 That's not a joke.

125
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
 "Get a Life," starring Chris Elliott.

126
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,320
 You guys remember that show, "Get a Life?"

127
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,880
 Fox was always trying to do really weird entertainment.

128
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,960
 They still do with stuff like, "It's Always Sunny."

129
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,240
 But "Get a Life" was unlike any sitcom.

130
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,280
 It really spoke to my kids in the hall, comedy sensibilities.

131
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,600
 I loved "Get a Life."

132
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,080
 And that was her first show as well.

133
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,440
 And she worked consistently.

134
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,480
 I mean, it almost looked like she was doing multiple television shows a season.

135
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,800
 And this goes on and on and on.

136
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,880
 And she's doing some really, really big shows as well.

137
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,000
 Long career, long career in Hollywood.

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,960
 But she's passed away recently.

139
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 She's passed away.

140
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,280
 And that's where this story starts.

141
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:14,640
 Because Karen Ray's child one day wanted to kind of Google her and kind of see, you know,

142
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,400
 just going through this user's post, they go by the name Spooks and Giggles.

143
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,080
 We're going to call them, we're going to call her Stella.

144
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,120
 I don't know her exact name.

145
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,880
 So Stella decides to Google her mom one night and is a fairly small internet presence.

146
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
 It does have a very active IMDb page.

147
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,320
 But as they're googling this information, they get directed to a website called Celebrity

148
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
 Deaths.

149
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,840
 You know what?

150
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
 That's weird.

151
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,520
 Like, I mean, I guess she was a celebrity.

152
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,000
 I mean, she was an assistant director in all these hit shows.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,600
 But like, I wouldn't really classify her as a celebrity.

154
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,100
 It's odd.

155
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,720
 And this sets off a whole chain of events.

156
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,800
 Because when you click on these articles, what you are seeing is a bot written article

157
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,560
 that's scouring social media posts.

158
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,440
 There's a website that all it does is look for celebrities dying or any sort of true

159
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,040
 crime murder news.

160
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,760
 And it scrapes the information off of Facebook or Instagram, wherever it's getting it, probably

161
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
 everywhere.

162
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,980
 And then this AI, this bot, is compiling these articles.

163
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,140
 Now we've seen stuff like that before.

164
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,860
 We've actually talked about stuff like that before.

165
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
 Episode 773.

166
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,380
 I talked about the Miami Herald bot.

167
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,140
 They're now using a bot to write real estate ads.

168
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,060
 But this has become far more sinister than just that.

169
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,420
 It'd be one thing if they were just scouring the web and putting this stuff up.

170
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,700
 And on these websites, it does make a note.

171
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,100
 It says this is not an obituary.

172
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,600
 They were just pulling information from tribute sites and social media posts and things like

173
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
 that.

174
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,240
 When we go to these sites, Stella was saying, kept saying, because they started posting all

175
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,840
 over Reddit about this.

176
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,640
 And I honestly thought it was an ARG.

177
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
 I almost ignored this story when I first saw it.

178
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,440
 Because I was seeing this in Mysteries of the World.

179
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,120
 I was seeing this in Reddit Bureau of Information or Investigation.

180
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,720
 Seeing this in all those places.

181
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
 There was no engagement.

182
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
 No one was playing around with it.

183
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
 I was like, God, this is probably just an ARG.

184
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,600
 But for whatever reason, I went back to look at it.

185
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,500
 And they said, listen, I'm finding all these sites that are mentioning my mom's name.

186
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,220
 It looks like a bunch of them are from India.

187
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,740
 I don't know what any of this stuff means.

188
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
 They're getting really mad.

189
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,100
 They're posting-- because there's a Reddit account called Jocko that it posts, I don't

190
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,100
 know, 15 times an hour boosting these articles.

191
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,220
 Like it's pumping these articles out quicker than you could write-- OK, maybe not quicker

192
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,180
 than you could write them, but incredibly fast.

193
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,440
 So if you go to the subreddits for Jocko, the subreddit called Celebrity Death.

194
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,880
 That's what it's called in the subreddit, Celebrity Death Subreddit.

195
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,280
 It's just link after link after link after link after link of all these articles.

196
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,680
 This computer is just pumping these things out.

197
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,280
 I'm sorry, the subreddit's called Death Obituaries.

198
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,680
 Death Obituaries is the name of that subreddit.

199
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,600
 Dozens of posts an hour.

200
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
 And that's weird, right?

201
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,980
 The fact what would be the point of scouring this stuff to get this information?

202
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,620
 People-- what's some engagement on Reddit?

203
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,020
 They go, it's clicks, right?

204
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,460
 They have you click on this, and then they get a couple of pennies.

205
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,980
 And if you do this enough times, then the pennies add up.

206
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,900
 The question is, why are they trumping up Karen as a celebrity?

207
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,140
 Because I guess she worked in the television business, and she did a lot of good work,

208
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,060
 but just an interesting thing.

209
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,640
 But that's not even the weird part of the story.

210
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,720
 While I'm investigating this, I'm scrolling through the Jocko account on Reddit, and I'm

211
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,720
 looking at all the other articles, and I'm just kind of scrolling through them, looking

212
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,760
 at all these other articles they've posted.

213
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,520
 I come across one, and this is the headline, and this is pretty typical for how these bot-written

214
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,320
 headlines are read.

215
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,320
 Quote, "James Crumbly Death.

216
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
 Dead.

217
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,760
 Obituary news.

218
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,500
 The second Blahino profile pic is of a Spanish soccer player who passed away.

219
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,320
 James Crumbly was a kid soccer coach.

220
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,900
 Click link to read full story."

221
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,340
 And you click on it, obviously I'm like, "Click the link, gotta know more."

222
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,260
 And the reason why, I mean, the guy post 50, or the bot post all these articles, the reason

223
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,260
 why that stuck out to me is I know that name, James Crumbly.

224
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,220
 That's the father of that kid who just shot up that school, Ethan Crumbly.

225
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,580
 Ethan Crumbly, I do have to say this, he looks like the flu.

226
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,240
 Have you guys seen a picture of this new school shooter?

227
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,840
 He looks like the Musa Nex guy.

228
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
 He looks gross.

229
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,160
 I don't know, I don't know why this is all the sudden become a Paris Hilton podcast,

230
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
 but he looks like a human disease.

231
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
 It's really weird.

232
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,400
 Like you can see the goo coming out of him.

233
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,680
 Either that, or I need to go talk to my doctor and start taking some anti-halosanogenic medicine.

234
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,720
 'Cause he's gross looking, he looks like Grimace Wormtongue on a bad day.

235
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,320
 Anyways, James Crumbly was his dad.

236
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,820
 And James Crumbly's like, "Oh, you're super gross, you're super disgusting, don't hug me."

237
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,060
 James Crumbly, and I recognize the name and I go, "Wait a second, maybe there's two James

238
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,340
 Crumblies walking around, I'm sure."

239
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,340
 So I clicked on that.

240
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,180
 And it was an article, it was just gibberish, talking about James Crumbly, talking about

241
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,180
 Blahino, and I go, "Who the hell's Blahino?

242
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,620
 I don't know, this guy is..."

243
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:26,460
 Blahino is a weightlifter who's so notorious, apparently he has his own Wikipedia, not his

244
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:32,240
 own Wikipedia page, he has the Blahpedia, where people post stuff about all this cringe

245
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
 things he's done.

246
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,640
 Apparently he's a weightlifter who was also a CIA assassin, believes the Illuminati is

247
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,640
 fake and not only is the Illuminati fake, which I, that's a fair assessment, he believes

248
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,000
 the Illuminati is fake and it was invented by Muslims on the internet.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,320
 And I go, "Ooh, I gotta check this guy out.

250
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,060
 I mean, I've spent five minutes looking at his page.

251
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,380
 This is fascinating, so we're probably gonna do a future Blahino theme segment."

252
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:08,580
 But so he has nothing to do with soccer, I tried finding, is there another guy who plays

253
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,780
 soccer who does Blahino?

254
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,860
 Nothing to do with James Crumbly, so what it looks...

255
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,820
 Oh, and it says in the article, "James Crumbly was a kid's soccer coach," so I go, "Is that

256
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
 true?

257
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,980
 I don't know."

258
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,820
 So I looked it up in James Crumbly.

259
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,480
 The only connection I could find between...

260
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,520
 This is all tragic, the only connection I could find between soccer and Ethan Crumbly

261
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,200
 and James, the dad, is that one of the victims, a young woman who was injured, played soccer.

262
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,600
 So that pops up in these search fields, these bots are just constructing these articles.

263
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,920
 So it's not just they're doing the celebrity deaths, it's not just they're taking people

264
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,520
 who actually passed away, it seems like they're trying to find things that get hits out there

265
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,420
 and trying to consolidate them, but that's not even the weirdest part of his story.

266
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,860
 So I'm going to all these websites and if you type in Karen Ray Schick, even though she

267
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,500
 had this long career, she didn't have a huge internet presence, you will see page after

268
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,420
 page of these bot articles.

269
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,300
 That's the number one hit for her now is all of these bot articles.

270
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,420
 And you're clicking on them and you're looking at them and stuff like that, and it's just

271
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,220
 all this AI generated stuff.

272
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,880
 Like I said, it's even weirder than that because one of the art, this is the article that caught

273
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
 my eye.

274
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,440
 This is the article that when Stella was putting out there, caught my eye.

275
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,520
 Is this is the headline?

276
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,960
 Is the assistant director dead or alive?

277
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:37,080
 Karen Ray Schick, Deaf News, Hokes Rumors, Details.

278
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,120
 Now this article was just published on December 3rd.

279
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,560
 I don't know when Karen Ray Schick passed away.

280
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,560
 This article was just published on December 3rd.

281
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,260
 And it tells the story about Karen Ray was a worldwide famous assistant director.

282
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,740
 I don't think any assistant director is well-famous, but anyways, it goes on.

283
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,220
 You're an assistant director.

284
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,220
 You're like, "Aw, sorry, you're famous."

285
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,220
 But everyone else, I don't know.

286
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,820
 And it kind of goes on through her career.

287
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,580
 And it says in 1989, she started as a production manager.

288
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,220
 So I mean, we just have these weird generated sentences.

289
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,780
 Now it could be, as I was saying this, I was saying it could be a translation error, but

290
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,040
 I don't think so because even with the translation errors, the output is just so much.

291
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,800
 I do think it's AI pushing this stuff out, but just weirdly worded sentences.

292
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,960
 And then it goes, "Does the first initial question arise," this is a quote, "Does the

293
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,360
 first initial question arise about her after the current situation that is she dead or

294
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,040
 alive?"

295
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,400
 Even the official sources of news have not confirmed the death.

296
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,960
 So there is a lack of confirmation.

297
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,480
 And that's why absolutely she is alive and doing good in work.

298
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,500
 We will also get more amazing work from the personality in the upcoming days.

299
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,540
 Then it lists some random show she worked on.

300
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,700
 And Estelle has written this article and it's infuriating.

301
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
 It's very hurtful.

302
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,460
 This is a mother who has passed away and now there's a death hoax surrounding Karen Ray

303
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
 Schick.

304
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
 Now, obviously I'm going to go on the record.

305
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,620
 I don't believe in this hoax.

306
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,300
 I'm not trying to prop up this hoax in any way, shape, or form.

307
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,500
 Why is this doing that?

308
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,480
 The site made up a death hoax.

309
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,560
 All it knew about her was that she recently passed away, she worked in Hollywood and it

310
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,320
 generated an article that would get people to click on it.

311
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,520
 Maybe 10 people and then the article would just be forgotten in a source but that would

312
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,560
 be 10 cents or maybe you get a dime each time.

313
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,960
 I don't know how it's working.

314
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
 Clicking on the ads.

315
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,620
 But hoaxes and death hoaxes and celebrities faking their deaths, that all is part of pretty

316
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,860
 common conspiracy 101 lore, right?

317
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,540
 Tupac, Elvis, Miley Cyrus, all these people who have faked their own deaths or been killed

318
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,540
 and replaced by clones, stuff like that.

319
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:07,020
 So we are at a point that I predicted this what a couple weeks ago I did an episode called

320
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,940
 Should We Melt the Conspiracy Theory Iceberg?

321
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,440
 It was episode 704, so it was actually a couple months ago.

322
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,880
 But the point is that we were coming across conspiracy theory icebergs that were generated

323
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
 by AIs.

324
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,880
 And I said eventually we're going to get to a point where you're going to have conspiracy

325
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,520
 articles written by AIs.

326
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,560
 And here we are now, it's happening now.

327
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,620
 This is a conspiracy article.

328
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,920
 It's not true, it's not true, and it's written in a mysterious way that maybe they are alive.

329
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,440
 And then it says no, no, they are alive.

330
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,400
 All that information was fake.

331
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,820
 It made up a conspiracy theory.

332
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:48,540
 Now 99.999% and this is not to diminish her work, but 99.999% of humanity will never

333
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,300
 Google or look up the name Karen Reschick.

334
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,940
 They just won't.

335
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,940
 So I don't understand why this is doing that.

336
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,820
 I guess that if you do it enough and you get enough clicks, they're getting what they

337
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,040
 want, but this is such a niche article.

338
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
 Neach whatever.

339
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,840
 The point is it's such a small audience for the article.

340
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,920
 It's an assistant director who recently passed away and then people who are also into death

341
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,120
 oaks.

342
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,480
 And it's almost there.

343
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,080
 The machine is almost ready to go because here's the thing, you keep perfecting that.

344
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,200
 And they see which articles get the hits and which ones don't.

345
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,600
 That James Crumbly article with Bohino probably got a lot more hits.

346
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,980
 There's a lot of times it's just a local crime thing.

347
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,580
 Guys got shot at ATM and no one's really going to click on that.

348
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,740
 I mean, maybe the guy's family is sad, but they'll just go to the legitimate news, but

349
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,180
 like the James Crumbly, Bohino thing, that probably gets more clicks.

350
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,540
 This AI is going to keep fine tuning itself.

351
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
 It's that whole idea.

352
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,340
 You build a machine that makes nothing but paper clips and eventually it turns the entire

353
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,620
 universe into paper clips because it has one sole purpose to make paper clips.

354
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,960
 They're creating AIs that have a purpose to create clickable articles and it will learn

355
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,320
 what articles are the most clickable, whether or not they're true or not, is irrelevant.

356
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,880
 Whether or not the planet Saturn wants to be turned into paper clips is irrelevant.

357
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,720
 And the AI will get good enough and it knows what we want and it will make conspiracy theories

358
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
 up.

359
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,080
 And the worst part is, is people will believe them.

360
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,640
 Not a lot of people read articles nowadays.

361
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,200
 A lot of people just read the headlines, but as this AI, I'm not saying it's going to happen

362
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
 tomorrow.

363
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,620
 I didn't think this is going to happen as quickly as it did, but I think that's what

364
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
 we're going to see.

365
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,980
 We're going to start seeing these AI generated conspiracy theories getting out there.

366
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,500
 And most of them are going to be like this, just a blink.

367
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,900
 It really, really irritates the people that is close to you and no one else is aware of

368
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,900
 it.

369
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,940
 But then we're going to get the big ones, some big ones like I don't know flat earth level,

370
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,660
 but orange is evil monkeys don't exist level, which does have a cult following.

371
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,200
 And the AI will learn and learn how to make better conspiracy theories and people will

372
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
 start to believe them utter nonsense.

373
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,760
 They will believe utter nonsense because the computer told them to.

374
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
 This is a very, very dark path we're going down.

375
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,960
 And that's not even the weirdest part.

376
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,240
 Because as I was researching this story, I got hacked.

377
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,360
 My P cloud account, which I never really have anything in suffered multiple brute force

378
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,420
 attacks.

379
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,780
 And so I took the IP and I put it in.

380
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,620
 I'm my IP locator.

381
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,780
 They came from India.

382
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,380
 And I put those links in the show notes.

383
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,220
 You can actually see the IP and where it was at.

384
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,660
 As I was researching this, just because I was clicking on these links, my Google accounts

385
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,900
 started flipping out.

386
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
 I got multiple emails going.

387
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,700
 There's an attempt that someone's trying to log into your account.

388
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,700
 Someone's trying to log into your account.

389
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,620
 So ended there doing it for multiple locations because I was clicking on these articles.

390
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,220
 Now I'm a seasoned computer guy.

391
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,200
 I know my way around computers.

392
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,260
 I work with other people's computers.

393
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,240
 I do not get viruses easily.

394
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,640
 This was just from pulling up the website.

395
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,460
 This was from me not clicking on anything.

396
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
 Not watching it.

397
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,520
 Not seeing a sexy, ebony video game ad.

398
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,460
 Just from pulling up the website and going there and looking at it.

399
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,240
 My P cloud account had several brute force attempts.

400
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,380
 And I thought, you have that two factor authorization set up and all that stuff.

401
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,620
 So that's the future.

402
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,900
 That is the future of, I think, conspiracy theory content.

403
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
 We're going to have to fight against this.

404
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
 Because it's going to be really cool and it's going to be super sexy.

405
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,980
 And the stories the AI will put out will speak to us on a certain level and will make us

406
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,900
 go, whoa, this is coming from some enlightened person.

407
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,540
 They'll get better at the text generation.

408
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,420
 They'll get better at the sentence structure.

409
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,780
 And those headlines to get people to click on it in the first place, they'll be indistinguishable

410
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,120
 from what a normal lunatic would write.

411
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 And it'd actually be better because it'd be fine tuned for what type of things people

412
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,160
 are into.

413
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,320
 Could you imagine an AI getting a hold of a pizza gate level, creating a pizza gate

414
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,520
 level conspiracy?

415
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,040
 That's what I'm worried about.

416
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,360
 So yeah, fascinating story.

417
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,880
 Sorry for your passing, Karen.

418
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,280
 And sorry for the pain that it's giving to your child.

419
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
 That's awful.

420
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,640
 Because they're like, I don't want this.

421
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,700
 So but it is a harbinger, I believe, of future bad.

422
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,180
 Joaquin, let's go ahead and leave behind this story.

423
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,060
 I'm going to touch the keys of the carbon recovery.

424
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,980
 Leave behind Los Angeles, California.

425
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:38,820
 If we are headed all the way out to Avonio, Italy.

426
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,780
 It's spring 1980.

427
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,680
 And there's like bumblebees flying.

428
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,080
 They're like sitting on flowers and there's like the sun is going goodbye.

429
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,240
 And he's just like, I just looked down at my notes and it takes place at night.

430
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,080
 The sun sets and then it's like an evening.

431
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,680
 It's a cool, crisp spring evening in Italy.

432
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,800
 There's a local farmer riding his motorcycle through town.

433
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
 Let's call him Terry.

434
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 So Terry.

435
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:12,260
 I was going to see how long I could do that.

436
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,140
 I was going to see if I could do for the rest of the episode.

437
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
 I just like making motorcycle noises.

438
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:23,580
 He's driving through town on his motorcycle and he sees something in the town square.

439
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:29,380
 A giant glass cage.

440
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:36,360
 It stops his motorcycle.

441
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
 Pulls his key out.

442
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,240
 I should just stop doing this podcast and just do an episode.

443
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
 Nothing but motorcycle noises.

444
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
 That one was pretty good.

445
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,840
 And he gets off of his motorcycle and he starts walking over and he's looking at this glass

446
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,960
 cage in town square.

447
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,760
 Now it doesn't say exactly what time of night this was.

448
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,720
 It doesn't say how alone he was.

449
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,520
 But I'm imagining there weren't a lot of people around because he's the only one at

450
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,860
 this point who notices this giant glass cage.

451
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,460
 And maybe it's in our project.

452
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
 Maybe.

453
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,660
 But if you let me finish, if you didn't interrupt me, I could tell you what was going on here.

454
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:18,860
 So walking towards this glass cage and he sees inside of it is something.

455
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,340
 Something sitting down.

456
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,100
 And as he's getting closer to this glass cage he looks and he notices there's someone

457
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,560
 inside of it.

458
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,680
 Or something.

459
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,800
 This figure was very tall.

460
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,880
 Even sitting down.

461
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,280
 Terry could tell how tall this thing was.

462
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:47,320
 It was sitting straight up with its hands on its knees.

463
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,360
 Perfectly poised.

464
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,920
 But that would just be Abraham Lincoln getting ready for his photograph to be taken.

465
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,980
 He's just a tall guy.

466
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:08,260
 But this thing, that's why it's a thing, its entire body is covered in long green filaments.

467
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,300
 Each inch of its skin seems to be a little green.

468
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,140
 A little furry.

469
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,180
 This thing also had long hair.

470
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,820
 But for whatever reason.

471
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,860
 I don't know, fashionable, interdimensional physics.

472
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,660
 Its hair was standing straight up in the air.

473
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,580
 He continues walking towards, I would have left a while ago, right?

474
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,900
 I would have been making motorcycle noises back at home.

475
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,980
 He continues walking towards this giant green monster.

476
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,700
 And that's when all of a sudden he's hit with a powerful odor.

477
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,780
 It is so strong it actually begins to disorient him.

478
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,340
 He can't get any closer.

479
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,140
 This thing smells so strong.

480
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
 Not bad.

481
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,140
 They don't specify that it was a bad smell.

482
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,740
 It's just such an overpowering smell.

483
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,060
 He couldn't get any closer.

484
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,300
 It begins to back off.

485
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,940
 And he turns and he starts walking to his motorcycle.

486
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,260
 He's like, "If it wasn't our project, if it was the most smelly our project ever, I

487
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,820
 don't know what could it have been.

488
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,220
 It was a giant guy in a glass tube.

489
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,940
 I could have just been, sculpture something like that."

490
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:31,300
 And then all of a sudden he hears the sound of glass breaking.

491
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:40,060
 He turns back and he sees two blonde women standing in the town square screaming at the

492
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:49,300
 top of their lungs.

493
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:55,540
 According to the report, it just says he walked back to his motorcycle and then heard a sound

494
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,660
 similar to glass breaking.

495
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,740
 As he looked back, he saw two blonde girls screaming.

496
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,540
 No other information is how this report ends.

497
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,780
 That was reported by Maurizio Virga.

498
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,980
 He actually is a really big UFO writer in Italy.

499
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,380
 He wrote the very first, at least what he claims, the very first book of UFO sightings

500
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,660
 in Italy in English.

501
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:22,420
 It was the very first time that those sightings had been translated to English.

502
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,020
 There's so much stuff you could talk about with this story as short as it is.

503
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,140
 There are so many places you can go with it.

504
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,260
 We don't have a ton of information.

505
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,540
 I tried looking for the book that this specifically came from.

506
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,580
 I couldn't find it, but he is still putting stuff out.

507
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:40,980
 I'll tell you this right now.

508
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,620
 If you want to go to the website of this man, Maurizio Virga, you will see the website of

509
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,820
 an Italian UFO researcher.

510
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,260
 If you picture an Italian UFO researcher, it's him.

511
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,420
 It's the hunkiest researcher you've ever seen.

512
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,700
 The photo is like welcome.

513
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,860
 Here are the books I have to sell about ET and the website is bordered in photos of him

514
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,340
 with his shirt off.

515
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,700
 He was just standing there against a rail with the Atlantic Ocean on his back.

516
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,220
 It's like, "Is this a dating profile?

517
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,780
 Are you trying to find aliens, bro?"

518
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,820
 Because you found both.

519
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,700
 So you have this hunky UFO researcher on the scene.

520
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,300
 But let's break this down by element, because there's really a lot of interesting stuff

521
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
 to talk about.

522
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,220
 One, the glass box appearing in the town square.

523
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,340
 Just that alone makes me think of some sort of interdimensional event.

524
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,980
 It is just there.

525
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,260
 It's something that is out of place of the environment.

526
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,180
 So right there, that's just a creepy image.

527
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,020
 The giant creature in the box.

528
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
 We don't get it.

529
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,660
 I mean, a humanoid, I'm assuming.

530
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,980
 The filament thing, was it an artificial filament or was it, I keep saying hairy just because

531
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,860
 I couldn't think of another word, but was it like more of a mechanical or a biomechanical

532
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
 feel?

533
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,860
 Was it more like tubing?

534
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
 How thick were they?

535
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,980
 I think that's really fascinating.

536
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,060
 The creature with its hair standing up.

537
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,700
 To be honest, I don't like that detail.

538
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,700
 That detail is super lame to me.

539
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,820
 I make some sound like a giant troll doll, but I'm a reporter.

540
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,420
 I got to include it.

541
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,820
 But yeah, again, like how is that the physics plane?

542
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,180
 And then I find it so much so he's a...

543
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,220
 And I joke about wanting to leave, but I would also probably get pretty close to this thing.

544
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,220
 He gets close to it.

545
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,380
 He's hit with the overpowering smell.

546
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,740
 It's very, very common in paranormal lore, whether it's sulfur, whether it's, well, it's

547
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,580
 usually sulfur, but these smells that are associated with Bigfoot sightings.

548
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,780
 Well, Bigfoot sightings not necessarily sulfur, but it's just a horrible smell that we have

549
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,820
 associated with Bigfoot.

550
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
 So that's interesting.

551
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,900
 It ties into the lore.

552
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,380
 Let's go back and look at this final ending here, this final event, because there's two

553
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,660
 ways to read it.

554
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,540
 The first way I read it, and the second way I read it, there's probably more than just

555
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,820
 the two ways that I read it.

556
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,580
 I'm not God of the universe, but anyways, so the first time I read it, I pictured it

557
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,260
 like this.

558
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,020
 He sees the giant green guy.

559
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
 He smells it.

560
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
 He's running around a leaf.

561
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:04,620
 He hears the glass break and he turns back and he sees the two blonde women screaming.

562
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:11,940
 And the, to me, the implication is that they, the creatures after them, that they got too

563
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,740
 close to it and the creature broke out of the glass cage and was coming after them.

564
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,980
 That was my initial read on that.

565
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,420
 No other information is how that ends.

566
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
 What a great cliffing.

567
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,340
 You're like, did this thing come out and, you know, eat them?

568
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
 Did it brutally maul them?

569
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,140
 They could throw armor on each babe and be like, where's the nearest club, women?

570
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,900
 I'm from Orion's Nebula and I'm ready to party.

571
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,740
 Like we don't know.

572
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,740
 We don't know.

573
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,540
 But there's another way to read it too, just using the exact same text.

574
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,860
 And this is, when I was reading it later, this is like, well, maybe this is what happened.

575
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,220
 He then heard a sound similar to glass breaking.

576
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,940
 As he looked back, he saw two blonde girls screaming.

577
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,980
 No other information.

578
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,940
 He hears the shattering of the glass.

579
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,260
 There's a big giant green monster in the glass cage.

580
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,100
 He hears the shattering of the glass.

581
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,460
 He's not looking at it.

582
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:15,620
 He turns back and now, in place of the glass cage, he sees two blonde women screaming.

583
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,140
 Because that's what it sounds like when you read it like that.

584
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,740
 He doesn't say that he saw the monster at all.

585
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,220
 He doesn't say that he saw the glass cage in rubble.

586
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,660
 He turned back and he saw, in its place, two blonde women screaming.

587
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,620
 Which to me is infinitely more bizarre and a little terrifying.

588
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:38,860
 Because that goes back into that whole reality shifting alternate.

589
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,700
 I can't even really wrap my head around that.

590
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,460
 If I saw a glass box and monster breaks out of a glass box and attacks a bunch of random

591
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,020
 people, not me, I'm fine with that.

592
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,340
 I can wrap my head around that because that's what animals do.

593
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,660
 That's what humans do, right?

594
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,500
 You break out and you fight.

595
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,460
 You start being a people near you.

596
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,780
 Never play couch cushion for it with me because I'll push out of them and start being you

597
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
 up.

598
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,540
 But I'm thinking about this now.

599
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:10,020
 What if that box shattered and two blonde women who had been abducted by aliens or

600
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,940
 something like that appeared?

601
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,300
 This was some sort of dimensional placeholder.

602
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,460
 The beast was no threat.

603
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,540
 The beast was just some sort of image that was conjured up.

604
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,780
 And when the glass thing disappeared, the women were returned.

605
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,060
 Or...

606
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,260
 The glass box explodes.

607
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,860
 I'm making this way weirder than...

608
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,260
 The glass box explodes.

609
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,020
 He turns back.

610
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,700
 He sees two blonde women screaming.

611
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,540
 Are the two blonde women real?

612
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,740
 Are they also an image?

613
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,340
 Like where did they come from?

614
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
 You know what I'm saying?

615
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:56,980
 Like what if this green monster man shows up in a glass box and he's sitting there and

616
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,860
 he's like, "I've journeyed long from Orion's Nebula.

617
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,860
 I wanted a party, but first I have a mission to complete."

618
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:09,660
 And then he breaks out of the glass cage and becomes two hot blonde chicks.

619
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,420
 And they're screaming because the mission is a success.

620
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,820
 Because you can't tell the difference.

621
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,220
 When a woman's screaming, you can't tell if someone just chopped off her right foot or

622
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,820
 she saw her best friend she hasn't seen in three years.

623
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,740
 And so Terry turns around and he's like, "Ah, and now there was these two hot blondes walking

624
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:30,060
 around Italy, but it was really one giant green alien guy split between them."

625
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,020
 And they're like going to the clubs and they're like dancing with each other, all sexy against

626
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,020
 each other.

627
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,620
 But for him, that would just be him like playing with his own, like tweaking with his own nipples.

628
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,060
 Little nipple clamps.

629
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,660
 But to everyone else, looks like these two hot blondes are like rubbing up on each other.

630
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,980
 And then he goes, "Okay, I got that out of my system.

631
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
 I really wanted to..."

632
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,980
 It's like, "Next up, the shower."

633
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:56,280
 But anyway, so after about two or three weeks of him just exploring himself or herself's,

634
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,180
 now that he's two blonde women, then they go get a job at like, I don't know, a nuclear

635
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
 power plant?

636
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,380
 Do they have those in Italy?

637
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,500
 Do they have those in Italy?

638
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,020
 They go to France.

639
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,980
 And if he has used these blonde women's bodies to infiltrate our planet, because I'm going

640
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,820
 to tell you this right now, that is the perfect disguise because just people will let you

641
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,980
 go anywhere.

642
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,420
 Like if you're walking into a nuclear facility, they'd be like, "Jason, they didn't even

643
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
 recognize me."

644
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
 They're like, "Not again.

645
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,260
 No, you cannot have any plutonium."

646
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,140
 And if you did, it would not turn you into a superhero.

647
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,180
 You have to leave.

648
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:38,220
 You have to imagine like a super hot blonde, like walking by.

649
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,340
 She's like, "Oh no, I need to go in there."

650
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,020
 It's like an open reactor.

651
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,140
 They're like, "Sure, go ahead."

652
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,020
 And if there's two hot blondes, I'm glad, does it even say in the notes that they're

653
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,020
 hot?

654
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,540
 It just says they're two blonde girls.

655
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,260
 But you know, if two hot blondes showed up at the White House, they're like, "We want

656
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
 to see the president."

657
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,860
 The Secret Service is going to be like, "That's cool."

658
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,380
 And just like, "Let him in."

659
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,140
 My point is, I don't know what this ending is.

660
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,140
 Not this ending I'm recording right now, but this ending of the story.

661
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:12,660
 I think there's the way to read it, and I think the classical way to read it is, the

662
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,420
 monster broke out and went after the girls.

663
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,060
 And maybe we have lost time.

664
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,100
 Terry doesn't really remember what happened.

665
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,020
 Because that is very common in UFO lore that something crazy happens and then the memory

666
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
 just stops.

667
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
 Totally possible.

668
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,700
 And it would also be a hundred times more puzzling if he turns around, the green monster

669
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,580
 is gone, the two blonde women are there screaming, and then they just walk away.

670
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,860
 That would also just be the end of the story.

671
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,500
 And you would have a harder time wrapping your head around that.

672
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,340
 Monsters attacking people, that's what monsters do.

673
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,900
 Monsters turning into people, or monsters ceasing to exist, and then two people just

674
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,020
 standing there.

675
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,580
 That's way weirder, and it's infinitely more scary.

676
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:01,300
 Because then I have to wonder, who's to say, like when I'm walking down the street, that

677
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,540
 the people around me aren't trying to green monsters full in half?

678
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,700
 They probably aren't, right?

679
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,700
 If that's your unique paranoia, I'm not saying, I'm not trying to worry you.

680
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,980
 But it would be the perfect way to infiltrate.

681
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:20,140
 Coming down and turning into beautiful women, and you would be marrying super powerful people.

682
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,100
 You'd be marrying UFO researchers, hunky UFO researchers.

683
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,980
 That would be, yeah, I wonder, actually, now that I say that.

684
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,220
 That would be really good, and aliens come down and then they start banging UFO researchers,

685
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,260
 because you know we're like the top of the genetic breed.

686
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,820
 But then they could change our research.

687
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,820
 So yeah, I don't know.

688
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,900
 I think, there's like, Jason, the story was actually really creepy.

689
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,620
 The idea that there's a monster appears in the middle of town and starts chasing women,

690
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,620
 that was creepy.

691
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,620
 I don't know.

692
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:55,460
 I don't know what you're going on about all this women can go anywhere you even at when

693
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,220
 you're saying that a beautiful woman can walk into a nuclear power plant.

694
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,620
 I'm not saying, okay, maybe not the White House, but I think it's easier for them to

695
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
 get access.

696
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,100
 I'm talking like top models, right?

697
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,980
 If you're super hot, you'd have an easier time getting into a restricted area.

698
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,620
 And where do aliens want to go?

699
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,620
 Restricted areas.

700
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,860
 They're constantly flying their UFOs over nuclear power plants, and maybe they go, now

701
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,900
 let's go see what's inside.

702
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,500
 So they tried being like a little gray alien and they got dissected.

703
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,580
 And then they just tried looking like a normal nerd who works in a nuclear power plant and

704
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,100
 they're like, can we see your ID?

705
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,900
 And then they showed up as like Jessica Rabbit.

706
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,580
 And then the general's like, boy, his eyes are like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

707
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,900
 They're like, oh, we need to keep him away from that plutonium.

708
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,740
 And they started to melt his face.

709
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,540
 He's all, aw.

710
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,860
 And so that's what I'm talking about.

711
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,580
 Aliens should become beautiful women and infiltrate these high level places.

712
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:51,740
 I just realized, I think I've described like five CineMax soft core porn's in the past

713
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,340
 10 minutes.

714
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,140
 But yeah, I think that would be a good plan.

715
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,780
 So, so was this really a spooky monster that broke out of a glass cage that I ruined a

716
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,780
 story?

717
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,780
 That I ruined a really cool story about a monster that broke out of a glass cage and attacked

718
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
 two women.

719
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,860
 And then Terry just had no recollection because his memory was wiped.

720
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
 It's possible.

721
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,860
 It's very scary.

722
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,820
 It's very scary that I discover a conspiracy that aliens is very, very specific conspiracy

723
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
 theory.

724
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:21,060
 No AI can come up with this, that aliens are coming down and turning themselves into two

725
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,700
 hot blondes.

726
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:28,940
 Because if you think that we can fight off an alien invasion, you're probably right.

727
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,980
 But what if the aliens were super bangable?

728
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:38,260
 Would you be willing to pick up a pulse rifle and shoot Pamela Anderson like an army of them

729
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,700
 coming at you in the Baywatch outfit?

730
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,540
 They're not dressed in like some dummy alien outfit.

731
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:47,580
 They're dressed up in the red outfit and like Britney Spears is like on this commander ship

732
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,500
 and she's like sending a bunch of Taylor Swift out.

733
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,740
 Those are like the ground forces, the foot soldiers.

734
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,180
 They're like, oh, you can wipe those off the map.

735
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,780
 They're coming across the field, but no one take out the Britney Spears.

736
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,020
 We wouldn't be able to do that.

737
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,500
 We wouldn't be able to do that.

738
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,220
 We would just battle down to our beautiful alien overlords.

739
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,980
 And I've realized that now that I've spoken that into the universe, on the Omnicron Nebula,

740
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,860
 they are already in their ships right now, headed out to Earth.

741
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,060
 It'll be the sexiest invasion of all time.

742
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:41,060

743
