1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
 We're going deep into Russian territory today.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,000
 First off, we're going to look at some mythological creatures from the Tatar Empire.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,500
 A civilization that was destroyed by the Soviet Union, yet some of their myths still last.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:22,500
 And then we join an unfortunate group of people that the Soviet Union deemed unnecessary.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,000
 Put them all on a train, send them out east.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Their final destination, Cannibal Island, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,500
 Both of our stories today pretty much take place in the same region.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,000
 One is fairly lighthearted even though a bunch of people die.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 And then the other one is quite grim and even more people die.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 But let's go ahead and get started on this extra fun,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Eurasian adventure-filled episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I know how many listeners I have in Russia.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I don't know how many listeners I have in Siberia.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 But did you know, here's a little tidbit for you.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Right now in the personal journals category of the podcast world,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 we're the seventh ranked podcast in Bahrain.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 What? How did that happen? It's awesome.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 We were number two for a couple of days and we got bumped down.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But anyways, yeah, number seven right now in the personal journals category in Bahrain.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 It's awesome, man.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And I think in this society and culture we're like 20th or 30th or something like that.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 But anyways, that's how this podcast is categorized.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 There's no category for paranormal.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 You just kind of got to find a category to put in.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I think personal stories fits.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Number two Bahrain listeners, thank you for making me formerly the number two.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And now, what did I say it was? The number seven?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Yeah, the number seven podcast in Bahrain.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 In that particular category, not all of them.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 So, but let's go ahead.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 We're going to say goodbye to our Bahrain listeners, not like permanently.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Keep listening to the show, but actually, why am I saying goodbye to you?

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 You guys are also getting in to the Carvener Coptor and we are flying over to Russia.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Now, we talked about the Tatar Empire during our mudflat episode.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And if you didn't hear that episode, it's not a big deal.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 We went over the history of the Tatarian Empire and I'll go over it very briefly now.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Apparently, there was this massive empire that ruled huge swaths of Russia.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And then when the Soviet Union took over, they erased them from the history books.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And you can still see mentions of them.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 This isn't really even a conspiracy.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 There's actual documented proof that people who know the region are like,

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 "Oh yeah, totally, the Tatar's. They're like my neighbor."

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But they got a ton of press for hundreds of years and the Soviet Union took over

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 and because it was mostly like a Muslim empire, they basically just wiped them out of the history books.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And what's weird is everyone else just went along with it.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 But today, we're going to look at some Tatarian cryptids,

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Tatarian creatures of ill-repute.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Actually, I think that means they're a whore.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Tatarian creatures of bad stuff you don't want to run into in a dark alley.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Or well at alley or anywhere at all.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 The Tatarian Empire had been this massive military group and government.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 They must have this amazing culture with these amazing legends, right?

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Let's take a look at some of them here.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 First off, and some of these you'll recognize, well, maybe you won't, because I didn't,

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 but some of them are still talked about in Russia today.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 So a lot of them are of Tatar origin, but they're still around in Russian folklore today.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Because they had a lot of bleed through.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 They had a lot of cultural contamination between those two groups.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Obviously, they live next to each other.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 We're going to look at first this Serauling.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 We're going to go into the forests of Siberia.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 But we don't want to because we know what's out there.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 It's a forest-dwelling shapeshifter.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Ooh, it's a good start.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Anything that lives in the woods is creepy by definition because there's a lot of places to hide.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And the fact that it can change its form, absolutely terrifying.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 It can be anything, anywhere.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Shapeshifter in the desert, not a big deal.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 You just see a cactus and then anything else, you go, "Oh, that's a Serauling."

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 You walk the other way, but a forest, it can be anywhere.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Long fingers, shah!

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Horn. Just one horn.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Because you know, the economy's not doing so well over there.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So, we're going to look forward to one horn on the head.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Sling! Big hairy body.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Big foot with some natural weapons.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 You can ram me with the horn.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Well, I guess it doesn't say there's... Just his long fingers.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It doesn't say there's claws on it.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So, anyways, the only one good natural weapon, the horn on the head.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 It also, it's a shapeshifter.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And one of its best disguises is it can turn into a peasant with glowing red eyes.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Now, when I got to that point in the description, I thought, "That's not a good disguise at all."

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Like, that's a good disguise if they're always in front of you, facing the opposite direction.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 You're like, "Hey, what's a Russian name?"

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 "Hey, Vladimir."

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 The guy's like, "Yeah?"

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And he's like, "Hey, turn around."

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 He's like, "No, I'm good."

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 "I'm just going to look in this direction."

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 "No, Vladimir."

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 "Turn around, man. I got to talk to you."

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Like, what a terrible disguise.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And that makes me wonder, is all of its disguises involve red eyes?

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Turns into a squirrel, red eyes.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Oddly enough, again, I'm assuming this is some sort of translation error, but it wears its shoes backwards.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 First off, why does a shapeshifter have shoes?

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And secondly, what?

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 So are their feet facing the right direction and their shoes are on backwards?

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 So you see, like, their toes sticking out of the heel and then, like, the shoes all floppy?

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Or I'm thinking what it means is that the shoes are on the wrong foot.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Which is still quite uncomfortable, but not nearly as uncomfortable as if you put your shoes on backwards.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Your toes are all mangled up.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 What do they do, Jason?

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 That's what you're asking right now?

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Yeah, you're looking at your watch.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Come on, Jason, get to the point.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Steals people's axes.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Now, I know you thought I was going to say Steals people's souls, because that would be awesome.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And at this point, you should start to realize something.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Tatar cryptids are quite bizarre.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Quite bizarre indeed.

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 They steal your axes.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 If you don't have an axe, you have nothing to worry about these guys, unless they lure you into the thickets.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So they'll be like facing the opposite direction.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 They'll be like, hey, come here.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Come here.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And you're like, which direction are you pointing at?

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And then he's waving his arm over his shoulder.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 He's like, over here.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Over here, man, I'm shy.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I don't want to look at you in the eyes.

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 You have such beautiful eyes.

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Come here.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And you go into the bushes and he turns around and you see the glowing red eyes.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And you're like, oh no, you start looking for your axe.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And then he tickles you to death.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Quite the menacing cryptid.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Tatar and Empire, these creatures, steal your axes and then trick you into going somewhere alone with them and then tickle you.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So basically, it's like everyone's creepy uncle.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But with a horn, with a giant horn on his head.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 So I'm like, OK, cryptids normally have weaknesses.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 What's this guy's weakness?

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 What could you imagine this guy's weakness?

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Break the horn, throw holy water on him,

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 kick him in the nuts.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 What's his weakness?

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Here it is.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 You turn your clothes inside out,

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 and you wear your shoes on the opposite feet.

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Now, it doesn't explain if by seeing that they blow up,

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 or if they just lose interest in you,

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 or you can magically disappear.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 But that works, for some bizarre reason.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And that's why I think their shoes are on the opposite feet as well.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So maybe they're closer inside out and then they think you're also a sorority and they're just like,

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 "Ah, I'm not going to mess with you."

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 But then I guess they would notice your eyes aren't burning red.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 But yeah, so if you want to get away from these guys,

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 turn your clothes inside out, put your shoes on the other.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Which I'm-- OK.

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So let's imagine this.

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 A guy lures you into the bushes and is getting ready to tickle you.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And then, can you do it in front of them?

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Can you change your clothes real quick in front of them?

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I don't understand the logistics of this.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And it's something I want to know about.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Because I might run into one of these guys.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Because we're going to continue our journey in the Tatar region.

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 We're going to meet the Arkhura.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Arkhura.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 OK.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Here we go.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Shapeshifter.

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 They've got a lot of shapeshifters over there.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Shapeshifters and the wilderness go very well together.

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Perfect hunting technique.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 They're shapeshifters.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 They have horns-- heard that before-- hooves.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 That's different.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And tails.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 So basically, these are more like a devilish looking creature,

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 a western devil type creature.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 He can change shape.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 He can become a peasant with glowing red eyes.

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Now, normally when cryptids have the same description, I go,

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 "Oh, that's interesting.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 How do these cryptids in different regions have the same description?"

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 This is pretty much the same region.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 What I don't understand is why they basically gave both of these creatures

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 that are totally different.

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 They're not the same, the exact, stupid giveaway.

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 This one, though, is a lot more powerful.

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 So it's a shapeshifter.

189
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 It can be anything.

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 But a lot of times, it takes the shape of a man.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 It can be as small as a blade of grass.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Or as tall as the tallest tree.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 That's dope.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 That makes the serrally look like a total punk.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And if you didn't think that was cool enough,

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 this dude-- I think this is just such an amazing image.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 This peasant, despite his red glowing eyes, which is a dead giveaway,

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 he has a long beard and the beard is living grass.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 That's-- I thought, I was like, "Okay, that's enough difference.

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Like, that's a cool visual.

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 You gotta wonder if there's ladybugs rolling around in it or chiggers.

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And I'm like, "If you get too close to them, your skin starts itching."

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 But I still like that image.

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's a very nature-based thing.

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Cast no shadow.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Like a true hunter.

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Never give your position away.

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Whereas his left shoe on his right foot-- oh, great.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Now we're getting back to the lame stuff.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 What does he do?

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 He doesn't heal leave your ax alone, but this creature,

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 this totally different creature than the serrally,

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 tricks you to go into a cave with them to cause you to death.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 This is the reason why they got wiped off the map.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 The Soviet Union was just embarrassed of--

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 these are the best legends you can come up with after a thousand years of civilization now.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 We're getting rid of you.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But let's look at another one, because we've already been out in the wilderness now.

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 It's time to come back in, because it's so cold out there.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 We're gonna go to Vladimir's house.

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 They're like, "Hey, Vlad, what's up?"

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And he's not looking at us, and we're like, "Oh, damn it."

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And then he turns around and we see he's fine.

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 He's like, "Oh, sorry, I was just playing Switch."

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 He puts down a Switch, and he sits down, and he's like,

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 "Oh, yeah, did you guys meet those two totally awesome monsters out there?"

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And we're like, "Yeah, yeah, they're really cool, man.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Way better than American monsters."

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And we're like, "You lame."

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 But anyway, so as we totally lied to Vladimir, he goes,

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 "I got one more monster to share with you.

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It's called the Bychura.

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And this one's a house spirit.

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So the Tatarians believe that these things--

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 and modern-day Russians believe in this, not sense too, but Bychura and Vladimir's like,

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 "What are you saying?"

237
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 We're like, "Oh, nothing."

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Bychuras are these house spirits.

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Now, shape-shifters.

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 "Oh, oh, maybe these will be cool."

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Right?

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 You can't have all three be lame.

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Bychura-- here's the actual description.

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I love this description.

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And this is the actual-- I'm going to read this actual description of them here.

246
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 "It has also been said that the Bychura can take the appearance of cats or dogs."

247
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 They become a DVD of that movie just sitting on the table.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You're like, "That's weird. I didn't know I owned that movie."

249
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Other stories either give them completely monstrous appearances, or none at all.

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Who's writing that story?

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 They're like this thing crept through the house.

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Little kids are like, "What did it look like?"

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And the guy's like, "Uh, nothing."

254
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 "It didn't look like anything."

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 "Just go to bed, kids. Just get out of here."

256
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Anyway, that's the description.

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 It can either be a cat, a dog.

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 It can be a monster, or nothing.

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 It can be just air.

260
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 But that's not all, because we're going to continue here.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 "The actions performed by Bychura vaguely resemble those of poltergeists."

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So that makes sense with it not being visible.

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Poltergeist is different than a ghost, where poltergeists are just making pots and pans flying around.

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 So that kind of makes sense.

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So anyways, the actions performed by Bychura vaguely resemble those of poltergeists

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 and are not necessarily harmful.

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Next sentence in the description.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It wears red dresses.

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 A cat wearing a red dress?

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Nothing wearing a red dress?

271
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 It kind of feels like a monster having a poltergeist, an invisible poltergeist,

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 knocking over in pots and pans,

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 if in reality what you're seeing moving through your house late at night is a floating red dress.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Even-- I'll give them this.

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 The idea of a desiccated monster with horns and eight eyes and a thousand tongues

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 wearing a red dress is quite terrifying.

277
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 But a basset hound in a red dress is laughable.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 He could be knocking over everything in my house.

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 He could be a true poltergeist tripping me as I'm getting out of the shower.

280
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'd still be like, "Ah, you lovable mutt."

281
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Like, that's not scary at all.

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 The least possible thing is any animal wearing a red dress

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 or just a red dress with nothing wearing a red dress floating around my house,

284
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I'm not scared of.

285
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But these ones do have one special superpower, I guess?

286
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And I couldn't really understand the logic of this.

287
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 The Bychura is a house spirit,

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 and what it's been known to do is it helps stop domestic violence.

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 A noble goal if ever there was one.

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 How does a nothing or a cat or a dog or a monster in a red dress stop domestic violence?

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Before the woman is about to get hit by her husband or boyfriend or dad, whatever.

292
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Before the woman is about to get assaulted, the Bychura yanks her hair.

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So basically, it's assaulting you to warn you you're about to be assaulted.

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 That would be the equivalent of a fireman showing up at your house,

295
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 setting another fire to warn you there's a fire in your house.

296
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 So, there we go.

297
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Those are the cream of the crop of Tartarian cryptids.

298
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 So, don't book your travel plans over there anytime soon.

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I would like to see the dude with the grass beard,

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 but I'd rather just like see a photo of him or like him on Instagram.

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I don't actually have to go out and get tickled by him.

302
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So anyways, we are moving just slightly over where we're...

303
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 So, we don't even need the carbon or coffee.

304
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 We're going to jump on board the Jason Jalopy, drive 60 miles,

305
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 because we are headed out to Nazino Island.

306
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 So, what is Nazino Island?

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Nazino Island is, and I don't know and probably mispronouncing that,

308
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 we're not going to be using that word much more,

309
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 because it goes by a nickname now.

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 It goes by a nickname.

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 But back in 1933, it was known as Nazino Island.

312
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 It was far, far east out into Siberia, super remote area.

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 There's a bunch of natives around there.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 They're further east than the Tatar's.

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And the year was 1933.

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And what happens is, this guy comes up with a plan

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 to resettle 2 million people across Eurasia.

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 So, Stalin basically, we had these huge urban centers,

319
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 and they had all of this open land.

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And they're like, "We want to have these giant farms.

321
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 We want to have basic, we're going to tell people where to go.

322
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 It's communist. We tell you what you're going to do,

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 what your job's going to be, and so on and so forth."

324
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And so, they had done this plan before.

325
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And what they did was they picked up 2 million peasants

326
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 who they thought were undesirables.

327
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 They have to establish order very quickly in the Soviet Union.

328
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 So, they begin moving people around.

329
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And it's a great way to crush dissent,

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 because you just destroy networks.

331
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 But what happened was they took 2 million peasants

332
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 and they scattered them across,

333
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 not like one person each farm,

334
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 but they would take a group of a couple thousand here

335
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 and a couple thousand here and a couple thousand here,

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 and push them off on new, empty tracks of land in Siberia,

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 and they were able to start farms.

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 They had to. Otherwise, they were going to die.

339
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 So, they had done this before and it worked.

340
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 In 1933, this guy says, "Hey, Stalin, let's do that again,

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 but let's push them way farther out east."

342
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 So, we have all that land out there,

343
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 two birds with one stone.

344
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 We're going to take all of these undesirable people in our cities.

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 We're going to push them far out east, too.

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 We're going to get these farms.

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And I guarantee you, Mr. Stalin,

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 they're going to be self-sufficient within two years.

349
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 We won't even have to supply them with any food.

350
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 They'll be supplying us with food.

351
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 So, Stalin goes, "Okay, yeah, you know that worked so well before."

352
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 We might do it. I'll think about it.

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 But go ahead and start laying out the plans.

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Go start doing the groundwork for it.

355
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 But I may change my mind on that.

356
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Nope. So, he starts setting up this program.

357
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 But the first time they did it, they used peasants,

358
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 people who had worked farms before.

359
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 This new program, they were like, "We need to empty the cities."

360
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So, they began taking low-level criminals.

361
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 They began taking people who were walking around

362
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 without their papers on a particular night.

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 They began taking shop owners who were getting a little too uppity

364
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 for the Soviet Union, throwing them in train cars

365
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 and sending them out east.

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 So, unlike the people who grew up on the land before,

367
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 these were city folk.

368
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 There were a few peasants in these groups,

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 but nowhere near the amount you would need to have a self-sufficient farm.

370
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Ever. Two years, twenty years.

371
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 They just did not know how to work the land.

372
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 They started rounding up these people.

373
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Now, on the railroad trip from, say, like Moscow or Stalingrad

374
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 or Leningrad, they would give them a food ration.

375
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And it was 300 grams of bread a day, which is,

376
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I should go to that saying, which is nothing.

377
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 That's not enough food.

378
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 So, they're eating their little bits of bread.

379
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And of course, you have this mixture of people who are thieves

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 and petty criminals.

381
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 I don't think they're any murder.

382
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I don't think they're any, like, prisoners in there.

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Well, if everyone becomes a murderer by the end of the story,

384
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 but mostly it was just, like, petty thieves.

385
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And then, like, they were, when I was doing this research,

386
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 there was a woman who was out.

387
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 There was this woman who went shopping that night

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 and when she was stopped by the police, she didn't have her papers on her.

389
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 She got sent there.

390
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And there was a business owner who was, like, locking up his shop

391
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 and the cops were asking questions and they didn't really like his answers.

392
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 He ended up headed this way.

393
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Because people were able to kind of track down some,

394
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 who some of these people were later on.

395
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So, it was just, you could have had the bad luck of being in this train car,

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 being forced to only, being forced to survive off 300 grams a day.

397
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And the guy next to you is a pickpocket.

398
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 So, you're not even getting that.

399
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 What was making matters worse, too,

400
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 is that the criminals were not only stealing people's food,

401
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 they were stealing anything they had on them,

402
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 including important documents that they would use to smoke,

403
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 like, they'd roll them up into smoking papers for cigarettes.

404
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 So, your documents that proved that you were a member of this,

405
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 like, you were a member of the Communist Party,

406
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 or that you owned your business, or just who you were,

407
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 people were like, "Yo, man, let me hit that."

408
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And they're like, "You're smoking your ID, you're like, "Oh, no, my identity,

409
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I don't know who I am now."

410
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 But you needed those papers to move around in Russia.

411
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 So, when stuff like that happened, it was making the whole,

412
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 your situation much, much worse.

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 They end up getting all the way out to Nazino Island on May 18th.

414
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 This is how poorly this was planned out.

415
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 The train cars get to the town near Nazino,

416
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 and there was around 5,000 people that first go,

417
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 so the train cars pull up.

418
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 They're like, "Okay, time to go to the island."

419
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 First off, 27 people fall out of the cars dead.

420
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 So, 27 people didn't even make the whole way to the island.

421
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 You ended up having 322 women, 4,556 men.

422
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 They take them off the train,

423
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 and they start putting them on barges to take to the island.

424
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 When this is, again, this is how poorly this was all thought out.

425
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 The barges reach the island.

426
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 It's May 18th, 1933.

427
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 They came up with this idea like in January, February.

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 It was so poorly planned,

429
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 this was the supplies that people brought to the island.

430
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Each person on the island got 4 kilos of flour.

431
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 That's it.

432
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 No tools, no farming equipment, nothing.

433
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 No other food, either.

434
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Each person got 4 kilos of flour.

435
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 That was all the food they had.

436
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 They'd been riding these trains for days already,

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 a week, more,

438
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 and they're eating 300 grams of bread a day if they were lucky.

439
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Now they're getting put onto an island with 4 kilos of flour.

440
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Now, they weren't even carrying it onto the island.

441
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 They were promised 4 kilos of flour per person.

442
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 But it had to be guarded by the military

443
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 because when they first started taking it off the boat,

444
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 people just started rushing the soldiers.

445
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And the soldiers just began shooting people.

446
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 "Stay away from the flour, stay away from the flour."

447
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Now you're like, "Okay, the soldiers must be well prepared for this."

448
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 They're Soviet Union soldiers.

449
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 They've been shipped all the way from Moscow out into Siberia.

450
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 They at least have guns to protect the flour.

451
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 The guards didn't even really have uniforms,

452
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 and a lot of them didn't even have shoes.

453
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 So even the people in charge of this whole debacle

454
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 planned it so poorly they couldn't even supply the troops

455
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 who were supposed to protect/be the prison guards

456
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 for the people on Nazino Island.

457
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 First day, people tried to get in the flour,

458
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 and it just doesn't work.

459
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 The soldiers are shooting people,

460
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 and they say, "Okay, this is what we're going to have to do.

461
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 We're going to have to take the flour back to the mainland,

462
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 and then each person is going to have to pick a person to run their group.

463
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So you guys all form little groups,

464
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 and then you send over a representative.

465
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 We'll give them the flour for your group,

466
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 and then they go back and you'll get the flour."

467
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 So what happens is kind of obvious.

468
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Each group becomes its own gang,

469
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 and begins robbing each other.

470
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And then a lot of times the people who were in charge of getting the flour,

471
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 they would come back and they'd say,

472
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 "Oh, sorry, they only said they were going to give us half the flour,

473
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 and they'd steal the rest."

474
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 It was just a total debacle.

475
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 It was just an absolute disaster.

476
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 You know, you have all of these people who are in groups starving,

477
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 and you have corrupt people have been picked to lead these groups,

478
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 and then the groups begin infighting among each other,

479
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 and they're fighting for flour.

480
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And these people are starving so much at this point,

481
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 they begin mixing the flour with river water,

482
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 just so it's slightly edible,

483
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 and then eating the flour just dysentery.

484
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Everyone just pfft all over the place.

485
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 They're drinking this contaminated water.

486
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 They have no other way to eat this flour.

487
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 They have no fresh water supplies.

488
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 So you either starve, or you have terrible diarrhea

489
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 because you have to eat this flour.

490
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 By May 21st, 300 people have already frozen to death.

491
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 People begin making wraps to try to get off the island.

492
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 And most of the time, because these are city folk,

493
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 they don't know how to make a raft,

494
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 the raft simply collapses in the frigid water,

495
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 and everyone on the raft dies.

496
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 But sometimes the raft would be seaworthy,

497
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 and the soldiers would just open fire on them,

498
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 killing them, and then you'd have a raft full of corpses

499
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 floating around the island.

500
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 So many people died trying to get off the island

501
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 that the waterway pretty much became choked with dead bodies.

502
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 To make the situation of you not having water much, much worse,

503
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 there's now blood and feces,

504
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 and decaying human bodies in your water supply.

505
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Now some people did get off the island,

506
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 and the soldiers would watch them run off,

507
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 and the soldiers would just say, "They're dead."

508
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 The area was so remote that there was nowhere to go.

509
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Even if you got off the island,

510
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 even if you were able to make a usable raft and you weren't shot,

511
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 you just died in the wilderness.

512
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And for the most part, that is what happened.

513
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 There was no recorded incidents of people escaping the island and surviving.

514
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 On May 21st, though, they've already taken the long-trained rides

515
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 with almost no food.

516
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 They now definitely have no food with just a flower.

517
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 May 21st, 1933, they began eating each other.

518
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 They began eating each other.

519
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 These gang, these groups that originally formed up

520
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 so they could get their food in a "civilized way,"

521
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 have now banded together and began attacking other people,

522
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 killing them and eating them.

523
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 On May 22nd, the day after people began eating each other,

524
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 actual food is delivered to the island.

525
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 It was just a logistical thing.

526
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 It wasn't like the soldiers go, "Oh, cranky, they're eating each other.

527
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Let's get some hamburgers over here."

528
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Just a logistical thing.

529
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It took four days for their food to actually show up.

530
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And then when they finally have some food supplies,

531
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 when they finally get a little bit of relief of this horrible thing,

532
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 and you're thinking, "Maybe I've survived this long.

533
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I've survived the train ride.

534
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I've survived the horrible freezing cold nights

535
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 and the bodies I haven't been eating yet."

536
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And now we finally have actual food supplies.

537
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 We might be able to make this work.

538
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 The very next day, 1,200 more people are sent onto the island.

539
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And the whole thing starts over,

540
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 because there's not nearly enough food for those extra 1,200 people.

541
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And they're going to an island where power has already been consolidated

542
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 among these gangs of people.

543
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 These people who are on the island for better or worse now know each other

544
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 and know what each group is capable of.

545
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And now you have 1,200 more city people who have never been this deep

546
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 into Russian territory being put on an island with cannibals on it.

547
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 This story was covered up because it was a huge failure.

548
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Now we're in June 1933.

549
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Stalin says he doesn't really know what's going on on the island,

550
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 but he starts to think, "You know what? I changed my mind.

551
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 I really don't think this is a good idea. I don't want to do it."

552
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 The island ended up having about 6,000 people on it altogether,

553
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 at its greatest point.

554
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 May 27th, you brought those other 1,200 people in,

555
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 and a couple weeks later it was cancelled.

556
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 6,000 people put onto that island.

557
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 2,856 people left.

558
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Between April and June, 3,222 people died.

559
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Frozen, shot, diseased, or eaten within two months

560
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 on a small little island in the middle of nowhere.

561
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 So in 1988, this story was completely buried

562
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 because it was just a huge failure of Soviet social engineering.

563
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 But in 1988 when the Soviet Union was trying to open themselves up more to the world,

564
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 the stories of this incident start to leak out.

565
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And there's a group called Memorial which goes around the world

566
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 kind of highlighting human rights abuses, and they got wind of it.

567
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 They ended up in 1998 going out and trying to interview people

568
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 to find out exactly what happened, because there were stories about

569
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 a place called Cannibal Island where you went and you either ate or got eaten.

570
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 The 2,800 people who ended up leaving the island,

571
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 they were sent to other work labor camps. They weren't sent home.

572
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And they were telling these stories about what happened,

573
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 the brutality that happened in just two months.

574
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 You go from being someone owning a shop in Moscow to eating flesh off human bone.

575
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 So they went out and they interviewed these native people in the area, the group memorial.

576
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And this is one of the interviews that was given.

577
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 They asked this native person to tell them a story,

578
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 and the native person says, "Well, this is his exact words."

579
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 They were trying to escape. They asked us, "Where's the railway?"

580
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 We'd never seen a railway. They asked, "Where's Moscow, Leningrad?"

581
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 They were asking the wrong people. We never heard of those places.

582
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 We're Ostiax, which is the native group there.

583
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 So they had no idea what was going on and what they didn't know.

584
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 There was a Moscow.

585
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Continue here with the quote, "People were running away starving.

586
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 They were giving a handful of flour.

587
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 They mixed it with water and drank it, and then they immediately got diarrhea.

588
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 The things we saw. People were dying everywhere.

589
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 They were killing each other."

590
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 On the island there was a guard named Kostya Vienkov, a young fellow.

591
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 He fell in love with a girl who had been sent there and was courting her.

592
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 He protected her.

593
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 One day he had to be away for a while and he told one of his comrades,

594
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 "Take care of her. But with all the people there, the comrade couldn't do much really.

595
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 People caught the girl, tied her to a poplar tree,

596
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 caught off her breasts, her muscles.

597
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Everything they could eat. Everything. Everything.

598
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 They were hungry. They had to eat.

599
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 When Kostya came back, she was still alive.

600
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 He tried to save her, but she had lost too much blood.

601
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 That's just one story from one witness.

602
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Out of the over 3,200 deaths that happened on Nazino Island.

603
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 What other monstrous acts took place in those two months

604
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 that had no witnesses, that had no survivors?

605
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 We may never know, but maybe that's a good thing.

606
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
