1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
 A recent string of scientific studies may have actually proved that a 10,000 year old

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,880
 alien knows how to manipulate reality.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,100
 And it would take a look at an absolutely terrifying chain of events, and if this story

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:25,180
 is true, it spells bad news for anyone who listens to this podcast, because we're gonna

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:32,520
 take a look to find out if, by investigating gang stalking, you can actually catch the insanity

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,480
 yourself.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,480
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:48,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenterder, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,000
 day too, I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I know I do.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,520
 Season 5 of Cobra Kai debuts on September 9th.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,440
 It's not a plug, I'm not getting paid by anybody, but I've become addicted to that

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
 show.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,160
 So I've got a few more episodes to watch.

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,640
 Before season 4 is over, so no spoilers, but someone who never spoils anything.

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,200
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
 Everyone give it up for Leyland.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
 Woohoo!

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
 Yeah!

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
 Come on in Leyland, come on in.

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
 He's doing the splits!

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
 You guys can't see anything with all these crazy backflips.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
 It's so awesome.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,160
 Leyland, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,840
 Guys, if you can't support the Patreon, I have a PayPal link in there as well, but if

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,920
 you can't do that, if you can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,440
 Trust me, I do just help spread the word about the show.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,560
 Tell your friends, tell your families.

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,880
 Talk about it online.

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,440
 All of that stuff really, really helps the show grow, and I really appreciate it.

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,160
 Leyland, I'm going to go ahead and crotty chop the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
 over to you.

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
 Hi-yah!

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,320
 Go ahead and catch them.

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,040
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,280
 We're going to fly all the way out to a research center.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,240
 We're going to go show them nerds what's what.

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,600
 We're walking around.

40
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,720
 We have lab coats with the cut off sleeves.

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,880
 They're all buff.

42
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,600
 Crotty chopping everybody.

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,360
 And after we're arrested and taken to jail and then we post bail and get back out, we're

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,840
 back at the research center wearing disguises like fake mustaches and stuff so they'll let

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:30,200
 us back in because we're going to take a look at a very, very bizarre and real phenomenon

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,160
 going on and how it actually may connect to the law of attraction.

47
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,280
 This is a really weird and cool story.

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
 So there have been some recent studies done, recent as in the past couple years.

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,120
 And what scientists have determined is that the human eye, you're not going to believe

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
 this.

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
 You're not going to believe this, right?

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,360
 I don't know what to say, but the human eye sees everything with a 15 second delay.

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,400
 And you go Jason, how is that possible?

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,680
 Someone throws a ball at me.

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,760
 They're not throwing it 15 seconds in the past.

56
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
 It's coming at me right now.

57
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,600
 I got to catch the ball right now.

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,680
 If I'm in the All Valley under 18 Crotty tournament, I have to block that kick right now and I

59
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
 understand.

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
 I understand.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,440
 That's what doesn't make sense to me either because we live in a world where things happen

62
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
 instantaneously.

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,200
 However, this is so weird.

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,040
 Research, they've done multiple studies on this.

65
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,520
 The human eye sees things with a 15 second delay.

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,600
 And scientists kind of knew this going on.

67
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,480
 This is one of the things that they did studies and there's been a bunch of studies.

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,440
 You'll see some articles in the show notes talking about this.

69
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,120
 They've done studies because they've known it to be true.

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,800
 It's something that scientists have go, there's no way that the human eye can actually see

71
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,520
 things in real time.

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,000
 And this is why the world is constantly changing.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,680
 When you're walking down the street, it looks fairly stable the way the light is shimmering

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,320
 through the branches of the trees and you see the shade falling on a chipmunk and he's

75
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,720
 running, he's training for his own Crotty tournament, running down the street, gathering

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 up acorns and stuff.

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,480
 That's what we see.

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,440
 But they said, what is happening in reality is every step you take, every move you make,

79
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,280
 the sunlight coming through the tree refracts differently or bounces off the leaves a little

80
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
 differently.

81
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,280
 The shadows are constantly changing.

82
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,360
 And they said, if you saw the world without this 15 second delay, it would be akin to

83
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,680
 a hallucinatory state.

84
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,760
 Everything would be in constant chaos.

85
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,600
 And there's a theory that there may be, this may be what people who suffer from like high

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,720
 levels of autism, how they experience the world, the sensory overload, they may not have

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
 the delay.

88
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,240
 That's a theory that hasn't really been tested yet, but I did read that in one or two of

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
 these articles.

90
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,920
 But they said, generally the human eye has this 15 second delay and what it does is it

91
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:03,460
 actually makes it harder to determine little changes.

92
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,200
 Because instead of seeing like the light going, every time you're walking underneath the tree,

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,640
 it actually smooths out all of that.

94
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,560
 So you only see the big changes when you're walking underneath the tree.

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,040
 Now not all of their science was tree related.

96
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,680
 And this is one of those things I'm reading this article and I find it absolutely fascinating

97
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,840
 when I think it just doesn't make sense.

98
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,000
 If someone is attacking me with a pair of nunchucks, I'm not seeing them 15 seconds after

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,080
 my brains are coming out of my ears.

100
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,280
 But there is this delay.

101
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,440
 And one of these articles, it was really cool, they said, you can test this.

102
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,040
 There's actually a, I keep talking about the articles in the show notes.

103
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,560
 There's a couple of YouTube videos that show different experiments that they've done, but

104
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,200
 there's an experiment you can do at home.

105
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,400
 And I got up, I walked around my house and it works.

106
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,000
 Be very, very careful when you do this experiment.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,280
 They said, if you really want to have an idea of what it could be like without this delay,

108
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,440
 because it's kind of built into everyone's eyeballs.

109
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,360
 They said, take a smartphone.

110
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,880
 I guess you could do it with a camera, but take a smartphone and put it in camera mode

111
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,820
 and put it close to your eyeballs.

112
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,360
 So basically the camera is your eyes.

113
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,720
 You're looking at the display and the camera is what you would be looking at.

114
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,720
 And they said, just look at the screen and walk around and turn your head as you're walking

115
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,920
 around.

116
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,160
 It's super disorienting because see the camera doesn't have that delay.

117
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,320
 And it's, it's a sensory overload.

118
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,840
 Like you go, but Jason, my eyes have the delay of looking at the video screen.

119
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,120
 Walk around and do this very safely.

120
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,400
 My place is not super safe.

121
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,700
 I got weights everywhere and for some reason sharp edges.

122
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,180
 Every single piece of furniture seems like it is designed to crush somebody's temple.

123
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:53,260
 Do this in a safe manner and walk around and it's disorienting because you're I, you're

124
00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:00,580
 seeing a weird ver, you're seeing what's real, but you're seeing it without that delay or

125
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,900
 less of a delay.

126
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,900
 And what's interesting, again, they've done so many studies on this.

127
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,600
 One of the studies was they had a closeup of a person's face, well, multiple people's

128
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
 faces.

129
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,200
 They had a bunch of people's and the closeup was so much that you couldn't really see much.

130
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,000
 You could go from the chin to the eyebrows, but everything else was kind of cropped out.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,920
 So you didn't see any changes in hair or ears or stuff.

132
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,120
 That's super noticeable, right?

133
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,880
 People kind of have a general face about them.

134
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:38,100
 And they said we would show a clip of 30 seconds of people's faces appearing on screen.

135
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,140
 And when they finished the test, when they did this at the University of California, when

136
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:49,260
 they finished the test, they go, what was the last face you saw?

137
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:58,780
 And most of the time, the people described the face that was 15 seconds into the video.

138
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:05,280
 Even though they watched the full 30 seconds, their eyes, it's not so weird, their eyes,

139
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,080
 it got that information of the last 15 seconds, but there still was that delay.

140
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,980
 And it smoothed out everything.

141
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,840
 So there's little changes, the subtle changes you don't notice.

142
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,180
 They have a bunch of YouTube videos and stuff like this.

143
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,180
 It's called Field of Continuity.

144
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,200
 And one of the, this is hilarious, one of the tests they did was because they've said,

145
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,700
 you know, this can cause a lot of problems.

146
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,400
 They were talking specifically about radiologists.

147
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,260
 So the guys who look at x-rays, and they look at hundreds of x-rays a day.

148
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,660
 And people have said, there is a chance that if you look at 100 x-rays a day or hundreds

149
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:51,260
 of x-rays a day, you're technically those last 15 seconds of x-rays you didn't see.

150
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,780
 So they said there could be mistakes where they see a lump when there's not a lump, because

151
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,680
 it's on a 15 second ago.

152
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,800
 I know you're shaking your head, I know you're shaking your head and you're like, Jason,

153
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,040
 you're obviously getting something seriously wrong, or you've been reading some really

154
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
 quack websites.

155
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,640
 No, no, no, these are real studies, these are real studies, check the show notes.

156
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,480
 They said that you will miss stuff.

157
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,720
 You will actually, so basically always do 15 extra seconds of work if you're a radiologist.

158
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,680
 One of the things they used to test this was apparently, and this was another, other thing

159
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,740
 they did, I don't know if it was necessarily the field of continuity study, but it was

160
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,220
 actually kind of funny, what they did was they took a series of x-rays and showed them

161
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,620
 to radiologists, and in some of them they drew a little picture of like a gorilla inside

162
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,820
 the body, and the radiologist couldn't detect it.

163
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,940
 Because what they were looking for was like cancerous lumps, they were looking, or broken

164
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,740
 bones or whatever they were looking at, right?

165
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,960
 They weren't looking for gorillas.

166
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,440
 So their brain didn't register there was a gorilla, it wasn't like a cartoon, like

167
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,800
 a fully colored like 2D McGilligorilla, but it was just like, it shouldn't be there.

168
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,600
 I mean, I don't care if it's a well drawn representation of a gorilla or just an outline.

169
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,280
 Gorillas shouldn't be in your x-rays, but they had these little gorillas in there and

170
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,320
 the radiologists weren't detecting them, because they were just kind of looking for these things

171
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,160
 that they've been trained to look for, and they're looking for them pretty quickly.

172
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:31,240
 Fascinating scientific study that we're actually seeing things 15 seconds in the past.

173
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,240
 There's a delay.

174
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,200
 Now again, like when you're throwing a baseball, I don't know how all that factors, like every

175
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,580
 baseball games they're like, oh, only 15 seconds too short.

176
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,920
 The score remains 0-0 in the 20th inning.

177
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
 Oh no.

178
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,040
 Obviously, there is some sort of work around, but I think like as the ball would be spinning

179
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,920
 towards you, if you didn't have that 15 second delay, you would see every light beam, everything

180
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
 bouncing off that'd be super chaotic, right?

181
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,920
 But if you guys are like, oh, this is like when you said animals talk to each other in

182
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,720
 your first episode, Jason, you must be missing something.

183
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,440
 Check the show notes if you don't believe me.

184
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,840
 You can always double check and triple check my work.

185
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
 I welcome it.

186
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,520
 The reason why I wanted to talk about this, not only is it a crazy science story, right?

187
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,760
 This also plays a part in one of the law of attraction techniques.

188
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
 We talked about a long time ago on this show.

189
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,480
 Now back on episode 463, it was How to Hack the Universe was the name of that episode.

190
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,080
 We were talking about that new app, Randonautica.

191
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,320
 Think about how old this, how long this shows went on when Randonautica has now been around

192
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
 forever.

193
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,040
 So in episode 463, we were talking about the Randonautica app, which would randomly send

194
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,400
 you to places and people were finding weird things.

195
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,560
 This group of teens uncovered a body.

196
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,280
 They actually got a murderer caught by using Randonautica.

197
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,480
 We talked about that and we talked about this manifestation technique from this.

198
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,800
 The woman's name is Esther Hicks, but she says that this 10,000 year old alien is beaming

199
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,120
 thoughts into her head, which actually goes well into the next story, but this 10,000

200
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,400
 year old alien has basically been a spiritual advisor to Esther Hicks and she has this program,

201
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,480
 she has this whole philosophy called the Abram Hicks Manifestation.

202
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
 The Abram Hicks, it's kind of like this, what's the right word?

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Institute.

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Abram Hicks Institute type of thing.

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,840
 We talked about it on that episode.

206
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,520
 It's one of those things that I do love, the law of attraction.

207
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,160
 I love how all of that stuff works.

208
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,680
 I'm a little, I'm a little, I'm a little iffy on the 10,000 year old alien talking or, but

209
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,920
 you know, I'm not ruling it out.

210
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,680
 I'm not absolutely ruling it out that that's impossible considering the other stuff we

211
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,200
 talked about on this show.

212
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,680
 It just to me, it seems weird.

213
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
 Right?

214
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,160
 Even to what Manny records her podcast in his Haunted Closet, it's a little too weird,

215
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,560
 but I do believe in the law of attraction.

216
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,840
 She's like been around longer than the secret.

217
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,800
 She's a big mainstay in the law of attraction world.

218
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,160
 I did more, if you want to know more about that, I talked about it on that episode, but

219
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,920
 one thing I talked about on that episode was the Abram Hicks manifestation technique where,

220
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,920
 we did a little test on that episode, where you have to have a positive belief with no

221
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,360
 negativity coming in.

222
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,680
 So let's say the positive belief is, I believe that Dead Rabbit Radio is the number one paranormal

223
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,080
 podcast in the world.

224
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:35,360
 I have to think that thought for 17 seconds without any negativity coming in.

225
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,000
 You have to have that positive thought for 17 seconds.

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,780
 Now what's interesting about that, I remember reading about that and we did it on that episode,

227
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,760
 but when I read this article about the 15 second sight delay, the first thing that popped

228
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:59,520
 in my head was that 17 second technique, because could the two things be related?

229
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:07,400
 The idea of law of attraction is to manifest your reality, to change things, and to see

230
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,280
 the world in a way that it is not.

231
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,000
 Wallace Waddles, who's my favorite teacher, he's really the guy who got me into law of

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 attraction.

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,360
 I just kind of knew it from osmosis and I was like, "Oh, it's just you wish that you

234
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,880
 have something blah blah blah."

235
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,320
 I read his book, I think it was called The Science of Getting Rich.

236
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,840
 The Science of Getting Rich was the name of the book.

237
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:35,080
 And he talks about if you can walk around in squalor, or walking around your dirty house,

238
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:43,480
 but yet you believe, despite seeing the rats and the cockroaches and the rotten banana peels,

239
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,000
 you see yourself in a mansion?

240
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,600
 If you can actually see past reality, you are a mastermind, because you have mastered

241
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,560
 your mind.

242
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,840
 You're seeing something that is not reality, and then reality will correct itself to match

243
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
 your vision.

244
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,720
 It's super interesting, right?

245
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,120
 And here we have this Abram Hicks technique, which the 17 seconds, and Abram Hicks, when

246
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:19,080
 I read her works, or his works, being the alien dude, I don't remember any connections

247
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,360
 to the scientific study.

248
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,640
 These scientific studies, even though the theory was around for a while, these are all

249
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,880
 like post-2020.

250
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,720
 The Abram Hicks manifestation technique is much older than that.

251
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,440
 And basically, you see with a 15 second delay, but you're perceiving reality with a 17 second

252
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,520
 time span.

253
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,480
 Like you're actually seeing two seconds past the delay.

254
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,640
 You are seeing, as far as your eyes are concerned, into the future.

255
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,440
 Now they say you have to do 17 seconds, and the best thing to do is to do 17 seconds multiple

256
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,520
 times in a row to get up to, I think it was 68 seconds.

257
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,160
 But still, I mean, you figure if you do it four times in a row, I don't know the math,

258
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,120
 I don't know the math, 68 divided by 17.

259
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,680
 But if you add two seconds up each time, you're still beating that delay.

260
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,760
 If you have a 15 second delay, but you can see 17 seconds into the future, how does that

261
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,160
 not work?

262
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,080
 How does that not work against the universe?

263
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,440
 You're seeing ahead of that delay.

264
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,880
 It's fascinating theory, right?

265
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,960
 We have the world of science, which is not talking about 10,000 year old aliens floating

266
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
 around.

267
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,720
 Same, there is a 15 second delay, and then we have this person, Abram Hicks, or this

268
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,800
 institute Abram Hicks, that's talking about you have to see, you have to believe something

269
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,600
 positively for 17 seconds.

270
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,640
 And both of those are pretty, both of those as far as I know have always been unconnected.

271
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,000
 This might be the first podcast that is really talking about this thing, probably because

272
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,680
 it's so insane.

273
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,600
 But yeah, just fascinating, can you beat the delay?

274
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,320
 Like if you have that 15 second delay, but you're seeing 17 seconds into the future,

275
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:05,360
 or you are creating reality for two seconds, you haven't perceived that reality yet.

276
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,200
 And then if you do that multiple times, that is adding up.

277
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,000
 Fascinating, fascinating story science and paranormal combining.

278
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I love it.

279
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,200
 I love it so much.

280
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:22,280
 Laylin, let me know how your results go, whether you use this law of attraction tip or you're

281
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,000
 walking around your house with your smartphone and you end up breaking your thumbs.

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,760
 Hopefully not the last one.

283
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
 Laylin.

284
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,200
 Let's go ahead and toss you the key.

285
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
 I see he's wearing those thumb casts.

286
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,280
 Laylin, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

287
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,320
 We are leaving behind nerd headquarters.

288
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:46,360
 We're gonna head all the way out to a sleepy town somewhere in America.

289
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,720
 Doing the show is hard sometimes doing the show gets kind of hard sometimes because on

290
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,600
 the one hand, I'm making it for me right on the one hand, like I have to be entertained

291
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
 by it.

292
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,360
 I just really find myself in a groove.

293
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,400
 Some may call it a rut.

294
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,360
 Some people may go, "Dude, you've covered a lot of gangstalking stuff recently, but I

295
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,440
 just find it so interesting."

296
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
 Don't get me wrong.

297
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
 I love it all.

298
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,600
 Paranormal and ghosts and aliens and demons and cryptids and all that stuff.

299
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
 I love that stuff.

300
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,400
 The gangstalking is really where you got, I talk a lot about mundane paranormal stuff.

301
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,480
 People waking up and their bedrooms completely black.

302
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,920
 Or just like these, that's it.

303
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,560
 It's the end of the paranormal phenomenon.

304
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,160
 It's not that they disappeared forever, which I do love those stories.

305
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
 I mean, I feel sympathy for their families.

306
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,560
 But I also like the mundane paranormal stories.

307
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,920
 And for me, gangstalking kind of sits in that realm where we have people who are insane,

308
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,080
 these people are suffering from some sort of mental illness.

309
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,320
 So much so that their world, their daily life has almost become paranormal.

310
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,520
 There's a worldwide conspiracy out to get them.

311
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,960
 It's just this weird thing.

312
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,640
 And sometimes it involves ghosts.

313
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,400
 Sometimes it involves demons or aliens based, I think, on their own personal philosophy

314
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,800
 on what they believe pulls the strings of the universe.

315
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,200
 That's what gangstalks them.

316
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,240
 It's a fascinating phenomenon.

317
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,600
 And then on what was it, Wednesday's episode, or no, actually, I think it was yesterday's

318
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:22,080
 episode, we talked about a guy who decided to start murdering people who he thought were

319
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,000
 not only gangstalkers, but responsible for false flag attacks, responsible for causing

320
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,240
 people to go on mass shooting sprees.

321
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,280
 He went on a mass shooting spree because of gangstalking theory.

322
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,000
 And I predicted that we were going to see more of that in the future.

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,320
 Unfortunately, right?

324
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:47,440
 Unfortunately, I've just seen the gangstalking phenomenon become more ingrained in society.

325
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,680
 We're seeing a lot of that stuff.

326
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,760
 I'd say it's getting close up there to flat earth levels of people who believe that they

327
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,840
 are being gangstalked, which is really bad.

328
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,760
 And so we have to look at this here.

329
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,240
 Is gangstalking contagious?

330
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,320
 Because that totally changes the game.

331
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:16,240
 We're going to take a look at the story of a man, a young father, who, by investigating

332
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,040
 gangstalking, becomes a victim of it himself.

333
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,480
 Now you may go, you know, always there's this thing with gangstalking that there is,

334
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
 and I do this all the time.

335
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,240
 Well, not on the last episode.

336
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
 I just talked about it.

337
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
 And lunatic walking around with a gun.

338
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,640
 But listen, there are legitimate gangstalkers, right?

339
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,200
 People piss off the wrong organized crime group.

340
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,280
 They are committing crimes, or the police think they're committing crimes, or the police

341
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,560
 just don't like the dude and they're watching them.

342
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,680
 You go to war with the wrong karate dojo.

343
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,520
 And the next thing you know, you're being gangstalked by a bunch of high school students.

344
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,560
 It does happen, right?

345
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,160
 Gangstalking the legal definition is simply being stalked by, I think it's three or more

346
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
 people.

347
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,200
 There is a definition for it because people do it.

348
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,000
 Like crime organizations do it, intelligence organizations do it, law enforcement.

349
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,880
 So that does happen.

350
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
 We do see that.

351
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,120
 And you could go, well, Jason, if I was currently being hunted by some street gang and you came

352
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,920
 to find out if they were really hunting me, of course you're going to be gangstalked.

353
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:24,400
 But generally when we talk about gangstalking, we're talking about the unbelievable stuff.

354
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,160
 It's interesting because gangstalking victims, or you know, supposed victims, targeted individuals

355
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,320
 will always go back to the provable ones.

356
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,320
 And they'll go, well, here's a story about a guy getting gangstalked by the Stockton

357
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
 Police.

358
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,400
 And they'll be like, okay, yeah, that's not what you're complaining about.

359
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,680
 You're not complaining about the Stockton Police gangstalking you.

360
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,960
 You're saying that it's the predator.

361
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,120
 This invisible entity is walking through your neighborhood.

362
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
 Okay.

363
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,200
 So, so let's not mix the two.

364
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,120
 The term you could say they are both gangstalking.

365
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,720
 But let's take a look at this guy.

366
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,560
 He goes by the handle glitch 82.

367
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
 We're going to call him Gary.

368
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,000
 We're going to call him Gary.

369
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,640
 And if that's your real name, it's just the guess.

370
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,560
 I don't, not a gangstalker.

371
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,440
 This story starts off in the fall of 2020.

372
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,640
 And Gary, he's an IT consultant and he gets contacted to do some work for this guy.

373
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,360
 Now this is his client.

374
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
 We're going to call him Bruce.

375
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,000
 Bruce said, hey, listen, I know you're an IT guy.

376
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,680
 And I was wondering if you could figure out what's going on.

377
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,960
 I believe that I am under surveillance.

378
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,320
 I believe that someone has put electronic devices in my house and you're a nerd.

379
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,400
 Maybe you can figure out how this setup works.

380
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,360
 Now Gary was actually up to the challenge for this one.

381
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,840
 I think he was getting paid for it.

382
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,680
 But two, he goes, no one's putting stuff in your house because Bruce was saying it was

383
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
 his neighbors.

384
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,800
 Bruce was saying, I think my neighbors are spying on me and they've put up all these hidden

385
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,800
 cameras and recording devices in my house.

386
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,400
 Can you find them for me?

387
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,040
 And Gary's like, that's not true.

388
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
 Right.

389
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
 That's just not true.

390
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,280
 Why would your neighbors want to spy on you?

391
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,320
 And remember gangstalking victims are so ingrained in the conspiracy theory, even if it doesn't

392
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,720
 make logical sense.

393
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,800
 They'll believe it, right?

394
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,320
 In their mind, that's what's set up.

395
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
 So Gary goes to the house and he actually uses a Wi-Fi detector.

396
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,480
 And he's checking the house out and he cannot find, which is what he thought, he cannot

397
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,400
 find any hidden cameras or non-hidden cameras.

398
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,480
 It's not like the gang suckers just left a little Sony camcorder right on the mantel

399
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,400
 and goes, ah, you'll never find this one.

400
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,840
 He didn't find any cameras, didn't find any recording devices.

401
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,160
 But Bruce was so paranoid that even though this IT guy's coming out and checking everything

402
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,800
 out, Bruce actually disassembled parts of his car looking for the hidden microphones

403
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,280
 and the cameras in his car.

404
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,040
 Gary's like, dude, this is nuts.

405
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,080
 Like I hope you don't expect me to help you put it back together.

406
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
 I don't know nothing about cars.

407
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,160
 But Gary's doing this work and then, you know, a little bit of time passes, not too long.

408
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,720
 And Gary then tries to get ahold of Bruce again and he can't.

409
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,240
 He realizes in short order, Bruce is gone.

410
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,760
 Not like spooky, not like the neighbors got him finally.

411
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,640
 They're like, we're tired of it being recorded.

412
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,720
 We're gonna make you our prisoner in our basement.

413
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,240
 No, Gary and Bruce actually had a mutual friend and Gary goes, hey, whatever happened to Bruce?

414
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,840
 Like, I'm pretty sure he's supposed to pay me, ready?

415
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
 Then all this stuff.

416
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,160
 And the mutual friend goes, oh yeah, dude, no, Bruce is gone.

417
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,800
 He actually like sold his house, moved away.

418
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 He's living with his sister.

419
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,040
 He's like, well, that's weird.

420
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,480
 But you know, the guy, he's nice enough, but it must have been paranoid.

421
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,440
 Like it must have driven him nuts.

422
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,240
 But there were no hidden cameras, no hidden microphones anywhere in his house.

423
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,760
 We're now in the month of October, 2020.

424
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,200
 This is when the situation really ramps up.

425
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,960
 So shortly before this, we don't have an exact month, August, September, maybe something

426
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
 like that.

427
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:09,600
 But once Bruce leaves, now we're in October, 2020, Gary feels different now.

428
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:18,160
 He says, I began to hear multiple voices in my head, which is not something that had

429
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,000
 happened previous to this.

430
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,520
 And what they did was they provided a running commentary on everything he did throughout

431
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
 the day.

432
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,040
 Now, he doesn't specifically say that it ramped up.

433
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,880
 Like it started off small, I just heard a Gary.

434
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,040
 How you doing?

435
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,280
 Eat that sandwich.

436
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,320
 Or if he just woke up one morning, it's like the voices, all 10 of them are there.

437
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,960
 They're like doing a little song and dance.

438
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,920
 Gary, Gary, what you doing today?

439
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,720
 We already know because you're crazy.

440
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,320
 We don't know if it was a slow ramp.

441
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,960
 I imagine it would be right.

442
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,200
 I think if you woke up one morning and you heard 10 different voices, he doesn't specify

443
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,520
 the number of voices, but there are multiple ones.

444
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,040
 If you heard a cacophony of voices in your head, if you just woke up and they're like,

445
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,640
 "Wake up, wake up."

446
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,240
 And it's not for radio, it's not your alarm clock.

447
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,920
 And as you're brushing your teeth, you hear like a, "Don't miss the back tooth."

448
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,960
 Like you did yesterday, I wouldn't put my toothbrush down and go to the hospital.

449
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,280
 Like if it started off at a 10, I think you would check yourself in a hospital right away.

450
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,320
 But if it was a slow buildup, you would try to figure it out.

451
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,840
 I remember I did an episode a long time ago about hearing phantom music in my apartment.

452
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,880
 And I couldn't figure out what it was.

453
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,240
 I hear Post Malone playing, even though when there was no music going on.

454
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
 And what it is, I looked it up.

455
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
 I did research.

456
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,120
 Like I let it go for a couple of days and I thought, "Well, I guess I'm crazy, but maybe

457
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,600
 I should figure something out."

458
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,920
 There's a thing called phantom music when you have white noise.

459
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,880
 It was during summer show, I had all these fans in the air conditioner on and your brain

460
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,080
 will try to make sense of it.

461
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,760
 And I was listening to a ton of Post Malone on Pandora.

462
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,080
 So it was making Post Malone-esque music in my brain.

463
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,600
 So I did wait a while.

464
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,280
 I'm all right and the song's down.

465
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
 I'm like, "What?

466
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,680
 I'm going to be the next Post Malone."

467
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
 I figured it out.

468
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
 Right?

469
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,560
 So I think it's probably a slow ramp up, but we don't get any indication of whether or

470
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,800
 not it was slow or fast.

471
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:18,520
 He basically just jumps to saying, "There were male and female voices in my head."

472
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,720
 And not only did they provide a running commentary on what I was doing throughout the day, they

473
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,760
 could actually see through my eyeballs.

474
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,360
 I could feel them in my consciousness.

475
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
 This is so creepy.

476
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,040
 I could feel them in my consciousness looking out of my eyes.

477
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,760
 And one of the weirdest things they did, there's a bunch of weird stuff, these voices.

478
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,880
 It's not just voices for this guy.

479
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,000
 There's a bunch of weird stuff they do, but one of the weird things they did was they

480
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 would comment on things before he saw them.

481
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,760
 Which is weird, because we were just talking about the 15 second delay.

482
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,440
 He would hear a voice going, "Wouldn't he need that banana?

483
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,000
 It's spoiled."

484
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,360
 And then he would turn and look and then he'd see a spoiled banana.

485
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,000
 Told you.

486
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,440
 So it was really messing with his reality.

487
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,440
 I guess probably just having voices in your head would do that, but they would comment

488
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,560
 on things before he saw them.

489
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,600
 And he said, "Listen, this was night and day.

490
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,960
 From the moment I woke up to the time I fell asleep, it was just all of my senses were

491
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,080
 under a constant assault.

492
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,320
 It was just this stimuli, stimuli, stimuli hitting him from every angle."

493
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,640
 Now this running commentary didn't necessarily make him think that this had anything to do

494
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,400
 with gangstalking, but it started to bleed into the real world.

495
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,920
 And that's the whole thing with gangstalking is you start to notice little patterns.

496
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
 It's not a pattern.

497
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,080
 It's just random noise, but you pick a pattern out of it.

498
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,400
 You see, through the course of a day, five different people walk by your house wearing

499
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,000
 a white shirt and you start to think, "It's the people in the white shirts you are watching

500
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 me."

501
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,480
 He, apparently at one point, was picking his nose.

502
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:09,920
 I mean, listen, I know that it might be embarrassing that you got caught picking your nose, especially

503
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,320
 embarrassing if it's the voices in your head that catch you, but he was picking his nose

504
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,400
 and the voices started making fun of him for picking his nose.

505
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,800
 And then he said, "Later that day, he took his daughter and her friend to Ace Hardware,

506
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,440
 the place where all kids want to hang out.

507
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,080
 Dad, can I get a new hammer?

508
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,000
 It'll be all your whole allowance for this week."

509
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,640
 He took his daughter and her friend to Ace Hardware, and while they are standing in line

510
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,840
 to buy something, there is a man behind them, behind this trio, and the man tells Gary's

511
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,360
 daughter, "Don't you know it's not polite to pick your nose?"

512
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:59,360
 So in Gary's mind, that was the voices, that was the gangstalking, that was this moment

513
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,760
 where this guy in reality was saying something, and even though he was saying it to the daughter,

514
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,720
 he was really attacking, quote unquote, attacking Gary.

515
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,440
 The whole thing about gangstalking, the end result is to drive you crazy.

516
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,680
 That's why they just don't break into your house, like the police would, or like a criminal

517
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,800
 organization would, or something like that.

518
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,360
 The gangstalkers want to slowly drive you crazy, so basically this man was saying this

519
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,680
 not to the daughter, or to Gary.

520
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,160
 We are missing a key piece of evidence.

521
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,560
 Here was the daughter picking her nose when he said that.

522
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,800
 Who knows?

523
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,360
 Did he just hallucinate the man saying that?

524
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,360
 Who knows?

525
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,760
 Because at this point, Gary is having full-on hallucinations.

526
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,360
 At one point he's walking down the street and he hears one of the voices in his head

527
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,320
 say, "Turn around.

528
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,640
 Turn around."

529
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:53,480
 And when Gary turned around, standing behind him was Agent Smith from the Matrix trilogy.

530
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,160
 And then Gary's like, "Oh no, no, no.

531
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,560
 He's always running for a phone booth.

532
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,040
 He's like, "Oh no, they don't exist anymore.

533
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,520
 How am I going to get out of here?"

534
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,920
 He turned and then he did a double take and it was just an old man with sunglasses on.

535
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,400
 It was just a boldly man with sunglasses on.

536
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,560
 It wasn't Agent Smith for all you dimensional merge fans out there.

537
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,240
 But he is having these real-life hallucinations.

538
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,560
 Now remember this all started with him being a skeptic of the gangstalking phenomenon.

539
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,160
 And he went to this dude's house to prove that gangstalking wasn't real.

540
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,800
 So when he's in a 7-Eleven and a woman walks up to him randomly and grabs his arm and goes,

541
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,480
 "It's the Illuminati!"

542
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,480
 And then it runs out of the 7-Eleven.

543
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,120
 I think I'm going to kind of start believing in gangstalking, right?

544
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,440
 He's having this string of events.

545
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,760
 Now we're talking about only a three-month period.

546
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:55,040
 This started in October of 2020 and it ends on December 28th, 2020.

547
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,640
 And in this time period, all of this stuff happens.

548
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,880
 And he...

549
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,440
 What could be causing the gangstalking according to the targeted individuals is different.

550
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,160
 Like I said, some people think it's demons.

551
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,640
 Usually it's not demons.

552
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,040
 I don't hear that super often.

553
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,720
 Normally it is the Illuminati or the government or your neighbors and they're working for

554
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,280
 an insidious organization.

555
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,160
 Gary has an interesting take on it.

556
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:27,760
 He starts to believe that it's alien and not for lack of evidence.

557
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
 Really.

558
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
 In his mind, right?

559
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
 I'm not physical evidence.

560
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,680
 Don't go running out of this details.

561
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,760
 Hoping you can reenact any of this stuff or find actual proof of any of this.

562
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,080
 But Gary said, "I know technology, right?

563
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,080
 I'm an IT consultant.

564
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,440
 I understand what is out there and what could be out there.

565
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,800
 And the technology you would need to beam voices into somebody's head and look through

566
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,920
 their eyeballs and affect other people around them, getting the person in line behind you

567
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,080
 to say, "Hey, picking your nose isn't cool."

568
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,440
 There's not human technology that's able to do that.

569
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,480
 Sure, you could probably give somebody a headache.

570
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,320
 You could beam some sort of vibration into someone's head.

571
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,560
 Maybe you could get a whisper in their ear with bleeding edge tech, but to have multiple

572
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,800
 voices going on in someone's head and being able to see through their eyes and being able

573
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:26,280
 to see things before they happen, see things before you see them, that is not human technology.

574
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,240
 So he starts to think it's aliens.

575
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,440
 And he said one day when I'm walking down the street, one of the voices said, "Look up."

576
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:45,240
 And I did, and blocking out a massive chunk of the sky was a huge UFO.

577
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,880
 So I understand why he would think aliens were doing this, and honestly, that would

578
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,560
 make more sense than just your neighbors, right?

579
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,640
 That the aliens are coming after this guy.

580
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,000
 But the question with all gangs talking is why that person?

581
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,360
 But it's interesting because Gary walked into this, right?

582
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,440
 Gary went in to investigate gang stalking, and now he's realizing he's a victim of this,

583
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,360
 and this is making him extremely paranoid, obviously, right?

584
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,360
 How many voices would have to be in your head before you were afraid something bad was going

585
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,400
 to happen?

586
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:27,920
 This all comes to a head on December 28th, 2020, Gary is running out to jump in his car.

587
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:34,160
 He is hit with the most overwhelming intrusive thought that he is about to be abducted by

588
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,520
 aliens.

589
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:47,080
 He gets in his car, he takes off, he's flying down the road at 120 miles per hour.

590
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,320
 He ends up flipping his car.

591
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,480
 He ended up getting in a car accident, he flips his car, and luckily, he might have suffered

592
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,960
 other injuries until the car was in shape to go home.

593
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,560
 Who knows what the injuries that he fully suffered, but he specifically said he broke

594
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,640
 his hand and two of his fingers were partially amputated.

595
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,160
 So you have that, right?

596
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,840
 I would find it hard to believe that you could survive a 120 mile per hour car accident.

597
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,680
 If you just broke your hand and just got a couple fingers cut off, you'd be the luckiest

598
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
 man in the world.

599
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,320
 But whether or not, whether or not this kind ended up in a cast for eight weeks or not,

600
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,920
 we don't know that.

601
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,320
 But the important part to this is that he gets in this horrible car accident, and really

602
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,720
 isn't that terrifying that you're on the street with these people, right?

603
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,040
 Someone's having this paranoid delusion.

604
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,960
 We're always afraid of drunk drivers or people high on drugs, but then you also just got

605
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,920
 paranoid people thinking they're out running aliens 120 miles an hour.

606
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,200
 He's lucky he didn't kill anyone.

607
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,720
 He lost a couple fingers and that sucks, but he gets in this car, he's in a flip, he loses

608
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,800
 a couple fingers, breaks his hand at the very least.

609
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,640
 And then the weirdest event of this entire saga happens.

610
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,760
 Everything stops.

611
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:20,000
 The voices, the hallucinations, the paranoia, it all just goes away.

612
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,800
 Since then, he's had no issues with any of this stuff.

613
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,480
 Just all went away.

614
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,040
 And he posts this online and other people are commenting and saying, "Hey man, maybe you

615
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,520
 should go see a doctor as interest."

616
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
 And he goes, "I did.

617
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,320
 I went and saw a psychiatrist after this was all over.

618
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,120
 And I told him the whole story and like was I crazy.

619
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,240
 And I understand when you're in the middle of the crazy, would you go see a psychiatrist

620
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,120
 as far as you know, they're in on the gangstucking.

621
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,960
 But after it was done.

622
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,400
 He at December 28th, 2020 is the date he remembers is the day this all ended.

623
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,360
 He goes, "I went and saw the psychiatrist and talked about, you know, was I going crazy?

624
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
 What was going on?"

625
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,280
 And the psychiatrist said, "Listen, you can have a psychotic episode.

626
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,520
 Those happen.

627
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,360
 But generally they don't just end after some sort of car accident.

628
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
 Right?

629
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,440
 I mean, that's feasible possibly, right?

630
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,440
 But generally speaking, that's not how a psychotic episode ends.

631
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,040
 And they go, "Skizofrenia is not a periodic event either.

632
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,160
 Skizofrenia is not something that you just kind of get over after you flip your car a

633
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,320
 couple of times."

634
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,280
 So what exactly happened to Gary?

635
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,880
 He says a long time ago, he's actually very active in like UFO posts, UFO forums and stuff

636
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,840
 like that on Reddit.

637
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,080
 So he is a fan of the paranormal.

638
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,560
 He's a fan of UFOs and stuff like that.

639
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:54,200
 And he mentions in this post, he goes, "Years ago I did actually invite aliens."

640
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,240
 He goes, "I really wanted to manifest an alien visit.

641
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,560
 I wanted to, you know, meet them.

642
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,280
 I wanted to see what they were all about."

643
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,920
 And nothing happened.

644
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,080
 And he goes, "Could it have been that?"

645
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,080
 Like he, he, it's interesting because see, like I said before, he's a fan.

646
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,040
 I don't know if he's a fan anymore, but he's a believer in the UFO phenomenon.

647
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,960
 So his gang stalking took that approach, right?

648
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,840
 As opposed to someone who's just a conspiracy theorist, theirs will take, you know, the local

649
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,120
 government or it's the school board that's after me or, you know, CIA.

650
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,620
 Maybe you're more grandiose of a threat, not just the school board that's beaming messages

651
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,620
 into your head.

652
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,600
 But yeah, he goes, "Could that have been it?

653
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,360
 Could I have invited the aliens in?"

654
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,040
 And to wrap all of this up.

655
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,080
 Remember the idea here is, is gang stalking contagious?

656
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:54,480
 At the same time all of this stuff was going on, Gary's girlfriend began to have some experiences

657
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,680
 as well.

658
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,280
 She said from time to time she would hear these strange voices coming from his phone.

659
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,840
 And once they were both in the living room and they heard his phone play the sound of

660
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,400
 like a record scratch, right?

661
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,080
 Now those are easily debunked, right?

662
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,640
 You could just figure, sometimes phones do weird stuff, sometimes they glitch out.

663
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,600
 I don't know about the strange voices, but the record scratch thing, you know whatever,

664
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,200
 that could be a technical thing.

665
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,200
 But she did start to hear strange voices coming from the phone.

666
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,160
 His sister-in-law, however, while he was being assaulted by all of these thoughts and these

667
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,800
 feelings and these visions and everything like that, his sister-in-law also began to suffer

668
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,440
 from gang stalking delusions.

669
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,240
 She started to believe that old classmates of hers, old, old classmates back when they

670
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,560
 were in school, began using technology to beam messages into her head.

671
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,400
 And what's weird is even while Gary was struggling with his delusions, he was telling his sister-in-law,

672
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,360
 "Listen, why in the world, why in the world would your classmates from a long time ago

673
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,960
 at school want to beam messages into your head?

674
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,640
 And if they could, how would they get the technology to do that?

675
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
 It's your classmates."

676
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,880
 He's like aliens on the other hand.

677
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,920
 My delusions are real, but he actually, like while he was suffering from this mental illness,

678
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,320
 was able to talk to his sister-in-law and says, "Just think about it, it doesn't sound plausible."

679
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,240
 She didn't believe him, right?

680
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,440
 She knew what she was experiencing that these classmates were beaming voices into her head.

681
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,440
 But, shortly after he had this horrible car accident and his delusions just disappeared,

682
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,520
 hers did as well.

683
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,560
 Now everyone is back to normal.

684
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,880
 It's a creepy story, right?

685
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,960
 It's a creepy story because what it basically says is, "He just went to disprove this, exists."

686
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,880
 He went to help someone out, right?

687
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,320
 He says, "Hey, I'm an IT consultant, I can come over to your house, I can prove that

688
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,840
 there's no cameras in your house."

689
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:06,640
 And because of that, he had three months of unending psychic assault to the point where

690
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,520
 he almost died and really he almost killed somebody.

691
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,560
 Imagine if he had the kids in the car or imagine if he had barreled down the wrong way of the

692
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,560
 street or even the right way.

693
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,560
 Going 120 miles an hour, you can just rear in someone and destroy them.

694
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,200
 Could it end at his own life?

695
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,400
 Could it end at somebody else's?

696
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:30,000
 Could it walk down the street and start shooting people like that nut job from yesterday?

697
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,200
 His only sin was that he went to someone's house to disprove it and it started to spread

698
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,080
 from him as well.

699
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:42,920
 Little bit to his girlfriend, but his sister-in-law began to experience these delusions.

700
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
 Is insanity contagious?

701
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,640
 I mean, we talk about mass hysteria, we've done a couple episodes on it, but this is

702
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,680
 something different.

703
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,680
 This is so alienating.

704
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,000
 It's the opposite of mass hysteria where everyone's running around the school screaming

705
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,040
 or everyone's dancing through Europe or whatever form it takes.

706
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,240
 This is you feel alone.

707
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,600
 You gangstalking victims suffer it alone.

708
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,760
 And that's why I think they're so eager to make these communities online and they just

709
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,400
 reinforce each other's delusions.

710
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,600
 It's really, really dangerous.

711
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:18,720
 But even then, they go back to their own home and they believe their neighbors or the CIA

712
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,240
 or the aliens are controlling everyone around them, but them.

713
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,920
 Is gangstalking contagious?

714
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:36,360
 Is the idea that you are being tracked and slowly driven crazy on purpose by an apharias

715
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,520
 group or an apharias group?

716
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,360
 Which would actually be even spookier because it's pronounced correctly.

717
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,440
 It really makes you second guess, right?

718
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,440
 It really makes you go, one of your friends, basically the moral of the story is if one

719
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,360
 of your friends is suffering from some sort of mental illness, don't help them because

720
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,760
 you might catch it too.

721
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,840
 Somebody just really, really likes eating hair and you're like, here's, here's, you

722
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:07,480
 just throw a list of psychiatrists at them and then run away before you also hunger for

723
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,960
 the human hair.

724
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,080
 It's just creepy, right?

725
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,200
 And gangstalking is so, it's so isolating.

726
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,640
 It's mentally isolating and it's so dangerous.

727
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,120
 I think we're just starting to see the tip of how dangerous targeted individuals can

728
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,960
 become.

729
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,280
 Is insanity contagious?

730
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,400
 And if it is, what is the cure?

731
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,360
 How can you let the clock run out?

732
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,920
 How could you just sit there and think, this will be over soon, maybe in a couple of months.

733
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,520
 Maybe in a couple of months, I'll be back to normal when the voices are in your head,

734
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,320
 when they're in your eyes, when they are haunting you from every angle from the moment you wake

735
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:01,160
 up to the moment you fall asleep, you are under constant psychic assault.

736
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:08,840
 How long could you last with that torment building in your head?

737
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:16,840
 If the only cure is to wait it out, how many people are strong enough to do that?

738
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,360
 How many people aren't?

739
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,120
 How many people will bow to the voices?

740
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,080
 Will listen to the paranoia?

741
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:33,560
 Will feed into the delusions until it becomes too late for them or for you?

742
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:40,640
 An innocent person walking down the wrong street at the wrong time.

743
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,960
 You thought you were just walking down to the corner store.

744
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,840
 Little did you know that you wore a white t-shirt that day.

745
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,480
 You were a gang stalker.

746
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,120
 You were the enemy.

747
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:07,640
 And now an enemy in a war you didn't even know existed.

748
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:18,320
 Until a targeted individual decided to target you.

749
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,840
