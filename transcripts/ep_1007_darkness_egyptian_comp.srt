1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 Is it possible that being abducted by aliens makes it less likely that you believe in Bigfoot?

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,880
 And then we take a look at the terrifying phenomenon no one has in the dark city.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,760
 Is it possible that at any moment, no matter where you're at or what time of day it is,

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,200
 the entire world can be shrouded in darkness?

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,200
 And that's only the beginning of the mystery.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,880
 I'm your host Jason Carvener, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too and I hope you guys have some awesome plans

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
 for your weekend.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,600
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today so first off walking into Dead Rabbit Command, everyone

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,040
 get on your feet and give it up for Valencia the researcher.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
 Woohoo!

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,600
 Yeah, walking on in Dead Rabbit Command, shut the door, shut the door, it's really cold.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 You letting all the heat out.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
 Valencia, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't spring

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
 to Patreon, you can do what Valencia did.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,320
 She has been making sure that people know about Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,640
 That's another great way to help the show grow.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
 It really really is.

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
 Tell your friends, tell your family, put up flyers around town.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,400
 All of these are great ways to spread the word of the show and that helps the show grow.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,920
 And also let's take a look at our submission for Fan Art Friday.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,240
 This is from Beetle Babe.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,840
 Beetle Babe recently got as a gift one of the tumblers.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,000
 I think that's a tumbler or a coffee mug or something like that but it's from the Dead

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,440
 Rabbit Radio merch shop.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,000
 Beetle Babe got this as a gift and they absolutely love it and I'm so glad that my merchandise

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 is selling.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,120
 But it's really cool to get a photograph of some merch.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
 It's really cool.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,680
 I don't have one of those myself.

33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,520
 I have a shirt and I have some other stuff.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
 I think I got a sticker from them as well.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
 Great.

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,200
 I just love this image and I love that people are so passionate about the show that they're

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,040
 getting stuff as gifts.

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
 That's just so cool.

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,200
 You guys are a really cool group of people.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,040
 I was thinking about that the other day because I interacted with a lot of you guys on Reddit

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,160
 or through email or through YouTube comments or through the export.

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
 What a fantastic group.

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
 What a fantastic group.

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,920
 I'm very proud to have you guys on my side.

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,560
 Valencia, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,240
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

47
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,200
 Let's drive all the way out to a crop circle.

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,480
 They're making new.

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,080
 There's like scientists trying to study it.

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,800
 They're like, "This is the best crop circle ever."

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,520
 Valencia is like doing donuts.

52
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
 Doing donuts.

53
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
 I'm running it all over.

54
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,400
 They're like, "Ah, our evidence."

55
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,800
 We're out in the middle of this cornfield and I'm meeting the corn.

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 I'm meeting the corn.

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
 I'm meeting the evidence.

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 I'm flying around.

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
 I got magical powers now.

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,760
 We're out in the middle of this cornfield because we're about to watch somebody get abducted.

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:09,720
 This UFO is like, "What's that?

62
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 What's that?"

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
 We're like, "Look up.

64
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
 Look up, dude.

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
 It's not with me.

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
 I'm just eating corn.

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
 I'm not making that noise."

68
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
 All of a sudden, this guy gets abducted by an alien.

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
 He flies away.

70
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
 We should have brought a camera.

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
 This is a paranormal podcast.

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
 I'm more concerned about the corn.

73
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,720
 The taste of the corn.

74
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,640
 Then we see a guy run up and he's like, "Oh my God.

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
 Did you see that?

76
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
 I just got abducted by aliens.

77
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,360
 We're like, "Yeah, it's pretty crazy, huh?"

78
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
 He's like, "Yeah.

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
 That's totally awful.

80
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,360
 What do you think is going to happen to that dude?"

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,200
 I'm like, "Well, I'm assuming they're going to run some tests on him.

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
 Hopefully he'll be back."

83
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,880
 The guy's like, "Man, that's crazy."

84
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,280
 Then we see a pickup truck driving through the cornfield as well.

85
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,080
 It pulls up in front of that second guy and out of the pickup truck jumps these dudes with

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,200
 AK-47 and ski masks.

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
 They're all, "Get in the truck."

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
 Get in the truck.

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,960
 He's like, "What's going on, man?

90
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
 What's going on?"

91
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,680
 They throw him in the back of the pickup truck and they're hitting him with the butts of

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
 the rifle.

93
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
 He's like, "No, no, please.

94
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
 I have a family."

95
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,960
 Pickup truck drives away.

96
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,560
 That's our true crime element for this episode.

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,760
 I'm sitting there belly full of corn.

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,960
 We just watched two people get abducted.

99
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:32,960
 One abducted by an alien and one abducted by man, the most dangerous animal of all.

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
 Recently, Zargoza University in Zargoza, Spain.

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
 We've been there before.

102
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,960
 There's a very famous paranormal story known as the Zargoza Govel and I'll put it in the

103
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
 show notes.

104
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
 We covered it.

105
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,280
 But in Zargoza University, they recently did this study.

106
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,800
 It's so fascinating.

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:05:01,520
 They wanted to know if people who were abducted by aliens suffer post-traumatic stress disorder.

108
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,600
 I would say probably right.

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
 They're kidnapped.

110
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
 They're brought aboard ships.

111
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
 It's super traumatic.

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,440
 At the very least, even if you're brought aboard ship and they're bleep-blop-bloop, we are here

113
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,760
 to bring peace among the stars.

114
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,880
 We're this advanced race and we believe all of these crazy things.

115
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,480
 That would probably mess you up a little bit.

116
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,160
 Not assuming they're just being your friend.

117
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,760
 It's the one where you get abducted by aliens and you're strapped down and they stick a

118
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,100
 hose in your mouth and they're making you ingest as clear liquid as their laser cutters

119
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,120
 are removing your fingertips.

120
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,560
 You know, that'll probably mess you up more than seeing the Earth from orbit.

121
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,640
 The Zargoza University recently did this study and they said out of 19 people that they

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,720
 were able to find who said that they were abducted by aliens.

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:57,560
 Out of 19 people who claimed to be abduction survivors, 9% of them had PTSD or symptoms

124
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,080
 that would diagnose them as having post-traumatic stress disorder.

125
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:09,320
 So 47% based on the study, 47% of alien abduction victims have PTSD.

126
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,240
 It's interesting because Zargoza University, the study they go, "We don't believe in aliens.

127
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,200
 We don't believe in any of this stuff.

128
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
 We don't believe in any of this stuff."

129
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,840
 I actually found out about this through an article in the New York Post written by Hannah

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
 Sparks.

131
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,160
 So thank you for bringing this to my attention.

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,000
 But I read this study and they're like, "We don't believe in aliens.

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,400
 We don't believe in aliens."

134
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:38,200
 But it's interesting to note, they continue, that they, speaking of the alien abduction

135
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,080
 survivors, they believe it was a real event.

136
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,160
 It didn't happen.

137
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,000
 But they believe it was a real event, so much so that the fear is real.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,240
 Even though aliens don't exist, those are their words, but even though aliens don't exist,

139
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,920
 the trauma was so real to them they developed PTSD.

140
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,440
 But let's look at the other guy who got kidnapped by the humans in the pickup truck.

141
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,440
 Because they did.

142
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,080
 Actually I think they had a control group of people who had never been abducted, but

143
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,200
 they have the people who have been abducted by aliens and then they interviewed people

144
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,760
 who had been kidnapped by humans.

145
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,240
 So they interviewed 32 people who had been kidnapped by humans.

146
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:38,720
 How high do you think the PTSD rate is among humans who are kidnapped by other humans?

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
 I would say 100% honestly.

148
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,400
 We see we're scared all the time.

149
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:53,840
 No, it's 46% of humans who are kidnapped by other humans.

150
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,880
 There's no doubt it wasn't a lucid dream.

151
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,640
 They're sitting in the back of a pickup truck for three days.

152
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,080
 All that stuff and you're tied up and then eventually you get freed because otherwise

153
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,800
 you couldn't be in this study.

154
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,040
 Do you think I can participate in this study?

155
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,240
 This university has to pay your ransom.

156
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
 Now we have some questions to ask you.

157
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,600
 Among people who had been kidnapped by other people, the PTSD rate is only 46%.

158
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
 That's super low.

159
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,640
 That's insane.

160
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:33,600
 And it is lower than people who claim to be kidnapped by aliens.

161
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,800
 The study was called post-traumatic stress disorder suggestibility and disassociation

162
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,680
 related to alleged alien abduction.

163
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,840
 And what was interesting about it, they did say that the fear is real to them.

164
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,120
 Whether or not they say they don't go, well maybe they were abducted by aliens.

165
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,880
 They go, these people are not, they didn't really get abducted by aliens but they believe

166
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
 they do.

167
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,960
 I wonder if during the study the abductees like, you believe me, right?

168
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,520
 You believe that aliens exist and the researchers like, uh, yeah, sure.

169
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,800
 But what's so interesting about this is, well this makes sense.

170
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,320
 Like the thing about if you believe the event is real and then you have a PTSD because of

171
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,240
 it, I understand that.

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,360
 It's interesting to note that it's the same, it's a little bit higher than human abduction

173
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:27,680
 which again you'd think would be 100%, but the suggestibility portion of this is really

174
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
 interesting.

175
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,600
 When they did, they didn't give an exact percentage but what they realized was that alien abductees

176
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:44,480
 scored lower in suggestibility, lower than the control group and lower than the kidnapping

177
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,080
 group.

178
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,920
 They were more of a skeptic after the abduction than before.

179
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,560
 And this kind of makes sense.

180
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
 It kind of makes sense.

181
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,760
 But let's put it this way.

182
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:08,800
 You believe in Bigfoot, you believe in ghosts, you believe in tarot cards, psychics and you

183
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,840
 believe in aliens.

184
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,240
 And then one day you are abducted by aliens.

185
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,120
 It would actually make sense for you to go, "I don't believe in that other stuff."

186
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,960
 I've never seen a Bigfoot.

187
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,240
 I've had sensations that might have been a ghost.

188
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,960
 Tarot card, psychics, I mean there's never been any real proof but I know aliens exist.

189
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,760
 Because I've seen one.

190
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
 I saw four.

191
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,440
 They were surrounding my bed and getting their laser beams ready.

192
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,560
 But I don't believe in that other stuff.

193
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:46,800
 That actually makes total sense because you had a concrete encounter with something that

194
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,760
 yes, while it is bizarre, you know it's real now.

195
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,840
 You know that is as real as people getting kidnapped by regular people.

196
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,520
 But then you go all that other stuff like, "I've never seen any proof of that."

197
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,720
 You think, some people might think it's the other way around.

198
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,280
 Well if you see aliens you go, "Well then it all must be real."

199
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,520
 But that's just not the case.

200
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,400
 It's interesting too, I was looking at this.

201
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,720
 In 1991 there was a nationwide poll of 6,000 Americans.

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,000
 And 119 gave answers that were indicative of alien abductions.

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,160
 Basically the poll was asking, "Have you ever done this?

204
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,480
 Have you ever levitated out of your bed?

205
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,040
 Have you ever been visited by tiny great people?"

206
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,400
 It asked these questions that would make it seem like if you answered these questions

207
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,960
 and maybe you've been abducted by aliens, even if you wouldn't say that.

208
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,960
 Even if you wouldn't classify it as, "Oh I've been abducted by aliens."

209
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,640
 You may say, "Have you had lost time?"

210
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,680
 Have you been in part of an interstellar war?

211
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,520
 They're like, "Oh that does remind me."

212
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,800
 In my first summer in college when I fought all those reptilians on Octuria 7, they asked

213
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,440
 you these questions that if you answer yes to enough of them you probably have been abducted

214
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
 by aliens.

215
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,440
 119 people out of 6,000 gave answers that were indicative of alien abduction and if you extrapolate

216
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,080
 that out that would mean in the United States alone.

217
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,320
 It's possible you have 4 million people who have experiences that would be indicative

218
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,320
 of them being abducted by aliens, which is a huge amount.

219
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,480
 Obviously if you didn't know 4 million with the big number you were like, "Golly Jason!

220
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,400
 I didn't know that 4 million!

221
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
 Wow!

222
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,800
 That's a big number!"

223
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,280
 So crazy steady out love stuff like this, super super fascinating.

224
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,780
 "Valencia, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter we are leaving

225
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,080
 behind this crop circle.

226
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,200
 We're destroying all their evidence.

227
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,080
 As the helicopter is lifting off, fly us all the way out to London."

228
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:47,440
 It's April 2, 1904.

229
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,360
 We're in the Wimbledon District of London.

230
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,040
 Specifically we're at a London Underground Station.

231
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,080
 So that's like their subway.

232
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,360
 Choo choo!

233
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,280
 Trains coming down the track.

234
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,800
 All these people are getting ready to go about their business.

235
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,000
 They're hanging out in the London Underground Station that all of a sudden the entire train

236
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,480
 station is shrouded in darkness.

237
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,440
 Now it's not just like the lights went out.

238
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:25,040
 It's as if you took the entire London Underground Station and dipped it in black ink.

239
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,080
 It's that level of darkness.

240
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,840
 You can't see anything.

241
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,000
 There is zero light coming in.

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,480
 Not even a sliver, which would allow you to make out shapes in the darkness.

243
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,000
 You guys have ever been in a super dark room and as your eyes begin to adjust, you can

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,720
 see, maybe you can't see the knobs on your dresser, but you can see the outline of the

245
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,840
 dresser in the darkness.

246
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,320
 You just need a little bit of light to be able to do that.

247
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,840
 That is not the case on April 2, 1904.

248
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,800
 It is completely black.

249
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,400
 They couldn't see any outlines of the structures around them.

250
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,800
 They couldn't see each other.

251
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,640
 "Blimey, me peepers, they're not working.

252
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,160
 I need the governor."

253
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,600
 And they're yelling and the employees are like, "We don't know what's going on.

254
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,920
 We're just as trapped in the dark as you are."

255
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,760
 It's almost too dangerous to even move around.

256
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
 And you could shout.

257
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,320
 You could shout, "Ah, porridge.

258
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 I'm late for my meeting."

259
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:29,720
 Well, a couple minutes pass and everything returns to normal.

260
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,920
 There's no notation to the sensation of it turning off and turning on.

261
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,680
 You don't know if it was a slow fade up or if it was just a blink and it was back.

262
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,520
 After a few minutes, everything returned to normal.

263
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
 But that didn't matter.

264
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,200
 People were still very, very puzzled and worried about what had happened.

265
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,040
 Because it was extremely dangerous here in an area where one wrong step in your train

266
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,440
 meet, you're landing right in front of those tracks.

267
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,520
 So people were complaining about this and eventually the city sent out some scientists

268
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,520
 to study what could have caused this and they actually closed up all the entrances.

269
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,400
 They covered all the ventilation, everything like that to try to eliminate all light.

270
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,680
 And they couldn't.

271
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,120
 They could not at any point replicate the pitch darkness that they had seen, that the

272
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,800
 people in the train station had seen on that day.

273
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,200
 Eventually scientists in town, the researchers who were looking at this said, "It's possible

274
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,480
 that what happened was you had some sort of toxic gas."

275
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,840
 Which you always want to hear happen at your workplace, right?

276
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,840
 Maybe some sort of toxic gas seeped up through the earth, because you know this is an underground

277
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,640
 metro station and everyone inhaled it and it caused temporary blindness.

278
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:48,240
 People weren't super happy with that answer, but that was the best they had.

279
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,640
 March 7th, 1911.

280
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,360
 We're in Louisville, Kentucky.

281
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,200
 It's 4pm.

282
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,240
 And it's an average day up to this point.

283
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,320
 People are walking around the city.

284
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 A few people are driving.

285
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,680
 I don't know how widespread cars were in Kentucky, 1911, but I'm sure there were a couple.

286
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,760
 People walking on the street, probably like a bunch of horses too.

287
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,960
 People are riding horses on the street.

288
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,120
 Like Jason just like a basic fax or don't even mention it.

289
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,320
 If you don't know, they're having a race.

290
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,720
 They're having a drag race with horses.

291
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
 Demolition Derby.

292
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,920
 Anyways, I don't know about the transportation of Kentucky in 1911.

293
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,120
 It's not important for the story.

294
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,440
 I'm just thinking about horses.

295
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:36,760
 At 4pm on March 7th, 1911, the city goes black.

296
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:46,960
 And if it's possible, the city was actually darker than the underground metro station.

297
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:54,400
 You had a population of around 50,000 people suddenly plunged into a darkness darker than

298
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,520
 night.

299
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,000
 At the time, 1911, you had a lot of people who were smokers.

300
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,560
 So they had matchboxes with them.

301
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,800
 So when the lights go out, and I'm not just talking lighting, but the sun's gone.

302
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,040
 An entire city is pitch black.

303
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,960
 People were pulling matchbooks out of their pocket and lighting matches.

304
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,120
 And they said, "Listen, I've been smoking for years.

305
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,400
 I'm holding the match.

306
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,480
 I feel the match striking against the side of the box.

307
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,320
 I hear it strike against the side of the box.

308
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:38,560
 I hear that telltale sound of when the sulfur ignites on the edge of the matchstick.

309
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
 I hear it.

310
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:47,040
 I can feel the heat, but I can't see the flame."

311
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
 It's that dark.

312
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,000
 You can hold a lit match in your hand.

313
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,040
 You can't even see the light.

314
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,920
 People also reported this darkness as being different than the one that was experienced

315
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,040
 in London.

316
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,640
 They said moving through it was...

317
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,360
 There was something tangible about the darkness.

318
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
 They said it was almost like you were moving through water.

319
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,600
 It was thick.

320
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,520
 This time, the darkness lasted an hour.

321
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:22,960
 Some people reported that when the city went black, and obviously, it's widespread panic,

322
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,840
 people began moving through the darkness trying to find loved ones or just get home by some

323
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,360
 more matches so they can smoke a cigarette in the darkness.

324
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,000
 They said when the light returned, when everything was back to normal, they were in a different

325
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,640
 location, which you would figure if you were walking.

326
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,480
 They said they were farther away than they should have been.

327
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,040
 If they moved what would have seemed like a block, they would have been eight blocks

328
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
 away.

329
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,320
 They didn't give an exact measurement.

330
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,880
 They didn't say it was an eight for one, but they said that when you moved, you actually

331
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,440
 ended up farther away, much farther away than you should have.

332
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,080
 One woman said she was at her house when everything went black.

333
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
 She couldn't see anything.

334
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,440
 All the outlines are gone.

335
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,640
 It's like you're walking through this void.

336
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,120
 She was moving through her house by touch.

337
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,360
 The things were physically still there.

338
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,840
 She couldn't see them.

339
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:28,320
 When the darkness lifted, she found herself in a locked room.

340
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,520
 Now I know what you're thinking.

341
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
 We're not done.

342
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,160
 We still got some more stuff here, but this is where I want to pause.

343
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,400
 I know what you're thinking, because this is exactly what I was thinking.

344
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,560
 Is there anything to back any of this up?

345
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,040
 Let me give you a little bit of provenance for this story.

346
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,960
 I found out about it on the website Anomalien.

347
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,040
 They wrote an article about the mysterious phenomenon of the onset of sudden darkness.

348
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,240
 I like Anomalien, but they publish a lot of goofy stuff too.

349
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,640
 They'll take a sentence or a headline and then extrapolate it.

350
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,400
 Most famously, that episode that I got, unending emails from you guys where I said there was

351
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,840
 like a three second delay in your eyesight.

352
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
 I don't remember exactly what the time was.

353
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,800
 Dude, you guys were like Jason, you clearly didn't read that article, right?

354
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,520
 And they also Anomalien also kind of made it more goofy than it actually was.

355
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,160
 But anyway, so Anomalien does do that.

356
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,440
 I do that from time to time.

357
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,160
 This was one that I was super interested in, because Dead Rat Baratio, we've been investigating

358
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,920
 the black bedroom phenomenon, which is something that this show has identified.

359
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,600
 No one else has put these stories together that we've come across through people's accounts.

360
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,840
 It's really cool and it's really creepy.

361
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,880
 I'll put those episodes in the show notes.

362
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,080
 So when I read about these cities going dark, I was like, wow, could this be connected to

363
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
 it?

364
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,000
 But by the time, I mean, I'm reading the article, by the time it said the city in Kentucky went

365
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,440
 black, I was like, okay, the Wimbledon, whatever happens at the Brits, whatever, you can walk

366
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,640
 around darkness all day long.

367
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
 No, I tried verifying that.

368
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
 I couldn't find anything.

369
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,920
 But by the time I'm reading the article and it gets to the Kentucky story, I was like,

370
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,080
 there has to be something.

371
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,560
 Like if this story is true, that is such a huge event that there has to be something.

372
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,200
 I'm not talking it would necessarily be in the newspaper.

373
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
 It would be.

374
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,600
 It would be a front page news story.

375
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,880
 But I'm thinking they're also in the, in the Fortian catalog and all these stories of

376
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,760
 high strangeness there should be mentioned of this.

377
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
 So I started looking around.

378
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:35,680
 The only sources I could find involving the stories all pull off of one website.

379
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,920
 It's a Russian website called philosophy of life.

380
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,800
 And this is the earliest post involving these stories.

381
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,560
 You have the post on a non-alien.

382
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:55,720
 Every other source I found to these two cities going completely black were from Russian websites.

383
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,280
 Like they had someone posted it on a Russian like version of Facebook.

384
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,560
 And then there was another story from another Russian website.

385
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:09,600
 But all of them pulled from an article written on September 23rd, 2011 on a website called

386
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000
 philosophy of life.

387
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,800
 Now what's interesting is philosophy of life, it describes itself as having articles from

388
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,400
 different areas of life.

389
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,160
 And then they have this list, culture and art, science and religion, history and adventure,

390
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,560
 geography, astronomy, and stories about famous people.

391
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,640
 So it's just kind of like a history website.

392
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,680
 They're the very first ones to run this story.

393
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,080
 They ran it on September 23rd, 2011.

394
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:42,760
 I went and there is zero mention of these events prior to that article being published.

395
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,560
 Well you go, okay Jason, so they made it up.

396
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,640
 Like they say that they're philosophy of life, but they must be some wackadoodle website.

397
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,440
 It's interesting because I started looking around this, I started looking around philosophy

398
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,080
 of life website.

399
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,040
 The articles they have posted right now, like two days ago when I was researching this, they

400
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,720
 have three articles on their main page.

401
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:14,880
 A biography of J.K. Rowling, a biography of Christopher Columbus, and a article on what

402
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
 is meltwater.

403
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
 I was like what?

404
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,680
 I don't think you've ever heard that term before.

405
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,440
 What is meltwater?

406
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,440
 Meltwater and I go, oh is that going to be some weird scientific curative or something like

407
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
 that?

408
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,120
 Meltwater is water that is melted from snow.

409
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,240
 I was like what?

410
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,040
 But maybe they used to be a weird wackadoodle website, right?

411
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,960
 Maybe these are their current articles they're talking about famous people and I'm sure,

412
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,400
 I guess meltwater would fall under science and religion.

413
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,760
 They had a section called like the unknown section.

414
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,480
 So like phenomenon, right?

415
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,400
 Forty and phenomenon, like we talk about weird stuff.

416
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,480
 They had two articles in the unknown section too.

417
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,440
 This article, which was titled darkness Egyptian.

418
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,480
 You'll see that phrase pop up around the internet, really only on three other websites that

419
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,680
 mention this.

420
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,720
 And the Anom alien, a darkness Egyptian because they were comparing these events to one of

421
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:22,920
 the biblical plagues when God was trying to get the pharaoh to let the Israelites go.

422
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,800
 It's called darkness Egyptians, the name of the article.

423
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,600
 They have two articles in the unknown section, darkness Egyptian and a general write up on

424
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,920
 the mythological creature known as the harpy.

425
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,120
 Which you can find anywhere.

426
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,240
 You can find information about harps anywhere.

427
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
 Check Wikipedia.

428
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,360
 You can go to my fifth grade class, learn about mythology back then.

429
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,520
 That's it.

430
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,560
 Everything else on this website, everything else that's been around, the website's been

431
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,060
 around since at least 2011.

432
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,400
 So we're talking 11 years at this point, 12.

433
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,920
 Everything else on this website is completely legit that I could see.

434
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,960
 I didn't see anything about like hidden history.

435
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,440
 I didn't see anything about alternative energy sources or curative medicines.

436
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,000
 It was all legit stuff.

437
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 It was philosophy of life.

438
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
 Interesting articles about different areas of life.

439
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
 The two of them were weird.

440
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,840
 One of them is just basic knowledge, harpies.

441
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,520
 And then this article, this is the very first mention of this phenomenon on this website.

442
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,920
 That's super fascinating.

443
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,440
 I expected to find this on some fringe conspiracy website.

444
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,320
 The fact that it's a Russian website is super interesting as well.

445
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,120
 Because a long time ago we covered a story called the Paris time gap.

446
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,440
 And I believe it was on the iceberg.

447
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:54,200
 It was a story that on December 29th, 1902 at 1.05 a.m., all the pendulum clocks in

448
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,800
 Paris stopped.

449
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:04,840
 Everyone woke up and everyone was nauseous.

450
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,720
 And what's interesting is I covered that and I was talking about it coming from these Russian

451
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,800
 websites and there is no knowledge of this conspiracy theory or this event.

452
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,680
 In the West there was zero.

453
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,400
 I remember getting emails from people who are Eastern European who listen to the show

454
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,880
 in that region of the world and they're like, "Oh no, I remember hearing that story a long

455
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
 time ago."

456
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,600
 Like it was super, I wouldn't say super common, but it's not like on the level of the Bermuda

457
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:35,240
 Triangle, but I got feedback saying that is actually like a, it's a well-known conspiracy

458
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,400
 theory.

459
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,360
 They thought everyone knew that.

460
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,120
 If you were into the paranormal, you knew the story of the Paris time gap.

461
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,840
 It's something that we only saw over there.

462
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,520
 I was never able to find any proof that it actually happened, but again it was a conspiracy

463
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
 theory.

464
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,080
 It was a regional conspiracy theory.

465
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,760
 And now we have this happening again.

466
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,680
 We have this Russian website that seems legit by all other means.

467
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,560
 I mean, go to the link.

468
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:09,760
 It's just like some boring history website and yet they have this story, Darkness Egyptian.

469
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,640
 They have this story about the black cities.

470
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,720
 And there's one more story I want to highlight here before we end up for the week.

471
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,760
 July 16th, 1957.

472
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,680
 We're in Orles, France.

473
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,840
 It's 12 in the afternoon.

474
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:35,440
 It's high noon and Madame Jeanette, she's a 54-year-old nanny, loads up a stroller with

475
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,040
 some diapers and a fresh baby bottle and a fresh baby.

476
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
 You have to have a baby.

477
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
 She takes...

478
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,200
 Do you know nannies call the people masters, like Master Bruce from Batman?

479
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,120
 Anyway, she takes the master's baby, puts her in the stroller and they go through a stroll

480
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,400
 through city park.

481
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,800
 Baby falls asleep.

482
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
 Madame Jeanette goes, "You know what?

483
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,640
 I'm going to sit down on this bench, little baby persons, catching some Z's.

484
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,880
 I'm going to sleep too.

485
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,520
 That's what nannies do when the baby's sleeping.

486
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,760
 They fall asleep in public."

487
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,560
 Madame Jeanette just sits down on the bench and then this...

488
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,920
 I like this story because it describes the process a little bit more.

489
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,560
 And this story also, 2011, Philosophy of History.

490
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,560
 That was the first place I found this story.

491
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,440
 And then everywhere else was Russian websites and then finally a nom alien.

492
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,840
 But anyways, we're going to get a description of how the phenomenon works.

493
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:37,920
 Madame Jeanette sitting on the bench and she said, "The lights fade out suddenly."

494
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,040
 Which is an interesting, almost a contradiction, right?

495
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:48,440
 She compared it to when you click a light bulb off, it goes out, right?

496
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,040
 It shuts off.

497
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,640
 But there is this mechanism where it doesn't instantly go off.

498
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,180
 It feels like it does, but it's a...

499
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,460
 It fades so quickly, it seems instantaneous, but it does in fact fade out.

500
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,720
 She's sitting in the dark.

501
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,600
 Now, it was noon when she sat down on this bench and now everything is pitch black.

502
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,640
 Everything around her is enveloped in darkness, including the baby stroller.

503
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,920
 And Madame Jeanette says that instantly the little girl began crying.

504
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,820
 The baby under her care began bawling.

505
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,740
 It's like whatever this mechanism was, it woke up the baby and terrified her.

506
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,900
 And Madame Jeanette is sitting there and she has to feel for the stroller.

507
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:47,180
 She has to find the stroller by touch and then she has to feel for the baby inside of

508
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,100
 it and then she pulls the little baby out and she's holding this precious little girl

509
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,840
 close to herself and Madame Jeanette's trying to soothe her.

510
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,040
 It's okay, Master Baby.

511
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,120
 It's okay.

512
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,760
 This darkness only lasts 15 minutes.

513
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,400
 And then the darkness fades away quickly.

514
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:21,700
 And now she's sitting in the city park.

515
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:27,900
 She can see normally, however, it's evening now.

516
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
 But at least she can see.

517
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,740
 It may be dark outside, the street lights may be on, but at least she's not trapped

518
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
 in this darkness.

519
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,820
 But now we have this massive time shift.

520
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,500
 In the first story, we had people getting lost in the darkness and then up in random

521
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
 places.

522
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,180
 This one is our first time where we have a noticeable time shift.

523
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,640
 She's in the darkness for 15 minutes, but now it's evening.

524
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
 It terrifies her.

525
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,000
 This whole event is freaking her out.

526
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,680
 She races home with the stroller and when she gets there, the family of the baby, they're

527
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,080
 freaking out as well.

528
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:06,200
 Not because they had also been enveloped by this blackness, but because the nanny and

529
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:14,180
 master baby had been missing for three days.

530
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,940
 The police and the family didn't suspect that the nanny was doing anything with the baby

531
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,540
 in those three days.

532
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,940
 One because the nanny was a very well respected member of the household and people knew her

533
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
 in the community.

534
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,620
 It would be so out of character for her to do something.

535
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:36,920
 The other thing that they noticed was the diapers and the bottle were fresh and they

536
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,600
 were the ones that she loaded into the stroller in the first place.

537
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,480
 So it wasn't like she had been taking this baby around for three days walking around

538
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,640
 in three day old poopy diapers.

539
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,280
 It was like she had just left the house 15 minutes ago.

540
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,920
 Is there any truth to these stories?

541
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,220
 You know, the one with Madame Jeanette and the London Underground Station, I think it

542
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,660
 would be easy enough for those to fly under the radar.

543
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,460
 Those aren't necessarily going to...

544
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,940
 The one in the London Station, you think there would be a series of articles about

545
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,780
 health effects on the station or what happened or something like that?

546
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,620
 I think those could fly under the radar.

547
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,460
 The one in Kentucky, I think would be really hard to black out an entire city and it not

548
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,960
 be in the paper.

549
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,320
 If Louisville, if 50,000 residents of the city were enveloped in darkness and they were

550
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,620
 just bumbling around for an hour and teleporting around town, I think that would make the local

551
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,740
 gazette.

552
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,200
 But then where are these stories coming from?

553
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,920
 It's so interesting because this is a website, the original publishers of this in 2011.

554
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,940
 I could find no earlier source.

555
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,420
 And it got to the point where I just started searching in Russian.

556
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,440
 I was actually using... what is it?

557
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
 Scrilich?

558
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
 Srillik?

559
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,400
 I was using that alphabet.

560
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:02,040
 I was like taking words and translating them into Russian and Google searching for those

561
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,720
 to find more stuff on this.

562
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,840
 And I couldn't find anything.

563
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,520
 The earliest example I could find was in 2011.

564
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,000
 It was... this story has not been told before that.

565
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,320
 So one, even if the story had been told before that, I doubt a website that's so dedicated

566
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,020
 towards just like general knowledge things.

567
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,180
 Do you know about harpies?

568
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:26,620
 And again, there's only two unknown stories in there of unknown phenomenon.

569
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,780
 Not like they have this huge thing and they were trying to figure out the wackiest stuff.

570
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,540
 I don't understand why they would run the story if it was fake, if they thought it was

571
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,820
 fake.

572
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,220
 And I don't think they just ran it.

573
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,220
 I think they wrote it.

574
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
 You know what I mean?

575
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,540
 Like I don't think that they had come across it on another website and go, "Hey, let's put

576
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,680
 this next to harpies.

577
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,200
 That'll be good."

578
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,400
 I think Philosophy of Life created this story or wrote it up.

579
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,520
 See, but again, like why?

580
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:01,040
 It doesn't make sense for them to write a fictional story when everything else is real.

581
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,320
 So where did they get it from?

582
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
 Did they...

583
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,720
 I'm super puzzled by this.

584
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,200
 Just like I was puzzled by the Paris time gap.

585
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,320
 Like why isn't it in any Western media?

586
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,300
 Especially because the three incidents take place in Western countries, France and Britain

587
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,380
 and America.

588
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,660
 And Anomalien published it.

589
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,780
 That was just a few days ago when Anomalien ran this.

590
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,820
 It was like the first week of January, maybe the last week of December, but I had never

591
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,820
 heard of this before.

592
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,820
 This is absolutely fascinating.

593
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,420
 There's so many questions I have about it.

594
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,020
 And the big one though is, is this real?

595
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,020
 Did this really happen?

596
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,140
 And you have to factor in a bunch of things.

597
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:45,760
 One, it sounds ludicrous in a nutshell because we're tied...

598
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,320
 Not the idea of people being trapped in darkness because again, we've been cataloging those

599
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,320
 events when we're looking at the Black Benjamin phenomenon.

600
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,680
 That's not what's ridiculous about it.

601
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,960
 What's ridiculous is that it could happen to large groups of people and it not be in

602
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,800
 the media.

603
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,760
 But then you also got to realize that the media is constantly picking and choosing what stories

604
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,340
 and narratives we hear.

605
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
 So what else?

606
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
 It's just so fascinating.

607
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,340
 I wonder what else is out there.

608
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,380
 I don't know if these stories are true, but I definitely find them absolutely fascinating.

609
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,660
 And I find it fascinating that a Russian website called Philosophy of Life is the first people

610
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,620
 to publish this story that I could find.

611
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:33,100
 And they put it alongside all their other verifiable stuff.

612
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,200
 I mean, I didn't have to fact check whether or not JK Rowling was real, whether or not

613
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,720
 she enjoyed the sweet, sweet taste of meltwater.

614
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,640
 This is all such a fascinating story.

615
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,920
 What we can really suss out of it is everything in a whole...

616
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,080
 The Black Benjamin phenomenon seems to be real.

617
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,120
 We're getting so many unrelated reports about it around the world.

618
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,200
 Are these stories real?

619
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,760
 Are these particular ones?

620
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,100
 The one that I find most suspect is the one that took place in Kentucky where 50,000 people

621
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,020
 saw this and there's not a single news report.

622
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,260
 However, let's put on our conspiracy caps to wrap this up.

623
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:16,540
 This would be a phenomenon that if it was happening, the government and the media would

624
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,660
 have to cover it up.

625
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,140
 Because just like they'll cover up the existence of aliens, just like they'll cover up the

626
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:31,520
 existence of unidentified flying objects in our airspace, especially during the Cold War,

627
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,800
 at least those were things you could shoot at.

628
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,280
 Even if you couldn't shoot them down, they were physical objects that we could open fire

629
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,680
 on and say, "Go away, go away, go away," and it flies away.

630
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,920
 That's not really effective, but this is...

631
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,160
 Whether this is a natural or a supernatural phenomenon, you're completely powerless once

632
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,560
 you're in its grasp.

633
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,340
 And the military couldn't deal with it, the scientists couldn't even replicate it.

634
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:03,980
 How would a government be able to calm down the population if this was an actual real

635
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
 thing?

636
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,900
 I mean, we know tornadoes are coming, I think, right?

637
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
 We can kind of predict those.

638
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,540
 We can't predict those when we see the neighbor's house way up in the air.

639
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,740
 You can't predict an earthquake, but you can prepare a city for it.

640
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,500
 You know, natural disasters, don't live next to a volcano, that type of stuff.

641
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:28,920
 But everything going pitch black and then you teleporting around the city, how do you

642
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,040
 prepare for that?

643
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,100
 And if it is supernatural, if it's something naturally could steady it and maybe figure

644
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,200
 out some way to predict it or mitigate it, but if it's supernatural, if it's some sort

645
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:44,440
 of dimensional rift opening up or reality itself is collapsing in a certain geographical

646
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,680
 area, there'd be no way to combat that.

647
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,280
 The easiest way to combat that was to make people think it never happened in the first

648
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,800
 place.

649
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,000
 You would not want panic in the population.

650
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,100
 But I don't know if the stories of darkness Egyptian are true.

651
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,860
 I do believe the black bedroom phenomenon is real.

652
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,620
 So that's interesting.

653
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:14,800
 All that is is a more localized and indoor version of the stories we've looked at today.

654
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
 So what is this?

655
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
 What is going on?

656
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,240
 This is absolutely fascinating and quite terrifying as well.

657
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,800
 And then the big question though is what happens when it happens to you?

658
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,520
 This really gets to the root of all of these stories we talk about on Dead Rabbit Radio,

659
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
 isn't it?

660
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,800
 It's always happening to somebody else and in the back of our mind we're thinking, what

661
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:46,080
 if this happened to me?

662
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,520
 And again there's no defense because we don't know what it is.

663
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,200
 And I think at first you would assume it was something natural.

664
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,920
 You wake up in the middle of the night, your bedroom's completely black.

665
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
 It's nighttime, Jason.

666
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,480
 What do you expect my lights on?

667
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,720
 But then you realize that there's zero light coming in, not even the light from the street

668
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:14,120
 lamps outside your house, from the moon hanging overhead.

669
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:21,240
 The best you could hope in that situation is that you could remain calm and that it's

670
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,960
 temporary.

671
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,160
 Because it has to be temporary, right?

672
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,240
 Every example we've ever come across, it's a temporary phenomenon.

673
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,120
 It eventually ends.

674
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:43,240
 But those are the stories told by the survivors.

675
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:50,840
 How many stories are out there of people waking up in a pitch black void?

676
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:59,280
 Or walking down the street and all of a sudden the city is shrouded in an unearthly darkness?

677
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,640
 Or sitting with your loved ones in your living room watching a movie.

678
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,440
 And at first you think the power is out.

679
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:17,200
 And then as the minutes turn to hours and the hours turn to days, and you and your family

680
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,800
 are desperately holding on to each other, because you know that if they wander off into

681
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:32,520
 this black void, you'll never see them again.

682
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:42,840
 You're thirsty, you're hungry, you're panicked, and you're trapped.

683
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,640
 How many people have ended their existence in these black voids?

684
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,760
 We just think they've gone missing.

685
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,000
 But in fact they disappeared into the darkness Egyptian.

686
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,680
 No one ever saw them again.

687
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:06,920
 And more terrifying than that, they couldn't even see their own hands.

688
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,120
 They couldn't even see their own body.

689
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:27,960
 They simply spent their last days wandering through an unknowable, unending world of darkness.

690
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:39,080
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

691
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,600
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm so glad you listened to it today.

692
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,480
 Have a great weekend guys.

693
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:50,480
 Bye.

694
00:41:50,480 --> 00:42:00,480
 Bye.

695
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:10,480
 Bye.

696
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,060
 (upbeat music)

697
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:23,060
