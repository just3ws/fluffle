1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 We start off Monday with a story that will really kind of piss you off, it still gets under my skin and I've been reading it all week.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy theory that a popular reality show may have been warning us of the coming police state.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 It's not cops, that's not the reality show I'm talking about.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Then we travel to China, specifically the Great Wall of China, to investigate a new rumor that is spreading around the internet.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Is it possible that there is an entire civilization living inside the Great Wall of China today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 We have a ton of stuff to cover, so first off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Alexander Helllander.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Alexander Helllander, he's walking into the building doing a little bow.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 He should change his last name to Highlander, that would be dope.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Or you know, just have his family legacy, his name Helllander.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Alexander, you're going to be our captain, our pilot of this episode, and if you can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Just help spread the word about the show, that also really, really helps out a lot.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 So I'm going to toss Alexander the keys to the Jason Jalopy, he's kind of spinning them on his finger there for a second.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I wanted to give you guys a little news update.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Real quick news, we are doing a live episode on Thanksgiving Day.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 That's at 12pm Pacific Standard Time, we're going to be doing a live episode.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And afterwards, and maybe a little bit before the episode, we'll be taking questions, having talking and stuff.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 You know what humans do when they meet each other?

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And I announced it during the live stream that I had on Saturday.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Next year, we're coming out with the Dead Rabbit Radio video game.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 So I've been working on that, it's a lot of fun.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 It's with RPG Maker, which I've used in the past.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I did create a game from start to finish.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It was a two hour campaign.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 It was fun to do.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And it thought it was fun as well, so we're going to be doing that game.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 It's going to be on itch.io, so it's free.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 If you want to kick down a buck or two, you can, but it's going to be out there.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 It's for you guys.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 It gives me something to do too, so I'm not just playing Minecraft on my time off.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I'm building this game.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 You are going to be able to play a Dead Rabbit Radio fan.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 You get to play you, searching for me after I have been kidnapped by Mormon Bigfoot.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 So it's going to be all of our favorites.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Hans is going to show up.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Hans, the little monkey army is going to show up and we're working on it,

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 but that's going to be coming out next year.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 So Alexander, are you ready to take us to our first story?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 He nods.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Do, do, do.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Alarm's going off.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Everyone's looking around.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 They're like, what's that?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I go, you didn't know we all have a new job.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 We are now officially baby savers.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And you're like, what in the world is a baby saver?

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I'm like, what's up with that?

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 You're all filling out your W9.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I'm like pushing you aside.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 We got this new job.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Baby savers.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Alexander's driving the Jason Jalopy has a little siren on it.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 We're driving to save little baby person.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Could you get any more noble than that?

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 We're in Newton, Alabama.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 [Makes a noise]

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 The car is racing through the streets in Newton, Alabama.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 It's the year 2017 and we just got a call that a baby needs saving.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So we pull up to this department of human services building.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 We're kicking down their door.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 They're like, dude, we know you work here, baby savers.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 You don't need to kick down our door all the time.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Get out of the way, person who's trying to help us.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Pushing our way into the back.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 In the back office, there's a woman named Grace Locke.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And she's holding her little three month old baby.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Now Grace Locke has two kids already, got busted for some sort of drug crime.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 We don't care.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 We don't care about the specifics.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 We're just baby savers, right?

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 She got busted for a drug crime.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Part of her parole, her probation, she had to do drug tests all the time.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And she'd been doing really good.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 That's what she'd been telling people, right?

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 You can never trust these guys.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Oh, I'm not using the meth anymore.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I'm not doing that no more.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And she decides that she wants her other two kids back.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 She wants to have her family because now she has this three month old child

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 and she wants her other two kids out of the foster system.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 They can be a family again.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I'm not on drugs anymore.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 She tells everybody.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 But when she's at department of human services,

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 she's holding her three month old baby.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 We're standing in the room.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 We got our sunglasses on.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Me, Alexander's looking super tough.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 He's all in his antelope.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Dude, dude, calm down a bit.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Calm down a bit.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 No punching yet.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And it turns out that while she's sitting in the office,

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 someone comes in, she's like trying to make her case to get her other two kids back.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And they go, yeah, that's all well and good,

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 but we are getting the results of your most recent drug tests.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 You tested positive for meth.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And not only that, so did your baby.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Your three month old baby tested positive for meth.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 So her baby is taken from her arms at that meeting.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 That's where we come in.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And then, I don't know, we just save them.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 We put them in a corral in the middle of a park.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Someone else can handle that side.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 We just literally take the babies.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So that unfortunately happens, right?

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 You have people trying to get their kids back.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 You have people who are struggling with drug abuse.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And it's a struggle.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 You're going to use, you're going to go a while without using,

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 you're going to use for a while.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 It's this whole thing.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 But Grace was sitting there and going, that's impossible.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 It's impossible.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I have not used meth in a long time.

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 She's just sobbing.

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Around the same time, there was this woman.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 She had already had issues with the law.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 She was getting drug tested, popped a drug test.

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Her kids get taken away from her.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Because again, this happens.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 This is pretty common.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 But that girl's mom, the grandmother to the children,

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 is like, I know for a fact my daughter has not been using drugs.

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I know for a fact she hasn't been using drugs.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 She gets the lab paperwork and she sees the doctor who signed off on it,

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 saying that she tested positive for drugs.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 She goes to the doctor's office and she says,

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I want to talk to you about this.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Like, I'm sure you hear this all the time,

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 but I can guarantee you my daughter was not using drugs.

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And the doctor, that's all he does is process drugs.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Even on his off time, he's like,

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Oh, what a long day at work.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 He brings home a bunch of urine and blood.

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And he's like, I'm not going to do drugs.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And he's testing it.

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 He goes, I test it all the time.

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Yeah, I do hear this all the time,

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 but let me take a look at that paperwork

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 and he looks at it and he's looking it over and he goes,

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 That's not my signature.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I never tested this person.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 This story really pisses me off.

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 This story absolutely pisses me off.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Brandy Murrah,

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 she was the owner of A&J lab collections.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 So what it is is people do the drug testing

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 and then they, the lab collection people collect them.

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 People collect it as per their name

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 and then they send it out to be tested by the doctors.

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 They're handling stuff for like employment.

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 They're handling stuff for probation.

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 They're handling stuff for foster system,

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 trying to get their kids back to department of health

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 and human services type of thing.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Brandy Murrah, the owner of A&J lab collections,

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 she owed money to these doctors.

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So she would gather the samples

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 and then send the samples out to the doctors,

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 but she wasn't paying her bills.

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 She was collecting her samples until she caught up on her bills.

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 But she can't catch up on her bills

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 unless all these other places are paying her

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 to send the stuff off.

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So what does she do?

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 She just takes these drug tests.

169
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 She takes these vial of blood, urine, a little bit of hair.

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 She's a foodie witch.

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 She's doing that on the site.

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 She's just saying positive for meth,

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 positive for heroin, positive for meth.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 She just starts making up positive drug results

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 and then forging doctors' names.

176
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 People's kids were taken away because of her.

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 People who...

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Listen, I make a lot of jokes

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 about people using meth and stuff like that.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 We pretty much had meth Monday going on for a while.

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 But come on.

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 You gotta...

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Someone who's a drug addict,

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 how many times were they lying to people,

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 saying, "No, no, no, mom, I'm clean.

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I'm clean this time."

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And then they OD or they...

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 "No, can I have $20?

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I'm gonna go check your cheese.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I know I'm gonna beat the high score."

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 And then they go out and they cop again.

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And that goes on and on and then eventually

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 you hit rock bottom and then you do try to recover

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 or you go to prison or something happens

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 with your kids or something like that.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 There's always with drug abuse,

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 there's always a trust issue.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Now imagine that you are actually clean.

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 After years and years and years of lying

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 and stealing, lying to yourself as well,

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 you're clean.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And you fail a drug test

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 and somebody takes your three month old baby

204
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 out of your arms.

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 That's quite sinister too,

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 to make up a baby drug test.

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 My first drug test by Fisher Price.

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Like that's pretty sinister.

209
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 She was making this stuff up,

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 ruining people's lives.

211
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 People who were really trying to make it work.

212
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 That, oh man, this story pissed me off

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 so much when I read it dude.

214
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I was like, you're really picking on

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 people who are trying their hardest

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 to get their life back.

217
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Together.

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 She's in prison for 15 years now.

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 For fraud.

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 15 years for however much money.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And the police say,

222
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 we don't know how many times she did this.

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 We estimate it's in the thousands.

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Thousands of false drug tests.

225
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And I'm wondering too how,

226
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 it's not so bad if you're applying for a job

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and you have meth in your system

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 and she says tested negative, right?

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 You go to the job, you act all,

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 all, uh, totally freaking out all the time.

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Your PBheromins personal assistant,

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 he's like, oh, I like your moves.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 That's fine.

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I mean, it could be troublesome if you're the boss

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 and you hired that guy.

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 But to struggle so long with addiction

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 and be clean and people still kind of like

238
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 not believing you because you lied so often

239
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 and then having science tell you,

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 oh, you're lying.

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 The story really made me mad.

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Really, really made me mad.

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 So let's take Grace's baby out of the pin

244
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 that we have built in the park

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 and give Grace her baby.

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Could you imagine that?

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Listen to this quote that Grace had after it happened.

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Quote, it was terrible.

249
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 I felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 because I knew I was doing right with this one.

251
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I knew I was doing right.

252
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 (exhales)

253
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Jacked up, dude.

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 The story really, really, really makes me mad.

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Alexander, let's go ahead and leave behind Brandi Marash.

256
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 She has on a little jail suit.

257
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 She's looking out between bars.

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I don't have to say allegedly

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 because she's already been sentenced.

260
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Call in that.

261
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Carbinder caboose.

262
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 We're hopping on the rails.

263
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 We're taking a train trip out to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 (imitates train train)

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 I know you wanted to pull the whistle.

266
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Alexander, so go ahead.

267
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Everyone wants to pull the whistle.

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Everyone gets a chance.

269
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 The whole time we're going there, we're all deaf by the time we get there.

270
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 We are now in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

271
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 We are at Abby Lee Dance Company.

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And so there's Abby Lee.

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 You're like, I still don't know where we're at.

274
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Who's that?

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 The Dance Moms.

276
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 It's the show Dance Moms.

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It's that reality show.

278
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 It's exactly what it sounds like.

279
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 It's a bunch of little girls trying to hone their craft.

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And their moms who are, I have a weird attraction to the moms.

281
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 I should say right now, I've watched more than a few episodes of this show.

282
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I have a weird attraction to the moms because I like people who are super driven.

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And they're all wealthy, which is another thing I'm attracted to.

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 So you have them and they just sit there and they mock each other constantly.

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And then they talk trash about other people's kids.

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Not so much.

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 You're like, what's happening this afternoon with paranormal conspiracy and true crime?

288
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 I'll get to that.

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 You're like, this isn't Dead Ravre Recommendant.

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And I was like, no, no, no, no, no.

291
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I don't watch as much as I used to because I don't have a lot of time,

292
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 but I do enjoy reality television set.

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I enjoy competitive reality television and I enjoy reality television.

294
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 It is a subculture that I'm not a part of.

295
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Like I was watching that, my big fat gypsy wedding.

296
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 That's not even a show.

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 It was about a bunch of gypsies running around Britain, getting married.

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 They were like all living in a trailer park and you had to have subtitles on

299
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 because you couldn't understand what anyone was saying.

300
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 But anyway, so I watched non-sense like that.

301
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I used to watch it all the time.

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 So I've seen more than a few episodes of Dance Moms.

303
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Abby Lee is basically yelling at kids.

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 The whole show is yelling at kids.

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 It's actually quite terrible.

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 The kids are crying the whole time.

307
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 But again, this is not a Dead Ravre Recommendant.

308
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 You want to see kids crying?

309
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Watch Dance Moms 8 p.m. on A&E or TLC or whatever.

310
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 The reason why we're talking about this,

311
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I have a legitimate reason why we're talking about this.

312
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 We're sitting in Abby Lee's dance studio.

313
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 There's a bunch of hot moms sitting next to us.

314
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And there's a bunch of like kids dancing and stuff like that.

315
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And then so we're watching that, but seeing the corner,

316
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 we see like this guy, he's like this dude just standing there in the corner.

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And he's like, he has a little earpiece in him.

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And then he's like, they're doing the dance.

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 They're doing the dance you like, boss.

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 They're really cool.

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And the technical one where they have to twirl around on their toes.

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Yeah, they're doing it really good.

323
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 There's a guy with an earpiece and he goes, the dance has commenced.

324
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Sir, we can start with plan one.

325
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 This is you.

326
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 I'm making it so convoluted.

327
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Here it is.

328
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Let me just tell you what the conspiracy there is.

329
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 I don't know why I built up this whole mythology.

330
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 This Dance Moms universe.

331
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Here's the conspiracy theory.

332
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 There's this person on Reddit named Gator Quake,

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 who put together this timeline.

334
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 This is going to blow your mind, guys.

335
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 January 5th, 2016, season six, episode one.

336
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 I actually had to watch this because I had to verify she wasn't just making this stuff up.

337
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 But season six, episode one, the girls put on a performance.

338
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 It's all interpretive dance, which is my least favorite kind of dance.

339
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 There's a girl in a bubble and the other dancers are wearing face masks

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 and they're pushing the bubble around.

341
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And she's like, "Ugh!"

342
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And then the dance, I watched the whole routine because again, I was like,

343
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 "That's the least interesting part of the show, honestly."

344
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 We'd rather see the Dance Moms.

345
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 They're doing the dance and then she's like getting pushed around and stuff like that.

346
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And then she dies in the bubble.

347
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Not in real life.

348
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It was part of the interpretive dance.

349
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 I got to watch that show.

350
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 No, that doesn't happen.

351
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 January 17th, 2017, season seven, episode eight.

352
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 One girl is not there.

353
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 She doesn't show up to practice and again, it's super competitive dancing.

354
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 She's at the ER with chest pains and the dance teacher goes, "Mmm-mm, that's not good.

355
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I heard a virus is going around."

356
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 January 24th, 2017, season seven, episode nine.

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I tried looking for this clip on YouTube because it sounds hilarious.

358
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And I found it, but it wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be.

359
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 A girl starts throwing up and she throws up into a garbage can.

360
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So, you know, it's not super funny.

361
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 You don't actually see like chicken bones coming out of her mouth.

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 She's throwing up and the other moms are like, "Get her out of here, dude."

363
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Like if she's throwing up, she's going to get all these other kids sick and the girls are like,

364
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 "Oh, the show, dude, maybe I should, did Rev recommend it."

365
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Because the show is hilarious.

366
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 The kids are like between the ages of like nine and 16, 17.

367
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 There's this little 11, 10 year old girl.

368
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 She's like, "I don't feel so well, mom."

369
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 She's throwing up in this garbage can.

370
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 The other moms are like, "Get her out of here.

371
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 She's going to get all these other kids sick.

372
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 We're in this enclosed environment."

373
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And the girl's mom is like, "Oh, no, no, no, she's okay.

374
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 She'll just practice over here."

375
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And then she takes a giant garbage can, sits it down next to her daughter and goes keep dancing.

376
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 If you need to throw up, just throw up in the...

377
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 [laughs]

378
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I can't imagine a parent being so callous.

379
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Let her go home, dude.

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 She's vomiting.

381
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Like if someone has a bad tummy ache, yeah, whatever, do a couple spin a right turn.

382
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Don't do that.

383
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But you don't mean like work it out.

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 They just put a garbage can next to her and go, "Okay, five, six, seven."

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 [laughs]

386
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 It's so awful, such an awful show.

387
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 But anyways, the point is, is that Gator Quake on Reddit posted this.

388
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 DanceMoms predictive programming.

389
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 The show DanceMoms was preparing the world for COVID.

390
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 With these three episodes, it was tuning into people's brains.

391
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 You see, the first one, her and the bubble and everyone with masks.

392
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 The show, the containment, the isolation that the world is coming to.

393
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Second one, Abby Lee goes, "There's a virus going around because no one ever says that, ever."

394
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Unless they're predictive programming for a pandemic.

395
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 No one's ever go, "Yeah, I heard the flu's going around."

396
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 If you said that, you're part of the problem.

397
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And then Gator Quake goes on to say, "Oh, that scene where the girls are telling her to leave,

398
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 the last one with the girls throwing up, by the way, I'd be telling her to leave, too."

399
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 "Take your daughter home."

400
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 They're saying, "See, that showed the anger people are going to have at people who don't self-isolate."

401
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 This is my thing about predictive programming.

402
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 There are so many, thousands of hours of content cranked out a day that you are going to have matches.

403
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 That's always been one of my big arguments against predictive programming.

404
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Think about all the movies that are churned out, all the television shows, all the songs that are churned out.

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 So when you have a rap song from two years ago and he's like, "Yo, coronavirus gonna get ya."

406
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 People go, "Oh, predictive programming. This underground rapper."

407
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It's a pretty good song. I'll put it in the show notes.

408
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 He really did say that.

409
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 This underground rapper said this, predictive programming.

410
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 How many hundreds and thousands of hours, hundreds of thousands of hours of content come out in the past two years all over the world?

411
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 You're going to get some hits.

412
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 That's always been my thing about predictive programming.

413
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 So yeah, you're going to get some matches.

414
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 You pump out, what is that, seven seasons of dance moms.

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And you pull out three episodes where people are sick.

416
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Then yes, you're right.

417
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 People get sick sometimes on television.

418
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And there's a pandemic going on. You're right.

419
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 But how many other hundreds of hours of television didn't have that stuff?

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 So that's always my thing with predictive programming.

421
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I just found this one super interesting because it involved a bizarre show.

422
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 A lot of times they involve things that are more popular like the Simpsons.

423
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I guess dance moms is pretty popular.

424
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Her argument was that this show was specifically to get stay at home moms ready for COVID.

425
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 But if they're stay at home moms, they're already staying at home.

426
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 So they already stay at home and COVID is about getting people to stay at home.

427
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So basically they'd be like, "Oh no. Normally I sit on the couch for 10 hours a day.

428
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And now I got to sit on the couch for 12 hours a day.

429
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Oh, whoa, it's me. Bring the wine."

430
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 So anyways, you can always find predictive programming and a bunch of stuff.

431
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 But Alexander, get ready to call in that carpenter copter.

432
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 We are leaving behind Abby Lee's dance studio and we are headed out to China.

433
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 We're flying out there, got a little tap shoes.

434
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I'm doing a little tap dance the whole way.

435
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 You're like, "Oh my God, this is so awful.

436
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I'm trying to impress those dance moms."

437
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, as you guys take a quick vote whether or not to push me out of the carpenter copter,

438
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 luckily you guys vote not to.

439
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 We land at the Great Wall of China.

440
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 [Demonic Chatter]

441
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 This is actually a recommendation via Levi on Facebook.

442
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 So thank you, Levi. I really, really appreciate it.

443
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I thought it was an interesting story.

444
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It's a little baby conspiracy.

445
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 This one is just starting off.

446
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 I wanted to explore it very early with you and we can see where this goes.

447
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Will it sprout like a mighty tree?

448
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Or just not?

449
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Just be a seed in the ground people forget about.

450
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 A long, long time ago, I didn't write it in my notes.

451
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 But a long time ago, it was old wind brushing over China, which I didn't put in my notes.

452
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 I didn't write in my notes where the wall was either.

453
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 You can tell this is a very well-prepared episode.

454
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 The dudes, the Mongols kept going into China and pushing over stuff.

455
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 They're like, "Ah, they run up to the emperor, they keep knocking him over and then leave."

456
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 He's like, "That's it, I'm tired of getting toppled over every time the Mongols show up.

457
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Let's build a big old wall."

458
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 So they build this giant wall.

459
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 They call it the Great Wall of China.

460
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 I don't know, did they call it the Great Wall of China?

461
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 We don't call it the Statue of Liberty of the United States.

462
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 They just say the Great Wall, or do they have a cooler name like the Barrier from Beyond or something like that?

463
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Who knows?

464
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I'm sure I can look it up, but again, poorly said of episode.

465
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 There's a Great Wall all over this place in China.

466
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It's like a supermarket and it goes everywhere.

467
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And it kept out the Mongols, kept out a bunch of raiders.

468
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 It's actually the largest man-made structure on earth.

469
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I'm actually surprised there's not more ancient alien stuff.

470
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 I have a theory of why.

471
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Because China had good written records, so we know how it was built.

472
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 All that ancient alien stuff, they go, "Well, there's no written record, so we're just going to make stuff up pretty much."

473
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 But for this one, I've never heard that aliens built the Great Wall of China.

474
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Even though it's the largest man-made structure in the world, I'm surprised there's no story.

475
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 There might be out there, I've just never really looked into it.

476
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 But anyways, so they have the Great Wall of China and it kept the Mongol hordes out.

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 No one's going to ride all the way around the wall.

478
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 You don't even know at what point you're going to like, the wall's going to end.

479
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 So you just give up.

480
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 You're like, "We'll go the other way. We'll raid the Middle East or something like that."

481
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Because that's much easier than just climbing a wall.

482
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 On June 26, 2020, on the export, there is a post that talks about Klandia.

483
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And what it is, is you had a Mongol horde show up to the wall and they're like, "Oh, great.

484
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 We heard people talk about this wall. We saw people coming back."

485
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 They're like, "Hey, how is it pushing over the Emperor of China?"

486
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 They're like, "Couldn't get there. There is a wall."

487
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 "What? There is that big of a wall?"

488
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 They're like, "Yeah, you don't waste your time. We're headed out to Turkey."

489
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 They get there, they get to the wall and they're like, "Oh, this sucks.

490
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I probably should have listened to my fellow countrymen."

491
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 But instead of leaving, they say, "You know, the old Mongol saying, 'Home is where the heart is,'

492
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 what if we live in the wall?"

493
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 [laughs]

494
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 What are you talking about?

495
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 He goes, "No, no, no. Hear me out. Hear me out."

496
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 We can still do raiding parties.

497
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 They're still like people we can attack on this side of the wall.

498
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And maybe if, you know, since we're already digging into the wall anyways,

499
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 maybe we could just pop out the other side.

500
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 But my point is that why would we scale the wall or dig through the wall,

501
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 attack a bunch of people and then have to go back through the wall to get home?

502
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And then make our home inside the wall itself.

503
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And everyone's kind of thinking about it and they go, "Let's give it a shot."

504
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 So they begin moving bricks around.

505
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Did they have guards on the wall?

506
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Like, what's the point of having a giant wall because other people like could climb up it and stuff like that

507
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 or just bring a giant ladder next time?

508
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Like, what's the point of having a wall unless you have guards on it,

509
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 but the wall's so big you would need a ton of guards or guys with really good eyesight?

510
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 You know, one of the two, either a thousand people or just a hundred who can see well.

511
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I'm sure they had a guard, right?

512
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Maybe.

513
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Probably should have researched that.

514
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Anyways, the point is that apparently a group of Mongols built a hole in the wall

515
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 and then created a series of tunnels underneath and inside the Great Wall of China itself.

516
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And at first it was just like they'd pop out every so often with their horses.

517
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 They were like, "What are you doing?"

518
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 They were like, "I'm just going to get out of here."

519
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And then they were like, "I'm just going to get out of here."

520
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And then they were like, "I'm just going to get out of here."

521
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And then they were like, "I'm just going to get out of here."

522
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And then they were like, "I'm just going to get out of here."

523
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And then they were like, "I'm just going to get out of here."

524
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000

529

530

620
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And then they were like, "I'm just going to get out of here."

621
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Because you don't know you're supposed to be afraid of them because you don't even know they exist.

622
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 It's possible that this person is onto something, that there is a hidden society inside China.

623
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 It's a funny visual, but that there's a hidden civilization inside the Great Wall of China.

624
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 So it's possible that this poster, whoever he is, is actually onto something.

625
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 He's actually trying to let people know about Calandia.

626
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And they may not even know how dire the circumstances actually are.

627
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 This may be a local legend they heard while they were teaching over in China.

628
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 But it actually may be a clue to who is pulling the strings around the world.

629
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Now I've always said, I don't think there's one monolithic group that is controlling the world.

630
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 I think there are hundreds of separate groups trying to control the world.

631
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I think there are hundreds of separate groups that are fighting amongst each other.

632
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Sometimes they make alliances for short-term gain.

633
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 But they're constantly pushing and pulling at world politics, at society, at culture, entertainment.

634
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 This is constantly going on.

635
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 But it's these groups that you don't even know exist that are the most dangerous.

636
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Because if you don't know they exist, you can't prepare to fight them.

637
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And a group that started off as savage raiders, raping and pillaging their way across China.

638
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 If they're now in the boardrooms, if they're now in the halls of power, that savagery is still there.

639
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 That take-all energy is still there.

640
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 You may not be able to find their nation on a map.

641
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 You might not ever know how to speak their language.

642
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 You may never even know they exist.

643
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 But they know you exist.

644
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 They can't wait until they take over the world.

645
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 The silent masters vying to conquer everything and rule the planet from within side the Great Wall of China.
