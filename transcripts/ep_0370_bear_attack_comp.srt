00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 Tonight's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio contains graphic content and may not be suitable for

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,960
 all listeners.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,920
 Discretion is advised.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:18,800
 The year is 1915, the place is Japan, it is a cold November morning.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,200
 When a bear is awoken, months early from the end of hibernation.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:33,400
 His bear steps out of its cave and sees a world covered in snow, a world without food

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,440
 for him to eat.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,640
 So he keeps marching through the forest, looking for something, anything to satiate

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,760
 his hunger.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,880
 And that's when he sees a small village.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:55,440
 The bear watches the humans, learns their routine, and then he does what he does best.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:07,640
 He kills and consumes today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,120
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,320
 Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,560
 You know, I want to be clear that disclaimer we have at the beginning is not a joke, this

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
 actually might be the most graphic episode we've had of Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,960
 I usually don't do a lot of the gory details, but this one, I don't feel it's gratuitous,

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,920
 I feel like it shows what's going on in this story, so I'm not going to pull any punches

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,800
 with this episode, just letting you guys know.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,160
 It is the Friday episode, so I mean, if I don't want it to ruin your weekend, I think

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,760
 this is a great story that we'll analyze it a little bit at the end, but I kind of,

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,120
 and this is the only thing we're doing today too, because I just kind of want to let this

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,160
 story marinate, you know, I think it's a really interesting story.

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,960
 We'll do a little analysis at the end.

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,240
 First off, I really got to thank Scary Man Esquire, he's the one who recommended this

27
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
 one to me.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,120
 He actually sent me the one about the talking bear we did a couple episodes ago.

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,880
 Now he sent me this one, never heard of this story before, completely fascinating, I love

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,440
 it, so thank you Scary Man.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,760
 This episode also, I want to mention our newest Patreon, we have Lori Snyder, thank you so

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,680
 much for supporting the show, it really, really means a lot.

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,240
 I actually messaged her and said, "Hey, you don't have a problem with bears, do you?"

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,000
 Because this episode is, it's not just about a bear, like I don't want to hype it up too

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,720
 much, but this episode's real, real dark, so if you want to have like a happy fun, sunshine

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,560
 filled weekend, maybe save this one, put it aside, listen to it on Monday.

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,640
 But for everyone else, let us, and I want to say this too, because I think that there

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,840
 are going to be people who are fans of this, fans, but there are going to be people who,

39
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,880
 and they're like holding up little penance and say bear on them.

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,760
 There's going to be people who normally don't listen to the show, this is probably going

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,720
 to be an episode that attracts people.

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,800
 I want to say to you guys, I mispronounce everything, and this story takes place in

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
 Japan, so if you're a huge fan of this event, again, fans are not the right word, there

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,200
 is no fan of this event, but if you're like, "Oh yes dude, some other guys doing a story

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,560
 on this, let me start you off with this one."

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,800
 We're going to the village, Sanky Betsu in Japan, and again with Japan they're going

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,320
 to have a lot of weird geographical things like Britain does, like counties.

48
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,960
 So technically it's Sanky Betsu Rokun Sawa in Japan, so we're just going to call it

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,600
 the village from here on out.

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,200
 And there's all the new listeners, there's all the listeners who tuned in just to hear

51
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,800
 about this bear story, but if you stuck around and you can deal with my mispronunciations,

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,040
 hopefully the passion can pull you through.

53
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,680
 So thank you, Scary Man Esquire, thank you, Laurie, let's go ahead and get started.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,640
 The year is 1915, the month is November and we're in Japan, we're in Sanky Betsu, Japan.

55
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,600
 There's a small village here, a little community of people.

56
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,360
 Now I had a look at some photos doing this story, and to give you an idea of this type

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,920
 of village, it's what you would think of as a village, it's not like wooden houses, they're

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,320
 like thatched huts.

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:13,160
 It's 1915, but they're still like, it's very, very rural area, so they're, just imagine

60
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,000
 this story taking place in, you're in the second worst three little pigs house.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,200
 That's where all of these actions are going to take place.

62
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,160
 When I was imagining it, I was imagining it like a shack from, you know, like country

63
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,520
 western days in America, uh-uh.

64
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,780
 This is not the, that would be 100% better than where we're going.

65
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,640
 So as we go through this story, it's all thatched huts, because they've made recreation

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
 since.

67
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,760
 1915, a bear is awoken early from hibernation.

68
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,560
 They don't really know what caused the bear, this story is 100% true by the way, they don't

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,920
 know what caused the bear to wake up early, but the best guess is that that's what causes

70
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
 bear to go nuts.

71
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,560
 There is another theory that we'll talk about later, but this bear we're going to be talking

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:06,420
 about is 8 feet, 8 inches tall, 837 pounds, a massive creature, massive, massive creature,

73
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,420
 needs food.

74
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,540
 It woke up, it's winter time, there's nothing to eat, it crawls through the forest, it comes

75
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,900
 across the village, and it sees a little farm on the outskirts of the village.

76
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,580
 This farm belongs to the Iquita family, and they have a bunch of corn they've harvested.

77
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:30,160
 It's just laying out, and so this bear is like walking, walking around, it's tiptoeing,

78
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,000
 it's all soup, I gotta get all the jokes in now guys, I gotta get all the jokes in now,

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,360
 it's tiptoeing, it hides behind a tiny tree, and then it's eating corn, which is interesting

80
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,840
 because it had to be eating the whole cob, I don't think the bear is just eating off

81
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 the kernels, right?

82
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,300
 Can you bite, I know I can't, but is there any nutritional value in the corn cob itself?

83
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,900
 So the Iquita family horse sees this bear eating corn, horse freaks out, that alerts

84
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,540
 the family and they run out and they see this bear just chilling there, yogi style, straight

85
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,100
 up eating some corn.

86
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:19,100
 The bear runs away, the bear gets scared, the bear takes off, but a few days later,

87
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,440
 the bear comes walking back and they're like, damn it, we've gotta protect our corn, it

88
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,000
 is winter, there's not a safe way nearby, this isn't food for us.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,640
 Bear comes back, wants to chow down on some more delicious corn, and they're thinking

90
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,400
 one, we don't want them eating our corn, two, they don't want them hurting our horse, because

91
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,520
 we need that as well, let's just kill the bear, right?

92
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,200
 Load up their gun, shoot the bear, hit the bear, he runs away, and they track him for

93
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,580
 a bit and then they say, you know what, he's not gonna come back, we shot him, he's been

94
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,420
 wounded, he's now afraid of humans, he probably didn't know, he probably woke up, he was

95
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,660
 groggy, he was hungry, he doesn't know what we are, we shoot it, now it thinks we're some

96
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,100
 magical race that can put metal from 500 yards away inside of him, he's gonna leave.

97
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,220
 So bear leaves.

98
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,820
 So all that happened about two weeks into November, middle of November.

99
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:21,840
 December 9th, 1950, 10.30 AM, the Ota family has a little shack, the husband's away working,

100
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,200
 the wife is preparing some food, and she's actually babysitting a neighbor's baby.

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:37,920
 Father comes home from work, pushes the door open, the floor is thick with blood.

102
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:46,460
 Imagine being in that situation, I mean he's, I remember once my car got stolen and I went

103
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,140
 into shock and I checked my pockets, I thought maybe I put my car in my pockets.

104
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,500
 Reality, and that's minor obviously, and I thought maybe I left my car in my apartment,

105
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,380
 I went upstairs and looked in my apartment, I'm like what, no my car's not big, you go

106
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,380
 into shock, I can't imagine walking into a room full of blood, anyone's blood, let alone

107
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,520
 people I know is blood.

108
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,120
 So you can imagine he was in absolute complete shock.

109
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,560
 Of course screaming, he's freaking out, other people come to this house and they make a

110
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,120
 few discoveries.

111
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:31,000
 One, the child she's babysitting, a toddler, had its head bitten clean off.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,740
 The wife is gone, completely gone.

113
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,460
 People start looking through the house, they notice that the way the firewood is strewn

114
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,580
 about, they go, it looks like she tried fighting the bear off.

115
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,500
 She's picking up pieces of wood, throwing them, swinging them at the bear, but look,

116
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:00,940
 look here on the ground, looks like her hand prints being dragged, husband's like no, no,

117
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:08,120
 no, they go out the back door and they see a bloody trail through the snow of a body

118
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,360
 getting dragged into the forest.

119
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,440
 December 10th, villagers get ready, they're getting their rifles, can you imagine actually

120
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,520
 sleeping that night, could you imagine being like we're gonna go hunt it, because this

121
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,120
 is the thing, one they needed to kill the bear, two they needed to get the wife's body

122
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
 back, they wanted to get her body back, and they're gonna kill the bear, they're gonna

123
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,220
 get the body back, but we'll do it tomorrow.

124
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,340
 I can't imagine sleeping that night in a thatched hut, but anyways, they go listen, we're

125
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,020
 gonna load up, we're gonna go out there, we're gonna go shoot this bear in the face, bring

126
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,620
 back the body of the wife and the bear probably, and they're not just gonna leave the bear

127
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,580
 out there, but they're gonna do both.

128
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,060
 And while they are getting, while they're like figuring out this plan and figuring out

129
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,980
 what to do, the bear just walks back into the village, and they're like dude, start shooting

130
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:07,720
 into the bear, they shoot him, he gets hit one time, and runs away.

131
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,120
 So then he takes off, and then they go, and they go into the forest and they're looking,

132
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:22,520
 they follow that blood trail, and they find that dude's wife, they find her head, and

133
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,200
 they find her legs.

134
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,780
 Everything else has been eaten, and the bear had actually packed the body in snow to preserve

135
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,860
 it and to hide it from predators.

136
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:41,060
 They pick up the head, and pick up the legs, take it back into the village.

137
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:49,540
 Now they know for sure that this bear has eaten, like it's one thing, it bit the, this

138
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,920
 is so gross, but it bit the kid's head off, and it attacked her, and you could go, it's

139
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,360
 attacking people.

140
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,700
 But when it took time to actually like eat out the person, like it took it and prepared

141
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,740
 it like a food source and then packed it and all that stuff, they go, this isn't just,

142
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,920
 this bear's not just killing people, this bear is eating people.

143
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,500
 And now that this bear has a taste for human flesh, it's going to come back.

144
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,120
 I think that's a weird thing.

145
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,400
 Do we taste so delicious, 'cause you always hear that, maybe it's just in movies, but

146
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,220
 do we taste so delicious, that when if a predator eats us, they want more of us?

147
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,960
 Like I can't imagine humans taste that good.

148
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,780
 But apparently we taste delicious.

149
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,780
 If an animal eats you, or eats anyone, it wants to eat more people.

150
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:40,140
 But like if a bear ate a duck, would it then go out of its way to eat more ducks?

151
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,060
 Like I don't really know how that works.

152
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,860
 But anyways, these guys know more than I do.

153
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,300
 They live in 1915 rural Japan.

154
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,160
 They're on the edge of a forest full of bears, I think they know.

155
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,400
 So they go, we know the bear's going to come back.

156
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,560
 We need reinforcements.

157
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,760
 We need reinforcements.

158
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,800
 First off, we're going to get all the men in the village and we're going to set up a

159
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,320
 little guard.

160
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,680
 We're going to do that and we're going to get a hunting team and all this up.

161
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,320
 But we need two people to go out to the biggest town, talk to the province leaders, get some

162
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
 backup.

163
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:18,420
 People who are picked are Miyoko, Yasutaro, and Sayato Ishigoro.

164
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,220
 And they had two wives at the village still.

165
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:30,240
 You had Miyako Yeo, and then you had Saito Taki, who was actually pregnant with Saito's

166
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
 child.

167
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,800
 So Yasutaro and Ishigoro say goodbye to their wives and say, "We'll be right back."

168
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,360
 So we do have to go and we have to deliver this message.

169
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,500
 We'll be right back with reinforcements.

170
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,740
 We have to kill this bear.

171
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,200
 Wives are like, "Don't be long.

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,340
 Don't, you know, we're afraid."

173
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,320
 There's a big bear out there and you're leaving us in a house of- you're leaving us in a

174
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
 house that's made of dead grass, basically.

175
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,320
 And the two husbands look at each other and they're like, "Hey, hey, hey.

176
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,660
 Don't criticize the architectural skills right now, okay?

177
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,120
 We got bigger things in our mind.

178
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,880
 Plus, look at all these guards.

179
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,360
 We're leaving these guards with you.

180
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 Because here's the plan.

181
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,480
 We're going to take all the women and children and put them in our house, which was the Miyoko

182
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
 household."

183
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
 I think that's how you pronounce it.

184
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
 I'm sorry, guys.

185
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,760
 We're going to take all the women and children and put it in this house.

186
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,040
 We're going to surround it with guards.

187
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,800
 They're going to have hunters go into the woods and find this bear and kill it.

188
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
 So you don't have to worry about anything.

189
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,280
 And the wives are like, "Yeah, that's a pretty good idea.

190
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,040
 We're more protected than the hunters are.

191
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,320
 And we're even more protected than our husbands are who have to travel through the wilderness

192
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
 to get to town."

193
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
 So this is still December 10th.

194
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
 This is still just the day they went out.

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,200
 This is the day after the first attack.

196
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
 And this has been a very eventful day.

197
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 They've gone out.

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,800
 They chased the bear.

199
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
 They found the body.

200
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,320
 They've come up with this plan.

201
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,540
 They're going to have all these guardsmen surround this house.

202
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,800
 They're going to go get reinforcements.

203
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,320
 So when the two husbands do go to the nearest town, they actually are able to get reinforcements.

204
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
 The local government says, "We're going.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 That sounds terrible.

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Sorry for your loss.

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
 We're going to send a group of people.

208
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,080
 As we come with you two, we're probably going to recruit some locals from other villages

209
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
 as well.

210
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
 And the two husbands are like, "That's a great idea.

211
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,320
 We should have thought about coming this way.

212
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,640
 Guys like that's why I'm governor.

213
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
 We're going to go.

214
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,960
 We're going to get all these dudes together.

215
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,560
 We're also going to assemble a six-man sniper team.

216
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,800
 So we're going to walk in with like 60-plus dudes, six snipers.

217
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,120
 It's going to be legit.

218
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,080
 But you guys might also want to talk to this other guy in town.

219
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,960
 His name's Yamamoto Haikichi.

220
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,040
 You might want to go talk to him.

221
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
 They go, "Why?"

222
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,880
 Well, Yamamoto, he is a famed bear hunter.

223
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,080
 He's an expert bear hunter.

224
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
 That's what he does.

225
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,040
 But he's fallen on a bit harsh times lately.

226
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,800
 You might want to go check him out.

227
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,440
 The two dudes track him down, track down the hunter, go to his house.

228
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,920
 And he's sitting there drinking.

229
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,000
 And they're like, "Oh, this isn't good.

230
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,400
 This isn't what we expected, right?

231
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
 The guy's drinking."

232
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,680
 And they're like, "Hey, mind if we come in?"

233
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,080
 And he's like, "It's a thatched house.

234
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
 I don't have a choice.

235
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
 You can just walk through the wall."

236
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,680
 And they're like, "Okay."

237
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,920
 So they open the door, they're polite.

238
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
 And they sit down, they're like, "Hey, so we're having this problem.

239
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,800
 There's this bear, it ate a woman and bit the head off a kid.

240
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,240
 Yamamoto is just shooting back.

241
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,480
 Oops, taking shots.

242
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,080
 I don't know if he was drinking the whole time, but he is an alcoholic.

243
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,680
 So let's just go bonkers with this globe.

244
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,440
 He has an IV of bourbon going right into his arm.

245
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,680
 They go, "Yeah, we hear you're the best bear hunter in town."

246
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,520
 And he's like, "I'm the best bear hunter ever."

247
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,720
 And that's, those are the old days.

248
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,640
 I don't bear hunt anymore.

249
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
 Takes another shot.

250
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,320
 And they're like, "Dude, this is dangerous how much you're drinking."

251
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,960
 And he's like, "Shut up!

252
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,080
 I don't bear hunt anymore.

253
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,240
 If you want someone to kill your bear, I am the man.

254
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,440
 But I just don't do it anymore."

255
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,800
 So you guys are like, "Come on, man.

256
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 You gotta help us out."

257
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,160
 He goes, "With what?"

258
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,880
 I pond my rifle to buy more liquor.

259
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,720
 I'm useless to you.

260
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,160
 Go find somebody else."

261
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
 Two men get up.

262
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
 He starts to leave.

263
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,880
 Yamamoto says, "Hold on.

264
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,280
 The bear you're looking for, he's not just awake early from hibernation.

265
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,160
 You see, I hunted that bear before."

266
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
 Two men look at each other.

267
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,240
 They're like, "What in the world is going on?

268
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
 Is this guy drunk?"

269
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,360
 And he's like, "Yamamoto stands up unsteadily.

270
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,120
 The bear's name is Kessagaki.

271
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,000
 And before he came to your village, he already killed three women.

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I couldn't catch him then.

273
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,200
 Can't catch him now."

274
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,080
 Especially looks at his little cup of alcohol.

275
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
 Especially now.

276
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
 Look.

277
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,960
 "Good luck.

278
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,120
 You'll need it."

279
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,920
 Shows the two men out.

280
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,560
 Kessagaki in English means the diagonal slash from the shoulder.

281
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,080
 Basically, just the way it kills people.

282
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,360
 The telltale marks of just the hand coming down so rapidly, so strong, just ripping flesh

283
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
 open.

284
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,680
 "It had eaten three."

285
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,440
 This was a man-eater before this whole event happened.

286
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,400
 The fact that it woke up early from hibernation is what made these events possible because

287
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,480
 if it slept through, it wouldn't have had to do this.

288
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,560
 But it would eat people at the drop of a hat.

289
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,880
 It had already tasted human blood.

290
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,480
 And you have to wonder how many other people, like wanderers or travelers, threw that neck

291
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,040
 of the woods that simply disappeared, that weren't in a hut that a husband came home

292
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:40,560
 to, that simply were killed and devoured in the middle of spring by Kessagaki.

293
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,880
 It's 8pm at the village.

294
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,920
 It's still December 10th.

295
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,680
 And while the husbands are having that conversation, hunters are out in the woods looking for the

296
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,520
 bear.

297
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,000
 Building their rifles up.

298
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,080
 Looking for anything that's moving.

299
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,520
 Take a shot at something in the woods.

300
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,840
 A large moving figure rapidly disappearing into the darkness.

301
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,500
 The gunshots continue and the guards surrounding the house hear it.

302
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,000
 They figure the bear is cornered.

303
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,160
 It is time to act.

304
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,040
 The guards leave one man to guard the hut full of women and children.

305
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,120
 And the rest of them run towards the forest.

306
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
 It's 8pm.

307
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,040
 We're at the hut containing all the women and children.

308
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,400
 Yeyo is there with her four children.

309
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:45,520
 Her youngest one is strapped to her back in a little bamboo-ska thing, a little baby-carrier.

310
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,360
 And she's preparing some food.

311
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,840
 There's a big pot of boiling water over a fire.

312
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,440
 She's slowly stirring it, preparing food for the women and children.

313
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,800
 A late meal to keep them calm.

314
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,520
 An oil lamp sits in the corner of the room as well.

315
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,560
 The only light source is available.

316
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:16,600
 So that means there's a glow and a flicker as everyone sits worried in this hut.

317
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,160
 They hear the gunshots.

318
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
 Yeyo is just stirring her pot.

319
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:39,720
 And then she hears a rumble outside the house.

320
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:50,160
 And as she right when she turns to look out the window to see what it is, the bear smashes

321
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
 into the house.

322
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,280
 It jumps through the window and comes inside.

323
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:08,040
 8 feet, 8 inches tall, 837 pounds, and a house full of women and children.

324
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,920
 The bear lifts its arm up and slashes Yeyo across the chest.

325
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:20,120
 Yeyo in a panic starts to back up, but one of her children is holding onto her legs.

326
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,160
 So she begins to trip.

327
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:29,760
 And while trying to stop herself from falling, she turns her back to the bear, exposing the

328
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,640
 baby strapped to her back.

329
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,840
 The bear bites into the child and begins to pull Yeyo back.

330
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,320
 At this point, the one guard remaining who's in the house goes for the door and the bear

331
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,520
 drops its attack against the woman and the child and begins attacking the man.

332
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,760
 When this is happening, someone panics and their hand hits the oil lamp.

333
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320
 Putting out the wick, it could have been worse.

334
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,940
 The oil could have spread, a fire could have ignited in this room with this bear.

335
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,440
 It simply put out the light, but at the same time, someone else bumped into the boiling

336
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,440
 pot of water hanging over the fire, pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

337
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:19,780
 pot of water hanging over the fire, extinguishing the fire and plunging the room into pitch

338
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,500
 blackness.

339
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,940
 You can see nothing.

340
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:36,620
 You can just hear the screaming, the moans, and the 800 pound bear coming after you.

341
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:45,040
 Claws and teeth cut a swath through the women and children of this village.

342
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:53,400
 Take, whose husband is off trying to recruit bear hunters, is there with her unborn baby

343
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,560
 inside of her.

344
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,400
 Survivors of this event said, "They heard the bear come closer."

345
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,200
 And Take beg the bear.

346
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,620
 Leave my belly alone.

347
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,020
 Leave my belly alone.

348
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,640
 Don't hurt my baby.

349
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,940
 You can take my head, but don't hurt my baby.

350
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,340
 Don't hurt.

351
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:25,740
 And then silence as her body slumped to the ground in the pitch dark room.

352
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:33,300
 At some point during this, Yeo does escape the house and begins running towards the gunshots.

353
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,480
 And around this time, the guardsmen and the hunters realize they had lost track of the

354
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,360
 bear and that it probably is back in the village.

355
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:49,120
 Yeo badly, badly wounded, child on her back, barely clinging to life.

356
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,400
 She tells the guardsmen what happened.

357
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,680
 It attacked the house.

358
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,320
 The guardsmen surround the house and their first idea is to set the house on fire, to

359
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,720
 burn it to the ground, to make sure that the bear is killed, but Yeo pleads with them,

360
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
 please don't please.

361
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,860
 There may be people in there that are still alive.

362
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,100
 We can't burn them down.

363
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,280
 So they come up with another plan.

364
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,380
 Half of us go to the back of the house, half of us stay at the front of the house.

365
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:18,940
 Now while they're coming up with these plans by the way, they hear a bear killing people

366
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,940
 in there.

367
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:27,540
 You hear people moaning, you hear people screaming, and just the bear is still going to town

368
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,300
 on these people.

369
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,800
 So they gotta come up with a plan really, really fast.

370
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,400
 They know it's still in there and they know it's killing people right now.

371
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,560
 Half of you guys go to the back, half of us stay at the front.

372
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,120
 You bang on the doors in the back.

373
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,520
 It'll make the bear scared, it'll come out the front door, we shoot it, game over.

374
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,620
 So you had half of the guards go to the back and they start bam, bam, bam, bam, banging

375
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,720
 on the walls, banging on the back door.

376
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,560
 The guys in the front get in position, get their rifles ready, but these aren't professional

377
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
 soldiers.

378
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,140
 They're not even really professional hunters.

379
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,820
 They bunch up, they get really tight, and the way the formation is is that some people

380
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,340
 are directly in front of somebody else's rifle.

381
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,140
 Plus they're worried about shooting, missing, and hitting the people in the back of the

382
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,780
 house.

383
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:21,060
 And they're completely terrified because there's an 8 foot 8 bear in there eating people.

384
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:27,540
 And they know it's coming outside that door in 3, 2, and at that point the bear busts

385
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,040
 down the front door and they open fire.

386
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,720
 Well some of them do, because again they're worried about hitting the people in front

387
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
 of them.

388
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,680
 The bear is not hit a single time and runs off into the woods.

389
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,080
 They go into the house, they start picking up the people that they can, taking the dye

390
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,720
 into a local school to do a triage, to save who we can.

391
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,240
 One of the survivors was the 7 year old son of the mayor who swore in that moment to kill

392
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,280
 10 bears for every one human that is killed.

393
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:11,040
 They find the body of Take, her head was bitten clean off, her pregnant belly was untouched.

394
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,480
 They cut her open and pulled out her child.

395
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,160
 Alive, alive.

396
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,680
 But who died a few hours later.

397
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:27,840
 The two husbands come back from town with good news, snipers and a veritable army of men

398
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,200
 were going to come the next day to help stop this menace.

399
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,280
 But as they come back to the village they see the schoolhouse abuzz with activity.

400
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,920
 That wasn't part of the plan.

401
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,420
 Something must have happened.

402
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,280
 They go in there and that's when they learn of what happened.

403
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,200
 The damage to their families was irreparable.

404
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,080
 Alive people were killed in that house over the course of minutes as this beast simply

405
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,600
 attacked them.

406
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,240
 The next day December 11th everyone's on edge.

407
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,320
 They have to bury all of these people who have passed and they know that that bear will

408
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,800
 come back.

409
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,360
 At this point everyone is in one location.

410
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,920
 Everyone who can is a guard with a rifle.

411
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,520
 That night the bear does not return to the village.

412
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,760
 December 12th the six man sniper team shows up, help from nearby towns, six theme in in

413
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,920
 total.

414
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,680
 They don't know what to do though.

415
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,280
 Do we keep playing a defensive game?

416
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,720
 Do we go out into the woods?

417
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,480
 Why didn't the bear show up last night?

418
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,880
 Is the bear looking for revenge?

419
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,280
 Is the bear looking for food?

420
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,600
 Are we making things worse?

421
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,280
 People are debating how to go about this.

422
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,040
 Yamamoto walks into the village with his rifle.

423
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,920
 Says listen, I know what we need to do to get this bear.

424
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,120
 It killed these people for food.

425
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,760
 It will come back for this food.

426
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,600
 That's what bears do.

427
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,320
 So we need to take one of these bodies that you've recently been and people are freaking

428
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,480
 out there like dude we're not pulling up one of these bodies.

429
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,640
 We're not giving this a...

430
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,200
 Yamamoto goes listen, I know that this is disgusting and I know this is against tradition

431
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,680
 but we can't just leave out some corn cobs at this point.

432
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,040
 We need the bear to come back to the village where we can shoot it or track it to its cave.

433
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,360
 And to do that, it killed people.

434
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,160
 It wants to eat them.

435
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,280
 Dig the bodies up.

436
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,000
 We use them as bait.

437
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,360
 And the townspeople really debated that but they don't have a lot of time and they go

438
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
 fine.

439
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:38,480
 This is super disgusting but yes, for the sake of the village, we'll use our dead family

440
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,760
 members as bait.

441
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,160
 December 12th, they leave the bodies out that night.

442
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,560
 The bear does not show back up.

443
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,920
 People are a little upset obviously.

444
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,080
 Yamamoto goes...

445
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,880
 Well, I don't know.

446
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
 Should have worked.

447
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,760
 Little egg on my face right guys.

448
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
 Sorry about that.

449
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,400
 But, you know, it's better than just hanging out here.

450
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,520
 December 13th, December 13th, that's when you just fade to black, go to commercial and

451
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,120
 then we're on December 3rd.

452
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,720
 Just Yamamoto getting like shrugging his shoulder.

453
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
 Sorry.

454
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,360
 His bodies, disinterred bodies are all over the place.

455
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,320
 December 13th, somebody leaves the protection of the group and goes walking through the

456
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,520
 village to go check on something.

457
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,480
 They end up going to the Ota household, which is where the first attack on humans took

458
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
 place.

459
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,400
 Walks in there and goes, "Are you kidding me?"

460
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,120
 Walks back to the group of people and says, "Hey, I know what's been going on.

461
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,480
 Why haven't we been seeing that bear lately?"

462
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,880
 The bear was coming back to the village, but since everyone was in one location, it was

463
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,720
 breaking into the houses on the outskirts of the village, eating their food.

464
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,280
 Just like sitting down and making a meal for itself.

465
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,520
 More corn.

466
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,640
 Just eating their stuff and then going away and then like looking in the woods.

467
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,920
 And when it saw everyone was at this location, it would sneak into one of their house, huff

468
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,200
 and puff until the thatched house blew away and then eat all their food.

469
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,880
 So the bear hadn't left.

470
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,240
 It had gotten smart and was just breaking into like eating canned goods and stuff like that.

471
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,080
 So now the people are like, "Damn it, not only did we have to dig up these bodies, but

472
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,200
 now even after we kill this bear, we don't have any food."

473
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,160
 So Yamamoto is like, "Listen, the defensive strategy is not working at all.

474
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,360
 Like we're not, we just can't sit here.

475
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,720
 We have to go out into the woods and find the bear."

476
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,560
 Which basically you totally lose home turf advantage.

477
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,840
 At this point, they had been fighting it in a clearing, which is pretty easy to see something

478
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,640
 that that's big on a flat field.

479
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,080
 You go into the woods, this creature evolved to hunt here.

480
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,760
 And now you want to go into their woods and hunt them down.

481
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
 We got to.

482
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
 It's a man-eater.

483
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
 It's going to keep coming back.

484
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,120
 We know that even when it's not attacking us, it's still breaking into these houses.

485
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,360
 It's not leaving this area.

486
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,720
 We have to go in after it.

487
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,000
 But here's the problem with going on the offensive.

488
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,360
 What happened last time they did?

489
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,880
 So they can't take everyone out to hunt this bear down.

490
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,120
 But how many people do you peel away knowing this creature has in the past backtracked into

491
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,520
 the village and eaten people?

492
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,320
 So they leave a bunch of guards there.

493
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,840
 And then you have Yamamoto, the six-man sniper team, and about, I think it was about, ended

494
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,040
 up being about 60 dudes going into the woods as well.

495
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,240
 A very big force of guys is going into the woods.

496
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,080
 They get deep into the woods.

497
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,360
 They're headed towards the mountains where they know these bears normally live.

498
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,640
 And there's a sniper up in a tree.

499
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,560
 And everyone's asleep because it's night.

500
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
 The sniper's up in the tree.

501
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
 He's just sitting there.

502
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:51,160
 And he sees just behind a tree a massive black shape just standing there, looking at the

503
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,080
 people sleeping.

504
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,320
 Now the sniper has to make sure it's not someone peeing against the tree, right?

505
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,760
 So he calls out, hoping for a response.

506
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,240
 Shape doesn't move.

507
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,040
 "Hey, who are you?"

508
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
 Shape doesn't move.

509
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,040
 The sniper gets his rifle ready.

510
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,680
 Ames it right at the shape.

511
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,280
 No reaction.

512
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,760
 Shape begins running on all fours.

513
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,920
 Disappears into the darkness.

514
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,880
 Everyone wakes up, obviously.

515
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,320
 There's like, dude, you won't believe what just happened.

516
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,560
 You're lucky I'm up in this tree because that bear was going to eat you.

517
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,240
 I mean, he was watching you guys and I put a bullet right in him.

518
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,560
 The course, when you're talking about something that's 8'8", 837 pounds, the question is

519
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,520
 "Where did the bullet go?"

520
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,240
 Because if you shot me with the sniper round in the arm, I'm down for the count.

521
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,480
 If you shot me in the chest, I'm dead.

522
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,640
 You shoot a bear something that big in the arm.

523
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,400
 It's like, "Ugh, I got a thorn in my arm."

524
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,800
 So they're like, "We got to find this guy."

525
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,400
 So everyone's like, "Wake up, wake up, get in the sleeping bags, get up, get up."

526
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,560
 They're like, "Dude, I was already up when the gun shot and the guy telling me a barrel

527
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
 almost ate me.

528
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
 I was already up.

529
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
 Let's go."

530
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,040
 So they do wait for the sun to come up.

531
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,240
 They're not maniacs.

532
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
 This isn't predator.

533
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,280
 They're not now going to walk through the woods and get picked off one by one.

534
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,160
 But the sun comes up and Yamamoto's like, "Listen, here's the deal."

535
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
 He got shot.

536
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,360
 That means he's wounded.

537
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,920
 That means he's not having a good day.

538
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,720
 However, it wasn't a kill shot.

539
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,360
 He probably will heal.

540
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,040
 We can track him, but see that over there?

541
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,360
 Everyone kind of looks up.

542
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,320
 That's a snowstorm coming.

543
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,000
 It's going to be big and hard to walk through and it's going to cover up all of his tracks.

544
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,160
 This is our chance right now.

545
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,600
 We got to get it.

546
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,400
 But, another but, we can't take 60 people and track this.

547
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,040
 We're too slow.

548
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,520
 So tell me, turn to the locals, turn to the villagers, which one of you knows this area

549
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
 the best?

550
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,680
 And I can imagine nobody wanted to answer that question, honestly.

551
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,040
 Because you know where this is going.

552
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
 But one of them does.

553
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,960
 One of them steps forward, a better man than me, and says, "I know this area better than

554
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
 anyone."

555
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,040
 What's your plan?

556
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,920
 Am I going to lead you and the sniper and maybe a couple of these other guys into the

557
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
 Yamamoto?

558
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
 It's like, "No, no, no.

559
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
 It's just me and you.

560
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,440
 It's the only way we'll catch it in time."

561
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
 Gear up.

562
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
 Damn it.

563
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,800
 You're like, "I should have been honest, throwing on your backpack."

564
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:26,920
 This thing has outrun waves of bullets, killed seven people in just two days here, plus three

565
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:34,000
 women previously, has a name that goes with how it murders people, and it's just you and

566
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,480
 a dude who you heard is a recovering alcoholic who just got his gun back from a pawn shop.

567
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,200
 But that's life, I guess.

568
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,800
 They begin to follow the trail.

569
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:54,200
 Yamato, expert bear hunter, comes with the territory he needs to know how to track.

570
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:01,800
 They're walking through the forest, crossing a river, headed towards the base of a mountain,

571
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:10,280
 and then Yamamoto puts his hand up to stop his guide, and they're 65 feet away from him.

572
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,440
 Is the bear, resting against the tree.

573
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,800
 I must imagine that the bear looked up and saw Yamamoto and thought, "I'm gonna eat

574
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
 him."

575
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,800
 But, if I can't eat him, if anyone's gonna kill me, I'm glad it's you.

576
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,360
 Yamamoto gets his rifle ready, takes aim, puts a bullet through the bear's heart.

577
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,840
 The bear starts to get up.

578
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,000
 It's not an exact kill shot.

579
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,320
 Yamamoto gets another round in the chamber, aims it again, puts a bullet right through

580
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,800
 the beast's skull, killing him instantly.

581
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,640
 When they did take the bear back to the village, it had undigested body parts in its stomach.

582
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,760
 They removed the head, kept it as a trophy, but now the skull has gone missing.

583
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,200
 Shortly after this, obviously, the town became a ghost town, and eventually became a distant

584
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,520
 memory.

585
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,920
 This all happened in 1915.

586
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,320
 It was basically a rural story.

587
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,520
 If you didn't know someone involved in it, it almost seemed like a fairy tale.

588
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,720
 A dark one, but a fairy tale nonetheless.

589
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,120
 A myth, something you would tell people to scare them of bears.

590
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:27,720
 It's interesting because this is a true story, but so many elements are like movie tropes.

591
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,880
 The hunter who's done hunting, who will never use his rifle again, who has an alcohol problem,

592
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,120
 who comes back in the third act to save the day.

593
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,360
 To train the village on how to defend themselves.

594
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:47,200
 And then it has the ruthless creature that some people could sympathize with because maybe

595
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,600
 his environment was getting encroached on or he woke up early for some reason.

596
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,240
 Other viewers could just say he was a bloodthirsty beast.

597
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,560
 The only thing that this story is really missing from a JAWS or a sci-fi channel movie is the

598
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,400
 mayor of the village saying "we can't get the authorities, this is bear festival week.

599
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,120
 We're having 10,000 people visit the village this week.

600
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
 We can't pan."

601
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,320
 That's the only thing this story is missing.

602
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,960
 It has almost every single trope you would see in a horror movie, including a happy ending.

603
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,640
 And to really wrap the story up, in the end that young boy, that 7-year-old boy, his name

604
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,160
 was Okawa Harayoshi.

605
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,040
 And he was 7 when that happened, the mayor's son, and he said "I'm going to kill 10 bears

606
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,480
 for every human that's killed."

607
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,680
 He ended up, by the time he was 62 years old.

608
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,760
 He killed 102 bears, so he killed 10 bears for each person who died in the village, plus

609
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,040
 another 10 bears for the three women who were killed before this all started.

610
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,040
 And then he ended up building a shrine so you could go and remember the dead victims of

611
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,640
 this event.

612
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,800
 Weird story, powerful story.

613
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,640
 A story of human survival, a story against nature.

614
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,280
 And I think it's an interesting story because when we see these movies like JAWS or BEES

615
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,640
 or Claws or Fleas or whatever, like whether it's a 5-Paint by Numbers sci-fi movie,

616
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,920
 or a movie like JAWS or something like that, whenever you see one of these creature features,

617
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,360
 this, it rings, yeah the monsters are made up, but the story beats ring true because that's

618
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,520
 what happens in real life.

619
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,240
 We have these people in real life sometimes can be tropes too.

620
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,440
 It's fascinating to me.

621
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,400
 The whole story's fascinating to me.

622
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,480
 And what's funny is you know America seems to have like a fear of clowns?

623
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,680
 In Japan it's a fear of bears.

624
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,720
 The Japanese people, this might be a stereotype, but according to the research I've done, Japanese

625
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,760
 people don't like bears.

626
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,840
 Brown bears specifically because that's what type of bear this was.

627
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,960
 Because this story became so ingrained in the cultural, just like Americans and John

628
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,160
 Wayne Gacy and clowns.

629
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:52,080
 This story is the John Wayne Gacy of Japan where you don't like bears.

630
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,880
 You don't want nothing with bears.

631
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,400
 Gummy bears, tailspin, Winnie the Pooh, you just don't want to see it because it reminds

632
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
 you of this.

633
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,120
 You can go though to this area now.

634
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
 This seems grim.

635
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,200
 They've built a recreation of the Ota House.

636
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,840
 So you can see what the house was like.

637
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:15,120
 And then next to it built a two scale, eight foot, eight inch tall bear monster.

638
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,400
 And it's bigger than the house.

639
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,120
 You can actually see the statue of that, like the hand of the statue on the roof of the

640
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
 house.

641
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,680
 That's how big this thing was.

642
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,320
 Can you imagine being, think about the next time you're with like a giant dog in your

643
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,520
 living room or your house or someone else's house.

644
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,200
 If you don't own a dog.

645
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,760
 And when it walks by, you can like feel the heat from it.

646
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,040
 But you're in a giant house.

647
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,880
 I can't even imagine how terrifying it would have been to be in that shack.

648
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:53,680
 Over the course of what, four days, a town was plunged into madness and fear because

649
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,440
 of the ultimate killing machine.

650
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:20,800
 And to this day, it still affects, this story still affects an entire culture of people.
