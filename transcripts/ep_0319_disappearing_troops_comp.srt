1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
 I had a few odd things happen to me this weekend, nothing too dramatic, but some of them worth

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,800
 discussing on this show.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,620
 A quick update to the "Storm Area 51" meme that is coming and gone.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:22,340
 And then we take a look at the story of Martin Guerrero, a man in France who got accused of

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,780
 stealing grain and disappeared.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,260
 And then he came back.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,260
 Or did he?

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,260
 A day on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:40,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,040
 I hope you're having a great day too.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,400
 I had a great weekend.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,080
 I went to a toga party.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
 Toga.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
 Toga.

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,200
 Dressed as a care bear, I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to make a toga.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,520
 Couldn't get it right.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
 I just wrapped a silk sheet or satin sheet.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
 Sheet.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 Not a sheik.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,880
 There's like this Middle Eastern oil baron wrapped around my waist.

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,680
 I wrapped a satin sheet around my waist.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
 So I just like at the toga.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,800
 I was wearing a care bear onesie.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,480
 I go to this party.

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,160
 Baller status guys.

28
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
 Baller status.

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,560
 Here's a little tip.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,840
 Here's a little tip for your Halloween costumes.

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,080
 Wear materials girls like to touch.

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,200
 She'll be getting touched all the time.

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
 Girl, look at me.

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
 I'm a big old care bear.

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
 Now everyone might not be able to pull off the care bear.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I think you guys can.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I think you guys can.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,920
 So anyways, I had my suit of a million, million touches and I hung out with some really good

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,920
 friends and rigged a toga contest.

40
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,840
 So my friend won and she was really happy.

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,520
 She said she'd never won a popularity contest before.

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
 So cute.

43
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,320
 Anyways, why am I talking about this?

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,080
 Am I humble bragging a little bit and I'm giving you advice on your Halloween costumes?

45
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
 You betcha.

46
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,320
 This also has to do with dead rabbit radio.

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,000
 It has to do with spooky paranormal stuff.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
 It has to do with dead rabbit radio stuff.

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,040
 First off, I'm sitting at this, it's at the Elks Lodge.

50
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,560
 So spooky, masons, conspiracy.

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,880
 It's at the Elks Lodge and I'm talking to this chick and she's just completely hammered.

52
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,920
 So at a certain point I'm kind of getting bored of talking to her because she can't keep

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
 ascended scowing.

54
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,380
 So I turn and I'm watching the television and a commercial comes on for Terminator Dark

55
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,640
 Fate and I go, this is going somewhere.

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,680
 This isn't me just talking about what happens at the bar.

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,400
 I'm looking at the television for Terminator Dark Fate and I go, what?

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
 That movie already came out.

59
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,200
 That movie came out like two months ago and it came and went and it got like 68% on Rotten

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,320
 Tomatoes and no one really cared about it and it made like half its budget in the opening

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
 weekend.

62
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,840
 It wasn't a huge flop but it wasn't a huge success and then it said coming November

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,680
 first and I was like, oh, Mandela effect.

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,380
 I have moved into a reality where Terminator Dark Fate has not come out yet.

65
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,140
 So I originally was in a reality where Terminator Dark Fate, the new Terminator movie came out

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,620
 a couple months ago and then I got ran over by a bulldozer or steamroller which would

67
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,620
 be more apt.

68
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,660
 I could probably outrun a bulldozer.

69
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,060
 Steamroller sneak up on you and then I'm here in this reality.

70
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,260
 Now obviously that's what a mad man would think and that's what a lot of people in conspiracy

71
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,440
 theory circles think.

72
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,040
 Mandela effect is you moving from one reality to the other where certain things.

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,680
 I'll tell you why I thought that Terminator Dark Fate came out.

74
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
 This is turning into a plug for that movie because I keep saying the whole name.

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
 I can tell you why I thought Terminator Dark Fate coming theaters November 1st came out

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,040
 two months ago was because I could care less about the new Terminator Dark Fate movie coming

77
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
 out November 1st.

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
 I could care less.

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
 I've seen them all.

80
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,520
 I'm really tired of the Terminator franchise.

81
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,940
 Genesis burned me out.

82
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,020
 I would watch a reboot.

83
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,660
 I would watch a remake.

84
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,900
 I would watch a Terminator set strictly in the 1980s but I'm tired of Terminators to

85
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,620
 one movie I would probably be fine watching a prequel of.

86
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,460
 I don't like prequels in general but I could watch a 1970s version of the Terminator that

87
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,260
 would be really interesting.

88
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,380
 I don't care about the robots punching each other in their current iteration.

89
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,840
 I'm done.

90
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,000
 This is the thing.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 People who Mandela affects stuff.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
 Mandela effect is because the reason why that terminology is there is because there were

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,360
 people who swear up and down that Nelson Mandela died in the 80s in prison and then when Mandela

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,360
 actually died like in the late 90s early 2000s they were like what no they swear up and down

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,880
 he died in prison in the 1980s and that's why it's called the Mandela effect.

96
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,420
 This idea that your memories aren't wrong you're from a universe where your facts are

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,020
 true and here is my argument for that.

98
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,660
 The people who believe Nelson Mandela died in prison in the 1980s I will bet were not

99
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,620
 huge fans of Nelson Mandela's work.

100
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,420
 Not saying they were actively trying to stop him they're like knocking him over as he's

101
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,940
 like walking through jail they're pushing him and they're like we're gonna make a

102
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
 broomer.

103
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,820
 I don't think they were following his career closely because then they would have been

104
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,620
 like oh he's out of prison now.

105
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,960
 I think that these are people who didn't really care about Nelson Mandela they knew he was

106
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,720
 famous and they kind of knew why and then they stopped hearing about him for a while

107
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,000
 or they just stopped caring and so I don't care about Terminator Dark Fate coming out.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,440
 It might be a good movie I think it'll be a middling movie I think it'll make middling

109
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,800
 amount of money and it'll have middling reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and it will disappear into

110
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,000
 the consciousness and then I will forget that I even recorded this segment.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,240
 I think it'll be that gray of a thing.

112
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,460
 I wanted to highlight it though because that's how Mandela Effect stuff starts.

113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,460
 Because you just don't care in the beginning enough to pay attention.

114
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,580
 So when someone points something out to you you go what?

115
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,580
 I didn't know that.

116
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,940
 I thought it was this and it turns out you really didn't care until someone brought

117
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,820
 it to your attention in the first place.

118
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,020
 Now also I wanted to say this I go to the Toga party and I'm hanging out there and I'm talking

119
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,780
 with different girls at this point and all these girls are my friends I'm not like super

120
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,480
 pimp I'm kind of pimp but I'm not like super pimp right?

121
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,000
 I'm talking to this other girl and she's pretty drunk too but not as bad as the first

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 one.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,360
 The first one was anyways talking to this girl, she's a friend of mine and all of a sudden

124
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
 I don't know how many people have been in an Elk's Lodge.

125
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,320
 I've been warned by people over the years dude don't go to Elk Lodges don't go to Mason

126
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,440
 buildings and stuff like that.

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,160
 Like even for fun even go there to drink or to play pool or whatever don't do it.

128
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,060
 I was like why not and they were like just don't and then it was just like mysteriously

129
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,340
 vanished in front of me.

130
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,940
 Turn into a flock of birds and fly away.

131
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,100
 I was like oh I always wondered what Susan was up to.

132
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,500
 She was just a flock of birds.

133
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,340
 So I've been told that for a long time anyways I go to I've been to this Elk's Lodge quite

134
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
 a few times.

135
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,780
 We're sitting there watching I'm probably breaking some sort of Elk law saying this

136
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,780
 I'm gonna get killed.

137
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,460
 I'm sitting there, Jenny's sitting next to me.

138
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,700
 We're at the bar and she's going on about something.

139
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,960
 I don't remember exactly what it was.

140
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,680
 Probably something about her because she talks about herself all the time and I'm starting

141
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,920
 to hear a low murmur through the crowd.

142
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,880
 There's maybe about like 40 people in the area we're at.

143
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,640
 I start to hear this low murmur through the crowd right and Jenny's still like yeah so

144
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,720
 anyways if you look at my hair and then like this bracelet I made and I'm just here like

145
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,440
 this and it's growing this murmur is growing and I can't figure out what what they're

146
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:47,060
 saying but I start to pick up that there is there is some sort of chance going on and

147
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,700
 I'm at this point going Jenny's trying to get her shirt and she's like yeah and so anyways

148
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,060
 like if you look at the hem of this dress I'm like I think we're about to get eaten

149
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,980
 dude like you need to be quiet and as she's finally starting to calm down we hear this

150
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:07,020
 the golden hour of recollection the homecoming of those who wander the mystic roll call of

151
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:14,080
 those who will come no more living or dead and elk is never forgotten never forsaken

152
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,360
 morning and noon may pass him by the light of day sink heedlessly in the west but air

153
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,760
 the shadow of midnight shall fall the chimes of memory will be peeling forth the friendly

154
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:33,400
 message to our absent members and everyone takes a drink and I'm like what is going on

155
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:43,740
 so apparently at 11pm on the dot this this chant starts which it would have been I would

156
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,380
 have been fine with and I am fine with this is your tradition but I would have not have

157
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,700
 been as petrified if I knew it was coming like if I go there again I'll be like but what

158
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:01,060
 was super weird dude is like you could hear it like it was a chant now chant again like

159
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,480
 if you're at a if you're out of sports arena and they're like go team and it's like 10,000

160
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,760
 people going go team it's nothing spooky about that right but if you're in a dark if you're

161
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,440
 in a dark building you know a really you know five people the five girls you came with who

162
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,840
 really want to be able to like fight their way out if these guys all of a sudden grab

163
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,280
 forks and knives and try to eating us you're in a dark didn't she I shouldn't say didn't

164
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:34,660
 she you're in a very very nice establishment but it is dark there's been a lot of drinking

165
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:41,900
 everyone's wearing togas and you hear a bunch of chanting and you can tell everyone is quiet

166
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:48,660
 and somber except for the girl sitting next to you who's talking very very loudly about

167
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,100
 her personal appearance and I'm thinking I had no idea what's gonna happen next 30 seconds

168
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:02,680
 if they all turn to me and point this is not going to be a good night but they didn't and

169
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,560
 I did go home and figure out why they did that I didn't go home immediately I was like

170
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,680
 see you later ladies I got a mystery to solve the next morning I looked it up they do it

171
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,480
 at 11pm it's this weird thing because back in the day there was a curfew at 11 every

172
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,560
 fire had to be put out at 11pm so that way you couldn't stay up all night and plot against

173
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,380
 the king ah King George it's not like people can't talk in the dark but I guess in olden

174
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,180
 times if the fire was out you freeze so anyways that's where the term the 11th hour comes from

175
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,580
 because they'd be like you know they haven't told the 11th hour to get back the ball whatever

176
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:46,180
 sports thing go team and so anyways it's from that and so back when Mason lodges are being

177
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,020
 started they go we should do something at 11 just like kind of some king thing because

178
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:59,120
 we're kind of like underground still I don't know anyways it was weird and creepy I don't

179
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,680
 remember what the other stories I was going to talk about let's see here we're like Jason

180
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,800
 you just wanted to talk about toga party I did I did I didn't want to talk about toga

181
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,720
 party something else weird happen oh dude so this this was the area 51 thing so I was on

182
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,480
 4chan today you know people go you don't really go to you don't really cover 4chan stuff anymore

183
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,180
 I go yeah it's because a lot of it isn't it's there's not a lot of good stuff on there

184
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,220
 anymore it kind of goes in waves you really have to dig for this stuff so anyways I am

185
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,740
 I still look I still look for interesting stuff I found this now this is going to take a little

186
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:39,940
 bit of a leap of faith but it's pretty brief so and I did not cover the area 51 storm area

187
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,860
 51 story I felt that it was pretty well covered in the mainstream medium there wasn't a lot

188
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,800
 I could add to it I kept looking for different angles to it and I couldn't find anything

189
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,600
 like everything I could come across was pretty mainstream I couldn't find anything relevant

190
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,080
 I like to talk about obscure stuff but here we go this is something that I have seen nowhere

191
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:09,520
 else so on 4chan there's currently a Prussian news article it's a couple of paragraphs written

192
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,940
 in Prussian on this thread on 4chan that has maybe like 12 responses it's not linked to

193
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,660
 an article in a Prussian magazine but it seems that it should be so let me read you

194
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,740
 I'm not going to read you the whole thing and I'm definitely not going to read in Prussian

195
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,020
 there is an English translation and the three fourths of it is all information we already

196
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,740
 know storm area 51 was a meme that was started and people were going to show up at area 51

197
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,080
 to do a Naruto run and then it just became like a big joke and they were going to have

198
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,480
 like alien wood stock but that got shut down because there was no infrastructure around

199
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,920
 that area all basic stuff right and then it goes into someone wanted to use the term alien

200
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
 stock and then someone else wanted to use that and that was like a legal battle but anyways

201
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,120
 here we go with the interesting thing on the day of the event about 150 people were reported

202
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:08,080
 to have shown up at the entrance to area 51 with two succeeding in entering the site and

203
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,100
 estimated 1500 attended the related festival so in the area you had about 1500 people you

204
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:21,740
 had 150 people at the storm area 51 designated quote unquote location and two succeeded in

205
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,420
 entering the site okay seven arrestor were made for trespassing including one for alcohol

206
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,640
 related reasons and one for indecent exposure that was probably someone urinating that you

207
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,480
 can get a you can get a sex crime rap if you urinate in public and the wrong cop comes

208
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,500
 around the corner or just a citizen sees you yeah you yeah you don't want to do that anyways

209
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,280
 three remain at large whereabouts unknown dubbed the Lincoln County war criminals Billy

210
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:56,060
 the Kid Charlie Bodry and Doc Skirlock so the implication is that there's three people

211
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:02,980
 out there and we don't know the real names they're going by the names of these western

212
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,020
 outlaws either they've chosen these names for themselves or someone else has chosen

213
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:19,780
 these names for them and this is being reported on a Prussian website or someone wrote a Prussian

214
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,700
 write up of this specifically for 4chan because there's no links for anything here they simply

215
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,420
 exist as its own thing and then you have the these two little paragraphs and then after

216
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:41,260
 that you just have pictures of T tunnels like a tunnel pictures of tunnel beams where it's

217
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,540
 like a stick and then two sticks holding that stick up and there's a picture of rocks and

218
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,100
 there's like a rock and two rocks holding that up and then there's photos of the three

219
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:58,220
 real life western outlaws I don't know what this is the whole start of this is this is

220
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,900
 what this thread is called G whiz deep and that has to be a code for something or has

221
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:11,140
 to be some funny joke I don't get it G whiz deep seven arrested two are inside new many

222
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,980
 photos and documents are uploaded today 30 days the Prussians made it in anniversary

223
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,260
 one month now storm area 51 they can't stop all of us and then there's some photos and

224
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,140
 some I have I don't really know what to make of this thread it's really really bizarre

225
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,140
 part of me thinks it's a code for something someone's trying to communicate information

226
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,740
 to somebody else and they're writing it in this way and we've talked about that before

227
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,100
 the show a lot of times intelligence agencies or drug smuggling agencies or criminal organizations

228
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,740
 or whatever or even people just running an ARG will write stuff that seems like nonsense

229
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,060
 to normal people but if you have the key code you go oh I'm supposed to be in Libsyn tomorrow

230
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,140
 according to this nonsense the T beams is telling me where to go what street to go all

231
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,940
 of that's possible but very very far fetched it's also possible that someone's totally

232
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,900
 making it up and they happen to be fluent in Prussian or it's a group of guys and they're

233
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,300
 like let's start this fake rumor that there's still two people running around in area 51

234
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,700
 and there's three other people that have never been found so are they captured or they still

235
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,420
 running around the base who knows could be that it could be true and one of the things

236
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,620
 I've come across a lot on this show is we will do articles we'll read articles and investigate

237
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,860
 these stories and then it just ends and stuff that happened like five six years ago I'll

238
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,380
 be like oh I wonder if that guy was ever found guilty and I'll dig and dig and dig and there

239
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,460
 was nothing because once the event is over it's like no people stop doing follow-up articles

240
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:44,700
 it's really really bizarre it's part of that clickbaity thing like when storm area 51 was

241
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,260
 a meme people were putting in all their headlines what a storm area 51 mean for the big bang

242
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,380
 theory like you put it in your headlines again I mean and then once it's over people stop

243
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,620
 covering it and I think that's where we're at now so it's most likely that some guys

244
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,620
 are making this up and it's a funny joke but it'll be interesting to see if there is something

245
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:12,700
 going on at that base or you have people that have been detained and not released been detained

246
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,460
 and we don't even know their real names that's even makes the story even more complicated

247
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:24,780
 because they are running around a US secured US military base so what was I would love

248
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:30,220
 to say we'll keep you updated but who knows I don't even know what this is it could just

249
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,580
 be a bizarro code that some guys have figured out or made up I don't think I have time for

250
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,580
 the Martin Guerrero story let's go ahead and do let's go ahead and do this one you know

251
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,620
 this is one I've had on the docket for months and it's I just really knew never knew where

252
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,220
 to fit it so we'll fit it here and it actually kind of fits with the Martin Guerrero story

253
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,540
 let's go ahead and hop in the carbon helicopter get your togas on boys we're headed out east

254
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,420
 or west we're headed out west from Oregon get on get on togas getting caught on the

255
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,180
 rotor blades I'm like we're leaving you behind dude you're like ah getting chopped up sorry

256
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,460
 everyone else get on get on all the other listeners but you are now on the carbon helicopter

257
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,460
 you're like Jason this sucks now you're just like floating above as a ghost you have ghost

258
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:27,300
 powers we're flying to China the year is 1937 so not a good time to be living in China

259
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:36,740
 because the Japan Empire the Japan dudes are just stomping all over China they absolutely

260
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,940
 hate China and China hates Japan for good reason I don't know why the Japanese hated

261
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:50,900
 China to begin with but they did with a furious fiery passion and so they was not basically

262
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:58,100
 it was not a good time to be Chinese in China Japan it was invading now the year is 1937

263
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,620
 there's this story takes place in Nanking which if you are a historian or just a have

264
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:10,940
 a passing knowledge of World War two Nanking was an even worse place to be as Japan was

265
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:17,140
 coming in the rape of Nanking was horrible I remember when I was planning this topic

266
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,260
 because I've had it for a while I started researching the rape of Nanking and I was

267
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:26,900
 like oh maybe I could do a nope nope super gross I mean some of the most barbaric stuff

268
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:33,500
 you could think of a human doing to another human happened in Nanking absolutely awful

269
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,780
 and I read an article once and I haven't been able to find this and again I've read this

270
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,740
 article back like in 97 or something like that I read this article and it said on the

271
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,220
 50th or it must have been the 60th anniversary of the rape of Nanking a bunch of Japan it

272
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,380
 the rape of Nanking I guess this is a rape of Nanking episode the rape of Nanking is

273
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,340
 what it says where they went in they just brutally raped a bunch of women they're also

274
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,220
 just shooting women children civilians men women I guess I already said that they're

275
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,020
 just shooting people in the street bashing their heads in with the butts of rifles stabbing

276
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,740
 them with bayonets raping them is a whore I mean that is me that's a whitewash of how

277
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,940
 bad it was but anyways in 1997 the bunch of Japanese businessmen said hey you know it

278
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:25,140
 would be so funny to do they go to Nanking which is in China so just so we're clear

279
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,580
 Japanese businessmen 60th anniversary of Nanking or 50th anniversary is one of those two it

280
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,540
 was the anniversary of the rape of Nanking a bunch of Japanese businessmen rent out an

281
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:43,420
 entire floor of the most expensive hotel in Nanking and then hire every prostitute in

282
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,860
 Nanking and they have a massive orgy on the anniversary of the rape of Nanking in the

283
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:53,620
 city of Nanking now I don't know how true that I read that story like 15 20 years ago

284
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,740
 and I was trying to find it again and I don't I wasn't able to find it so that story may

285
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,860
 be fake news but I did read that anyways long story short Japanese people do not like the

286
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:11,220
 Chinese and at this point it's vice versa 1937 let's do the story there are 3000 Chinese

287
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:18,380
 soldiers who are ordered to guard an area around Nanking because Japanese are just stomping

288
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,660
 everything and they're like you guys need to get over there you guys need to set up right

289
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,220
 here you're going to guard this place okay you division you go over here you go over

290
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,180
 here and so on and so forth and so December 9th rolls around right and you have all of

291
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:37,500
 these divisions all of these troops scattered around the area surrounding Nanking the Japanese

292
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,380
 have not gotten there yet but what happens is December 9th rolls around people are talking

293
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,940
 to the Milwaukee talkies back then they had radios people like over hey alpha team will

294
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,260
 call him alpha team I don't know what they were alpha team alpha team are you there yeah

295
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,140
 yeah we're here and they're like okay and they would people would talk they'd do the rounds

296
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,620
 but by December 9th they'd pick up division would pick up the line and go alpha team alpha

297
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:12,220
 team report alpha team alpha team report so people are very very nervous that this whole

298
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,580
 group they're not getting any answer from these guys you're thinking of is to have have they

299
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,660
 been assaulted is the attack started what's going on send some scouts out you two you

300
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:27,220
 guys look fast you guys run out there or take a Jeep and this isn't the ancient Greece guys

301
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,740
 get in a Jeep they're like oh that's much better they get in a Jeep the scouts go to where

302
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:38,940
 this 3000 troops were situated there's nobody there it's completely empty scouts are looking

303
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:46,260
 around and they're like this isn't good they radio back hey yeah we're here but they aren't

304
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,500
 you guys might want to come out and take a look at this so they send out CSI combats

305
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,300
 scene investigation bunch of guys walking around with suits sunglasses they're like hey

306
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,620
 shouldn't you be in like an actual uniform and prepare to fight the Japanese they're

307
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,620
 like shut up and investigation they're reaching down they're like rubbing dirt between their

308
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:12,420
 fingers and they're like ah yes I don't know I've never watched CSI I just know the memes

309
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,060
 I don't know exactly what they do on this show but anyways he's rubbing dirt rubbing dirt

310
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,500
 between his fingers the other people are like actually doing investigation this is what they

311
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,340
 find all the weapons are still there so you know it's funny all the weapons are there

312
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,620
 I wonder where their vehicles were that might be a little clue but anyways that solves the

313
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:37,060
 mystery all their weapons were there but every land vehicle had mysteriously disappeared

314
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,980
 anyways all their weapons were there other troops like you know because you have this

315
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:47,820
 ring of defense around the city other groups of soldiers said well we didn't see any any

316
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,740
 fighting over there we didn't hear any fighting and we didn't see a bunch of people leave

317
00:23:53,740 --> 00:24:00,260
 and then of course things get a little more complicated when the Japanese imperial army

318
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:06,460
 just crashes over Nanking like a tidal wave so at that point they really aren't worried

319
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:13,420
 about what happened to these 3000 dudes like full on World War two has hit China the city

320
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,780
 of Nanking it's block to block fighting and eventually the government of China just like

321
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,500
 I give up not as a government but the city they just kind of pulled out of the city and

322
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,900
 the Japanese just went to town just smashing in people's heads it was a horrible thing

323
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,180
 now I could be a little off on the detail not the smashing heads they did that but I

324
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,820
 like I said I researched this quite a few months ago and I'm pretty sure that's how it went

325
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,180
 out that eventually they were doing block to block fighting and the Chinese government

326
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,820
 just said we got to pull out I remember there was a couple of Westerners there that were

327
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,260
 trying to like it was it's actually a fascinating story but there was a people there trying to

328
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:56,340
 negotiate like make this a safe zone like can we get all of the civilians here for a safe

329
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,900
 zone and the Japanese are like yeah and the Chinese are like yeah and then they all went

330
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,420
 the safe zone and the Japanese just went in there and just it was just smashed people's

331
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:13,300
 heads open it was brutal but that is a different podcast to totally you can listen to hardcore

332
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,860
 history or something like that you want to hear about people getting bayoneted in the

333
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:23,500
 uterus because that's what happened and then let's get back so the war is over now Japan

334
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:31,460
 gets stomped out of China a couple bombs dropped on them they get just pushed back to little

335
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:38,860
 tiny island in the middle of the ocean and so China goes hey you know yeah yeah you did

336
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,980
 a bunch of messed up stuff but whatever happened to those 3000 troops and the Japanese go what

337
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,620
 you have to be a little more specific than that we killed a lot of people over there

338
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:56,060
 and they're like yeah but there was a 3000 troops outside of Nanking and they just disappeared

339
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,620
 like what happened to them the Japanese go through all their logs and they go we don't

340
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:07,220
 know we actually never engaged in a fight at that particular time in that particular area

341
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,620
 so we had nothing to do with it I've always thought it was weird how militaries keep track

342
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,820
 of stuff like we've done a couple shows about boats and they have ships logs and I guess

343
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,620
 I get that but what do you write in the log there was more water around me today there

344
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,860
 was a fight over a loaf of bread like what do you put in the stuff and then why do you

345
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,660
 keep it like after the war why does Japan have a book saying oh here's here's our book

346
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:39,580
 of atrocities it's a scrapbook like just burn all that stuff why do they keep logs and I

347
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,340
 don't know I have no idea I'm sure somebody in the military could be like oh it's because

348
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,620
 we like writing and it's an outlet for our creativity I don't know but anyways Japan

349
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,620
 goes through their logs and they're like they're like atrocities A through F and they're flipping

350
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,620
 through it and they're like yeah no you're not in here so there's some theories about

351
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:07,100
 what this was what this was some people say that it was a time slip you have a group of

352
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,540
 people 3000 troops that basically Mandela affected out that would actually be a convenient

353
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:18,860
 time to Mandela effect you go to a timeline where Japan is not about to invade your country

354
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,420
 they're like oh this is beautiful there's been theories about a time slip there's been

355
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,500
 theories about mass alien abduction I think they have a hard enough time getting one person

356
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,380
 3000 people would be kind of hard to abduct I thought it was interesting because a long

357
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,220
 time ago we did an episode about the black bamboo forest and the stone's gate in this

358
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:43,100
 mystical weird it's real life forest it's super spooky in the guards not the guards the guides

359
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,900
 will only take you so far in the forest there's a massive stone gate and their story after

360
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:52,700
 story of China sending in explorers and survey teams and stuff like that and they'll cross

361
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,780
 stones gate and then they won't come back or they'll feel like they're being whisked away

362
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:03,340
 to another dimension something that this place is only 20 bike vehicle is only 21 hours away

363
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:10,260
 from the black bamboo forest and there was a story of troops during the Mao revolution

364
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,780
 that were loyal to the capitalist government or whatever they had over there they went

365
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,580
 beyond the stone gate and that was the name of that episode I recommend checking it out

366
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,420
 but they went beyond the stone gate and they never got found again so it's possible these

367
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:29,520
 3000 troops also did that but but what's even more interesting is actually it's not it's

368
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,140
 less interesting but what's even less interesting is that some people say this story is not

369
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:42,980
 true at all that it's a local legend now when I look at my articles for this story of where

370
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,740
 I got this from because I had heard this pop up a couple times some of them are mystical

371
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:54,020
 websites message to eagle.com is a website I've gone to a lot they do a lot of unexplained

372
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:01,860
 stuff but then we have war history online which is more of a mainstream website where

373
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,220
 they talk about surprise war history online so it's kind of a legend that's been going

374
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,500
 around for a while and I've got this article from multiple sites but some people say that

375
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,220
 this is the first clue that it's fake is that some people say the story takes place in 1939

376
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,380
 so that makes it way after the battle in Anking and so that makes it even a little more suspicious

377
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:30,620
 but there's a possibility that it's just a retroactive legend that none of it happened

378
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,580
 there were no 3000 troops in that area and no one ever asked the Japanese if they had

379
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,460
 any records on it and it's just completely made up it's fake but if you are going to

380
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:48,340
 disappear right before a massive battle is the time that you could see doing that it's

381
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,820
 an interesting story to think about because what we have let's assume that it's true for

382
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,900
 a moment what we have is a mass disappearance and we'll get those on the high seas for me

383
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:04,340
 to triangle type stuff but 3000 soldiers simply leaving their posts never to be seen again

384
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,540
 it's not like these people popped up after the war or anything like that and shortly

385
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:16,340
 before the rape of Nan King so this supposedly happened on December 9th and later in December

386
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:24,100
 was when the siege started it's an interesting time to go missing imagine that you are a

387
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,380
 young Chinese man you're conscripted into the military and one night when you're just

388
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,100
 ready to do your job you're terrified of what's coming you don't know if you're prepared

389
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:43,940
 for the combat but one night there is a flash of light and you're abducted you and every

390
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:50,740
 soldier that you've bonded with over the past few months of training you have been abducted

391
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:58,500
 by aliens or teleported to another dimension another timeline where you are the alien December

392
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:08,100
 9th 1937 in China would be the only time that you would prefer to be in the hands of alien

393
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:17,900
 captors because what was happening back on earth to your own people was more horrible

394
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:27,780
 than any alien intelligence could ever conceive what we do to each other as a species would

395
