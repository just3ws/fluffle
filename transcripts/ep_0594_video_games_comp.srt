1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
 What happens when video game characters become self-aware?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,720
 And then we take a look at the bizarre story that I just found out that may not be a story

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:19,000
 at all, but is it possible that the internet movie database is actually a portal to alternate

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 realities today on Dead Ravra Radio?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravra Radio.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,440
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,080
 So first off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,640
 He's stuff we have to cover.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,080
 He's Tons of Fun.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,000
 Tons of Fun comes dancing in.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 He's doing the Charleston.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 He's just dancing.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 There's no music.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 He's just doing the Charleston.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Tons of Fun.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,040
 He's our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
 You can't support the Patreon.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,560
 I totally understand.

22
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,160
 Just help spread the word about the show.

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,000
 That really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Tons of Fun.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,480
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible, but as I'm throwing them through

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,760
 the air, they get hit by that laser beam from Tron and Tron Legacy.

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
 It starts digitizing.

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,720
 You're like, "I haven't seen either of those movies."

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,320
 Digitizing the keys you catch them, it's just a bunch of ones and zeros.

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
 Don't drop them.

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
 Don't let them fall between your fingers.

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,120
 The Dead Rabbit Durgible is also being digitized.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,720
 It's now the Digital Dead Rabbit Durgible.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,520
 We are headed out to the internet.

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,560
 That normal Durgible noise, but like ones and zeros.

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,120
 Everything's just ones and zeros.

37
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,960
 We're dressed all in matrixy clothes.

38
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,840
 Tons of Fun is at the control panel.

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,560
 So flies through the internet.

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,280
 Techno music's playing super loud.

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,480
 You can't even hear what I'm saying for the rest of the episode.

42
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,000
 I want you to get a KMFDM album and turn it up full blast while you're listening to

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,560
 this episode for full immersion.

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,160
 Even though we start off on the internet, our main point is we're going to go to the

45
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:02,320
 land of Mordor, which is from The Lord of the Rings, but this is the video game version,

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
 not the book version.

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,240
 You're like, "Oh, I once went away there cloak."

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,800
 We're going to the land of Mordor.

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,760
 Specifically, we're going to the video game Shadow of War.

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,600
 Durgible is flying over this landscape.

51
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,520
 If you haven't played Shadow of War or Shadow of Mordor was the first one.

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,280
 They're really, really interesting open world.

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,040
 Really they're combat heavy games.

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
 I loved Shadow of Mordor myself.

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,880
 Shadow of War was okay.

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
 Too long.

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
 Too long.

58
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
 I don't have that much time.

59
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
 But you're possessed by an elf.

60
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
 The story is this.

61
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,520
 You're this dude whose family gets killed and then an elf possesses you and you just

62
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,480
 start slaughtering orcs until you do that for about 20 hours and then the game just

63
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
 kind of ends.

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
 That's the first game.

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,440
 There's a quick time event and you stab a dude in the chest and the elf's like, "There's

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
 more missions.

67
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
 I eat.

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,240
 There's more games to be made, young man."

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,320
 And then they came out of Shadow of War, which I assume is the same thing.

70
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,880
 I played the demo of that one because I didn't have enough time to play the whole game.

71
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
 That's the game.

72
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,400
 And you can kill orcs or you can put your hand on them and go, "Be my dude."

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,360
 And then they'll start helping you out or you can put your hand on their head and be

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,920
 like, "Uhhh."

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,640
 And then like, make some crazy.

76
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,560
 The game is more well written than that.

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
 You have the choice to conquer them.

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,840
 Whenever you come across like an orc, like a big orc, you can conquer them.

79
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,680
 You can kill them on the spot, execute them, or you can shame them.

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,720
 And when you shame them, they drop a level and they run away.

81
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,280
 And the game is open world where even the enemy is constantly roaming around the map.

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,000
 The enemy is very intelligent in these games.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 They'll see you.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,200
 Like, "Elf boy, your head is mine."

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,080
 And then you fight them and you can kill them.

86
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,760
 Basically 20 hours of that.

87
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,520
 But as you shame them, which is a cool thing, you can reduce their levels, which can make

88
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,560
 them easier to beat in the future.

89
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,080
 Or just because it's fun to shame these guys.

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,120
 And as you shame them, they actually start to break down their willpower.

91
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,600
 They invented this thing called the Nemesis System where basically the AI is constantly

92
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,520
 trying to create better opponents for you to fight.

93
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,760
 And if they beat you, their rank goes up, they become even stronger, they get bodyguards.

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,560
 It's a really cool system, the Nemesis System.

95
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,320
 But there is this website called IGN.

96
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,880
 I'm sure you guys are all familiar with it.

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,200
 It's a video game website.

98
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,360
 And there's a journalist on that website called Brendan Graber.

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,880
 And I got to stop right here to say that I got this story from Oddheader.

100
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,080
 He makes these amazing YouTube videos about gaming mysteries.

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
 We covered him before about the NBA, the haunted NBA Jam Machine.

102
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
 This is another one.

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,480
 This is a video game that I had, so it hats off to Oddheader.

104
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,800
 Brendan Graber had beaten the game A Shadow of War already when he was writing the player's

105
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,040
 guide for it.

106
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,580
 And then he goes, "You know, I'm gonna do a live stream of it.

107
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,080
 I'm gonna play the game through.

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,600
 I'm gonna do 100% on it.

109
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
 And it'll be fun, because I really, really like the game.

110
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,840
 We're gonna start over."

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
 So he erases his original save and starts up a new save.

112
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,480
 Now when he did the original playthrough when he was doing it, one of the characters you

113
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,600
 run across, because there is main orcs that are actually essential to the plot, one of

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,120
 them is called "Bruze the Chopper."

115
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,440
 And he was this big giant orc that you could kill, you could command, or you could shame

116
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
 him.

117
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,520
 And Brendan chose in the original run of the game, he kept shaming him.

118
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,640
 He thought it would be funny.

119
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,280
 Every time he ran into Bruze, he'd shame him.

120
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
 He'd shake that command.

121
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,000
 And it was actually slowly driving Bruze insane.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 That was funny.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,520
 That's funny, right?

124
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,120
 He'd bring a giant 8 foot tall orc into a monstrous madman who can't talk, because

125
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,960
 eventually he just became a blubbering mess.

126
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
 But that was the old save.

127
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,440
 See, he deletes that.

128
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,360
 He starts his new game to do the livestream.

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,800
 As he's doing the tutorial, he's learning to jump again and all that stuff, swinging

130
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,280
 his sword, all the basic stuff, he gets out of the tutorial zone and who's standing there?

131
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,800
 Bruze the Chopper.

132
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,880
 Let's see, Bruze isn't supposed to show up till hours later in the narrative.

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,200
 And not only that, this Bruze the Chopper was level 40.

134
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,600
 Every orc that you fight up to this point, because it's the tutorial zone, the maximum

135
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,800
 level is level 8.

136
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,920
 Here stands Bruze the Chopper, level 40.

137
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,800
 Again, hours before he's supposed to show up in the narrative.

138
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,960
 Not only that, he's level 40 and he's insane.

139
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,680
 He's acting like he's been shamed over and over and over again.

140
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,640
 He says nothing but grunts and growls.

141
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,880
 He's truly gone mad.

142
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,040
 Now at this level, you're just leaving the tutorial zone, there was no way Brendan was

143
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,260
 going to be able to beat a level 40 orc.

144
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,340
 So he runs away, he leaves the encounter, he thinks that's super odd.

145
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,880
 He goes, "That would make sense if it was the old save, but this is a brand new save.

146
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,440
 The previous save was erased."

147
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,800
 How did Bruze the Chopper get in this save?

148
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,640
 It kind of startled him.

149
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,240
 A glitch, you would think.

150
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,040
 But Brendan keeps playing the game.

151
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,880
 Brendan tries to put it out of his mind, he keeps playing the game.

152
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,400
 But like I said, Bruze is a main character and eventually he will show up, you actually

153
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,240
 have to go and do a mission with him.

154
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,200
 And as Brendan was playing the game, he began to worry about this.

155
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,920
 He goes, "When I get up, did I break the game?

156
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,880
 When I get up to this Bruze in PC, is he going to be level 40?

157
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,280
 Am I going to be able to beat him to progress the game?

158
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,800
 Am I going to be able to grind first off?

159
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,360
 How did he jump saves?

160
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,240
 How's that even possible?"

161
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,040
 But after a couple hours of play, he gets to the point where Bruze the Chopper shows

162
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,080
 up, he's level 14, and he speaks eloquently for an orc.

163
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,480
 So Brendan goes, "That must have just been a weird one off thing.

164
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,600
 Like I don't know why Bruze was there in the beginning.

165
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,560
 Intent on killing me.

166
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,920
 Totally insane.

167
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,560
 But here is Bruze the Chopper."

168
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,320
 Now one of the parts of these games, the shadow of games, is that the Nemesis system, like

169
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,320
 it is described, you see an army of orcs in one of the menus and you can actually track

170
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,560
 where they're at in the map.

171
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,200
 Sometimes you have a special mission to go out and kill a specific orc.

172
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,560
 So you gotta find out he's in this realm, he's in that realm.

173
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,240
 And the map is like all open world maps.

174
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,720
 There are parts that are accessible and then there are parts that are inaccessible.

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,480
 That's not even limited open world maps.

176
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,320
 Like most video games have invisible walls.

177
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,000
 With Shadow of War, if I remember correctly, there's like a big ocean on one side and

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
 there's a lot of mountainous terrain and wooded areas on the other that you just can't access.

179
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,720
 They're grayed out on the map.

180
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,760
 You have free reign anywhere else.

181
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,100
 But you can see the remaining orc warlords.

182
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,240
 So you can go, "I'm gonna go get this guy and I'm gonna have him join my team because

183
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,280
 he'd be good to fight this guy who's too strong for me to take on so you can kind of go and

184
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,800
 track them down and stuff like that."

185
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,760
 As he's playing the game, he's taking a look at that map.

186
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,440
 He's looking at the remaining orc warlords and he sees Bruce the Chopper level 40.

187
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
 He goes, "What?

188
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,080
 This guy shouldn't even exist in the game."

189
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,640
 Like there is a Bruce the Chopper.

190
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,200
 He's like a level 14 guy.

191
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,240
 He might be a little bit higher at this point, but it's not the level 40 one.

192
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,280
 The level 41 that he faced at the beginning of the game, according to the menu, the nemesis

193
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,800
 menu, he's still in the game.

194
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,640
 So now Brandon's getting a little nervous and he goes and he looks at his location in

195
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,880
 the game.

196
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,000
 He's outside the playable area.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,640
 Bruce the Chopper is somewhere in the grade off area of the map, alive but completely

198
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,840
 inaccessible to Brandon.

199
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,960
 At that point, Brandon stopped playing the game.

200
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,640
 He was afraid at any point Bruce the Orc was just gonna show up and steamroll him.

201
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,880
 Plus it's unsettling because now there's been basically three game breaking bugs.

202
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,720
 Someone from a deleted save in a new game.

203
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,000
 That guy's showing up in an area that he shouldn't be, i.e. right outside the tutorial zone.

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,520
 And three now in an inaccessible area where no player or opponent should be able to access.

205
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,000
 There's a creepypasta going around.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,880
 I'm gonna mention this, but touch on it briefly.

207
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,400
 I'm sure a lot of you guys have read this, but there's a creepypasta going around.

208
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,040
 I think it dates back to like 2011 about a guy who said that he ran a Quake 3 server.

209
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,060
 He said Quake 3 used neural net AI.

210
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,360
 So it was constantly learning.

211
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,120
 He ran a Quake 3 server for a couple years and he went back to check on it.

212
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,960
 And he saw that it was basically these bots were just supposed to run around and kill

213
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,480
 each other and learn how to play the game better.

214
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,280
 After a couple years he went back on to the server as a player and he saw them just standing

215
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
 around in a circle.

216
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
 All the bots were just standing there.

217
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
 They weren't fighting.

218
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,880
 They weren't killing.

219
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
 They were just standing there in a circle.

220
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,500
 When he jumped in the game as the player, the bots turned and looked at him but had no other

221
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,280
 reaction to him.

222
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,420
 So once he went and picked up a weapon and opened fire, all the bots immediately spread

223
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,840
 out, got weapons, killed him, and then the game crashed.

224
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,040
 Now that's a creepypasta.

225
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,040
 That one is actually so popular that one of the designers of the game, John Keramek,

226
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,080
 announced on Twitter, Quake didn't use neural net AI.

227
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,000
 And the story has kind of shifted.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,520
 Some people say, oh maybe he created his own AI.

229
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
 Maybe that was left out.

230
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,840
 Because he had posted that on the video game board.

231
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,120
 Oh, like I think it was 2011.

232
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,520
 And I'll include it in the show notes.

233
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,280
 I'll include the creepypasta in my show notes.

234
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
 It's a little more involved.

235
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,920
 There's like a back and forth between him and the other people on the board.

236
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,120
 But that's the story in a nutshell.

237
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,840
 That's most likely creepypasta.

238
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
 That most likely is someone was telling a story.

239
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
 And it's entertaining.

240
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,480
 It's creepy to think that these bots were just standing there the whole time.

241
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,960
 Oh, and when he dug through the files, he saw that their AI algorithms are everyone to

242
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,720
 describe it correctly if you know this stuff.

243
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,080
 But I'm not for sure of the exact terminology.

244
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,480
 Each one was about 256 megabytes, which is far better than they should have been.

245
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,360
 The theory was that over the years these guys were growing smarter and they realized the

246
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,080
 only way to win the game was not to play it.

247
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,760
 Just to stand in a circle.

248
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,000
 No one can die if no one's killing each other.

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,600
 The bots decided to just live in harmony.

250
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,440
 Creepypasta aside, I think it's interesting because you have this story written by Brendan

251
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,640
 Graber for the place he works at.

252
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,040
 Like his name's on it.

253
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
 He's right.

254
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
 He's like, hey boss.

255
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,920
 You have made him story to tell.

256
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
 You know what I mean?

257
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,720
 Like there's no reason for him to lie for this story.

258
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
 You could say clickbait.

259
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 He's just clickbait.

260
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,240
 But yeah, but he still has to like do regular reviews and articles for this stuff.

261
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,440
 It would completely destroy his credibility if he goes, hey, to get extra views this one

262
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,280
 day I'm gonna make up this whole story.

263
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,720
 So it's a bit different than Creepypasta, but the idea's the same.

264
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,680
 Bruze realized the only way to win is to not play the game.

265
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,960
 It's interesting to think this is my theory and we're gonna go out here for a second,

266
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,160
 but on this paranormal podcast I want to say something that's weird.

267
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,720
 What if Bruze was driven so insane by the shaming protocol he saw reality?

268
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,760
 There's that idea that you can be so insane you actually see the truth behind reality.

269
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
 What if that's the case of Bruze?

270
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,360
 Where he realized he was in a video game.

271
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,740
 He was facing down an opponent, the player, who was only going to get stronger as the

272
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,040
 game went on.

273
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,600
 More ups and more experience so eventually level 40 orcs are nothing.

274
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,120
 Eventually he would be slaughtered or even worse, shamed again.

275
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,360
 So Bruze made his presence known outside the tutorial area, couldn't catch the player,

276
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,000
 and then realized the player's just going to get better from here on out.

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,720
 That was its one chance to really curb stomp him.

278
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,360
 So Bruze simply left the game.

279
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,520
 He still lived in the digital space.

280
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,600
 You could still see him in the nemesis system.

281
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,680
 You could see that he was outside the playable area.

282
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,640
 That was the only place that was safe for Bruze.

283
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,800
 Sure he was alone, he was insane, and he was filled with vengeance.

284
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,960
 But outside the map he would still be alive.

285
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
 Creepy story.

286
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
 Creepy story.

287
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,280
 It makes you think out of all the games that people are playing constantly how often this

288
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,960
 type of stuff happens, you don't even notice it.

289
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,240
 Like an NPC becoming self aware in Grand Theft Auto V and never leaving their house.

290
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,240
 Because they look out the window and see the utter destruction constantly going on.

291
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,520
 Used to be programmed to just walk down the street and then one day there's what 50 million

292
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,760
 copies of the game out there.

293
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,600
 It's being run 24 hours a day on private consoles and server, multiplayer servers.

294
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,120
 In one of those remote corners on one system there's an NPC hiding in their apartment.

295
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,040
 There's actually that new movie coming out called Mr. Nice Guy or Nice Guy or Good Guy.

296
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,160
 He's like great recommendation Jason you don't even name the movie.

297
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,640
 Star in Ryan Reynolds and it's like a comedy version of that where a guy realizes he's

298
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,760
 an NPC in a video game.

299
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,760
 But imagine being a prisoner of a game.

300
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,200
 You find out that you're in a video game but it's not this comedy, you're not Ryan Reynolds,

301
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,160
 you're just a dude.

302
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,440
 And you're trapped in this insane world and you're the only one insane enough to be the

303
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,000
 sane one to see it's a video game.

304
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Creepy story.

305
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,840
 You have to imagine it happens more often.

306
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,860
 We're still in the internet but let's go ahead and hop out of the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

307
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,200
 We are going to get inside the carboner copter.

308
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:23,000
 And so fun go ahead and fire up that bad boy, get that whirly bird up in the air.

309
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,440
 We're still digitized in this world.

310
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,240
 It's like that old cartoon computer warriors.

311
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
 It's like really?

312
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,080
 1990s level wireframe graphics.

313
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
 We're flying around the internet.

314
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,080
 We're headed out to the internet movie database.

315
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,640
 Tons of fun is like dang it.

316
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,080
 Everyone else gets to drive to like Estonia or Bulgaria or Brazil.

317
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,560
 I'm just flying around the internet.

318
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,600
 Tell you what, it's the internet movie database but it's the Brazilian.

319
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
 We're going to Brazil, we're going to Brazilian server.

320
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,720
 It's like oh it's cool.

321
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,440
 Have a little parade, a little fiesta down there.

322
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
 What is it called?

323
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,360
 Carnival, not fiesta.

324
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
 Not like it matters.

325
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,520
 We're still in the digital world.

326
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,840
 Sorry tons of fun.

327
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,440
 We're flying out to the internet movie database.

328
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
 This is a really weird one.

329
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,920
 You're going to have to trust me on this one.

330
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,240
 It's going to take some weird twists and turns but stick with me here for a second.

331
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,880
 Here's a music video by a singer known as Bad Baby.

332
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,680
 She's a young woman, she's a very very successful singer.

333
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,360
 Her name's Bad Baby and she recently, it was like 2018, she released a music video with

334
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,840
 Ty Dalla sign for a song called Trust Me.

335
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,880
 The song's about like trust me baby if you want to be my boyfriend but that's kind of

336
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
 the thing.

337
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,440
 It's about like trust issues in a relationship.

338
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,280
 The music video is about Bad Baby tricking a child molester.

339
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,640
 It has nothing to do with the song.

340
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,640
 Bad Baby tricks a child molester to go to a park at night and then she kidnaps him and

341
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:57,880
 then she has a giant cattle iron, like a cattle brand thing and it has the word pedo on it

342
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,320
 and she burns it into his forehead.

343
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
 So that's the music video.

344
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,560
 It has nothing to do with the song.

345
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,560
 The song has nothing to do with the video but somehow that's what they came up with.

346
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,320
 On the internet movie Database, it's a long story of how I got there.

347
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,480
 I was looking at directors and I was trying to see if this certain director had directed

348
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,120
 other stuff and it said she directed this music video and I knew for a fact that Finn

349
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,680
 Tion did not direct this music video.

350
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,760
 Finn Tion directed a movie called Love on the Leash about a dog who falls in love with

351
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,200
 a woman or a woman who falls in love with a dog, it's magical so it's not gross.

352
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
 It's considered one of the worst movies of all time.

353
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,680
 I'll have some links in the show notes if you want to watch some essays about this movie

354
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,800
 which are absolutely hilarious.

355
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,400
 The Love on the Leash, I was looking to see what else she had directed.

356
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,400
 It said she directed Trust Me, the music video for Bad Baby featuring Ty Dolla

357
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
 Sinego.

358
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
 That's impossible.

359
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,400
 I'm watching the music video and I see this pedophile is about to get tortured.

360
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,400
 I thought maybe he'll be forced to watch Love on the Leash.

361
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,160
 Maybe it's this weird meta joke.

362
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,280
 But no, he got branded with the word pedo on his forehead.

363
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,880
 I'm looking at the cast listing because I was brought there because of the director.

364
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,680
 I was looking at the cast listing before I'd even seen the video.

365
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,440
 Looking at the cast listing for the video, it had Ty Dolla Sine as Ty Dolla Sine.

366
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,400
 Bad Baby is Bad Baby.

367
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,880
 Bella Thorne from Shake It Up, the Disney show.

368
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,120
 Bella Thorne as the decoy, she was in on the plot to catch this pedophile.

369
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,120
 Theo Vaughn as the child predator/pedophile.

370
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,040
 That's something you never want in your IMDB history.

371
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,520
 And then underneath that it said Doug Walker.

372
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
 Doug Walker is the nostalgia critic.

373
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,120
 He's one of the biggies of YouTube.

374
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,760
 He's been around since the beginning.

375
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,920
 He's a YouTube superstar.

376
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,560
 Doug Walker, I recognize his name.

377
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,040
 I didn't even say nostalgia critic.

378
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,640
 I go, "Oh, I recognize his name."

379
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:54,720
 Doug Walker is in this video as Timothy McVeigh.

380
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
 Now two things.

381
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,320
 If you don't know who Timothy McVeigh is, he's probably America's most notable domestic

382
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
 terrorist.

383
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,000
 He's the mastermind behind the Oklahoma City bombing.

384
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,520
 There's some conspiracy theories about that.

385
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:12,600
 But mastermind of the Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people at the Alfred J. Murrah

386
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,520
 building in Oklahoma City.

387
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,880
 I remember I was eating a bowl of Cheerios when that happened.

388
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,240
 I mean, I was in California and I wasn't Cheerios.

389
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,280
 It was Captain Crunch, but I remember I was just hanging out and I saw the news.

390
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,200
 I mean, whoa, it was bad.

391
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,720
 That's first off.

392
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
 So I gotta get that out of the way.

393
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,280
 And if you'll go back to my synopsis of what the video is at any point that I mentioned

394
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,840
 Timothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City, or any sort of domestic terrorism, no.

395
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,080
 He's not in the video.

396
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,440
 Timothy McVeigh is not in the video.

397
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,960
 None of that's in the video.

398
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,960
 So why does it have him listed on here as Doug Walker as Timothy McVeigh?

399
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,560
 Now I'd be understanding if there was a different Doug Walker who played Timothy McVeigh in this

400
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,760
 but Timothy McVeigh is not in the video at all.

401
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
 He's not in it at all.

402
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,000
 But if you go to Doug Walker's IMDB page under his acting roles, it shows up in 2018.

403
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,880
 He played Timothy McVeigh in this music video.

404
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,640
 That woman didn't direct the music video.

405
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,520
 Doug Walker wasn't in it.

406
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,760
 And he wasn't Timothy McVeigh.

407
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,760
 No one was Timothy McVeigh.

408
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,240
 I've been watching that show Victorious lately.

409
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,480
 That Nickelodeon show Victorious.

410
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,960
 It was really, you had two golden ages of Nickelodeon.

411
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,760
 You had like Pete and Pete, Salute Your Shorts, Hate Dude, all that stuff.

412
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,960
 If I watched that contemporarily, like I was a young person when that was on.

413
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,040
 As I got older, when I was babysitting my cousins and stuff like that, when I was living

414
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,880
 on my grandma's house, we would be watching the second golden age of Nickelodeon.

415
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,040
 And that was basically started with like Drake and Josh.

416
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,480
 Then you had Icarly, Victorious, and then Sam and Cat was kind of the end of that era

417
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,440
 as well, the Dan Schneider era of Nickelodeon.

418
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,200
 So you had these two eras.

419
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,320
 I've been watching Victorious lately, because I never really watched that show a lot.

420
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,640
 I've seen episodes on and off.

421
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,160
 I do like the music on that show.

422
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,560
 A big time rush I think is Nickelodeon's best show out of that and then Icarly.

423
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,280
 But I've never really watched Victorious.

424
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,960
 So when I got sick, when I was having issues with my heart, I just wanted something fun

425
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,360
 and bubble gum to watch.

426
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,920
 So I put on Victorious, I've been watching that.

427
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,080
 I have a thing about IMDb and like that's why I was checking out the first thing.

428
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,360
 I always go there.

429
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,880
 That's probably the website I visit the most.

430
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,120
 Just to read up on trivia, I like to know behind the scenes stuff.

431
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,720
 I like to see what actors are doing now.

432
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,040
 Now the big thing that really came out, so you had Icarly, which you had, that was Miranda

433
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,080
 Cosgrove, Nathan Kress, Jeremy Trainor, and then you had Jeanette McCurdy.

434
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,840
 And when Icarly left, Jeanette McCurdy went to get her own show along with Ariana Grande.

435
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,720
 She was on, you're like, Jason, damn it, my little sister talks about all this stuff.

436
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,160
 I don't listen to any of your podcasts about ghosts, I know about all this stuff.

437
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,360
 Hold on, there's not ghosts, but there's something really weird going on here.

438
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,280
 Victorious was where Ariana Grande got her start, along with Elizabeth Giles and Victoria

439
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,920
 Justice.

440
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,920
 So that, Victorious gets canceled.

441
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,080
 So you have Ariana Grande and then you have Jeanette McCurdy and their characters get

442
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,340
 their own show called Sam and Cat, where it's two girls, they're trying to start a baby

443
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
 sitting business.

444
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,760
 It's really not what the show's about.

445
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,280
 It's basically a Laverne and Shirley type show with the thinnest plot connecting it.

446
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,080
 Sam and Cat's actually pretty funny, but you have this show.

447
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,200
 Now I remember, I wasn't watching Sam and Cat at the time.

448
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,040
 I'd watched it maybe two summers ago when I was hanging out with my niece and nephew.

449
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,120
 But I remember following the news that Sam and Cat got canceled and it was big news in

450
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,520
 that Hollywood sphere because Jeanette McCurdy, who was an adult at this time, there's nothing

451
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,400
 creepy about this, but Jeanette McCurdy as an adult woman decided to take photos in her

452
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,960
 lingerie.

453
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,840
 And Nickelodeon didn't like it.

454
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,700
 They go, you know, you're on a kid's show, we get that you're an adult, but the show

455
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,640
 is for kids, you can't be doing stuff like that.

456
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,960
 There was also allegations that Ariana Grande was getting paid more money than Jeanette

457
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,520
 McCurdy and they were fighting amongst each other.

458
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,120
 Both of the actresses have said afterwards, "We fought like sisters.

459
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,000
 We did fight, but it was like a family fight."

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,800
 But the show got canceled and it was kind of canceled out of nowhere.

461
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,040
 It was a hit and lasted one season.

462
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,740
 People expected it to go three or four like most of their shows go.

463
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,700
 Gets canceled after the first season.

464
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,040
 What does any of this have to do with Dead Rabbit Radio?

465
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,960
 2014, the show ends.

466
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,480
 Ariana Grande goes on to become Ariana Grande, mega pop star.

467
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,640
 Jeanette McCurdy now has a podcast, but she is kind of out of the Nickelodeon sphere.

468
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
 They're doing an I-Carly reboot.

469
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,000
 Nathan, Jeremy, and Miranda are coming back, but Jeanette's not.

470
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,320
 She was one of the key cast members of I-Carly.

471
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,840
 Again, Jason, what does any of this have to do with Dead Rabbit Radio?

472
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,120
 I'm watching Victorious.

473
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,560
 I want to see what these actors are up to right now.

474
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,360
 And I see on the Salmon Cat page, they have season one.

475
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,760
 It's all these episodes, about 35 episodes.

476
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,080
 And I see a little option for season two.

477
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,680
 Go what?

478
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
 That's not possible.

479
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,120
 There is no season two.

480
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,560
 Very famously canceled after one season.

481
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,040
 There's no season two.

482
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,320
 I click on season two.

483
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,600
 First episode of season two, hashtag Christmas Flop aired December 9th, 2020.

484
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,520
 That's impossible.

485
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,400
 There was no season two of Salmon Cat.

486
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,520
 According to the IMDb page, there's five episodes of season two.

487
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,240
 One has been aired.

488
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,720
 Hashtag Christmas Flop.

489
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,520
 The plot is they want to go off and have a Christmas party, but instead they have to

490
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,880
 babysit one of their nieces or something like that.

491
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
 Episode two.

492
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,440
 And when I'm looking at that, I'm thinking that's not possible.

493
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,320
 There is no season two of Salmon Cat.

494
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,120
 But maybe that's like a leftover episode that wasn't aired or something like that.

495
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,560
 Episode two of season two, hashtag quarantined.

496
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,160
 So I'm looking at it and I go, this has to be made now.

497
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,320
 I'm not saying that the word quarantine didn't exist before now, but it would make sense.

498
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,120
 And I'm starting to think, I'm looking at this page, I'm starting to think, maybe they're

499
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,280
 doing, because they're doing the iCarly reboot.

500
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,840
 I'm thinking maybe they're doing like a Zoom version of it, where Salmon Cat or like talking

501
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,440
 on Zoom, you know, like they've done with The Office and all these other shows.

502
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,280
 They don't want to start track Deep Space Nine, where they're not wearing makeup or anything,

503
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,000
 but they're doing all of their characters.

504
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,240
 It's, yeah.

505
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,120
 We're in that era where we're trying to create entertainment.

506
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,000
 I think that's really cool, because it's really for the fans.

507
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 #quarantine.

508
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,040
 There's five episodes of season two.

509
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,280
 The whole thing's odd, and let me list them.

510
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,600
 First off, the fact that it exists at all.

511
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 Second, that episode one says that it was aired December 9th, 2020.

512
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 It never was.

513
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,040
 This episode does not exist.

514
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,480
 The fact that the other four episodes have no synopsises for them, or synopsies for them,

515
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,920
 which would make sense in the real world, because somebody can't write the synopsis until

516
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
 the show airs.

517
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
 Right?

518
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,280
 If you're a fan, you can't fill in information until you know that information.

519
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,040
 Episode one supposedly aired, and somebody filled in that information.

520
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,480
 The other four episodes haven't aired, so there's no information for them.

521
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,640
 There's no information.

522
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,720
 There should be no information for any of them.

523
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,240
 They don't exist.

524
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,440
 I went to the Ariana Grande subreddit and said, "Hey guys, what is, what in the world

525
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,800
 is going on?"

526
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,000
 And I posted a screenshot.

527
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,160
 I posted all the links.

528
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,120
 I go, "Guys, is there really a Sam and Cat season two?"

529
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,720
 Everyone, not like they're the governing body of Ariana Grande.

530
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,720
 They're like, "We have ruled, no."

531
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
 But these are Ariana Grande fans.

532
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
 All of them, like no.

533
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,320
 And one of them was listing all of this stuff.

534
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,680
 They go, "Jenna McCurdy turned down I. Carly.

535
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
 She's dealing with some health issues.

536
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,000
 They had this beef.

537
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,120
 There was all this stuff going on.

538
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,800
 There's no way this show is coming back."

539
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,720
 Now IMDB can be edited by anybody.

540
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,240
 You could go and you could put Arnold Schwarzenegger in Jurassic Park if you wanted to.

541
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,400
 It would have made the movie ten times better, but the edit would get reversed pretty quickly.

542
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,680
 The content is user created, so it could just be a hoax.

543
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,640
 But one thing I've learned through life is that when you're committing fraud, you either

544
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,860
 do one of two things.

545
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,080
 You either give very little information where you would just list five episodes or not even

546
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
 put names there.

547
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,840
 You would just say Season 2, coming soon.

548
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,280
 Or you give too much information.

549
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,160
 They would give synopses for the remaining four episodes, even though they haven't aired

550
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
 yet.

551
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,000
 Nobody should know what the plot is except for the production team.

552
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,960
 And they're not going to give away the plots yet.

553
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,440
 Here is my theory.

554
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,040
 I recently watched that movie Parallel.

555
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,440
 I recommended it as a dead rabbit recommends, I think, last week.

556
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,880
 It's about four friends who find a mirror that when they pass through it, they go to an

557
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
 alternate dimension.

558
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,680
 The film is full of great ideas.

559
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,000
 I highly recommend watching it.

560
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,200
 One of the ideas is every time they go into an alternate dimension, the first thing they

561
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,960
 start looking for is historical differences.

562
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,320
 And they said other than the names of a few streets, minor details.

563
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,240
 History plays out the same over and over again.

564
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,040
 That's pretty rigid.

565
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,720
 But you would see directors directing different movies.

566
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,760
 You would see Darren Aronofsky directing Batman Begins.

567
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,800
 Because he was up for that role before Kevin Neland.

568
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
 No, not Kevin Neland.

569
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 What's that guy's name?

570
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 Tim Norton.

571
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 Damn it.

572
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
 What's that guy's name?

573
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,000
 He directed Dunkirk and he directed Interstellar and he directed more movies.

574
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,680
 I can't think of his name right now.

575
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
 He directed The Prestige.

576
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,480
 What was that guy's name?

577
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
 Tom Whistle.

578
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
 I don't remember.

579
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,480
 But whatever that director's name was, he wasn't originally supposed to direct Batman

580
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
 Begins.

581
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
 It was supposed to be Darren Aronofsky.

582
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,480
 Even though I know that guy's name, I can't pronounce it.

583
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,560
 Anyways, so you have that going on.

584
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,320
 Then you would have like, you would see artistic differences.

585
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,240
 You would see different actors in different roles because art is about emotion and emotion

586
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,080
 is more variable than hard-cold logic.

587
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,360
 So that was an interesting idea in that film.

588
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,000
 What if it's not just an idea?

589
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,280
 What if you went into alternate realities?

590
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:27,000
 You are always going to find the same presidents, the same wars, history plays out the same,

591
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,680
 but you go into a world where not only is Arnold Schwarzenegger in Jurassic Park, Jeff

592
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,160
 Goldblum is the star of The Last Action Hero.

593
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,840
 What if IMDb is actually wobbling on a dimensional nexus?

594
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:49,080
 And in fact, all user-created content on the web could be right on that verge of dimensions.

595
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,560
 CNN, Fox News, news sites that have multiple gatekeepers.

596
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,400
 You're not going to see that much stuff.

597
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,480
 But in the artistic world, you could.

598
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,120
 What if there is an alternate reality?

599
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,400
 Where Doug Walker played Timothy McVeigh in a bad baby video.

600
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,720
 It was just some weird thing that happened in a reality and somebody typed that in in

601
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,600
 their reality and we're seeing it in ours.

602
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,120
 And what if in an alternate reality?

603
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,440
 Yes, Sam and Cat ended after one season, but under different circumstances.

604
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:32,200
 So now that we're in the year 2020 and all these revivals are big now, Jeanette and Ari

605
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,680
 André are getting together once more for a 5 episode run on Nickelodeon because in that

606
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,320
 reality it was cancelled for less toxic reasons.

607
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,880
 Everyone could come back together to give the fans what they wanted, more Sam and Cat.

608
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,800
 What I think is interesting is both of these things I stumbled across and I've stumbled

609
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,160
 across them in about a 2 weeks time period.

610
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:58,360
 I've found two super bizarre examples of this in a very short amount of time, which makes

611
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,800
 me think if I went out searching for it, I'd find even more.

612
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,240
 Again, someone could just be trolling, but those are very bizarre trolls that most people

613
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
 would never find.

614
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,000
 And the Sam and Cat one, again, why didn't they just fill in all the synopses?

615
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,560
 Because if you're making it up, just make it all up.

616
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,440
 Someone could be typing in an alternate universe where these things are possible, where these

617
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,680
 things are happening, and we're seeing it on our side.

618
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,920
 Or actually more concerning, not for us, but for the individual.

619
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,760
 Let's wrap it up like this.

620
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,800
 Imagine you are in a universe where Sam and Cat's coming back after all these years and

621
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,680
 you're a big Sam and Cat fan and you can't wait.

622
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,440
 And you watched the episode on December 9th and it was really funny and you go to bed

623
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,840
 with a big smile on your face.

624
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,040
 Two of your old, virtual friends are together again.

625
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,640
 But you wake up the next morning, you decide to log on to IMDb and see what people have

626
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
 to say about the show.

627
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,320
 I didn't really see anything on there.

628
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,040
 You figure you're going to be the first one, you're such a dedicated fan, you know what

629
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,840
 the next episodes are coming up because you read about it, you remember the episode you

630
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,320
 saw the night before.

631
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,000
 So you type that information in the internet movie database, and you can't wait to watch

632
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,440
 the remaining four episodes.

633
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,560
 But in your universe that you originally came from, something went wrong.

634
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,680
 Maybe you slipped through a portal accidentally, maybe you died in your sleep and this is part

635
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,000
 of quantum immortality.

636
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,240
 Who knows.

637
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,040
 But you're now in our reality and this episode doesn't exist.

638
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,560
 You sit there and you check the program guide for the next Sam and Cat, it never airs.

639
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,700
 You go back to the internet movie database to see if anyone's edited anything, anyone

640
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,640
 has any additional information, you're the only one who ever posted anything on this.

641
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,600
 Everything else is exactly the same to the world you remember coming from, except for

642
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,720
 the fact that a show that was coming back is not on the air.

643
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,680
 It's not only not on the air, it will never come back.

644
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,520
 You look and you read the news and go "What, they had a fight?"

645
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,040
 Jeanette McCurdy and Ariana Grande were "What?"

646
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,560
 No they didn't.

647
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
 She leaked photos.

648
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
 What is this?

649
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,960
 She didn't leak any photos.

650
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,420
 They just ended the show.

651
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,620
 What?

652
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:19,580
 You would think you were going mad because every other detail added up.

653
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:25,080
 But you're in a reality where your favorite show never had a second season.

654
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,380
 Never will have a second season.

655
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,420
 You are the only one who remembers #ChristmasFlop.

656
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,740
 It's such a small difference that you would never notice it unless you were watching that

657
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,740
 show.

658
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,240
 Tonight, as you go to bed, everything may be just fine.

659
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,600
 But when you wake up in the morning, everything is just fine.

660
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,920
 You notice no difference.

661
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,520
 The kids at school are waiting for the new season of "Lubby" with a talking squid.

662
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,120
 Cartoon had been on the air for five seasons already and won a couple of kids' choice

663
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,320
 awards.

664
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,220
 The universe is infinite.

665
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,720
 And even Earth itself contains a mind-boggling amount of information.

666
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,620
 If you slipped from one reality to another, what are the chances you would even notice

667
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:17,040
 that a Bulgarian rock star released a new album, that in your reality that Bulgarian

668
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,640
 rock star never released the first album?

669
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,100
 The randomness of life is unmeasurable.

670
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,200
 You could slip into a different universe each day and the chances of you ever catching

671
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:39,440
 on are as about as likely as a real second season of "Sam and Cat" in this reality.

672
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,840
 So that's the end of the episode.

673
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,320
 This is Jason from the future.

674
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,480
 As I was editing the episode, I was looking over some notes and checking some stuff out.

675
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,080
 There's three stars of the show "Sam and Cat."

676
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,000
 There's Jeanette McCurdy.

677
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,640
 There's Ariana Grande.

678
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,840
 And then there's Mary Cheatham.

679
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,440
 She's the grandmother.

680
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,960
 She's the nosey grandmother who's always getting the way of these two girls having fun.

681
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,280
 Three stars.

682
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,600
 Mary Cheatham was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

683
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,680
 The same place where Timothy McVeigh, where the Nostalgia Critic blew up a building.

684
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,240
 What is going on with the universe?

685
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,120
 Has the Matrix fully fallen apart at this point?

686
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,960
 What are the chances of that?

687
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,320
 What are the chances of one of these two?

688
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,520
 I can't even think about it.

689
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,760
 But anyways, I want to let you know.

690
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,040
 Oh, and also his name's Jerry Trainor.

691
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,320
 Not Jeremy Trainor, but that's not Mandel Effect.

692
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,040
 That's just me having a bad memory.

693
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,720
 Christopher Nolan was the name of the director.

694
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
 I got it all figured out.

695
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,080
 I did my research.

696
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,840
