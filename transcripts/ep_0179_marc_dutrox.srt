1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
 A body found in the desert, another mystery.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,280
 But this one involves one of the most famous people in the world.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:16,440
 And then we take a look at a true crime case that was so bad it caused people to change

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,200
 their last name today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:31,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,040
 I am your host, Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,520
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,840
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so we're gonna jump right into it now.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
 A little warning.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
 A warning.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,840
 This episode's a little grim.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,760
 Try to keep it lighthearted, but it's pretty grim.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,080
 Okay, so I don't recommend listening to this episode if you're depressed.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
 I don't know.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,120
 The year is 2012.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,760
 Massive icebergs crashing against the west coast.

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,600
 People barely escaping earthquakes in their planes in the movies that we all went and

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,600
 saw.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,840
 But in real life in 2012, it's June 26th.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,440
 There's a dark SUV driving through the desert of East LA.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:23,240
 Here's the spot.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,720
 You have to skid.

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,440
 You get a driven and stop normally, but okay, everyone gets out of the SUV.

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
 Four door shutting.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,680
 Anyways, have to open up the back.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
 You get the point.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,360
 There's an SUV in the middle of East LA.

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,640
 It's dark outside, and there is a small black canvas bag.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
 Maybe Lycra.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
 I don't know.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
 But it had...

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,600
 There was a body in the bag.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,440
 One guy starts digging the hole.

34
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,520
 Should I pre-dug it?

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,760
 That's a tip.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,240
 Take the canvas bag or Lycra and throw it into the hole and bury it.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,400
 Now that unfortunately happens all the time.

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,800
 Not all the time like it's happening right now, but bodies get buried in the desert.

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
 People disappear.

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,760
 But this body was supposedly different.

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,280
 The girl in the bag is supposedly Miley Cyrus.

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,240
 This was a request from Matthew T via email.

43
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,760
 This is a very famous conspiracy theory.

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,760
 The first time I saw it was on 4chan years ago.

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,280
 Years and years and years and years ago.

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,600
 It's been going around 4chan for quite a while and it's kind of bubbled up to the surface

47
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
 internet.

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,520
 I mean 4chan's surface internet, but you know what I mean?

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,880
 It's gotten a little bit of mainstream play, but that was the first place I saw it.

50
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,680
 It was bizarre because the theory that...

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,720
 Well, okay, so let me get into the conspiracy theory real quick.

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,600
 The conspiracy theory is that Miley Cyrus...

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
 This is so ridiculous.

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,720
 Okay, so Miley Cyrus was supposed to have an origin.

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
 This was after Hannah Montana, by the way.

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,840
 This was when she was older, so it's not super icky, but Miley Cyrus was supposed to have

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,520
 an orgy with a bunch of Disney executives and she refused.

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,120
 She said no, I'm not gonna do that.

59
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,780
 So they beat her to death and threw her in a bag and drove her out to East LA and buried

60
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,440
 her in the dirt.

61
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,840
 And the thing was is that her body was found.

62
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,640
 Her body was eventually found.

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,120
 People were like, "Oh my god, look, it's Miley Cyrus.

64
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,880
 She's been beaten to death."

65
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,560
 And a local radio station reported that they had found her body.

66
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,480
 And actually taking a double look at my notes, they didn't find her in a duffel bag, but

67
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,920
 that's not the point because the whole story's made up, by the way.

68
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,240
 The news station reported that her body was found, like on the side of the road in East

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,480
 LA, and she looked like she was dehydrated and beaten to death.

70
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,720
 I had always heard that she was buried and they just never found the body, so the story

71
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
 has varied.

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,720
 I guess I always heard that she was left on the side of the road as well, but I later

73
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,760
 version I heard was that she just disappeared.

74
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,520
 She was buried in the desert of East LA.

75
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,840
 So first thing we have to address is Miley Cyrus is not dead.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
 Miley Cyrus is alive.

77
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
 Okay?

78
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,280
 That's the first thing we have to address, but let's get into why this conspiracy theory

79
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,360
 takes off.

80
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,280
 It's one of those things that, and we see this a lot, we actually see it a lot with school

81
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,880
 shooting things now, but we see it mostly with celebrities.

82
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,840
 We'll take a picture of a younger photo of a celebrity, and then they'll take a photo

83
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,600
 of that celebrity when they're older, and they'll circle different parts of their body

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,960
 and go see the nose.

85
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,840
 Remember she used to have a child-like nose, and now her nose is more adult-like?

86
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,040
 She must have been replaced, and obviously with celebrities you're gonna have things

87
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,040
 like plastic surgery taking place as well.

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,720
 Fake celebrity deaths stories have been around forever.

89
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,880
 What we're getting a lot of now is celebrities murdered and replaced by body devils.

90
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,840
 So that's the conspiracy theory here.

91
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,120
 And what's funny is that out of the, in the original 4chan posts where they explained

92
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,720
 the story behind Miley Cyrus being murdered, there was a bunch of other stupid rumors on

93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,480
 there, one of them.

94
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,680
 Remember that movie Home Alone?

95
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
 I reference it all the time.

96
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,840
 I've never seen it.

97
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,560
 Apparently in the same paragraph, or in the same post that says Miley Cyrus was brought

98
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,560
 out to the desert beaten to death for not being in an orgy with Disney executives,

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,120
 Mccully Colkin was molested by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci on the set of Home Alone for

100
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,160
 the whole shoot of the film.

101
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
 That never took off.

102
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,840
 That conspiracy theory never gained any legs.

103
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,720
 I think it's interesting that the Miley Cyrus one did.

104
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,400
 And I do have to say, if you go, well how do you know Miley Cyrus?

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,440
 I will, this is my, it's funny, I will talk about ghosts, and I will talk about, oh here's

106
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,640
 my experience with the haunted apartment.

107
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,520
 There's one thing I almost never tell anyone about because the story is so ridiculous,

108
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,600
 nobody believes me and I have to spend like a half hour convincing them.

109
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,200
 I know Miley Cyrus.

110
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,220
 Well I guess I should say I did as in a few years ago.

111
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,080
 But it's not like, whenever I tell people that they're like, how do you know?

112
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,040
 And I was like, ugh, like it's a long drawn out story, but we talked for a while, we talked

113
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
 for a couple months.

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
 Yes.

115
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
 Yes.

116
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
 She exists.

117
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
 She's still alive.

118
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:37,840
 I know that as a fact, but again, I'll tell you all of my ghost stories before I try convincing

119
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,200
 another person that I know Miley Cyrus because of that.

120
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,480
 For some reason they'll believe me when I tell them there's a purple man in my apartment.

121
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,480
 But when I tell them I know Miley Cyrus, it's, a fight starts.

122
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,760
 So anyways, she's not dead.

123
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,640
 But what's interesting is we have all of these rumors about celebrities dying and being killed

124
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,680
 by the Illuminati, being replaced.

125
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,160
 There's tons of them.

126
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:12,080
 That spunky dunk sent me through email an actual fun death conspiracy.

127
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,440
 I thought this was interesting.

128
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,600
 I thought this was an interesting take on the dead celebrity.

129
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
 So George Burns was this famous comedian.

130
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,080
 This is very brief, but George Burns was this famous comedian, the old man.

131
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,280
 He was in all those movies like, oh God, you devil.

132
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,960
 He was, I mean, he had a long stand up career, long career in film.

133
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,360
 And his thing would be like, I'm going to live till I'm 100.

134
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
 I'm going to live to be 100 years old and I'm going to walk on stage at the Las Vegas

135
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,680
 resort and I'm going to do my routine.

136
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:52,760
 He actually signed a contract saying he would perform when he turned 100 at this casino.

137
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,980
 And he would go on the Carson show and he would just, that was, that's not all he talked

138
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
 about.

139
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,960
 He also actually had a comedy routine he did.

140
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,760
 That was one of his things like, I'm so old and I'm going to live to be 100 and I'll still

141
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,440
 be doing this show.

142
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,640
 So in January 1996, he had already not been seen for a while.

143
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,200
 He's 99 years old in 1996.

144
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,760
 And his 100th birthday rolls around.

145
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,920
 But he makes no live appearances and people go, yeah, that, I mean, yeah, it was probably

146
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,720
 a joke he signed that contract like, but he did it.

147
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,240
 He made it to 100.

148
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,560
 And then in February, his publicist is saying, oh yeah, no, he's doing great.

149
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,360
 He actually went out to go play poker with some guys the other day.

150
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,360
 His old buddies came over and they all played poker.

151
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
 The end.

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,880
 There's no photos.

153
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,160
 There was no names of the people who supposedly went to play poker with him.

154
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,280
 It was just something the publicist released.

155
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,600
 And then in March, they announced that he had passed away.

156
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,080
 But really nobody had seen him publicly for a while before that.

157
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:02,280
 So the conspiracy theory is, is that he died earlier and they were able to cover it up.

158
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,960
 So he lived to be 100.

159
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,720
 Like he always said he would.

160
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
 Is that possible?

161
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,960
 I mean, obviously you're going to have things like death certificates and things like that.

162
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,440
 But it's, it's not, it's more likely than Miley Cyrus being replaced by a body double.

163
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,680
 But I think it's always interesting when you can get a conspiracy theory that actually

164
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,560
 is uplifting.

165
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,680
 Like the family and the publicists watch their friend for decades and family member for their

166
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,640
 lifetime die and say, you know what, let's, let's try to make his dream come true.

167
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,840
 Let's let him live to be 100.

168
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,400
 Let's put that in the record books.

169
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,160
 The oldest living comedian.

170
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,840
 So conspiracy is going to go both ways.

171
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,680
 I thought that was a very interesting celebrity death conspiracy as well.

172
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
 But again, it's conspiracy.

173
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,440
 There's absolutely no proof.

174
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,160
 It's just all assumptions and stuff like that.

175
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,480
 But it's still kind of a sweet story.

176
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
 Okay.

177
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,000
 So that was the lighthearted part of the episode.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,520
 Miley Cyrus sitting in the duffel bag on the side of the road.

179
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,360
 Now, oh, and I guess I should say there, what that didn't exist either.

180
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
 It's not like they found a body and it looked like Miley Cyrus.

181
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,880
 They was just all made up.

182
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,680
 And I don't think the home alone thing happened either, honestly.

183
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,840
 But now we're going to Belgium.

184
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,280
 We're going to Belgium and we're going to look at this guy.

185
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,200
 Let's take the carboner copter because I think this is going to be the last bit of

186
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,960
 levity we have for this episode unless an inappropriate joke pops up.

187
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,120
 But as we're flying over to Belgium, we're listening to can't be tamed Miley Cyrus's

188
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,400
 hit album.

189
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,600
 We're flying over to Belgium.

190
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,960
 I know I've already said that.

191
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,280
 And as we're flying over there, I tell you this, listen, this story is going to get a

192
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,760
 little dark.

193
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,800
 But at the same time, this guy is like, is such a weird idiot.

194
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,120
 This guy is such an idiot that you're going to keep thinking, how in the world has this

195
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
 guy not gotten caught?

196
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,880
 How is this guy just not really faced any charm, like charges for it?

197
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,960
 And it's going to, I mean, it's weird because he almost seems to have this weird sort of

198
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,720
 luck to him.

199
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,040
 And who we're talking about is Mark Dutrot.

200
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
 Dutrox?

201
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,440
 I think it's Dutrot.

202
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,400
 And it doesn't matter because that name doesn't really exist in that country anymore because

203
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,320
 this case was so bad that people changed their last name over it.

204
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,880
 They just wanted nothing to do with this name.

205
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,080
 And you're going to, every time I say something, you're like, that's not bad.

206
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,480
 Yeah, well, okay.

207
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,880
 So Belly, Mark was a career criminal.

208
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,120
 He looks like an accountant.

209
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:42,240
 He looks like a skinnier version of the red staple guy from the office space.

210
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,160
 He looks like a big old nerd, but he was actually a career criminal.

211
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:53,200
 And he was, his main thing was kind of robbing cars and raping and kidnapping girls.

212
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,240
 So a very odd choice of like, that's a weird spread to have.

213
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,600
 One is all about money making.

214
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,920
 The other one is kind of about self gratification.

215
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,440
 But again, wait till the end how this plays out.

216
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,480
 He actually was a very, very successful criminal to the point where he owned seven houses.

217
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,760
 Now I'm assuming that, you know, Belgium doesn't have the highest, I don't know how much houses

218
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,480
 cost in Belgium, especially this was back in like, this span the 1980s to like the 1990s.

219
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,280
 So I'm sure he was, you know, $10,000 a house.

220
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,240
 I'm getting hung up on the wrong point.

221
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:37,040
 He owned seven houses, three of them were specifically to torture and rape people.

222
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,520
 He owned three houses specifically to torture people.

223
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,840
 So he ends up in 1986 though, so early early on he pops up on the radar.

224
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,160
 I mean he'd done petty crimes and stuff like that.

225
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,800
 In 1986 him and his wife, Michelle Martin, I don't know why she has a different last

226
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
 name.

227
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:06,640
 Him and his wife in 1986 are caught and convicted of raping five young girls sentenced to 13.5

228
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,760
 years for five.

229
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,800
 Five young girls, he got sentenced to 13.5 years and you're thinking, oh my God, that's

230
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,480
 no time at all for five rapes.

231
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,360
 He only served three because the judge said he's a really good guy.

232
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,680
 He's really good in prison.

233
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,120
 Three years for raping five different girls.

234
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,240
 His grandma sees that mark is getting, his grandma sees that mark is getting paroled

235
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,800
 out three years later.

236
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,760
 She writes a letter to the judge saying, I don't think that's a good idea.

237
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,720
 I think he's up to something.

238
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
 Judge doesn't care, let's him go.

239
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,440
 So the next time we start to really see Mark engaging in this, at least that we have records

240
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:58,520
 of, 1995 two eight year old girls are kidnapped and taken to his dungeon.

241
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:06,160
 Now his dungeon, you know, you have his living houses, he has his torture houses, but in

242
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,280
 his main house that he lived in, he built a dungeon underneath the house or like in

243
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
 the basement.

244
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,640
 It was seven feet long, three feet wide, five feet high.

245
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,560
 So imagine how comfortable you would be in that.

246
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,840
 Five feet high automatically would be a no go for me.

247
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,080
 But seven feet long and three feet wide, that's basically just one person.

248
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,360
 He starts kidnapping women, multiple women and forcing them in here.

249
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,840
 First off, two eight year old girls are kidnapped right off the street by him and his wife,

250
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,800
 throwing in the basement.

251
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,320
 Two months later, so he's kept the girl, they don't find the girl, the little girls

252
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,720
 are in the basement and he keeps them for two months.

253
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,560
 Two months after that, he finds two teenage girls and connects them and throws them in

254
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
 the basement.

255
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,760
 So now he has four women underneath his house and his wife, it totally knows about it.

256
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,600
 She's totally a sicko too.

257
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,320
 And there's a friend that's kind of floating around in the periphery who ends up becoming

258
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,400
 a accomplice.

259
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,880
 So he has four girls in his basement, eventually two of the teenage girls, either they rebel

260
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,880
 too much or he gets tired of them, he takes the teenage girls out of the basement, buries

261
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,600
 them alive.

262
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,080
 He ends up, so his auto theft ring is about to be exposed.

263
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:39,440
 And he knows that one of the guys that's working for him has been, he basically has been holding

264
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,380
 a bunch of money, holding a bunch of the profits of the cars and is also being tailed by the

265
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,380
 police.

266
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:52,120
 So what Mark does, he invites them over to his house, which do not go over to a dude's

267
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,560
 house because it was pretty well known among his gang, I believe, that he was also doing

268
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,320
 this side thing with women.

269
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:05,680
 But anyways, this idiot goes over to his house and gets roofied by Mark and when the drugs

270
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,400
 wear off, you know those hose clamps that they're basically the metal circle that have

271
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,540
 the little screw on it and you can just kind of like put it around a hose and it gets tighter

272
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,820
 and tighter and tighter and then you turn the screw and it's locked.

273
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,220
 It's just basically a metal ring that you can tighten.

274
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,020
 The guy, the accomplice with the car ring wakes up to find one of those clamped around

275
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:34,540
 his nut sack and Mark screaming at him saying "where's the money, where's the money, the

276
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,700
 cops are after you, give me the money, give me the money."

277
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,300
 That sounds, that's the worst way to wake up.

278
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,960
 I can't imagine, I would, I think it would be better to wake up with an ax coming at

279
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,520
 you about to bust your head open than to wake up with a hose clamp on your balls.

280
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,280
 Because then you don't know what's going to happen, at least you know the ax is going

281
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,920
 to be over soon.

282
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,560
 The guy, the friend, the previous accomplice in this business together with his balls just

283
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,720
 being crushed, tells Mark "yes, yes, I will tell you where the money is."

284
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,660
 Mark then buries him alive, with the ball clamp still locked on and I think he probably

285
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,980
 had bigger things to worry about as the sand entered his airway but still he could have

286
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,060
 made it a little more comfortable.

287
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,620
 So Mark's like "awesome, I got the money, the guy the police were investigating for

288
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:30,940
 the auto theft ring is gone, the police will never find out that it was me behind the auto

289
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
 theft ring, he gets arrested.

290
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,820
 He gets arrested for stealing cars.

291
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,920
 They already had enough evidence on Mark to get him for stealing cars.

292
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,880
 They sent him to jail, this time they don't know about any of the murders, they sent him

293
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
 to jail for a year.

294
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,720
 Now a lot of times when you go to jail you have to make arrangements.

295
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,080
 You may have an employer and say you know I work construction and I was wondering, I'm

296
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,680
 going to jail for this auto theft thing, you think I'll still have a job when I come back

297
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,180
 and we'll talk about it, make arrangements about who's going to move your stuff, where's

298
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,180
 it going to stay, stuff like that.

299
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,460
 His arrangement was he told his wife, don't forget to feed the girls in the basement.

300
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,660
 Because remember they're still going to be in there, now that I'm not, wife's like

301
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,860
 "yeah I'll feed them".

302
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:24,780
 So he goes to jail for a year, when he comes out of jail, he comes home, he goes in the

303
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,740
 basement, both girls have starved to death.

304
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,440
 And the wife, Michelle, was like "I was too scared to go down there, they were making

305
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,080
 a lot of noise and they were banging on the wall so I just let them starve to death".

306
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:41,720
 So what do you do now that you have a bunch of dead kids in your basement and your mark,

307
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,920
 I guess I should add that one, you go out and grab somebody else.

308
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,280
 So they got rid of those bodies in 1996 so he just gets out of jail because you're having

309
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,980
 a problem with your life.

310
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,260
 Later he's driving around the town, he's a 14 year old girl, grabs her off the road,

311
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,020
 puts her in the car and this is where they see the wife helping him and an accomplice

312
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,300
 because at this point people are reporting "hey this van just came by and picked up this

313
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,420
 14 year old girl".

314
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:20,540
 The police follow it, they ID it, they arrest them and they free the girls.

315
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,620
 The end, right?

316
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,320
 So that's the story of Mark Dutroul.

317
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,880
 And you're thinking "okay he just seemed to be fairly lucky, he's able to kidnap all

318
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,680
 these girls and not get caught, he's able to pay for all these houses, some even specifically

319
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,640
 built for torturing people, he gets arrested for auto theft sure but he only does a year

320
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,240
 and then he comes out and he finds this stuff like he seems to be fairly lucky but his luck

321
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,920
 actually we haven't even scraped the surface of that because what happens is after he gets

322
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:58,060
 arrested a bunch of stuff comes out and the biggest thing is Mark says to the police "I

323
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:06,100
 am the number one provider of child and teenage sex slaves to people in high positions in

324
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,700
 this country.

325
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:15,220
 I have provided women to and girls to judges and politicians and police officers.

326
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,920
 They come to me when they want something that is illegal".

327
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,920
 Now of course this causes a big, big issue.

328
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,960
 Some of the police officers absolutely don't believe it right off the bat.

329
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,560
 They're like "that's not true, he's just trying to make it into this big thing, this is a

330
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,280
 psychological thing that killers do where they try to turn themselves into some sort

331
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,800
 of killing god, they're not just some lone weirdo, they're a part of some organization".

332
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,620
 And other people are like "that actually makes a lot of sense because this is what started

333
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,380
 coming out as they started investigating this".

334
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,420
 Because when he was being investigated for other crimes, car theft, other petty stuff,

335
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:02,340
 he offered money to a police informant to buy girls.

336
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,020
 Police informant, someone working with the police knew that he was in the market for

337
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,700
 young girls.

338
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,960
 He told the same police informant that he had built a cell, so you figure that could

339
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,800
 just be hearsay.

340
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:23,560
 His mom wrote a letter to the police saying "I think he has girls locked up in his basement".

341
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,360
 When the police were investigating him for car theft, they went to his house and they

342
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,600
 had a locksmith go around opening locks.

343
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,200
 And when they were in the basement, the locksmith said "I thought I heard people crying out

344
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
 for help".

345
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,700
 And the police were like "no no no no, that's no big deal, that's no big deal".

346
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:51,940
 And then there apparently was a videocassette in Mark's house that showed him building

347
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,420
 the dungeon.

348
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,980
 It would have showed exactly in the house where the dungeon was.

349
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,900
 And the police were like "during the trial, during the investigation into the police,

350
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
 they go "how come you didn't watch this tape?"

351
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,140
 And they said "we didn't have a VCR".

352
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,520
 So again, all of that stuff can be chalked up to incompetence on the part of police.

353
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,120
 So he says that he is protected by powerful people and the police let him do what he did

354
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,280
 because he was providing young women to powerful people.

355
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,400
 And they start investigating it and they come up, I mean all of this stuff could just be

356
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,880
 incompetence.

357
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,080
 But, then we get into the weird stuff.

358
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,620
 The stuff that isn't chalked up to incompetence, the stuff that's chalked up to, he might

359
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,380
 be telling the truth.

360
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,540
 This was actually before Mark's trial.

361
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,460
 They now opened an investigation into these allegations.

362
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,700
 Is it possible that Mark was providing girls to high powered people?

363
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,500
 They had to open an investigation into that.

364
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,820
 They got a seasoned judge, a guy not like Bacon seasoning, but a judge who had been around

365
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,720
 for years, they get him to oversee this investigation from the legal side of it.

366
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,680
 Like to basically, it's not like out there with a magnifying glass, but you know what

367
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,960
 I mean, like he's the guy who's basically going to look at all the evidence and decide

368
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,060
 whether or not they can go forward with this investigation charge.

369
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,080
 So it's not Mark's trial.

370
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,840
 It's a look into whether or not these things are true about what he's saying.

371
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,900
 The judge attends a charity dinner for one of his victims.

372
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,660
 And people go, "How can you be unbiased?

373
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,640
 How can you be unbiased if you're going to a charity dinner to raise money for a family

374
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,020
 of a girl who was raped and murdered?

375
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,520
 You can't be part of this investigation."

376
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,420
 Judge is like, "Whatever, like that's stupid, but whatever.

377
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:46,360
 I'm sure they will replace me with somebody just as diligent as is and intelligent as myself."

378
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,120
 The new judge who was taken over to investigate powerful people and find out what if these

379
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,320
 allegations are true?

380
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:02,500
 First time judge never handled anything like this before, handpicked almost to be incompetent.

381
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,580
 And immediately says, "I don't want any more evidence.

382
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,560
 I want us to go through the evidence that we have right now to see if these allegations

383
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
 are true.

384
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,620
 I don't want people to keep running around and investigating this stuff.

385
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,860
 Let's just go over all the stuff we have so far and decide whether or not to go forward."

386
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:23,560
 So really just quashed the investigation and just looked at any preliminary evidence that

387
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,880
 they had gathered.

388
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,760
 Huge protests and Brussels over this.

389
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,120
 Because this was a big story.

390
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,140
 You had all these young girls killed.

391
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,740
 You had this guy who took them 10, 15 years to catch.

392
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,120
 The victims that I've listed like the girls that we know, those are the ones we know about.

393
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,160
 He's saying there was a huge network of girls being kidnapped, raped and murdered.

394
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,900
 It definitely seems like he did more.

395
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,660
 Whether or not he was selling them to other people is the question, is where the conspiracy

396
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
 comes into.

397
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,540
 But the people of Brussels, the people of Belgium were pissed.

398
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:01,140
 300,000 people marched on the Capitol after that judge was removed and the new judge put

399
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,700
 it.

400
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,700
 People were furious because they saw this as government cover-up.

401
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:14,580
 The former judge, the judge who got canned for going to the charity dinner, was now brought

402
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:20,040
 back to testify during the investigation phase over whether or not this was a conspiracy

403
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,400
 theory.

404
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:28,800
 And he said, "We were told by police that murder contracts had been taken out against

405
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,760
 magistrates."

406
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:37,480
 So the police said, "Listen, somebody is trying to kill judges over this.

407
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,240
 We cannot guarantee your safety if you remain a part of this investigation."

408
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,660
 So long story short, the conspiracy investigation, after 17 months long, said there was no conspiracy

409
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,660
 at all.

410
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,740
 We've fully investigated ourselves.

411
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,980
 We did nothing wrong.

412
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,260
 There was some corruption.

413
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,580
 There was some incompetence.

414
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:01,220
 But we were not in any way dealing with that man and getting girls from him.

415
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,340
 We have fully investigated ourselves and that is not true.

416
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,780
 Case closed.

417
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,780
 People were furious, obviously, because they didn't believe it.

418
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:14,800
 They then moved to the trial of Mark Dutrou, got it done fairly quickly.

419
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,720
 He got sentenced to life because they eliminated the death penalty.

420
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,240
 His wife got, I believe, 17 years.

421
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:29,440
 She's out now and she has her own place that is owned by a judge.

422
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,880
 She's living in a judge's house, a house that a judge owns.

423
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:40,340
 This woman who was part of a ring that was suspected of dealing pedophilia and kidnapped

424
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,980
 girls to powerful people lives in a house owned by a judge.

425
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,580
 He goes, "Oh, everyone deserves a second chance."

426
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,380
 And to wrap it all up, you have the death threats against the people.

427
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,660
 That's the weird thing about this, is that you had the actual crimes, which is bizarre

428
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,500
 enough, but this whole conspiracy angle is what really threw it off.

429
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,480
 Now Mark says that he was dealing young girls and women to powerful people.

430
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,560
 Powerful people are saying that's not true.

431
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:14,120
 Every piece of evidence that you found is just a sign of our ineptness, our corruption, and

432
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,400
 our sloppy work.

433
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,520
 And yes, we should have caught him earlier.

434
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
 But we are never part of this.

435
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,840
 It was him and two or three people.

436
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
 And that was it.

437
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,960
 That was the only people involved in this.

438
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
 They've all been arrested.

439
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,160
 They've all been punished.

440
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:35,620
 During the course of the investigation into the allegations of the powerful people, twenty

441
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,660
 witnesses died.

442
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:46,820
 What's terrifying about that is I'm sure you had a lot of innocent people swept up in that.

443
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,420
 People, delivery drivers who just happened to turn their head at the wrong time, saw

444
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:56,860
 Mark talking to a police officer in a friendly manner, in uniform.

445
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,720
 Maybe there was a young girl in the back of the squad car.

446
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:06,120
 The delivery driver just looks a little too long and goes from being someone dropping

447
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:12,200
 off a Domino's Pizza to being a witness of a conspiracy and then eventually a body in

448
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,720
 the woods.

449
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,320
 Twenty deaths over a single court trial and they were involved in the court trial is a

450
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,640
 pattern of obviously that's a lot.

451
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,520
 I'm sure some of them were corrupt.

452
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:35,020
 Police officers or like local officials who were starting to really sweat over having

453
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:40,500
 to be investigated for their connections to Mark Dutrault and were being killed.

454
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,500
 But again, I'm sure a lot of them were people just like you and me.

455
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:53,020
 People who just looked a little too long at an otherwise normal situation and saw a monster

456
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,840
 of a man staring back at you.

457
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:22,320
 You didn't end up in his dungeon, but he still got you.

458
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,320
 You're not going to get away with it.

459
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,900
 (upbeat music)
