1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
 Today we go for a hike in the Orgonian Woods and watch our back for the sound of a noisy ghost.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,140
 Was he there? Was he there?

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we travel to Brazil to look at the story of a group of warriors who went toe-to-toe

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,420
 with a one-eyed alien and then that alien started sleeping with their women today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,920
 *music*

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too. We got a problem. We got a problem. It's a very interesting one.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,720
 We'll talk about that in a second. A little teaser for you.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,100
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Jimmy Moore.

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,700
 Jimmy Moore named after that hit Britney Spears song, "Jimmy Moore." I bet you didn't know that, Jimmy.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,820
 That's how you got that name. Jimmy, Jimmy Moore, Jimmy, Jimmy Moore.

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,860
 I love that song. Anyways, thank you, Jimmy. You are another enduring part of Britney Spears legacy.

13
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,660
 You are going to be our pilot, our guide for this episode. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine, too.

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,820
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,000
 We also have a merch store. It's in the show notes and

16
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,500
 if you're supporting the Patreon and I haven't gotten your address yet for the stickers, send me your address over.

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,960
 Because we're starting to mail those stickers out and they're really, really cool. Now, Jimmy,

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,540
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy, but just keep it idling right now. Outdoors, not, we're not in the garage.

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,860
 Something weird is going on. Something weird is going on. This is what I meant by saying we have a problem, guys.

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,020
 So every day I wake up and I go to

21
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,420
 about five different news websites. I go, quote-unquote, "news websites."

22
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,800
 I go to Fox News, CNN, Drudge Report. That's where I get my mainstream news at.

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,300
 And

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,020
 Drudge Report always has some weird tabloid headlines and stuff like that.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,400
 So I got that and then I'll go to the export and I'll go to Reddit. Between all of those combined, I usually get

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,700
 about four to eight leads. I may not fully investigate any of those stories.

27
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,180
 There may be a story that's so intriguing I'm recording that day.

28
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,660
 You can go either way. What's super weird is in the past five or six days

29
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,980
 I have gotten in almost no new stories at all across all those formats at all.

30
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,140
 The last story I got actually was from Reddit. We're gonna cover it Friday. It's a mind-blower.

31
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:32,160
 I never ever ever heard of this story before. It's absolutely jaw-droppingly nuts. Almost got no engagement on Reddit.

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,540
 Vito, Vito

33
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,660
 Scoletta sent me a story last night.

34
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,620
 I don't think I'm gonna do a full story on it, but I wanted to give him a mention because it's fairly interesting.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,900
 I guess the video this was on the export. The video game Carneval

36
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,180
 was created by... It was interesting because it started off really interesting and then like a lot of this stuff does.

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,900
 The mythology starts tripping up the myth. Originally the video game was supposed to have this deleted level

38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,920
 that was considered too obscene. When Midway was looking at it, it was a tunnel of love theme.

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,660
 Carneval is a light shooter video game where you're like, it's pretty gross, especially for its time.

40
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,960
 It came out in the 90s. And apparently they had a tunnel of love

41
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,740
 level that people thought probably had like S&M stuff in it. Midway goes gross. You can't do that. That's possible, right?

42
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,740
 There's possible some programmers are joking around.

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,240
 But then it gets into this thing that it's really this cult. This ancient cult was building the video game and some of the

44
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,940
 programmers were like working for the cult and one of them was trying to meet one of the Sailor Moon characters.

45
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,980
 And I checked out at that point. So thanks for the recommendation.

46
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,940
 But other than the story we're gonna talk about Friday, which I'm not gonna give away and

47
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,780
 the carnival story. Oh, oh, and some guys also saying he's made telepathic communication with a cute alien.

48
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,740
 I mean that that's all I've gotten in the past four or five days. I'm not covering that story, right?

49
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:57,720
 It's almost sea and you could say it's the news cycle. You go Jason, things are really turbulent right now.

50
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,880
 No, that's not it. I've been doing research like this for years and years and years and I've never run into a drought like this.

51
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,780
 I mean obviously it could be that I'm getting more picky, but I'm not even getting stuff to be picky about.

52
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:18,060
 Carnival, cute alien telepathic girl and the Friday story, which I'm probably hyping up at this point, but I mean it's super bizarre.

53
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,260
 And it's real. It's one of those stories that worked its way through the legal system and the court system and stuff like that.

54
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,300
 It involves all sorts of stuff. Space and conspiracy and truth, right?

55
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,700
 It almost... I don't know man. I don't know. I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

56
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,840
 It almost... I don't know man. It feels like maybe the veils tightening. Maybe they... and hopefully I'm wrong.

57
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,720
 Hopefully we just aren't some weird dry spell, but what if the world is getting less weird?

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,760
 It'd be a very dull place if across five websites that I normally get four to eight weird stories

59
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,040
 I'm finding nothing except two people arping on the export and then this

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,120
 story that happened back in the 80s. The weird story again happened in the past back in the 80s.

61
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,720
 So who knows, but it is something we're gonna keep an eye on. Okay, so you got that car warmed up, Jimmy.

62
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,060
 We are driving out from Hood River, Oregon. Burp, burp. We are headed to...

63
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,220
 Oh, Oregon. I forgot we're going to Oregon. We're leaving Hood River, Oregon. We are headed to

64
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,640
 Forest Grove, Oregon.

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,060
 So it's the early 1900s, Forest Grove, Oregon. And there we're gonna meet an unnamed dude.

66
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:31,780
 I know, I just heard your eyes roll. My eyes rolled as well. We just heard we are gonna meet this big giant

67
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,160
 unnamed dude.

68
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,660
 We're gonna name him Barry. He's just big strapping man. He's an outdoorsman.

69
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,760
 So of course you're gonna be strapping and he like does like chops down trees and stuff like that.

70
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,860
 That's not his job. He's actually an accountant. That's what he does on the weekend.

71
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,940
 He chops down trees, but he's most known not for being a big burly guy because that's pretty much a lot of woodsmen.

72
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,140
 It is, he's known for having a big brass bugle.

73
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,060
 He always carried around with him in the middle of the woods.

74
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:07,040
 Which you know, could be like a romantic thing, you know, like a guy up alone in the woods, his dog sitting next to him.

75
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,820
 You're like out and you see like a little silhouette on the mountain side.

76
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,740
 You see a little dog and you see a guy, a mournful soul with his bugle.

77
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,580
 And you're like stoking the campfire and stuff like that.

78
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:32,540
 That's not what he did. That's not what this guy did. That would be fine, right? That would be slightly romantic.

79
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,100
 But he wouldn't do that.

80
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,760
 He may have done that after work as the accountant. What he was known for, what this guy was known for, is you would be in the woods, okay?

81
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,760
 You would be in the woods. You're hunting. You're fishing. You're enjoying the solitude of

82
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,300
 nature. This is so funny. I love this guy.

83
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,900
 Except for what he does later. He would enjoy the solitude of nature. You go out to woods to find some peace.

84
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,880
 This dude would creep up behind, this guy would creep up behind you with his big bugle.

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,700
 Get as close as he could and go "BURR" and totally freak you out, right?

86
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,260
 You've been in the woods. You've been alone for like two hours at this point. Just a little fishing rod.

87
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,260
 Shhhhhh.

88
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,540
 Shhhh.

89
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,860
 And then "BURR"

90
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,140
 I'm moving away from the mic to do that sound effect. He wasn't. He was getting as close as possible

91
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,260
 to blow a giant bugle right in your ear. So people in town HATED his guts.

92
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,700
 They absolutely hated him.

93
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,180
 So when he was found murdered, or more specifically when he was found killed

94
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,940
 later on, I don't think there was a really big obituary written for this guy.

95
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,420
 Assuming he's real. Now again, before I finish the story,

96
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,900
 we're gonna put our skeptic cats on because we're gonna take it off in a second. This story,

97
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,620
 this is a local legend. The fact that we don't have an exact time period or the name of the guy makes it very suspicious.

98
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,500
 This guy may have never existed, but in Forrest Grove, this is a local legend. People do believe this is real,

99
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,580
 while others may just poo poo the whole thing. Burn that skeptic cat because now we're gonna get into the fun stuff.

100
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,420
 So anyways, this dude's body is found dead. Now the story is that

101
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,740
 they find him and next to him they find a

102
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:18,180
 dead mountain lion. And this dude was totally like all gashed up and stuff. "Ah no, the dramatic reenactment.

103
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,580
 No, my face. Oh no, not my arm. Oh no, my other arm."

104
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,200
 And he's getting eaten up by this dude, this mountain lion, but at the same time he's using this brass bugle.

105
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,400
 It's so heavy. He's just bashing in this mountain lion's skull.

106
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,340
 So they basically both kill each other in their blood pools together into one big puddle. And that's the end.

107
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,060
 I mean, that's that's interesting, right? A practical Joker getting killed by a mountain lion.

108
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,220
 Maybe he tried surprising him. Maybe the hunter became the hunted.

109
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,940
 But what makes this story unique is that it is one of the very few times

110
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,580
 that a ghost kills a person.

111
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,700
 Whaaat? You haven't even gotten to the ghost part yet. So what happens is they start finding people in the woods

112
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,340
 with their heads bashed in. What? What's going on? The detective comes out there. He's shining. They don't have flashlights.

113
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,940
 The detective comes out there. He's holding a candle. He's dropping wax all over the crime scene.

114
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,180
 He's covering up all the fingerprints.

115
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,660
 It appears that this man has had his face caved in. And according to all my experience being a forensic scientist and a band leader,

116
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,780
 I can tell that this injury, this injury is caused by a large brass bugle.

117
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:28,060
 Does anyone in town know anyone who has a large brass bugle? What? Well, Barry used to. Well, let's get him.

118
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,740
 Uh, Barry's been dead for two years, Detective.

119
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,060
 You like that? Theater of the Mind, folks! Bet you pictured that perfectly.

120
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,060
 People are starting to get found in the woods with their heads bashed in with the bugle. Now,

121
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,940
 it's funny. I was telling Sabine this story and I was like, yeah, and this ghost killed a bunch of people and she's like,

122
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,860
 oh, okay. I was like, that's super rare. It's incredibly rare

123
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,620
 to come across a story where a ghost is killing people. In my experience, like off the top of my head,

124
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,340
 I know of two. And I've been researching this stuff for decades.

125
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:11,980
 Two actual ghost killing people. We've had stories of like Freddy Kruger is based on a demon in Hmong culture.

126
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,020
 That's a demon. We've had stories about, um,

127
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,580
 actually have an upcoming story about a village that was getting killed by a spirit,

128
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,740
 but that was like a haunting curse. As far as a human dying and the ghost coming back and killing people,

129
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:32,300
 extremely rare. I, off the top of my head, I can think of two. Lucky Boy Mine, which we covered that a long time ago.

130
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,060
 We just did a repeat of that. And this story is very, very rare.

131
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,740
 And it's funny because Sabine was surprised because in the movies, it's super common. A ghost is killing people.

132
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,780
 That's the movies, guys. That's fake. In real life, in real ghost life,

133
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:54,060
 it's extremely rare. Extremely rare. So one, that makes me think that this guy was not killed by a mountain lion.

134
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:00,860
 If he existed, let's again, assume he just existed. Somebody got bugled by this dude, right? Just burp, right in his ear,

135
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:07,020
 and then killed him. And then, maybe he already had a dead mountain lion in the back seat of his car,

136
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,780
 and he's like, "Ugh, they didn't have cars." Maybe he had a back in the back seat of his horse.

137
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,500
 Throws a dead mountain lion on top of Barry, our bugler. Who knows?

138
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,540
 I mean, okay, that's a little, that's a little harder to pull off. He kills a man. He's like,

139
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,380
 "And now I must hunt a mountain lion to have the perfect crime." He spends the next four days in there trying to track down a mountain lion.

140
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:33,420
 But it doesn't make sense why a man would get killed by a mountain lion. A man who wasn't murdering people in the first place, okay?

141
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,340
 He was a normal jerk. He basically would have a YouTube channel with two million subscribers if he did this today.

142
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,220
 And he was a normal guy, and then he gets killed by a mountain lion, and then he begins murdering people.

143
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:53,020
 Like, that, first off, ghost murdering people is extremely rare. But then, to have just, I just think it's, that's weird enough, but then

144
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,060
 To not be a revenge-seeking ghost. The Lucky Boy Mine was a revenge-seeking ghost.

145
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:04,060
 There, there, odd story. The reason why people think that the bugler was doing this was that

146
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,580
 some guy almost got his head caved in, and he turns around, and as he sees the bugle coming towards his head,

147
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,020
 he turns around and sees a ghastly glowing outline of a man whose face was all gashed up.

148
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,980
 And he's swinging the bugle, and the guy jumped out of the way. And then he went to town and said,

149
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:27,580
 "This dude who, who may or may not be fictional, honestly, but this dude tried killing me with a bugle, and his face was all gross."

150
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,940
 And people go, "Oh, we know who that is. There's only one gross guy

151
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:37,980
 who ever played with a bugle, and that was Barry." So, an exceptional story because we have a ghost murdering people.

152
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,060
 It's super, super, super, and you could go, "Jason, well, you're cherry picking. Maybe the ghost demon."

153
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,340
 Even, even if we included demons killing people, we're still looking at maybe

154
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,860
 a dozen of like a ghost, of a non-caporial ghost. Not a possessed person, but a non-caporial ghost or a demon

155
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,620
 killing someone, not making them kill themselves, actually killing them. We're looking at maybe a dozen stories.

156
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,660
 It's incredibly, incredibly rare. So, basically, more of the story is, don't go to Forest Grove, Oregon.

157
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,820
 Apparently, their sky is making weird sounds. Their ghosts can do the impossible. People still think this guy's out there.

158
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,300
 This guy's still out there playing that lonely bugle. I'm actually thinking about

159
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,620
 visiting some of these haunted places in Oregon. If you guys know how much I despise

160
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:32,060
 traveling, you guys would be like, "Oh, I'd go there all the time. I don't like going any place I can't walk back home from."

161
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,620
 So, anyways, I may go to Forest Grove, or I may just stand the camera crew down there and I'll watch them.

162
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,820
 I'll watch them like Obama was watching Osama bin Laden being killed. I'm just watching on cam. I'm like,

163
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:48,300
 "Good job, guys." They're just like walking through spooky forests and I'm eating popcorn. I'm watching them just getting killed with bugles and I'm like,

164
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:54,220
 "Too spooky. I'm so glad I'm not there. So glad I sent out my B team." Not the fans that I really love.

165
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:01,740
 Jimmy Moore light up that carbonic copter. We're leaving behind Forest Grove, Oregon. I want you to fly us all the way out to Brazil.

166
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,540
 Flying over the Pacific Ocean. We're headed out to that emerald

167
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,900
 country. I don't know. The country with a bunch of trees. That's the only country with a bunch of trees.

168
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,740
 We're flying out there. Now, most of this information, really all of it,

169
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,860
 I got from a very well-written post on

170
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,660
 Above Top Secret is a website.

171
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,860
 It was written by someone named Fro Charroca.

172
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,140
 Fro Charroca. So I want to give a tip of the hat to that, a tip of the space helmet to you.

173
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:38,220
 Thank you so much for doing all this research. Now, I did find a couple other mentions of this. It wasn't a fictional story,

174
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,500
 but for the most part because of the age of the story and because of the language barrier,

175
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,780
 you don't find a lot of stuff. Like when people send me stuff from Mexico and Brazil,

176
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,820
 I really love to read it or really any country. I get stuff.

177
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,100
 But I was getting a lot of stuff from Fabio from Italy.

178
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,060
 There is that language barrier. It makes it a little bit harder.

179
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,620
 And actually, I can run a translate on it.

180
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,740
 Just there's not a lot of resources on it to begin with. It hasn't really got into the paranormal world.

181
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,620
 We're going to go out to the Serra Pucatote Mountain.

182
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,700
 Everything used to be sepia tone and now it's all lush green jungles and stuff like that.

183
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,220
 But this story still takes place fairly recently

184
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,220
 in the past 100, 150 years. So this story takes place an old time in Brazil.

185
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:32,940
 There's a tribe known as the Ben-Gochre tribe. So they're walking around and stuff. They can do other stuff.

186
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,580
 They can also sit and sleep, but there are no Matic tribe. So they go where the food goes.

187
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,540
 So they got their arrows and they're looking and they see like this gazelle standing there and they go to shoot in and moves.

188
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,900
 And then they go shoot in and moves again. They go to shoot it and it moves again.

189
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,260
 And they say they know they're 400 miles away and they finally kill it.

190
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,100
 And they're like, all right, where do we cook it at? And they're like, oh man, we left the fire.

191
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,620
 We left the fire all the way back there. So they got to set up a new fire.

192
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,820
 And then the next day they see Brazil walking, they're like, this time

193
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,860
 we're going to kill it right here. And then they end up in another country.

194
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:10,620
 They end up camping near this Sarah Pucatote mountain in Brazil. So they're sitting there.

195
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,260
 They're eating their gazelle, which I don't actually even think exist in Brazil, right?

196
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,820
 They're eating a taper or something, right? Originally they were hunting a gazelle in Africa

197
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,340
 and then they chased it across the ocean. It's all swimming. They're swimming after it.

198
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,580
 They end up in Brazil. So they're eating a taper. They're eating a big old bow constrictor,

199
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:35,740
 whatever's down there. And they see mist all around the mountain. And you're like, Jason,

200
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,940
 that's pretty normal. But this was cursed mist. See, at this mountain, they would often see like

201
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,580
 weird lights and like the mist seemed especially cursed. They're like, don't go to the mountain.

202
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,900
 That mountain's spooky. Like we can hang out down here. We can eat all the animals we want.

203
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,500
 Don't go to the mountain. But they are camping near the mountain. They see the mist.

204
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:04,060
 And then one time they see a light fly out of the dark night sky through the mist and then

205
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:14,140
 crash somewhere near the foot of the mountain. So they go, we better go investigate that tomorrow

206
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,100
 morning, right? Like let's not go. Let's not rush to go out there right now. What they used to describe

207
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,620
 it as was a flying canoe. So the next morning they get the warriors and they wake up. They get the

208
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,780
 actual street gang, the warriors. They fly them out from New York City. They get the warriors of

209
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,540
 the tribe and they're like, wake up, wake up. You got to go check out that big old flying canoe.

210
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,460
 And they're like, oh yeah, I forgot about that. The warrior is hoping everyone else forgot about it

211
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,620
 because he's super scared. He's like, oh yeah, I'm already sure it's nothing. I think I saw that last

212
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,180
 week. It's no big deal. They have it all the time. Anyway, the warriors, the super scared warriors

213
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:52,380
 go out to where it's at and they see a man, not a man, a humanoid thing kind of walking around

214
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,420
 where the canoe had crashed. And they're like, oh, that's weird. They see this guy walking around,

215
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:04,060
 right? And he's like big and puffy. He's like a big puffy dude walking around and he turns and he

216
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:11,580
 looks at the warriors and he has just one giant eyeball on his face. The warriors kind of, ah,

217
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,780
 first they just thought he was like a puffy albino dude, but now they realize he's an alien.

218
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,020
 So they start shooting arrows at him. That's their first instinct because this is an outsider,

219
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,420
 this is an invader. And the guy doesn't even flinch. Arrows are just going point,

220
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,820
 point, point, point, bouncing off of them. One eye just staring at him. And then the dude,

221
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:38,860
 this alien guy has this big old stick and he points it at a rock and the rock disappears.

222
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,140
 So the warriors can't look at each other at this point. Now they can't run away.

223
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,740
 This is the reason they exist. They have to protect their tribe. They've been training their entire

224
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,660
 life for combat. They get another volley of arrows. They're shooting arrows. Plink, plink,

225
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,020
 plink, plink, shoot him in the eye, shoot him in the eye. Someone says, "Plink, plink,

226
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:02,300
 doesn't matter." He points the staff at a tree. Poof! Tree disintegrates. One of the warrior pulls

227
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,580
 out his club, runs up and starts beating the guy, beating the alien up. Alien just shrugs the

228
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:13,100
 dude off. He points his wand at one of the tribe members. He passes out, just falls to the ground.

229
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,940
 He points at another one. Arrows are still bouncing off this dude. Bink, bink, bink, bink. He points

230
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,180
 another one. That guy passes out too. At this point the warriors are like, "Okay, I need to get a new

231
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,100
 profession. I wonder if I can still get into that hunter-gatherer thing I've been hearing about."

232
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,820
 They grab their fallen comrades. They take off into the jungle and they look behind and they see

233
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,940
 this one-eyed monster just kind of standing there. Not that one-eyed monster. Don't be perverted.

234
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,020
 They see it standing there. And from that time on people are like, "Okay, remember how we said

235
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,060
 like the mountain was cursed and all that like mist and stuff? It's 100% cursed now. There's a one-eyed

236
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,380
 monster there that he's shooting you with stuff. Again, don't be dirty. He's shooting you with stuff

237
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,820
 and he's making you fall asleep and just stay away from that mountain." And one's like, "What?"

238
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,340
 So people just kind of avoided that area. And since it's a nomadic tribe, it wasn't a huge issue.

239
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,260
 They're still kind of moving around the area. A couple years later some people are hanging out.

240
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:10,060
 They go to the like Laundromat, aka the lake to do their laundry. And someone sees this giant dude

241
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,620
 just skinny dipping. And they're like, "What?" And then they stand there and they watched for a

242
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,620
 while. And then like 20 minutes later they're still watching. And someone's like, "Hey, Onako,

243
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,460
 are you done doing the laundry yet?" And she's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, almost. I'm almost there."

244
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,660
 She's still watching this guy just swim around naked. And then after she's gotten a good eye

245
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,220
 full or two, she goes back to village. She's smoking a cigarette. She goes, "You guys won't believe what

246
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,460
 I saw. There's this giant naked dude skinny dipping and all the girls are like, "Oh, the

247
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,340
 Chawman's like, "No, no, no, you crazy girls. Let's send the warriors out." And the warriors are like,

248
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,900
 "Yeah, we want to see it too." So anyways, the warriors go out and there's this giant naked guy

249
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:51,260
 swimming in this lake. And he turns around and he goes, "Hey, hey guys, how you doing?"

250
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,940
 And he's speaking their language. And they're like, "What? How'd you know that? How'd you know

251
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,740
 speak a language?" And he goes, "I know a lot about you guys. You guys might not recognize me,

252
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,020
 because I'm this giant tall albino looking dude, but you guys shot a bunch of arrows at me a couple

253
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,340
 years ago." And they're like, "What? No, that was a one-eyed monster that we were shooting and stuff

254
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,180
 at." And he's like, "You mean that?" And he points over, "You guys might have picked up on this to

255
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:23,340
 begin with his space suit, his astronaut space suit." He says his name is Bepp Karoti. And in that

256
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:30,700
 language of that tribe, it means "starborn" or "man of the stars." And he goes, "Listen, I know we got

257
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,580
 off to a bad start. I paralyzed a couple of you guys and I destroyed that rock." And some guys

258
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,180
 like, "That was my favorite rock. I'm sorry, man. I know it was your favorite rock, but I was trying

259
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,900
 to show you guys how powerful it was. We got off to a bad start, but I'm kind of bored and lonely.

260
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,740
 You see, I'm not going to be able to leave for a while. I'm stuck here on your planet. Can I hang

261
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,700
 out with you guys?" So they invite him into the tribe. I mean, what are you... The other option

262
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,420
 is they say no, and he's like, "Then I'll destroy you all." I mean, like, you're going to invite him

263
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,620
 into your tribe, right? He's a super powerful monster man who paralyzed your greatest warriors.

264
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,860
 You're really not going to tell him no. So he comes to the tribe. He starts hanging out. Now,

265
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,860
 we have this weird classic tale where he's hanging out of the tribe and there's like a young maiden

266
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,540
 watching him. He has clothes on at this point. I'm assuming. I don't think he was naked the whole

267
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,060
 time. There's this young maiden kind of checking him out. And he's sitting there and he's eating

268
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,740
 dinner. And he's like, "Oh, this is really good." And she's like waiting him. She's like giving him

269
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,980
 little, like, dough-eyed eye-look things and stuff like that. You can obviously tell I'm a romantic

270
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,660
 at heart. And then there's like a scene where there's like a full moon and there's bugle music playing

271
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,740
 in the distance. And he's like, "I've loved you ever since I came to your planet." And she's like,

272
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,220
 and she's like starting to swoon. And then we cut to "Take Your Breath Away," musical montage of them

273
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:57,020
 banging in a hut. And then they're married. He ends up, the long story short is he ends up marrying

274
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,700
 this native girl. And she gives birth to two kids of his, a boy and a girl. And then he's there long

275
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:09,180
 enough to not only have made a peace treaty with the locals, but being a woman, raise two kids,

276
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:15,020
 and become a grandpa. His daughter has a kid. So they've been chilling here for a while. And his

277
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:23,180
 daughter's name was Cobb. So I mean, that's just a weird name. Maybe it's a normal name in that

278
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,300
 community, but I don't think so. I don't, it could be wrong. I could, that could be the most racist

279
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,860
 thing I've ever said on the show. They're like, "What? President of Brazil? His name is Cobb,

280
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:38,380
 you racist? I'm pretty sure it's a space alien name." Again, could be wrong, but the fact that her

281
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,260
 dad was a space alien, I think I'm fine on saying that Cobb is a space alien name. Anyways,

282
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:51,340
 while he's raising this family, he also starts teaching them to not be nomads anymore. They're

283
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,100
 like, "Go to hunt the gazelle." And he's like, "No, no, no. Not only is that animal not indigenous

284
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,100
 to this continent, but you don't have to do that anymore. I'm going to show you how you can build

285
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,900
 a civilization in one place. And I'm going to make your weapons better. I'm going to train your warriors

286
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,060
 to be better." And then there's a montage of him like training the warriors. They're like punching

287
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,580
 sides of gazelle flesh. They invent stairs and then they're running up them. And, and Beth is sitting

288
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,900
 there with his little timer. Click. Yeah, good job. Good job. It's a sundial. They have to run until

289
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,100
 it goes from 1 to 2 p.m. Everyone's training. He teaches them how to build a better society. And

290
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,300
 then, so everything's going great. He's met the love of his life. He's having kids. He's training

291
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,940
 these people to become much better fighters. He's training them to become a more cohesive

292
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:38,300
 civilization. So one day, everything's going great, right? He's building up their society. He has

293
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,180
 grandkids for crying out loud. One day he goes out on a hunt. He's showing the hunters how to do

294
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,380
 this stuff. He's like, "This is how you do it. You don't have to track them across two continents.

295
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,460
 You can do this." Arrow goes right through the taper's neck.

296
00:24:50,460 --> 00:25:00,860
 Great job, Beth. Thanks for showing us that. Beth? Beth? Beth is gone. Where did he go? I don't

297
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,220
 know. Where'd he go? The hunters get back to the village and everyone in the village is like,

298
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,860
 "Get ready. We think something bad's going to happen." And what happened? Well,

299
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:18,220
 Beth came back here and he painted his family black. So that's just weird. That's just weird,

300
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:23,980
 right? That's very, very uncommon that someone's going to come back, paint their family any color,

301
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:30,380
 really, and be having a good day. But he paints them black and he locks them in the hut. And as

302
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,860
 they're telling the hunters this, they notice Beth, he's walking out from behind the hut,

303
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:44,060
 wearing his astronaut suit, which everyone in town knows full well is arrow proof and spear proof

304
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,780
 and club proof. And he walks into the center of the village and he starts going, "Okay, guys,

305
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,500
 who's going to fight me? I am taking control of this village unless one of you guys stops me."

306
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,420
 Or like, "You're a space alien who's indestructible and you have magical powers. We're not going to

307
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,620
 fight." Because no one will fight him, he starts upsetting the forest on fire. He's like, "Okay,

308
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,540
 who's going to fight me? Who's going to fight me?" And people are like, "Bep, no one's going to fight

309
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,780
 you, right?" First off, there's a raging forest fire behind you and I'm pretty sure your family's

310
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,260
 in a thatched hut. So not a great planning on that one. But secondly, bro, we're not going to fight

311
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:25,340
 you. What's going on?" And Beth says, "That's it. That's it. I'm out of here." And he walks out of the

312
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,940
 village, flaming forest fire, leaving his family painted black in the hut. He walks out of the

313
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,300
 village and they watch him. I don't know how they saw this part. This is not part, I mean,

314
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:39,180
 unless Inspector Gadget has his telescope of guys, they watch him walk all the way to the mountain.

315
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,180
 And at that point, a beam, booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

316
00:26:39,180 --> 00:27:09,180
 And at that point, a beam, booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

317
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:16,780
 They're like, "What just happened?" She's like, "I don't know why my dad did that, but I do know this."

318
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:23,500
 He'll always be in here. She taps her head. Because I've been in contact, I'm in telepathic

319
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,460
 contact with him. And if we ever need our help again, he'll come back. Fast forward years later,

320
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,940
 crops aren't doing too well. All of the structure that Beth had set up starts to fall apart. Crops

321
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:42,780
 aren't doing well. Famine hits, disease hits. The village is dying off. And one day, and the

322
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:48,140
 daughter's watching all this happen and everyone's getting sick and she goes, "Now's the time."

323
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:58,140
 In our darkest hour, she paints herself and her kid and her husband black. She prays to her father.

324
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:05,500
 The light canoe comes back. He comes back down, goes, "What? What? You guys have totally messed

325
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,100
 this stuff up. I told you to irrigate, irrigate, irrigate. What's this?" He replants all their

326
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,140
 crops, gives them new crops, gives them crops that were not indigenous to the area at all.

327
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,900
 He shows them how to build stone houses, which technically you should have shown him how to do

328
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,620
 that the first time. He actually tells them to get closer to the mountain. This should be your home,

329
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,460
 closer to the mountain. This mountain will help protect you. And they changed the name of the

330
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:36,940
 tribe at that point to the Kayapo. And to this day, they have celebrations where the people in the

331
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:43,260
 village have a bamboo suit that they wear and they dance around in as their celebration to Beth.

332
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,180
 Now, what's interesting, when you look at the photos of this guy, the first thing you think of,

333
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:55,500
 that looks like an astronaut suit. In the 1970s, you had some kids that had come from those tribes

334
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,980
 into other big cities. This tribe still exists. It's not one of those completely isolated tribes.

335
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,580
 And this story I told you about, this is when I said "Old Time Brazil," we're not talking

336
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:15,340
 1400s, 1200s, 600s Brazil. We're talking like 1700, 1800s Brazil. There was a time period,

337
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:21,260
 fairly recently, that the story took place. This isn't a creation myth. The conquistadors had already

338
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,540
 been there. This tribe was already interacting with other nations. But they're just like, "Nope,

339
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,060
 we don't want any part of that." And they were moving around Brazil. This wasn't an ancient,

340
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,860
 ancient myth. So you have people still doing the ceremony at Beth. And when you have these kids

341
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,220
 do a cultural exchange, they went to a big city and they're seeing footage and seeing photos of US

342
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:49,580
 astronauts landed on the moon, they go, "That is what Bep Karate looked like." That is, that's exactly

343
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:55,340
 what he looked like. That was the description. That one eye is basically the giant glass advisor.

344
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,220
 Which is how you, if you're calling stuff flying canoes, if you saw an astronaut turn around and

345
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:07,900
 look at you, it would look like a giant eyeball. So that's the story of Bep Karate. It definitely could

346
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:14,380
 be, we got to run through these always, it could be fiction, it could be 100% fiction made up

347
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:20,780
 that's leaked onto the internet and has become this story. It's definitely possible too. It could be

348
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,900
 made up at the time. It could be a legend that was made up by the tribe to explain certain

349
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,140
 things. Someone's like, "Where'd you get those beet seeds at?" And he's like, "Oh, let me tell you a

350
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,900
 story. Let me tell you a really long complicated story about an alien coming down and having kids

351
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,140
 and stuff like that." The person who originally made the story popular before it got to a

352
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:47,100
 above top secret was Hawa Ameriko Arett. He was a researcher who worked with native tribes and

353
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:52,300
 he was with the tribe like in the 70s. So even if it was 100 years from when he, even if their

354
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:58,300
 timeline was accurate, we're talking 1800s. I'm giving them a little bit of wiggle room, but that

355
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,500
 means that that genetic line, Bep's kid, if he had a daughter and the daughter had a son,

356
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,940
 and that was only 100 years ago, 150 years ago maybe, you know, give or take some years,

357
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,420
 and that was happening, that genetic line should still exist in that group of people. There should

358
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:21,260
 still be someone who were now maybe five generations removed, six generations removed from this story.

359
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:28,220
 We should still be able to find a spark of genetic information of this star man. But the thing is

360
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,380
 this story is so obscure nobody really knows about it. If this story was more popular, you know

361
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,420
 that History Channel or Gaia or whatever would send someone out there to start testing these

362
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,260
 people's DNA to see if they could find the star child. Nobody knows about this story. I think

363
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,820
 it'd be really interesting and I think people in that community would want to know, because it would

364
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,220
 prove their story that their culture is based around. So yeah, if you work for one of those

365
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,820
 companies, why not? If you work for one of those companies and you're listening to my podcast,

366
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,780
 let's do this. We can actually, again, with their permission, I'm not saying that we need to take

367
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,900
 their blood against their permission, but with their permission, let's find, we can prove if this

368
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:11,980
 is real. If this is real. If there really was a man from the stars who slept with a woman and had

369
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,860
 kids and grandkids, and most likely it went on from there, and then came back again to give

370
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,700
 him more fruits and vegetables and stuff like that. Maybe, you know, dropped off a couple of

371
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,180
 gazelle. Those gazelle they'd been hunting all along, Bepp dropped some off from their ship.

372
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,420
 So if you're ever driving through the middle of nowhere and you happen to see a spaceship crash

373
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,140
 in the distance, you will want to check it out. I think we all would want to check it out. I would

374
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,780
 check it out via webcam. But if you drive off towards the crash site to see if there really is a

375
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:43,340
 crash ship there, just make sure that you're not traveling with any attractive women, or if you

376
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,660
 are an attractive woman yourself, just be prepared. Because the alien that crashed on the ship may

377
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:55,180
 not just be an indestructible warrior. He may also be a man looking for the love of his life.

378
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,540
 I mean, ladies, could you could you do worse than an alien? Who can make stuff disappear?

379
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,420
 But guys, be careful, because you're hunting with your girl and she sees this giant naked

380
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:11,500
 dude walking around. No matter how much you swing your club, it doesn't work. This other guy just

381
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:17,420
 get bounces off this other dude. Don't blame me when she leaves you. I'm telling you right now,

382
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:23,740
 if you if you want to keep your girlfriend, don't go towards the crash UFO. But if you're a girl

383
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,740
 and you're looking for love, you should just keep heading out to that crash site till you approach

384
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:36,460
 the radioactive debris. Now that's not dangerous. That's just the glow of romance.
