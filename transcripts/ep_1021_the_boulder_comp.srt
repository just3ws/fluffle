1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
 A graveyard is spooky.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,800
 A haunted graveyard is even spookier.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,040
 But what if you could visit a graveyard that wasn't just full of ghosts and ghouls, but

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,920
 was also inhabited by a sex-crazed demon?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,240
 We'll check out one of those in a bit.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,320
 And then we take a deeper look into a mystery we covered not too long ago.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,280
 We got an update to the bizarre phenomenon known as Darkness Egyptian.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,160
 Then we travel to Ireland to take a look at a haunted castle.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,080
 But we're not worried so much about the spooks that are hiding among the rubble of this once

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,960
 grand structure.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
 No.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:52,160
 It is simply the journey to the castle that may split reality into today on Dead Rabbit

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
 Radio.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:03,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,040
 I'm your host, Jason Garvin, and I'm having a good day.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,400
 I hope you guys are having a good day too.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,600
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,880
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,000
 So first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our Christmas livestream contributors.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,920
 Everyone get on your feet, but make sure you don't squish them.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
 It's B.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
 Woohoo!

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,120
 We're flying around in between our claps.

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
 Woohoo!

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,360
 We're now we're actually trying to squish them.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,000
 B, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,160
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I get it.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,560
 I truly do.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
 That helps out so much.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,280
 Tell your friends, tell your family, tell everyone that Dead Rabbit Radio is awesome.

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,240
 Even if you don't think it's true, even if you're like, "Eh, it's okay."

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,360
 It's a good way to kill that 45 minutes an hour.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
 Just tell them, just lie.

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,160
 It's the greatest thing you've ever heard.

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,000
 B, let's go ahead and start off.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,920
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the hare hovercraft.

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,120
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command Hoverus all the way out to Florida.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
 Vroom!

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,760
 Vroom!

41
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,600
 Hovercraft is hovering.

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,240
 Little bees on the controls.

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,480
 It's a quite a journey.

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,880
 It's pretty fun.

45
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,120
 Specifically, we're headed to Clay County, Florida.

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,160
 This is the home of the town Green Cove Springs.

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,320
 It sounds quite quaint, right?

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,160
 Sounds like you go there.

49
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,400
 Everything's picturesque.

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
 Sounds pretty nice.

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
 It sounds like a pretty nice place.

52
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:41,880
 I was actually looking at satellite photos of this town to try to figure out where this

53
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
 story took place.

54
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,720
 Thank you Google Maps for spying on us.

55
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,440
 That courtesy of CIA funding and technology.

56
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,960
 We're in Green Cove Springs.

57
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,680
 If you're in this area, you can check it out.

58
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,320
 But bring protection.

59
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,680
 And when I say that, I don't mean holy water or a shotgun full of salt rock.

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,400
 Talk about condoms.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,800
 You might want to bring condoms if you're investigating this cemetery.

62
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,960
 I will also say now, if you ever are ghost hunting with someone and you notice in their

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,880
 backpack they brought condoms and you're not going to the cemetery, you might want to be

64
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,640
 a little bit careful.

65
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,720
 You might have some other intentions in mind.

66
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,680
 A short while off of Highway 17 in Clay County, there is, this is very interestingly named,

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,520
 its Little Ruth Church Cemetery.

68
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,160
 Now I don't know if the, like I'm looking at a satellite photo, I'm looking at a photo

69
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,760
 taken 50,000 feet in the sky.

70
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,680
 There was a building, it may or may not be the church.

71
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,040
 It was interesting because the descriptions would sometimes refer to, actually I was able

72
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,160
 to find one description on the Google Maps that said Little Ruth Church.

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,680
 Everything else said Little Ruth Church Cemetery.

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,120
 So I don't know if the church is somewhere else.

75
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,240
 But it's, what's interesting, it's a huge field for such a little church.

76
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,400
 Like there's this little white building and there's like a tree kind of obscuring its

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,680
 view.

78
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,400
 So I go, well maybe that's the chapel, but it's a pretty big field and that's not including

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,680
 the graveyard.

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,880
 There is an old timey graveyard there.

81
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,960
 That includes around 150 graves.

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,920
 That's a ton of people.

83
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:30,120
 And this area locally is known for having a lot of ghostly activity.

84
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,480
 So we're there late at night, we're walking around.

85
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,720
 And we see behind one of the gravestones a shadowy figure though.

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,600
 We go, wow, we're all pretending to be amazed.

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,880
 Whoa, shadowy figures in the graveyard.

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,160
 Be still like beating heart.

89
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,840
 This is dead rabbit radio man.

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,040
 We expect more from our haunted graveyard.

91
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
 We've rocked condoms after all.

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,440
 We expect more.

93
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,760
 This place has been reported to have shadowy apparitions moving around the gravestones.

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,040
 Also this is what I'm talking about.

95
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
 This is crazy.

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,640
 It's not that crazy, but it's not as crazy as we're going to get.

97
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,120
 But it's better than shadow people.

98
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,640
 There's this entity known as the runner.

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
 Locally is known as the runner.

100
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,880
 He's a shadowy entity, but this one just doesn't pop up behind tombstones.

101
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,600
 He follows you around.

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,920
 People say when they walk through the cemetery, they hear the sound of the, they've seen him

103
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
 as well.

104
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
 It's a shadowy entity.

105
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
 He's walking around the cemetery.

106
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,720
 You'll hear the sound of someone walking behind you.

107
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,200
 And they said it's a distinct shuffling sound, as if someone was scuffing a foot against

108
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,840
 the ground as they were walking.

109
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,920
 That's interesting.

110
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,240
 What's also interesting though is this ghost has quite the perimeter.

111
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,440
 What people have said is that this ghost has also been known, if you're walking down Highway

112
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,680
 17, he'll follow you out there, which is a couple blocks away from the cemetery.

113
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,960
 You'll be walking down the highway and you'll hear this sound like someone's walking behind

114
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
 you.

115
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,040
 And to be so far out of the cemetery, quite interesting.

116
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,800
 That's where we're getting just beyond just shadowy figures popping up from behind gravestones.

117
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
 But that's not why we're here.

118
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
 We are paranormal investigators.

119
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,800
 Listen, I would, if there was a haunted graveyard within walking distance and all that happened

120
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
 was the shadowy figure jumped out from behind a tombstone, I would investigate it.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,800
 If it's in walking distance, if it's any farther, I was like, "Oh, I have to pack a car and

122
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
 stay overnight.

123
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 I'll let someone else do it."

124
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,520
 I want the good stuff.

125
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
 That's why we're here.

126
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,200
 I would go to investigate the runner.

127
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,080
 I would pack up a suitcase and stay the night to investigate a phenomenon like the runner.

128
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,400
 But this is super interesting.

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,680
 Apparently in this graveyard, there is a succubus.

130
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,680
 There is a lust-fueled demon in this graveyard.

131
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,880
 And that's super rare.

132
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
 Succubi in and of themselves aren't incredibly rare.

133
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,880
 I mean, like, on the higher, they're far more rare than ghosts.

134
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
 Far more rare than ghosts.

135
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
 But I mean, they're all over the literature.

136
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,320
 They're all over the ghost lore, the paranormal lore, demonic lore.

137
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:26,040
 Succubi are quite common in that sense.

138
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,960
 And generally, it's something that you summon or something that comes after you.

139
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:40,320
 I cannot recall a location-specific succubi.

140
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
 That's what makes this intro.

141
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,120
 I mean, again, a lust-fueled demon.

142
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,960
 Yes, I would cross the country to investigate that if there was a verified...

143
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,000
 Not just because I'm a horn dog, but because now we're talking about high-level...

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,920
 And I don't mean to dismiss shadow people.

145
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
 I don't...

146
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
 Because I've had my experiences with shadow people.

147
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
 They are terrifying.

148
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,400
 It's just like, if I always reported...

149
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,280
 If I just did stories about shadow people, that was all I would cover.

150
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
 Those stories are super common.

151
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
 That's what I'm saying.

152
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
 It's not like I'm trying to diso...

153
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
 Oh, blame.

154
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,080
 I'm all calling them losers as they're manifesting in my reality.

155
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
 It's not what I mean.

156
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,960
 I think a long-time listeners of the show know how I'm talking about it.

157
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,240
 It's like, otherwise, that'd be all I'd cover.

158
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,560
 We try to cover more extreme, weird, high strangeness on the show.

159
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,160
 So yeah, like a Succubi, if there was a location-specific Succubi...

160
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,000
 Because I wouldn't manifest one in my house.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,920
 I wouldn't manifest just a ordinary demon in my house.

162
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,840
 Let alone a sex-fueled maniac from beyond the nether.

163
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
 Like, no.

164
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,720
 I don't want that walking around my house.

165
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,120
 So if there was a place I could go and want to follow me home, yeah, I'd go check it out.

166
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,200
 But a location-specific Succubi, that's super rare.

167
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,120
 I can't think of another place.

168
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,580
 And like, how did it get there?

169
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
 What is it doing there?

170
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,960
 It doesn't seem like it would have a lot of foot traffic.

171
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,920
 So it's in a band and cemetery next to a church.

172
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,960
 But what's interesting about it, this may be real, and if it is real, you have a...

173
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,400
 Because, again, the big thing, like, you see a lot of this in the paranormal community,

174
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,200
 people trying to summon Succubi.

175
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,920
 You have all the young men out there wanting to summon one of these and have sex with these

176
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,600
 creatures, and that's the big problem, not having sex with a creature, which is risky,

177
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,520
 but how to summon it.

178
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,680
 How to get it to come into your bedroom in the first place.

179
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,520
 What type of magic do you have to work?

180
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,520
 What type of incantations, anything like that, do you need to do to get one of these things?

181
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,720
 But if you could just go to a location, I mean, it would really be the difference between

182
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,720
 going through the trouble of getting a girlfriend and maintaining a relationship, first going

183
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
 to a strip club.

184
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,240
 You know where the strip club is.

185
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,000
 You know where to go, you know what the address is, you know, everything you need to do, you

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,360
 pay the right amount of money, you get in.

187
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,240
 Getting a girlfriend, you're like, "Do I pick her up at church?

188
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
 Do I pick her up at a bar?

189
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,480
 Do I pick her up at a club?"

190
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
 You know what I mean.

191
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,400
 So if you had a location specific Succubi, I could see, like, almost this would be a

192
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,360
 tourist destination.

193
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,760
 Super fascinating if this thing is real.

194
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,800
 I found a couple different accounts of it.

195
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,240
 It doesn't give us any detail what she looks like.

196
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,120
 I mean, you assume sexy, but you also figure she's a demon and she'll probably show her

197
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,520
 true form at some point.

198
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:31,120
 What I find interesting is going back, this property has a huge field attached to it.

199
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,600
 And there's no buildings there, there's no graves there, it's just this huge field.

200
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,680
 And it's fenced in along with this white building under the tree.

201
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,440
 And I wonder, let's put on a conspiracy cap, that that field, no one else wants to build

202
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
 there, no one else wants to buy that property.

203
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,160
 They just let that be undeveloped property because there is something dark there.

204
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,760
 There is something there that shouldn't be.

205
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,400
 You don't want to build a Kmart there.

206
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,040
 You don't want to put up a Dairy Queen.

207
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,960
 So it just remains unsold and undeveloped.

208
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,160
 Again, there's nothing there, it's just this big open field.

209
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,680
 But it is fenced in with the same property.

210
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,200
 So that is the story of Green Cove Springs.

211
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,120
 I wonder if any of you guys are willing to go investigate it?

212
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,520
 If so, let us know.

213
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,920
 I'd be really interested.

214
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,120
 Or not, because you could easily be devoured by a succubi-

215
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,600
 Again, this is one of those things that if it was closer to me, or if I had more resources

216
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,320
 I would go on investigate it.

217
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,920
 Shadow of the Fingers hopping behind a grave.

218
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,040
 I've seen stuff like that.

219
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,800
 It is terrifying, but I would like to see something else.

220
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,520
 Which you know what's funny, super dangerous for a paranormal investigator to have that

221
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
 mentality.

222
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,800
 Super dangerous.

223
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
 So I might want to check myself.

224
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,520
 I might want to check myself, because that actually, that really can put you in some

225
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,640
 real dicey situations where you're like, "This stuff is boring.

226
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,080
 I want to see the real hardcore paranormal stuff."

227
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,480
 And then it comes for you.

228
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,280
 So you've got to be careful.

229
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,640
 B, let's go ahead and touch the keys for the Jason Jalopy.

230
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,240
 We're leaving behind Florida.

231
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,160
 We're going to head all the way out to Louisville, Kentucky.

232
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,000
 This story is actually a quick update to a story we did a couple weeks ago.

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,160
 I talked about this phenomenon called Darkness Egyptian.

234
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:35,720
 We discovered it in a Russian-based paranormal article.

235
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:43,880
 And it was stories of entire areas going completely black for a period of time.

236
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,200
 And very bizarre phenomenon happening in this stuff.

237
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,960
 People were teleporting around, massive amounts of loss of time.

238
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,400
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

239
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,560
 And really that also connected to some stories we've been covering in the past as well.

240
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
 What I've coined the black bedroom phenomenon.

241
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,440
 It's something that these accounts are just popping up randomly.

242
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,160
 No one else has been connecting the dots.

243
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,000
 I find it absolutely fascinating.

244
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,160
 People waking up in their bedrooms and all the lights are off, but not just because it's

245
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,660
 nighttime.

246
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,800
 Like literally they're in a pitch black void and they'll walk and walk and walk and walk

247
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,680
 and walk and they'll never find their walls.

248
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
 And then they're just like, "This is just too weird."

249
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
 And they go back to bed and when they wake up everything's back to normal.

250
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,040
 Their wall is only like six feet away from their bed.

251
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,880
 People have looked out their bedroom windows and the entire world is dark outside.

252
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,040
 It's a super fascinating phenomenon.

253
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,520
 We don't know what's causing it.

254
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,120
 So when I found this article called Darkness Egyptian, that's a translation error because

255
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
 it's Russian.

256
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,300
 They're talking about the Egyptian darkness and the Egyptian plagues and all that stuff.

257
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,600
 One of the places we covered was Louisville, Kentucky where for 10 minutes the entire city

258
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,880
 went pitch black and it was so dark it was said that people who smoke cigarettes had

259
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,320
 little match books in their pockets and they were lighting matches and they could hear

260
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,960
 the sulfur igniting but they couldn't see the flame in front of them.

261
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,080
 And there were reports of people teleporting like you would walk maybe a block or two but

262
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,560
 when the darkness left after 10 minutes they found themselves on the other side of town.

263
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,360
 One woman found herself in a locked room in her house.

264
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,560
 She somehow walked through the wall.

265
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:29,000
 Well Sean on our Discord, Sean, Patreon supporter, Sean's a member of the Patreon Discord, found

266
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,560
 this so awesome Sean.

267
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
 This is what I love about you guys.

268
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,440
 I see this show as I try to be entertaining and I try to give you the resources that if

269
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,440
 you guys are more, that's why each story is only like 10, 15 minutes long.

270
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,840
 If you guys are more interested in the particular subject, I love it for you guys to do more

271
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,920
 research on your own and find this stuff because I didn't find this.

272
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,680
 He found, because I said, we don't know if any of this stuff is true, like these accounts.

273
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,120
 I said specifically the Louisville, Kentucky story.

274
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,560
 I go, you figure this would have been in the news if this was real.

275
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,440
 I go, is this just some urban legend?

276
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,840
 Like it's not popular in America at all.

277
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,520
 This was coming out of a Russian website.

278
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,840
 I go, I wasn't able to find anything.

279
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,960
 Sean found an article about this.

280
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:24,680
 The Courier Journal published an article in March 8, 1911 called "In Darkness".

281
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:33,320
 And the article states, quote, "A pall of darkness lasting for a period of 10 minutes."

282
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,440
 So crazy, like we actually got verification of this.

283
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,480
 There's still a twist, quote, "A pall of darkness lasting for a period of 10 minutes during

284
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:50,840
 which time the city was as dark as night fell over Louisville shortly after 8 o'clock yesterday

285
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,800
 morning.

286
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:03,880
 During this time period, it was impossible to distinguish an object only a few feet away."

287
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,200
 So what happened?

288
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
 Like that was the big question.

289
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,640
 Like if a whole city went dark, you figure there would be some contemporary record of

290
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
 it.

291
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
 I couldn't find it.

292
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
 Sean did.

293
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
 Isn't that awesome?

294
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
 Sean found this article.

295
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
 This is contemporary.

296
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
 This is a local news source.

297
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,960
 It said people headed to work couldn't see anything.

298
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,680
 The whole city was pitch black.

299
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,920
 They had to find shelter.

300
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,640
 They didn't know where to go.

301
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,080
 You're basically just going into any open storefront or something, hopefully where there's other

302
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,360
 people so you could all panic together.

303
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,160
 But this article has some details that is left out of the Russian website.

304
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,880
 That was written, I think the Russian website if I remember correctly, mid-2010s.

305
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,560
 If I remember correctly, I think it was like from 2012, 2015, somewhere around there.

306
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:02,480
 Maybe 2017 was when I found the earliest version of the story of darkness Egyptian.

307
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
 But here we have a contemporary article.

308
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,560
 It says two minutes after the city went black.

309
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,960
 Couldn't see anything a few feet ahead.

310
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,600
 The temperature dropped four degrees.

311
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,120
 It was 44 degrees, which is so pretty cold.

312
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,000
 It was 44 degrees.

313
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,280
 The world goes black.

314
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,800
 Now it's 40 degrees.

315
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:41,440
 And a massive storm erupts throughout the city.

316
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
 Rain and hail.

317
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,200
 Rain fell down on the city streets.

318
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,920
 Hail bombarded the people who couldn't find shelter.

319
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
 That's another reason why they had to find shelter.

320
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,760
 This massive storm breaks out.

321
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,760
 Rain and hail smash across the landscape.

322
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
 Winds, that wasn't bad enough.

323
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,080
 You're like, I can take a little hail.

324
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,480
 Winds of up to 60 miles an hour swept through the city.

325
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,440
 You would think it was the end of the world.

326
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
 Right?

327
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,000
 You've been in rainstorms.

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,120
 You've been in hailstorms.

329
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,360
 But you've never been in pitch blackness.

330
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
 And those things happen.

331
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 I mean, maybe at night.

332
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,880
 But not like you're walking around at eight in the morning and then all of a sudden everything

333
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
 goes pitch black.

334
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,040
 Now you notice it's different.

335
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,120
 This one, you couldn't see things a few feet away.

336
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,160
 It's not the darkness where if you lit a match, you couldn't see it if you held it

337
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,480
 up to your face.

338
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
 That was one of those accounts.

339
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,960
 I mean, that won't let me want to be able to light a match in a rainstorm anyways.

340
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,600
 But remember, there was a couple minutes in between the darkness falls.

341
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,320
 You have no idea what's going on.

342
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,560
 Then this storm hits.

343
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,040
 A local weather bureau the next day explained what had happened.

344
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,560
 What they had said was that there was a low cloud formation that was moving so low across

345
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
 the ground.

346
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,520
 It was picking up dust the entire way.

347
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,080
 And as it got closer to Louisville, it began to pick up dust from the city and all of the

348
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
 smoke.

349
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,480
 Again, this is 1911.

350
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,080
 They probably have their smoke stack district.

351
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,160
 You have a low cloud coming in, picking up all the dust along the way.

352
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,160
 Now it's picking up more dust in the city and smoke from the city.

353
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,800
 And when it came over Louisville, it basically turned the lights off.

354
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,520
 That's what the weather bureau says happened.

355
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,040
 It's also interesting to note that the darkness Egyptian story, it only took place in Louisville.

356
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,560
 It turns out that this storm was far bigger than just Louisville.

357
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,800
 It was actually damaging other towns.

358
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,240
 You had in Owensboro, Kentucky, roofs ripped off of buildings.

359
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
 The storm was so bad.

360
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,880
 A church was completely leveled, but no fatalities in Owensboro.

361
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,440
 And then another church, oddly enough, another church in Hindersen, maybe they were poorly

362
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,560
 constructed, but another church in the nearby town of Henderson was destroyed.

363
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,480
 Tons of damage to that town as well.

364
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:10,080
 They said in Henderson, the cloud wasn't this pitch black void, but it was green.

365
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,560
 It was black and green.

366
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,600
 Again, you would think it was the end of the world if this type of stuff came out of nowhere

367
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
 and happened.

368
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,720
 So that's super fascinating.

369
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,040
 So we do know that the phenomenon was real.

370
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,240
 There's a bit of an exaggeration.

371
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
 I mean, here's the thing.

372
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,600
 There's two ways we can look at this.

373
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,800
 One we can go, the darkest Egyptian thing, maybe through no fault of their own, right?

374
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,840
 There's over 100 years between these stories.

375
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,320
 And if a Russian website's reporting it from an American newspaper, you're going to have

376
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
 translation errors.

377
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
 Or they could have just been making stuff up.

378
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,560
 But it's interesting because Sean was able to find that the event was real.

379
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,160
 So the question is, is it possible that over time the story got exaggerated so people are

380
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,920
 teleporting around town?

381
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,120
 They're walking through the darkness and they're actually traveling miles instead of feet.

382
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,040
 And they can't see the match in front of their face.

383
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,880
 And there's just this bizarre phenomenon.

384
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,240
 The lights shut off and then turned back on.

385
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,000
 The darkness Egyptian had two other examples.

386
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It was well.

387
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,440
 They had a subway that went completely black that scientists were not able to replicate.

388
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,400
 And then the third story was part of France went dark.

389
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,280
 But the only person that we know who experienced it was a nanny and the child under her care.

390
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:23,600
 Those are the three stories mentioned by darkness Egyptian, that conspiracy theory.

391
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,160
 It's possible that these elements have got exaggerated over time vis-a-vis Louisville,

392
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
 Kentucky.

393
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,480
 It's also possible in the world of the paranormal, right?

394
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
 This is so cool.

395
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,560
 It's also possible that the darkness Egyptian story is more accurate.

396
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,920
 Because the Louisville Courier Journal is not going to say panic struck the streets of

397
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
 Louisville yesterday.

398
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,440
 It's people teleported around the city.

399
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
 Is there a God we don't know?

400
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,720
 But science and faith both broke as the world went dark.

401
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,800
 I mean, they're not going to report it even if people weren't teleporting around.

402
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
 That's not going to be the newspaper.

403
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,080
 That's not going to be the newspaper.

404
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:05,040
 I mean, unless you think about it, if you clearly saw someone teleport in front of you

405
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,520
 and a journalist saw that too, they're not writing that article.

406
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,000
 They're not writing an article unless it's about a scientist building a teleportation

407
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 machine.

408
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,760
 They're not writing that article.

409
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,840
 So because even if you were able to prove it, people would still call it fake.

410
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,920
 That's just the world we live in.

411
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,400
 And especially back in 1911, they're not going to say people were teleporting around the

412
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,440
 city and there was no rational explanation for this.

413
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,960
 Maybe the truth, I think the truth probably lies somewhere in between the two.

414
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,360
 I think there's probably was a storm, but maybe there were some supernatural elements

415
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
 to it.

416
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,080
 But fascinating nonetheless.

417
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,480
 That's what I love about you guys.

418
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,040
 You guys do follow-up research.

419
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,960
 I try to cover the stories in entertaining, yet concise ways.

420
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,080
 That's why I include the show notes.

421
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,920
 That's why I do the show notes, honestly.

422
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,680
 So you guys can do additional research.

423
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,680
 You guys can correct me using the show notes.

424
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,160
 You guys have stopped correcting my mispronunciations.

425
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
 That's the funniest thing.

426
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,600
 You guys have been like, "I'm done."

427
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,360
 I still do all those true crime YouTube shorts, TikTok videos, and people are like, "That's

428
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,160
 not how that city's pronounced?"

429
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,040
 You guys don't even care.

430
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,440
 You guys don't even bring that up anymore.

431
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,160
 I love you guys.

432
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,960
 B, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

433
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,280
 We are leaving Louisville, Kentucky.

434
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,000
 We're going to wait till the darkness leaves so we can actually get a good view of where

435
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 we're going.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,840
 We're leaving behind Louisville, Kentucky.

437
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,400
 Fly us all the way out to Ireland.

438
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,600
 [imitates flying]

439
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,280
 We're about to visit Castle Saundersen.

440
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:50,000
 Castle Saundersen today is in ruins, but it was once a magnificent castle that held the

441
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,920
 family Saundersen.

442
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,680
 Saundersen Castle is known to be haunted.

443
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,320
 And one of the groups of phantoms that are seen in the area, because apparently there's

444
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,400
 like a wooded area and then a road you can take up to the castle.

445
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,720
 It's just castle ruins.

446
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,000
 But still, wouldn't that be awesome to walk around the ruins of Castle?

447
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,840
 Finally in the forest, you'll see a bunch of old timey soldiers wearing red coats, like

448
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,240
 the British soldiers.

449
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
 That's a ghost sighting.

450
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,880
 There is another ghost sighting in the area of one of, because you know this was a family

451
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
 line.

452
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,400
 A lot of people of the Saundersen's lived here.

453
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,560
 There was a Mrs. Saundersen who hated poor people, but she can't really run a castle

454
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,360
 without a bunch of poor people helping you out, like watering the garden and giving you

455
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,920
 food, butlers and stuff like that.

456
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,760
 Apparently she wouldn't allow poor people to walk behind her.

457
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,840
 That was her reputation.

458
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,760
 People below her station couldn't walk behind her.

459
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,000
 So she had a separate path built for them.

460
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,160
 And people have said, there's reports that you can kind of feel her presence in the area.

461
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,320
 You're like, "I feel like I'm actually pretty financially successful."

462
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,040
 And all of a sudden you can hit with a flying pot and you're like, "Oh man, I guess I am

463
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,600
 a bum."

464
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,600
 So her ghost may be there as well.

465
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,160
 Let's take a look at this particular story though.

466
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,600
 The person who posted this account goes by the online name of Jo Show.

467
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,560
 And they actually have thought that maybe this Mrs. Saundersen who doesn't let poor

468
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,200
 people walk around her castle or specifically walk behind her, they go, they joked, maybe

469
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,760
 she had something to do with this phenomenon.

470
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,320
 Which is possible, but I think this phenomenon actually transcends ghosts.

471
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,680
 We're going to meet this young woman.

472
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,640
 We're going to call her Tracy.

473
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,360
 She goes by Jo Show online, but we're going to call her Tracy.

474
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,560
 Tracy and her friend will call her Beth.

475
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:49,680
 Tracy and Beth, they're visiting Ireland and they decide to visit Castle Saundersen.

476
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,120
 They're using Google Maps to get through the area.

477
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,200
 And they're driving down this narrow dirt road through the woods headed towards Castle

478
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
 Saundersen.

479
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,600
 And they see another car coming down the road towards them.

480
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,880
 So both cars kind of slow down to pass each other.

481
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,000
 And just as they're passing each other, the other car is full of a family and the driver

482
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,320
 of that car turns to Tracy and Beth and says, "Hey, you guys headed up to the castle?"

483
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,320
 Tracy's like, "Yeah."

484
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,760
 Driver of the other car goes, "Well, yeah, that's where we're going to, but there's

485
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,960
 a boulder blocking the road."

486
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,280
 So we can't get around.

487
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,520
 We can't get around the boulder.

488
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,000
 This is an abandoned castle.

489
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,640
 I don't think there's like a national park service that is up there making sure everything

490
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
 is okay.

491
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
 It's just a bunch of rubble.

492
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,280
 So if a boulder rolls across the path, I mean, eventually someone may remove it, but it's

493
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,920
 not like there's going to be a tow truck there that day.

494
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,080
 The driver of the other car goes, "We're actually going to backtrack and see if we can find

495
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,760
 another way up to the castle because there's just no way around that boulder.

496
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,920
 We can't drive around it."

497
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,720
 So the family drives past them and Tracy and Beth talk briefly and they go, "So what do

498
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
 you want to do?

499
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
 Do you want to keep driving up to this boulder?

500
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,760
 Do you want to turn around and follow them and possibly find another path up there?"

501
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,560
 They decide to follow the family car.

502
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,280
 They decide to follow this family.

503
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,400
 So they begin, basically, they turn their car around and they begin going back the way

504
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,480
 they came.

505
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,600
 And Tracy says, "We've drive for a while.

506
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,480
 We've drive for a good while following this car and we're constantly looking from side

507
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,920
 to side, seeing if we can find another route up to this castle."

508
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,720
 And they see the family in the other car also trying to figure it out.

509
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
 They can't find anything.

510
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,280
 And after driving a while, the family in front of them comes to a stop.

511
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,480
 And when Tracy pulls up to the car, the other driver goes, "We're just going to go back

512
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
 the other way.

513
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,760
 There's no other way up to this castle.

514
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,080
 We've been driving for a while now.

515
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,920
 We can't find another dirt road in this abandoned part of Ireland to get to it.

516
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,360
 We're just going to drive back to the boulder.

517
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,520
 And here's the thing, we'll just park our car and walk.

518
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,240
 It's not super close.

519
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,680
 It's not a super close walk, but it's also not super far.

520
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,560
 We were actually probably going to have been there by now if we had done that.

521
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,360
 We've been spending all this time driving.

522
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,200
 We're going to drive back to the boulder, get out of the car, walk around the boulder,

523
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,440
 head up to the castle.

524
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,680
 So the family car turns around and heads back the way it came, headed back to the boulder.

525
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,120
 And Tracy and Beth are like, "Oh my goodness.

526
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,960
 What is going on?

527
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,120
 Let's actually keep driving.

528
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,680
 Let's find a way to get to Castle Saundersen.

529
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,080
 I do not want to hike through these woods."

530
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:42,120
 Because they also started to get a weird feeling just being in the woods.

531
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,680
 Just being out here was starting to make them feel a little, they're getting a little creeped

532
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,440
 out.

533
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,760
 So they continue to drive down this path and then eventually they go, "This is total waste

534
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
 of time.

535
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,000
 Now we've added even more time driving out."

536
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 We can't find, there's no other way to get to Castle Saundersen.

537
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Fine.

538
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,640
 We will turn around and go back and just park by the boulder and walk.

539
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,440
 They turn around and they begin headed back up to the way that Google Maps is telling them

540
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,840
 to get to Castle Saundersen.

541
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,040
 And they're driving, they're driving, they're driving, they're driving.

542
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,200
 They've gone quite away the opposite direction.

543
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:34,720
 Eventually they're driving up this dirt road and they see the family car parked.

544
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,080
 The people in the car are gone but the car is parked there.

545
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,080
 And Tracy and Beth are like, "Oh this is where they parked their car.

546
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,080
 But where's the boulder?"

547
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,840
 They said they were going to park by the boulder and just walk around and they go, "Where's

548
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
 the boulder?"

549
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,160
 You know, maybe they parked a bit away from the boulder because I don't see a boulder

550
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
 either, Beth says.

551
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:59,280
 And Tracy is like, "Okay, let's get as close to this boulder as possible because I don't

552
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
 want to walk.

553
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,560
 I don't want to walk that much.

554
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
 The woods are creepy.

555
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,200
 Are you feeling the creepiness too?"

556
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,520
 Beth's like, "Yeah, this is weird.

557
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,720
 This is during the daytime apparently as well.

558
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,400
 This isn't like spooky, spooky 3 AM."

559
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
 But here's the family car.

560
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,120
 So Tracy and Beth go, "They must have not...

561
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,160
 They figured they were going to park right next to the boulder and walk around the boulder,

562
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,480
 but whatever.

563
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,200
 Let's just park behind this car.

564
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,360
 Let's just park here and then we'll hike up to the boulder.

565
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
 It has to be somewhere.

566
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,320
 We'll hike up to the boulder and we'll walk around it.

567
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,440
 Then we'll go to the castle because obviously if they parked here, they parked here for

568
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
 a reason.

569
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
 Maybe they're parking near the boulder.

570
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,840
 Maybe there's a parking meter.

571
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,560
 Maybe this is all a trick for the government of Ireland to make a little bit of money.

572
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,720
 Maybe it's not a good parking.

573
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,920
 Maybe it's not super stable.

574
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
 Whatever.

575
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
 We'll park here.

576
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
 We'll walk to the boulder.

577
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
 We'll walk around the boulder.

578
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
 We'll go to the castle."

579
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,680
 So they park behind the family car.

580
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
 They get out.

581
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
 They're walking.

582
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,240
 You don't see a boulder anywhere.

583
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
 Okay.

584
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,600
 Maybe the boulder's a little bit farther up the road.

585
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
 They keep walking up the road.

586
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
 Okay.

587
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,080
 There's no boulder.

588
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,560
 Where in the world is this boulder that they were talking about?

589
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,760
 They walk for 25 minutes.

590
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,560
 This was not like a short jaunt.

591
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,960
 Through this forest that they've never been through before.

592
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,480
 That's reportedly haunted that they're getting creeped out by.

593
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,960
 After a 25 minute walk, they finally come to it.

594
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,440
 The castle.

595
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,440
 They never see the boulder.

596
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,640
 They park their car 25 minutes away from the castle.

597
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,920
 They could be, they were like looking around.

598
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,200
 They go, "We could have easily just driven up here."

599
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,640
 My calves are killing me.

600
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,360
 We're walking up this road to this guy.

601
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,920
 We could have just parked right here.

602
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,280
 Like, what were they talking about?

603
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,440
 So they figured we must have turned down the wrong road.

604
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,880
 We must have just not been on the road with a boulder.

605
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
 Whatever.

606
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,440
 Let's just enjoy this haunted castle as much as we can and call it a day.

607
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,560
 Because we must have just taken the wrong path or something like that.

608
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,320
 That's not a big deal.

609
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,200
 They explore the castle.

610
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,280
 They're taking a look around.

611
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
 It's really cool.

612
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,000
 Like, what an adventure that would be.

613
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,480
 Anyways, after a 40 minute visit, it's time to head back.

614
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,800
 It's a 25 minute walk back.

615
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,840
 So they turn around and they leave Castle Saundersend and they begin walking down this

616
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,600
 path, this road that they'd come up originally.

617
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:35,920
 They're walking and then all of a sudden Beth says, "Tracy, is that a boulder?"

618
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,320
 Tracy looks and sure enough, there's a huge boulder.

619
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,640
 Huge boulder blocking the road.

620
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,200
 Now at this point, Tracy and Beth are thinking, we must have walked.

621
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,760
 It has to be a difference of trails, right?

622
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,440
 We walked up a trail that didn't have the boulder on it.

623
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,680
 Like, it's just somehow we got turned around.

624
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,560
 Because this boulder is so huge, this boulder was not here when we left our car.

625
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,060
 It just wasn't.

626
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:08,920
 We could have driven all the way up to the castle.

627
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
 We must be on the wrong road.

628
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,120
 Or, you know, the right road, whatever, we're on a road, but this isn't the road we came

629
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
 up.

630
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,240
 The road we came up, we could have driven right up to the castle.

631
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,400
 But here we are where that giant boulder, let's walk around the boulder.

632
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,920
 Then we'll figure out what road we're supposed to be on from there.

633
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:39,400
 So they walk around the boulder and what they see parked right next to the boulder, there's

634
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,720
 a car, which is what the original plan was.

635
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,880
 We're going to park our cars near the boulder and walk up to the castle's understance.

636
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,520
 So they see this car parked there.

637
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:59,000
 But at that moment, Tracy sees a little bit down the road, their car.

638
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,360
 In viewing distance of the boulder, Tracy and Beth see their car parked on the side

639
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,000
 of this dirt road.

640
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,440
 And they're like, "That's impossible.

641
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,800
 That's absolutely impossible.

642
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,800
 This is the same road we came down, we parked and we walked up.

643
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,560
 Not only was the boulder not this close to our car, or we can look and see our parked

644
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,260
 car, the boulder wasn't here at all.

645
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,680
 We walked the whole walk, there was no boulder, and here we're seeing this car parked.

646
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,400
 And now down the road, we see our own car parked.

647
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,440
 Now they got in their car and they just drove away.

648
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,320
 A bizarre story to share with their friends.

649
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:48,440
 And you know, Tracy was talking about it's possible that this was like a ghostly event.

650
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
 It could have been, right?

651
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,640
 It could have been Mrs. Saunderson trying to keep poor people out of her castle.

652
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,560
 The thing is with the Mrs. Saunderson legend, it talks about like she didn't like them walking

653
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
 behind her.

654
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,440
 She had different paths in the castle.

655
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,440
 So I mean, there's a big difference between that and manifesting a boulder, but I'm not

656
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,120
 going to say that's not it.

657
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
 That's impossible.

658
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
 Or anything like that.

659
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:15,860
 I actually think this falls more into alternate reality type of things.

660
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,860
 It's interesting.

661
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:21,200
 It's a really interesting story and there's all those different ways to look at it.

662
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,920
 There's a lot of possible lessons you could pull out of it.

663
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,520
 Should they have kept driving?

664
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,480
 How mind blown would the family have been if the two girls pulled up in their car or

665
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
 they passed them?

666
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,880
 They're like, eat our dust, losers.

667
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,600
 They might have parked right up at the castle and people would have been amazed because

668
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:45,960
 other people not only observed the boulder, but stopped like the family car stopped because

669
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,080
 they saw the boulder.

670
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,120
 The car that was just in front of them, they saw a boulder so they stopped and they walked

671
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,880
 around it to go to the castle.

672
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,800
 But when Tracy and Beth pulled up, they didn't see the boulder.

673
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,600
 They only saw a car parked, but the occupants of that car had seen the boulder.

674
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,160
 It's an interesting story.

675
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,920
 It's a really interesting story about what possibly could have gone on.

676
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,760
 But I thought of something else when I was reading this.

677
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,320
 I was thinking, were they in a universe where there was no boulder and then they went to

678
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,840
 the castle and as they were returning, they returned to boulder prime, the universe where

679
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,160
 the boulder has existed.

680
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,080
 Is that possible?

681
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,280
 But I was thinking in some way the universes must have merged or in some way that boulder

682
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,840
 itself must have manifested.

683
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,920
 The story from Tracy is true.

684
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,440
 She's telling us a true story.

685
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,320
 We went from one point where there was a boulder to no boulder to then a boulder again.

686
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,520
 I was reading the story and I thought, okay, this is interesting.

687
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
 But what?

688
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,560
 This is where it gets creepy.

689
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,680
 It's a pretty benign paranormal story, but this is where it gets creepy.

690
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:06,560
 What if they hadn't parked their car behind the family car?

691
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,120
 What if they had continued driving up to the castle?

692
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,680
 Now they're trapped.

693
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,320
 Now is there like some sea-later suckers?

694
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,600
 They drive it to the castle, they spend 40 minutes there, they get back in the car and

695
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,320
 as they're coming home, there's a boulder in the way.

696
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,800
 A boulder blocking the car's drive through the rest of Ireland.

697
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,440
 Now basically it's trapped at the castle.

698
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,280
 Sure, the two girls could get out and walk around the boulder, but their car is still

699
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,040
 on the other side of it.

700
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:49,360
 But even more creepy than that, I was thinking what if they parked the car right where the

701
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,920
 boulder was supposed to manifest.

702
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,480
 They see the family car parked and they go, well, we should park, but let's not park behind

703
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
 them.

704
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,480
 We don't want to box them in.

705
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
 Let's just drive up a little bit more and see if we see the boulder and they drive up

706
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
 a little bit more.

707
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,040
 They don't see the boulder, but they said, let's just go ahead and park because it could

708
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,520
 just be right around the corner and they get out and leave.

709
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,880
 But they ended up parking their car exactly where that boulder was going to manifest,

710
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:21,640
 exactly where the realities would merge between no boulder and boulderverse.

711
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,880
 What would have happened to the car?

712
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,120
 Would it appear as if a boulder rolled over a car and you could see the car was crushed?

713
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,200
 Would they merge into one item?

714
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,440
 Would you have basically a bizarre relic that no one could explain?

715
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,420
 A car sticking out of a boulder, not sticking out from underneath, but it's actually merged

716
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,240
 into the same space?

717
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,400
 What would happen to the car?

718
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:55,200
 And then I started thinking, this almost makes me feel like you've glitched out a video game.

719
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,240
 You're no clipping through a wall, if that makes any sense.

720
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,840
 Like you have two items occupying the same space, which is impossible, but this car is

721
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:10,360
 now in a place where a boulder is supposed to be.

722
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:16,120
 As the universe emerges back, what if the car basically clipped into the boulder?

723
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,720
 And when you no clip, when you mess with the laws of the video game, it can send everything

724
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,120
 haywire.

725
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:29,080
 What happens if you are able to force two items into one place at the same time?

726
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,720
 Because had that family car not stopped there and had the girls not parked behind it, they

727
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,920
 may have continued to drive a little bit more and very easily left their car, because there's

728
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,120
 not a boulder there.

729
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,840
 There's not a boulder there.

730
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,760
 Why not park there?

731
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,240
 But then I thought, and we'll wrap it up like this, had they parked the car there and the

732
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,480
 boulder appeared, would it look like the boulder simply rolled over the car?

733
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:02,040
 Would they merge together in one unexplainable object?

734
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:09,160
 Would one or the other or both cease to exist in possibly reality itself as something is

735
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,280
 happening that's not supposed to happen and it crashes both realities that they live in?

736
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,720
 They've basically forced a fatal error in the system.

737
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:26,360
 Or, and to me this is the creepiest one, what if when the realities returned when they merged

738
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,960
 back or when they moved from no boulder to the boulder verse?

739
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:40,800
 What if instead of walking back from a castle, what if they were standing where the boulder

740
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,080
 was going to remanifest?

741
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,360
 Like it has to come back into reality.

742
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,440
 Multiple people saw it one way.

743
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,280
 The family saw it twice.

744
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,800
 They saw it the first time they parked their car in front of it and walked around it.

745
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,200
 These girls though.

746
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,480
 Imagine if they were walking down that road and they see their car probably about 20,

747
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
 30 feet away.

748
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,280
 They go, that's really fun.

749
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,360
 I don't know what all this stuff was about a boulder appearing black in the road.

750
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,000
 We could have easily driven up to the castle to 20, 25 minute walk.

751
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,760
 Into their walking and then suddenly the realities merge again but it's not their car that has

752
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,440
 parked to where the boulder is.

753
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,400
 It is those two young girls standing in the spot that's about to be inhabited by a massive

754
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,400
 rock.

755
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,800
 What happens to them?

756
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,960
 Do they instantly liquefy?

757
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,560
 As if this boulder rolled down a hill squishing both of them.

758
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,360
 Do they merge with the rock itself?

759
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,280
 Because two items can't take up the same space.

760
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,640
 Do their molecules get mixed with that of this boulder?

761
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,080
 And they are instantly killed and never seen again.

762
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,680
 They're literally meshed in with the rock.

763
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,000
 There's not like a hand or a foot sticking out of it.

764
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,800
 Not like a car would be big enough to possibly protrude from the boulder.

765
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:20,800
 Or what if they're walking there and that boulder rematerializes and it breaks the game.

766
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,200
 It doesn't destroy it enough for anyone else to know what happened.

767
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,840
 We go on with our days.

768
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:33,160
 But the two women who are in a world with no boulder on this road and they're standing

769
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,480
 there when the boulder rematerializes.

770
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,680
 Maybe they're not squished.

771
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,280
 Maybe they're not merged with the stone.

772
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,800
 Maybe they're pushed out of this reality.

773
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:56,280
 They clip through the walls of the game.

774
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,040
 These two young women wanted to go on vacation in Ireland.

775
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,160
 It sounded nice.

776
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,840
 And it probably was.

777
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:09,860
 Until they were suddenly pushed out of the realm of the sane.

778
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,600
 Of the laws of the universe.

779
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,360
 They were shifted over not into another dimension.

780
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,000
 But to something that defies words.

781
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,880
 It's something that we can't explain because it wasn't meant for humans to ever know about.

782
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,320
 We're not supposed to pierce that veil.

783
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,600
 We can see heaven and hell.

784
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,880
 We can see ghostly realms.

785
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
 Psychic phenomenon.

786
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
 Alien conquerors.

787
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,360
 And extraterrestrial messengers of peace.

788
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,920
 These things are all built into the system that we live in.

789
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,720
 But even all of our paranormal friends and foes.

790
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:56,080
 They don't go through that wall that those two women were forced through when they happened

791
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:02,560
 to be standing when a boulder shifted realities.

792
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,240
 These two young women just wanted a vacation.

793
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,760
 Wanted a little bit of relaxation.

794
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,720
 Now all they want to do is come home.

795
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,600
 But home doesn't exist where they're at.

796
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:29,880
 Whether it is love or hope. Not even fear, pain or sadness.

797
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:38,480
 They now exist in a place where nothing was meant to exist.

798
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,640
 All because they stood in the wrong place at the wrong time.

799
00:44:42,640 --> 00:45:10,160
 All because they couldn't see the boulder right in front of them.

800
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:17,160
 They're not going to leave.

801
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:26,160
 They're not going to leave.

802
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,160
 They're not going to leave.

803
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:41,160
