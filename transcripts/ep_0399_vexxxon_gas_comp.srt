1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 We finally know who's putting hats on pigeons.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,080
 Is there really a movie that can kill you simply by watching it?

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,880
 Are Buddhist priests starting to look a little too much?

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,120
 Like a little Buddha statue?

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:23,200
 And finally we travel to Canada to meet a man who believes that the aliens are up to no good here

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:31,040
 on earth. In fact, they're going so far they've become weapon dealers here on earth today on the

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,360
 season finale of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:46,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of not just any episode, it's the season finale of

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:54,640
 Dead Rabbit Radio season 8 ends here. It ends now. That's a crowd. I don't know why the crowd's cheering

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,000
 that show's going on hiatus. We're gonna take a week off. Next week we are going to have our week

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,080
 of classic episodes. So there we go. Stick around and then we'll have more stuff the week after that

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,920
 when season 9 starts. I want to give, I've been given some shout out to long time patreons.

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,120
 We're gonna continue that trend today. Love me some pickles. Love me some pickles. Thank you so

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,680
 much for supporting the Patreon all this time. I really, really appreciate it. Love me some pickles.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,040
 This is going to be flying the Carpenter copter and we're going all over this episode. So first off,

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,880
 let's fire that baby up pickles. We are headed to Vegas. Now this is actually a quick follow-up to

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,400
 a story I did a couple weeks ago. Last year actually, which is a couple weeks ago, six weeks ago,

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,240
 they, I did an episode about pigeons being found with cowboy hats in the city of Las Vegas. We

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:53,680
 know who it is now. It's Putin. Putin is a group called Pigeons United to Interfer Now. And basically

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,480
 they recently had the Democratic debate over there in Nevada and a bunch of pigeons showed up in

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,720
 the mac, a bunch of pigeons showed up with MAGA hats and one of them had a little wig. And there

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,520
 was some weird video released about it and reporters are like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, so are you like pro

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,200
 Trump? Are you anti-Trump?" And they're being really coy about it. But yeah, so they're the ones who

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,520
 were doing it was, it was probably a test run to see if they could get a bunch of MAGA hats on

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,400
 pigeons. But there you go. That's the follow-up to that story. I do have to say one cowboy hat

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,440
 wearing pigeon has died since the time I originally did that story. Because, you know, birds kind of

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,480
 have to see what's above their heads because what's above their heads are bigger birds that are going

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,720
 to eat them. Cowboy hat really obstructs your visions. A lot of humans aren't worried about

29
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,680
 pterodactyls coming down and getting them. You don't have to look up all the time. But that's also

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,680
 why they don't allow cowboy hats in construction sites, right? So one pigeon has passed away and

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,240
 then now there's a bunch of pigeons wearing MAGA hats. And apparently they're gluing them on with

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,840
 eyelash glue. So it like wears off after a certain amount of time. But any amount of time to block a

33
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:17,040
 flying animal's vision is bad. So, but there's the follow-up to that. It was a political performance

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,160
 art group is the way I would classify it. They probably aren't for or anti-Trump. They're probably

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,000
 just for art. For art's sake. But unfortunately a little pigeon died. I remember once I was telling

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,880
 someone about this story, this follow-up, and I said, "Yeah, one of the pigeons died." And they went,

37
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,640
 "Ah, I guess people don't like pigeons. I don't mind pigeons. I don't mind pigeons at all."

38
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,680
 But anyways, my view on pigeons is not notwithstanding. We are now leaving. Pickles fire that

39
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,480
 carpenter copter up. And I know a lot of you guys are now married to a bunch of hookers and strippers

40
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,720
 because we were here for five minutes and you already fell in love with someone. They're invited

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,280
 on the carpenter copter too. It's the season finale. Let's pack this thing on board. Pickles

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,640
 just like, "Dude, there's a weight limit. But we are all flying off now to Thailand."

43
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:11,760
 And in Thailand, and maybe in other Buddhist countries, but in Thailand specifically,

44
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,880
 Buddhist monks every morning they wake up. They're like, "Ugh." Now, they get their, that's all they do.

45
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,040
 They just yawn. They get up and they get their clothes on, their robes on, and they eat by

46
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,240
 getting food from the locals. And so by giving food to the Buddhist monks, you're getting good karma

47
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,360
 for your family, which sounds like a racket. Honestly, I mean, it's no different than tithing,

48
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,760
 which honestly, that's kind of a racket too. But it's an idea that like basically, I don't want,

49
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,040
 I don't want to work for food. I don't want to work, but I need food to survive, so I will pray

50
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,400
 for you if you give me food. And so the monk walks down, basically is a protection racket.

51
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,000
 Ah, nice family you got here. It'd be horrible if they got reincarnated into something really,

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,320
 really ugly. Yes, yes, let's get you some, let's get you some burritos. So anyway, maybe I'm going

53
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,160
 to become a Buddhist monk. I can really work that magic. Buddhist monk walks down the street and he

54
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,800
 has an assistant there, right? And because he gets so much food, it's not like you just go to

55
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,880
 one person's house and get a hot pocket. Like, you hit up a neighborhood. Ah, nice flower bed you

56
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,200
 have here. Might be some of your reincarnated relatives. It'd be horrible if I stepped on

57
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:36,400
 them. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'll go get you some lollipops. I'm glad I've turned Buddhism into the

58
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,160
 equivalent of the Italian mafia walking around baseball beds. Just smashing, just smashing

59
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,400
 spirits, reincarnated, I don't know, windows. Are you here? You were reincarnated as sand and then

60
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,120
 you refused into this window. No, I don't know how reincarnation works. But anyways, I wonder if you

61
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,680
 can be reincarnated into sand. So that is a question I'll look up later. So anyways, these monks are

62
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,520
 walking down the street. Yeah, give me some food. So anyways, the people gladly give them food under

63
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,600
 duress. And they have an assistant who has like a bag and the food goes into the bag. And sometimes,

64
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
 I guess, they'll probably just eat it there if they make them soup. Throw that in the bag too.

65
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,960
 He's like, oh no, my chocolate candies are all ruined by all this soup. Anyways, let me get to the

66
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:31,120
 actual story. So the monks in Thailand are getting really, really fat because the people are giving

67
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,920
 them, for two reasons. One, the monks can't say, oh, you know what I'd really like is some chocolate.

68
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,160
 They can't say that. They have to take whatever the people give them. So you're like giving them

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:51,680
 food. You know they're allergic to it. I have to. It's part of my religion. But they have to eat it.

70
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,480
 But they have to take it. You don't have to give them like garbage. They're like, oh great,

71
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:04,960
 banana peels again. Oh man. No, they're not allowed to request certain food. But people say

72
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,640
 they make it known that there's types of food that they like. Like you're going to do that, right?

73
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,880
 And so the one guy like sweet and sour soup, he's going to be like, hmm, I heard your loved ones

74
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,080
 crying out in pain last night in my sleep. But if you gave me some sweet and sour soup,

75
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,080
 they might get reincarnated quicker and in a place nearby you. Yes sir, yes sir.

76
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,840
 Anyways, the problem is that the priests are getting fat because one, the people are giving them

77
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:42,960
 a lot of prepackaged food that tends not to be super healthy. Two, after, I believe it's noon,

78
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,160
 after two, they can't eat one of those two, one of those two times. They can't eat anymore.

79
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,760
 The monks have to not eat for the rest of the day. So, but they can drink energy drinks. So you

80
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,120
 have a bunch of moth, which is so funny because you just imagine monks being like ohm, ohm. But

81
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,240
 imagine how to do that on eight red bowls. Well, you'd be dead. You wouldn't have to imagine it.

82
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,520
 You'd be reincarnated as something else, but just two red bowls, ohm, ohm, ohm. Like you wouldn't,

83
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,800
 your brain would be messing up. But anyways, so they drink about energy drinks, a bunch of sugar

84
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,680
 that keeps them going, but it's making them fat. And they wear such big gowns, I guess they're not

85
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,520
 going to a cantileum. They wear such big robes that they don't notice they're getting fat. Now,

86
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,840
 in Thailand they have a big obesity problem. It's the second fattest nation in the world after Malaysia.

87
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,120
 Now I'm reading facts here. One third, you can tell the tone of my voice changes,

88
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,520
 one third of Thai men are obese and 40% of women are obese. But when you look at the monks,

89
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:56,000
 almost 50% of all monks are obese. 40% have high cholesterol, 25% have high blood pressure,

90
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,840
 10% are diabetic. It's a crisis over there. So what they have to do, they're telling monks,

91
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,680
 okay, first off, cut off the sweets, exercise a little bit. They told people to start walking

92
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,720
 around the church every day. But that's not going to help. Those are all helpful tactics,

93
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,200
 eat less, exercise more, but they're still wearing the big gowns. So what they've actually had to do

94
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,400
 is they take these robes now. The monks always had these roped belts. Now they tie,

95
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,280
 and you can't tell, you just tie the rope, right? Now they have knots in them. So you could be like,

96
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,120
 uh-oh, I only got two knots left before the rope's out. Must be getting fat. So the government's

97
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,440
 actually trying to tackle this, and they are telling people, please stop giving them prepackaged food.

98
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,000
 But if I have to prepare something every day for a monk, I'm just going to give them a couple

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,400
 Oreos. Like, that's just the reality of it, right? I'm not going to make them scrambled eggs.

100
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,640
 But I guess if I wanted to be blessed, I guess if I wanted good karma, I should take care of my

101
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,840
 monks. I shouldn't have monks dying of diabetes on my doorstep. There's just a bunch of left legs

102
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:12,080
 that have been amputated. There's just a bunch of feet hanging out on my doorstep. People are

103
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,320
 gross, Jason. What's going on? Well, the monks keep coming, and they have diabetes, and they

104
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,400
 feet fall off because they have such long robes. They can't tell that their feet are all rotting

105
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,680
 and stuff. They obviously have no pain receptors or sense of smell, and they walk up, and I give

106
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,640
 them a couple Oreos to take one or two bites. Feet fall off. What am I supposed to do? It's

107
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:38,000
 outside my house. It's not my property. Slam the door. So there's that story. Hopefully that

108
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,440
 doesn't happen. Hopefully these monks lose weight. Losing weight is always a great way to feel better.

109
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,280
 So if that is your goal, it's a good time to get started on that. Maybe this story

110
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:56,720
 is a wake-up call, and maybe you don't have to wait for your next life to be healthy in this one.

111
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,960
 Or what's a better way to... Maybe you don't have to wait to be reincarnated.

112
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:08,240
 Never mind. You guys get it. If you want to be healthy, it's time to lose weight is what I'm

113
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,480
 saying. And I'm on that journey, too. I'm not just bagging on you. I'm only bagging on the bullet cut.

114
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,680
 And so, yeah, they are... And let me wrap this up without a disgusting foot joke.

115
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,480
 Basically, they're saying, "Guys, you are a spiritual role model. She also got to be

116
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,800
 physical role models, too. So if you're nice and slim and fit, then maybe the people you preach to

117
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,600
 will go, "Oh, they know how to take care of their bodies as well as their spirit." And that's true.

118
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:47,280
 So hopefully the monks drop from 50% obesity rate. That's insane. And that's obese. That doesn't

119
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,800
 count all the overweight people. That's probably another 25%. There's probably like one slim monk

120
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,040
 there who's chilling and they're all making fun of him. They're like, "Boney, boney." He's like,

121
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,520
 "No, I'm going to be reincarnated as the strongest man in the world. I want to beat you guys up."

122
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,120
 He's running away. They're all, "Boney, boney." They're eating his food. So just for legal reasons,

123
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,560
 I do not believe Buddhist monks or the Italian mafia don't sue me, Buddhist religion. I hope

124
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,040
 Buddha doesn't show up himself, come down as an avatar. And he's like, "Oh, so I heard you were

125
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,520
 dismissing my boys." And I'm like, "No, sir, he's breaking my legs." Okay, that's enough of mocking

126
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,520
 one of the biggest religions on the planet. Let's go ahead and move on to a movie I found recently.

127
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,400
 Now, it's funny because on the YouTube channel, I know a lot of guys go back and listen to the

128
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,800
 podcast episodes way back. A lot of times, you start listening to podcasts, you really enjoy it.

129
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,480
 I really appreciate that. You keep listening to it and then you start going backwards, like Sabine

130
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,600
 does. She listens to one new episode and then like one or two older episodes. But on YouTube,

131
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,000
 it's really easy for people just to kind of type in a topic, find an individual video, and comment

132
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,320
 on it. And those people, I don't know if they've ever listened to another episode, so I don't know

133
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,640
 if Lindsay Harrison's ever going to hear this. But a long, long time ago in like season two or three,

134
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,600
 I did an episode like, "What's the scariest movie ever made?" It was a thought experiment. I was

135
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,960
 like, "Don't tell me about The Ring or don't tell me about Serbian film or nothing like that."

136
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:34,160
 My question is this. Is there a movie made that is so like infused with dark psychic energy that

137
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,040
 watching it kills you? And I said, "I don't think the movie exists, but as a thought experiment,

138
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,840
 I think it would probably be made in the 70s. I think it would have these sort of qualities. It

139
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,520
 probably was made outside of the studio system. It was most likely made, I think I said, in South

140
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,280
 America or maybe Germany or something like that. But that's an interesting episode. I didn't take

141
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,080
 the time to look it up. But what's the scariest movie ever made? It's kind of a thought experiment.

142
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,320
 Now, a lot of times people have commented on the YouTube video and they're like, "Well, it's this

143
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,400
 movie. It's that movie." And most of those movies I'd either seen or heard of. Well, recently,

144
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
 Lindsay Harrison commented on that video. She goes, "Oh, I know the movie you're talking about. It's

145
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,160
 called Antrum. Antrum. It's a movie that kills you when you watch it." Now, obviously, my curiosity

146
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,080
 was peaked and I looked it up. Now, this is a dead rabbit recommend. This is what this is. Because

147
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,440
 Antrum, it won't kill you. I watched it the other day while I was playing Minecraft. It won't kill

148
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,000
 you. But it's a very, very well-done horror movie. There's definitely disturbing. It's not gory,

149
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 so it's not like, "Oh, look how dark I can be. Stab, stab, stab. Cut your face off." type stuff.

150
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,960
 It's... Here's the concept. It starts off as a mockumentary. It starts off with these people

151
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:57,840
 saying they have found the fabled movie known as Antrum. It's only been screened twice. Once it

152
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,880
 was screened in Budapest, there was a fire in a theater in Budapest and it killed everyone in the

153
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,360
 theater. I tried verifying that. I couldn't find any proof of that. There was another showing in

154
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,880
 America with some like Colt movie house. Everyone gouged their eyes out. It was super spooky and

155
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,440
 ultra realistic blood was shooting at... So that's the concept of the thing. You have like these

156
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,960
 talking heads saying, "This movie supposedly does this stuff." And then the movie starts and there's

157
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,720
 this little warning saying, "If you watch this movie, you may die." Very big. It doesn't kill you.

158
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,560
 Very big publicity stunt thing. And that's maybe the first 10 minutes. The movie itself, Antrum,

159
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:44,000
 is really good. It's actually a really good movie. And they do have some creepy like flash

160
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,480
 sigils pop up and that was more distracting than anything. But I thought the movie itself,

161
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,960
 the plot was interesting. There was some absolutely kind of disturbing images that stuck with me.

162
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,200
 And you'll know what it is when you see it. People in reviews have said I was very unsettled during

163
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,880
 that particular scene and then later on they're like that scene. And when I read that I was like,

164
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,360
 "Yeah, that's the scene I thought they were talking about." It's a very interesting movie. I really

165
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,360
 recommend watching Antrum. It's definitely a movie that, even though I was playing it, watching it

166
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,040
 during the day, playing Minecraft, it's a movie I think you would, I enjoyed it in that setting.

167
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,600
 I think you would enjoy it. I think I would have enjoyed it more at night watching it with full

168
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
 attention. But even barely paying attention, I want to say barely paying attention to it because

169
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,600
 Minecraft is such a minimal mind game. I still really enjoyed it. I'm definitely recommending

170
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,640
 it to you. You guys are like, "Jason, don't quit recommending movies that you watch with one eyeball

171
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,440
 while you're digging in a giant cave or a mine." It's not cavecraft, it's Minecraft, but

172
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,880
 quit recommending movies that you don't... This is just how I watch movies. This is how I watch

173
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,280
 movies and it's very rare when I have the time. Evil Within was a movie I highly recommend if you

174
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,920
 haven't seen the Evil Within. I started watching that playing Minecraft. I watched maybe 20 minutes

175
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,880
 of it and then stopped playing Minecraft, started the movie over again and gave it my

176
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,800
 undivided attention. It's rare when I do that. It's rare when I have the time to do that. You're

177
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,560
 like, "Jason, you don't really need time to play Minecraft." And I say I do! Good sir. I have to

178
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,720
 de-stress somehow. Let's go ahead and move on to our last... Thanks, Lindsay, for letting me know

179
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,440
 about that. Let's move on to our last topic of the season. Let me some pickles, fire that copter

180
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:43,360
 up again. We are headed to Carp, Ontario. Now you're gonna have to hit that stealth mode.

181
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:54,400
 Pickles, take us low because we are headed to an area, a contested area, you could say.

182
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,440
 Who controls this little piece of Ontario? Is it the Canadian government? Is it the American

183
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,560
 government? Probably because we're awesome. Is it aliens? We'll find out.

184
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:15,680
 November 4th, 1989. It's 8 p.m. Several people in the area are kind of going about their business,

185
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,320
 washing dishes, watching television, watching television with one eye playing Atari with

186
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,520
 the other. They have two TVs pressed together and they see a bright light in the sky. They also,

187
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:35,120
 in the darkness, start to hear helicopters. Cattles running around, breaking out of the gates.

188
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,440
 The next day a farmer said he had to wrestle up all his cattle, put him back in the gate.

189
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:47,040
 "Something spooked these boys," he said. It's an exact quote. It's not. But anyways,

190
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,320
 people didn't really think anything of it. UFO sighting, that's kind of cool, but I could have

191
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,840
 been a meteorite, I could have been something else. It wasn't until UFO researchers started to get

192
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,800
 packages that the mystery really began to unravel. And in this package there was a story written

193
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:11,120
 from a man who only went by the name Guardian. And this is what made UFO researchers start to

194
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
 look back at this date. Otherwise it was just like a bright light. They didn't know how to

195
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,000
 classify it. November 4th, 1989 in Carp, Ontario. According to Guardian, this is what happened.

196
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,440
 So the Canadian military one day, they have their radar thing. They pick up a globe.

197
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,840
 Flying over Carp, Ontario. They're like, "We don't have a globe. Do you have a

198
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,680
 America? Do you have a flying globe?" And the America's like, "Nope, we want one though.

199
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,080
 That's probably a UFO. We're going to start scrambling our forces." And then all of a sudden,

200
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:50,080
 the globe falls out of the sky. Canada's like, "You better get here quick because it's already

201
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,800
 crashed. Come on, military music. Americans getting their guns ready. They already have

202
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,760
 them ready. All the time we're completely armed and I love it. Put all the bullets.

203
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:10,480
 Lock and load guys. We're going to Canada." They take two Apaches and a Black Hawk up to the area.

204
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:18,240
 Now this crew is specifically trained to deal with non-terrestrial encounters.

205
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,800
 These Apaches are fine. Now you get why we're in stealth mode because these

206
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,160
 dudes are reloaded for bear. Each Apache has eight missiles containing something known as

207
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,400
 Vexon gas. It's a nerve agent that kills on contact. And what they want to do is they see

208
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,120
 this smashed orb in the ground. They fire their rockets. But they make sure they fire them 10

209
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:51,680
 meters downwind from the craft. Now Vexon gas dissipates after it gets so far. If you're 20 meters

210
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,520
 away, you can breathe it in. You'll be totally fine. We're 21 meters away. I'm testin' fate.

211
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,240
 But the aliens aren't. The spacecraft is right in the middle of it. So they launch all 16 rockets.

212
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,800
 You had eight rockets per Apache. 10 meters downwind. And then once they believe the Vexon gas

213
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:18,720
 has taken effect, the Black Hawk lands. Go, go, go, go! Troops get out. They attach a bomb to the

214
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:27,680
 side of the craft. Clear! Blow a hole in the side of this vehicle. Get inside. Amen stuff.

215
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,960
 Three dead aliens. They're not making noises. They're dead. Three dead aliens are in this craft.

216
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,120
 We got another one, boys. We killed these dudes from another planet. They're doing high fives and

217
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,320
 stuff like that. So they stay there all night long. They have a little camp out. They brought,

218
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,720
 who brought the marshmallows? All these special forces fighters. They're like burning the body

219
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,680
 of an alien. They're roasting the marshmallows over there. Mmm, this is delicious. Tastes like

220
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:59,360
 Alpha Centauri. The next day, a moving crew shows up. I'm not just a moving crew. It's not you,

221
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,480
 all. The next day, the military shows up with these giant moving vehicles. They cut the vehicle up,

222
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,440
 throw the pieces onto the moving trucks. Because it was big. It's huge. We'll get to that in a

223
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,240
 second. They drive it to this place known as the Defense Research and Development Canada,

224
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,560
 which I don't know why it's, shouldn't it be Canadian? Oh, it doesn't matter. It's in

225
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:28,240
 Canada, Ontario. Canada, Ontario. I take them there. And also the aliens were basic gray aliens.

226
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:35,360
 They refer to them as Reptilian, but I think that was in reference to the skin. The, what

227
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,760
 Guardian called them, referred to them as the Reptilian fetus-headed beans,

228
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,000
 where it listed its class one NTEs, which is a nontrrestrial entity.

229
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,400
 Continue with this quote, "Like others recovered in previous operations, they were muscular gray

230
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,840
 white skinned humanoid." So standard gray alien, just a little more buff. They've been hitting

231
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:04,640
 them weights. So when they take it to this place in Canada, Ontario, the DRDCs, we'll call it,

232
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,160
 they begin to reassemble the ship. Now you might think it's stupid that they took it apart in

233
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,840
 the first place, but they did have to transport it. You couldn't transport a giant globe going

234
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,480
 on the road. People would get suspicious, right? Plus, they've done this before, so they knew how

235
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,280
 to put it back together again. But when they put it back together again, it fits perfectly in place.

236
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,640
 It's almost seamless. And they, they're popping around inside and they notice something here.

237
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:39,520
 There's 50, 50 nuclear warheads on this thing. All of them from the Soviet Union.

238
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,160
 Now apparently, I'm going to tell you two things. You decide which one's dumber. This is the first

239
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,440
 one. Okay. This is the first one, according to Guardian. And they, actually, no, no, no,

240
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,360
 I'm going to say that one because that one's definitely dumber. The other one they face,

241
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,920
 so they found 50 nuclear warheads. The other one they found was they found two one millimeter

242
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:12,640
 around spheroid little, you know, little balls, little implants, right? And they look at these

243
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,680
 and they're like, oh my God. Because the scientists knew exactly what these were. They'd seen them

244
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,720
 before. What it is, if you stick it up your nose, not your nose, if you stick it up someone else's

245
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,960
 nose using extremely low frequencies, you can actually turn them into mine slaves, turn them

246
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,240
 into zombies. It's basically everything that MK Ultra ever wanted to do, where you have a

247
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,040
 mine control subject. You can do it without having to psychologically break someone down and build

248
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,320
 them up and break them down and build them up and all that stuff and have it maybe not work.

249
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,200
 They might just go insane. Just stick something up their nose, right? So they find two of those.

250
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,120
 The first thing they find, let's go back to the first thing, they find 50 nuclear warheads

251
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,600
 that according to sources, according to the one source,

252
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,960
 they were stolen from a nuclear submarine, a Soviet nuclear submarine.

253
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:17,120
 And China got them somehow. So either China stole the submarine or the submarine commander

254
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,480
 sold them to China. Because this is towards the end of the Cold War. Everyone's just trying to get

255
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,800
 out. Soviet Union is collapsing. Everyone's trying to get their money. Possible China got ahold of

256
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,240
 the missiles themselves. It just took the warheads. It's possible that the sub commander gave them

257
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,880
 or sold them, most likely sold them. It's not like, here, China, I love you so much. Here's 50

258
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,760
 nuclear warheads. But China, in turn, goes, what are we going to do with 50 nuclear warheads?

259
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:46,080
 I mean, other than bomb other countries. So this is, they were able to access the alien computers

260
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,640
 and this is what they found out. China and the Great Aliens have a partnership.

261
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:02,960
 The aliens want to develop biological weapons in Syria and the Chinese want to go into Syria.

262
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,520
 So instead of just, you know, getting a travel passport and seeing the sites of Syria, the Chinese

263
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,920
 government works with the Great Aliens and they said, "Grey's, we need to get these 50

264
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,120
 nuclear bombs into Syria without dropping them in there. We want them delivered there. We want

265
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,520
 Syria for whatever reason to have control of 50 nuclear bombs. If you fly these over to Syria

266
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:34,400
 for us, because, you know, we can't put them on a cargo plane, China famously has no shipping

267
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,200
 companies. They're not able to ship stuff across the world. Stuff that's made in China is just there.

268
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,360
 And if they only had some way to export all of their goods, they'd make a lot of money,

269
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,520
 but they just build iPhones and then they just put them on a conveyor belt and they go on a

270
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,040
 garbage can. They can't get stuff off of that continent. It's a tragedy. So if only there was

271
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:01,600
 some way they could move 50 nuclear warheads from point A to point B. So they contacted the

272
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,880
 Grey Aliens somehow, right? And the aliens said, "We will do this for you. We will transport 50

273
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,960
 nuclear weapons on our ship only if you let us hang out in Syria and develop biological weapons."

274
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,760
 And China goes, "Oh yeah, totally. We're totally in control of Syria as their eyes shift from side

275
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:27,120
 to side. Oh yeah, we know that plays really, really well. We go there all the time." So apparently,

276
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,800
 according to Guardian, this spaceship was on its way to Syria to drop off some nuclear bombs

277
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,720
 where they were going to meet the Chinese people and start doing biology. That might be one of the

278
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,640
 dumbest alien conspiracy things I've ever heard. Ever heard. We've done a lot of stuff. I actually

279
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,440
 know I almost refuse to cover it when aliens talk about saving the environment. I make more jokes

280
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,560
 about it. I don't think I've ever actually covered a sighting like that. I hope I haven't. I'll be

281
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:59,520
 embarrassed if I did. I think that's really corny. But this takes the cake because, one,

282
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:06,320
 oh gee, how do I even begin to dissect this? Do I even want to? First off, China doesn't need

283
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,080
 aliens' help to move a bunch of nuclear weapons too. Using a UFO to smuggle nuclear weapons is like...

284
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,760
 I don't even... That is such a bizarre thing. I don't even know if there's a comparison to it.

285
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,000
 Three, why would aliens want to go to Syria to test biological weapons? You could do it much

286
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,840
 easier in Africa. There's much bigger swaths where there's no nobody paying attention. And if

287
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,280
 something gets loose and 100,000 people die, they're like, "Ah, it's just Ebola." Eh, whatever.

288
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,760
 Like, in Syria, it's, "We're right next to Europe. People are going to freak out."

289
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:44,080
 But anyways, anyways, this is apparently this plan. Eh, well, I don't know why I'm arguing with it.

290
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,960
 It was found on an alien's computer. Like, really, can I debate this? So, now, I also should say that

291
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,160
 this vehicle isn't just any standard UFO. It was classified as a Starfighter. It was heavily armored.

292
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,600
 It had laser guns on it. Beam weapons is what they called them. Now, it wasn't that heavily armored

293
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,960
 because a bunch of special forces threw some C4 on it and blew a hole in it. I'm pretty sure that

294
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,600
 Thanos has ships that do more damage than that. But anyways, apparently it's a Starfighter

295
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,840
 heavily armored. All that stuff. Smuggling Russian weapons into Syria. This was all said by a dude

296
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,880
 named Guardian. Now, at the time, people thought the story was really intriguing. It was quite obscure.

297
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,160
 Very, very obscure. But then this dude ended up on Unsolved Mysteries.

298
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:35,520
 It got super popular in the 90s. So, in that same area on August 18th, 1991, in the Carp, Ontario,

299
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,440
 there's another sighting. A UFO lands in that same location. So, were the aliens looking for their

300
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,840
 downed craft, or they're trying to figure out what happened to all their crew? Who knows? But they

301
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,000
 came down to the same location and Guardian not only gets video footage of the UFO landing, but

302
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,560
 video footage of a great alien at the scene. He gets the video footage of the alien walking around.

303
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,800
 Now, a local woman goes, "That's funny because the same day that this footage apparently was taken,

304
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,720
 I saw a UFO fly outside my house. My dogs went out to chase it. They're barking, they're barking.

305
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,840
 I had to bring the dogs inside." And on the video of the UFO landing, you hear dogs barking in the

306
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,080
 distance. So, some people believe that, yes, this video was taken at that same night. And whoever

307
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,080
 took that video most likely knew something was going to happen at this location. And so, Guardian

308
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,400
 says, "I got a tip. The aliens were going to land here. And I came out with my camera. And I recorded

309
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,440
 it, and I recorded this great alien. And then you got this woman kind of verifying it, saying she

310
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,600
 saw a UFO around the same time. And people have watched the video footage and they go, "I don't

311
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,920
 know what it is. Like, that could be a UFO. It could be nothing. It could be a fraud." And for a lot

312
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,440
 of people, that's enough. Just not being able to say that's fake. Having any sort of doubt is enough

313
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,760
 to think, "Oh, it might be real." And so, he sends these packages out again. And like I said, this

314
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:05,040
 video is aired on an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. But this time, unlike the first time when he sends

315
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:12,400
 off the packages, this time there's a thumbprint on a piece of tape that's used to attach the packages

316
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,920
 down. They're like, "This is interesting." So maybe we can actually find out who this guy is, if it's

317
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:26,960
 legit. Now, some people eventually found out there is a guy living in the area, friend of the witness

318
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,800
 of the second encounter in 1991. He's living in the area. His name is Bobby Charles Boyce. He's a

319
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:41,440
 UFO enthusiast. He's a local. He's been known to go by the alias Guardian. And he refuses to give his

320
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,640
 fingerprints to see if they match the package. Now, that's fair. I'm not going to make a guy give

321
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,640
 his fingerprints out to every guy that gives me fingerprints. You're like, "Yes, sir." Like,

322
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,920
 that's fine. He can review, give out fingerprints. So case closed, right? We know this guy is a UFO

323
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,320
 enthusiast. It doesn't necessarily mean the story's not true. The story's probably not true. But it

324
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,920
 doesn't necessarily mean that the story's not true because the person who's reporting it is a UFO

325
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:13,280
 enthusiast. I mean, you can be both a whistleblower and like the thing you're blowing the whistle on.

326
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,200
 Like, I would never be a whistleblower on the oil industry. I don't know nothing about the

327
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,080
 oil industry. I don't care. Or like, cheating in football. It's like, I don't even watch football.

328
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,240
 How can I be a-- Like, if someone told me, like, all these secrets about the NFL, I'd be like,

329
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,840
 "Oh, yeah, okay." And then just like, go about my business. I wouldn't feel the need to go tell

330
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,400
 of people. It's most likely the story's made up. It's most likely that this UFO enthusiast,

331
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,360
 this guy's drilling the UFOs, made the story up because the details don't add up. The reason why

332
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,440
 I enjoy the story is it does give another layer to the human-alien interactions. We hear so much

333
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,320
 about governments making deals with aliens, like the Americas made a secret deal with aliens,

334
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,480
 or the world's made a secret deal with aliens to get technology. We get Velcro and they get

335
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,200
 humans to abduct. It's more-- And that's dumb. It's more likely that aliens would make individual

336
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,280
 deals with individual governments. And you would-- It would basically be the ultimate

337
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:13,280
 spy game, because you would be trying to figure out what the other nations are getting out of

338
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:20,160
 their deals with the extraterrestrials. And it would be like, almost everything is up for grabs.

339
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,000
 It would be really bizarre, because America could go, "Okay, we want this technology."

340
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,400
 Aliens go, "Done. We want to be able to abduct X number of people and you're really not going

341
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,480
 to investigate it. Done." But then China can go, "We don't care about the technology.

342
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,680
 We want to destabilize the Middle East. We want to be able to move in and start doing--

343
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:43,760
 Making moves over there. Done. We want to do X, Y, and Z. Yeah, you can abduct a bunch of people.

344
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,360
 We don't care. We abduct a bunch of people. Hey, man, we'll show you some tricks."

345
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,440
 Chinese governments like, "Hey, dude, we'll show you really how to abduct people." Oh, thanks.

346
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,040
 So that's an interesting wrinkle to the whole thing. I think there's, what, like 280 countries

347
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:05,440
 that's basically 280 different alliances that can be made and everyone would want a piece of the

348
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,680
 extraterrestrials pie, whether it be the technology, whether it be the knowledge, whether it be

349
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:19,600
 just revenge against another group of people. I find that idea fascinating. This particular

350
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,400
 story with the nukes, I don't believe, but I like the idea that things like that may be going on

351
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,640
 behind the scenes. I read recently once-- I forgot where it was. I'll try to pull it back up, put it

352
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,280
 in the show notes, but-- read recently once that gray aliens, their obsession with the planet Earth,

353
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:44,000
 is because they were here first. That were the interlopers. The same way that humanity evolved

354
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,760
 to take the world away from the dinosaurs. At some point, the gray aliens were here and then

355
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,720
 either moved on or were pushed out. And their obsession with our planet, when there's so many

356
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,840
 other planets available, not only in the solar system, but throughout the galaxy, is that this

357
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:05,280
 is their home. And it's funny because that is a very human way of looking at things. How many conflicts

358
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,000
 do we have on this planet over I was here first? I mean, you'll see school kids have that-- have

359
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,880
 those conflicts. I was sitting here first. And then we have entire nations go, "No, no, no, this is

360
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,880
 mine. India, Pakistan. This is mine. Kashmir. This is mine first." And if that's the case,

361
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,280
 all of the treaties, all of these things they're making with these alien governments, we'll abduct

362
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,960
 people, we'll give you technology. You let us build these bio weapons in this area, we'll give you,

363
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,960
 we'll move stuff for you, we'll be your middleman and all that stuff. Their end result isn't to abduct

364
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,280
 people. Their end result isn't to build these weapons. Their end result is nothing but the

365
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,640
 utter extermination of the human race, if these theories hold out. What if the reason-- I know

366
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,520
 I-- I know I harp on this all the time, but what if the reason they are really pushing us for us to

367
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,440
 save the environment is because we're messing it up, but we'll mess it up to a point and we will

368
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:11,440
 evolve to deal with it. That's what humans do. What if we're gonna mess it up to a point where

369
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,840
 they can't? What if we simply evolve faster? And I'm not necessarily mean biologically evolved,

370
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:23,440
 but socially evolved. What if we go, "Oh, we lost 10 miles of coast land on every continent."

371
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,960
 Just moving a little bit. "Oh, we can grow grapes in Norway now. Now we'll have a new

372
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:37,600
 vineyard out there." The climate change doesn't affect us as much. The humans are survivors.

373
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,040
 We're basically born from an asteroid collision as tiny little mammals and have conquered the

374
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,360
 planet. Maybe that's the most threatening thing to gray aliens is our versatility.

375
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:53,680
 That is, waters keep getting polluted. We're just like, "Ah, just drink a cup. We'll give you a--

376
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,920
 make you tell me here a little bit." But aliens can't do that and that could be their obsession

377
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,600
 with the environment. I could be reading it wrong. I think a long time listeners in the show know I

378
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:09,600
 think that aliens suck, but I think that if aliens do exist, I think they are most likely hostile.

379
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,040
 Just because any species that enters into another species domain is hostile.

380
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,640
 If an iguana walks into a snake pit, they're not gonna have a good day. One of them-- one of

381
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:30,000
 them is done. So did we enter the alien snake pit or did they enter ours? I guess it doesn't matter

382
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,200
 who was here first. I guess it matters who can hold it. Who can hold it for the longest? Who will be

383
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,920
 the last man standing? That's the ultimate question. Because right now it may be behind the scenes,

384
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,440
 power brokers, meddling in countries affairs, doing the bidding of one human against another

385
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,440
 and the whole time plotting their worldwide revenge. All of that stuff can go on, but once the first

386
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,640
 bombs start dropping, once the first trigger is pulled, once the human alien war truly starts,

387
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:12,720
 then we'll know who has the power. And in that moment, will humanity unite like an Independence Day

388
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:21,680
 and fight back the alien oppressors? Or will generation and generation and generation of

389
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,440
 alien meddling in our politics, in our societies, and in our belief systems pay off?

390
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:36,560
 Will we be so divided among each other that while the aliens are shooting us in the street,

391
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,400
 we're pointing our finger at our neighbors and saying this is your fault?
