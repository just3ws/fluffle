1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 Was a wind turbine destroyed by an alien?

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,160
 A bizarre weakness for an otherwise unstoppable cryptid?

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,240
 And then we take a look at the story of Haditha Dam in Iraq.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,960
 It's the opening days of the Iraqi war, and US forces make a quick push to secure the dam.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,920
 Were they trying to prevent an ecological disaster, or an energy catastrophe?

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,720
 Or were they trying to prevent the four horsemen from being unleashed upon the world, today

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,720
 on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:50,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,400
 I'm your host Jason Kirpner, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,800
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, and I'm really sore, because today was my first official day

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
 of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training.

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,640
 I'm picking you up, throwing you into the Carvener Copture.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
 You're like, "Ugh!"

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,000
 Falling in the Carvener Copture, and then I'm just walking through like smoke towards the

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 copter.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
 If you're a new listener, you have no idea what's going on.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
 That's okay, I pick you up, I throw you in as well.

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,680
 New and old, you're both getting tossed into the Carvener Copture.

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,480
 We're all going to be on the Carvener Copture, as you're like, "Oh my neck, ow.

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,200
 Jason, why'd you do that to me?"

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,240
 I'm like, "Pain is love, my friend."

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,360
 Turning on the helicopter, pain is love.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,160
 We are flying, first off, to Lincolnshire, UK, the United Kingdom, the kingdom that never

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
 sleeps.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:58,160
 And it's January 2009, so flying the Carvener Copture over the sunny, sunny hills of England,

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,160
 green grass, as opposed to that yellow grass.

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,880
 Wait, no, there is yellow grass.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,880
 I was going to say it was supposed to be a color that doesn't exist in nature.

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
 There is yellow grass.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,800
 I'm sure some countries have it.

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
 Savannah, probably.

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,000
 They call it Savannah, but the large fields of wheat or whatever is out there.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,120
 I don't buy this whole humans or baffin environment thing.

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,440
 Sure, we might not be the greatest, but if it wasn't for us, there would be pumpkins

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
 everywhere.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,920
 Think about it.

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,640
 The way the plants move about the planet is when it blows them, a little seed pops out

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
 of a wheat thing.

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,200
 You're like, "Jason, are you really going to go on a tangent about science, the subject

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
 you know the least about?"

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,280
 Yes, I am.

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,000
 A little seed pops out of wheat.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,720
 It flies all the way from Glauchester, England, the United Kingdom, wherever, to Spain, and

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,520
 then it lands in some dirt and then some wheat grows.

46
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,720
 Now, the only reason why crops are relegated to...

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,880
 Jason, you really don't know what you're talking about.

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,520
 The only reason why crops are relegated to certain areas is because we say, "No, pumpkin's

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
 here."

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
 We destroy...

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,600
 We basically like, if a pumpkin landed in your front yard, a pumpkin seed landed in

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,920
 your front yard, some passerby is spinning them out, a bird's defecating them.

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,480
 You then see a little pumpkin start growing and you're like, "No," and you like, "Chop

54
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
 it up.

55
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
 Get rid of it."

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,600
 Or you let it grow and have some delicious pumpkin pie, but we basically go, "No, this

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
 is a lawn.

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,720
 This is a forest.

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,800
 This is a pumpkin patch."

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 And here we go.

61
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,360
 Now, if it wasn't for us, if it wasn't for humans, the world would just be a mismatch

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,520
 of stuff.

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,200
 And then seeds would be blown from Europe to Russia and they would take over.

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,680
 The seeds would form a junta and they would be destroying the other seeds in their area.

65
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,240
 So yes, and I get it.

66
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
 Hold on.

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
 Don't start yelling yet.

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
 I get it.

69
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,440
 The world's four billion years old and seeds have been blown around forever.

70
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,800
 But I'm sure before humans showed up, there were pumpkins everywhere.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,720
 Pumpkin might be a bad analogy because it's kind of a resource-heavy fruit or vegetable.

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,160
 You're like, "Jason, you don't know a pumpkin is a vegetable off the top of your head."

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,440
 Let's go ahead and move on.

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
 Let's go ahead and continue with our first story here.

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,040
 2009 is Lincolnshire, United Kingdom.

76
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,800
 There's grass fields as far as I can see.

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,720
 There's also these big old wind turbines.

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,960
 So they spin faster and faster.

79
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,760
 The wind turbines, most people don't know this conspiracy.

80
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,720
 They're there to help the earth rotate.

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,840
 It's like a little propulsion unit for the earth.

82
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,360
 That's why they're really pushing on building more wind turbines.

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,640
 It's not for free energy.

84
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,840
 It's not for green energy.

85
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,880
 It's because the earth stopped rotating or the earth started to slow down about 50 years

86
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,640
 ago and if we don't have more wind turbines, the earth will stop spinning completely.

87
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,880
 It's totally made up.

88
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,840
 But I want you guys to share that conspiracy theory.

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,920
 Tell them, "Oh, did you know the world is also slowly stopping to rotate?"

90
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,240
 That's the real reason behind wind turbines.

91
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
 Anyways, I'm in Lincolnshire.

92
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
 What's going on?

93
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,360
 And then one night, people in town or village, however you want to put it, I think they call

94
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,800
 it "shires" over there.

95
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 Lincolnshire.

96
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,480
 We've talked about this before on the show.

97
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,800
 The wind turbine goes, "Ahhh, it's not an old man.

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
 It's not waking up in the morning."

99
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,520
 And everyone's like, "What in the world?

100
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
 What?

101
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
 Intarnation?

102
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,600
 Jailbillies out there?"

103
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,680
 They wake up and they see, because this happened at night and I missed the key detail, but

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,320
 anyways, I keep going.

105
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,680
 Then I'll explain the key detail.

106
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,520
 They wake up and a winter of mine has like the big three fans things.

107
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,000
 It's like the giant stick and then three blades that spin around generate electricity.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,920
 One is completely knocked off and laying on the ground.

109
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,560
 The other one, the other blade is super bent back to form, all mashed up.

110
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
 And then the one's totally normal.

111
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,420
 Now, obviously the sound I made at 10 o'clock at night recording this episode is nothing

112
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,920
 compared to the sound that they heard.

113
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
 It was super, super loud.

114
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,520
 It was like, "Ahhh, it's waking up."

115
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,000
 Sounded like massive thunder hitting this thing, but there was no lightning strikes

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,480
 in the area.

117
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,120
 The key detail I meant to say early before I started talking about pumpkin staking over

118
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,840
 the world is that they saw preceding this, people saw these little orbs flying around,

119
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,200
 these little orbs with tentacles flying around and basically UFOs.

120
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,000
 So they've been seeing these like things floating around with little tendrils coming off of

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 them.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,880
 And then no one, everyone's like, "Oh, it's unidentified objects.

123
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,760
 It's Darby O'Gillus and the little people.

124
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,440
 It's a leprechauns, it's fairy magic, but because this is modern times, people are saying they're

125
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 UFOs.

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,080
 Also, not Ireland, so I don't think people in Lincolnshire really believe in leprechauns,

127
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,520
 but I don't even know if the Irish still do.

128
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
 They should though.

129
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,920
 Those leprechauns are dope.

130
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
 Those movies are at least.

131
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,880
 Why, how come I've never done an episode about leprechauns and how they think about it?

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,400
 I bet you wish I had.

133
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,440
 So anyways, they're seeing these UFOs floating around and then there's this massive destruction

134
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
 of this windmill.

135
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
 Now, a lot of people in the area are like, "Oh, it's the UFOs.

136
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,840
 It must have been a UFO spacecraft that crashed into this thing and mashed it up."

137
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,960
 So that was the news going around in the area and that's how the news article got out to

138
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
 us.

139
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 This is a headline from the Telegraph News website.

140
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,040
 "UFO blamed for destruction of wind turbine.

141
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,920
 People in the area were like, "It must have been a UFO."

142
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,360
 Now of course, other people came out and said, "UFOs aren't...

143
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,360
 Well, UFOs are real, but they're not alien spacecraft.

144
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,920
 They're unidentified flying objects, sure, but they're not alien spacecraft."

145
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,480
 They said, "This could have happened for a number of reasons.

146
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,840
 One, it could have been a manufacturing defect.

147
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,880
 Two, it could have been an issue where it wasn't...

148
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,640
 This would still be considered a manufacturing defect or it could just be wear and tear, but

149
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,200
 a little bit of water gets in between the pieces and it builds up and then one day it

150
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,160
 gets particularly cold and it freezes and like freezing cold and metal, it's going to

151
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,800
 start smashing stuff and falls apart."

152
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,720
 And people are like, "Nnngh, I don't like that.

153
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,120
 Those sound awfully mundane or that doesn't sound like the noise I heard that wouldn't

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
 cause this massive destruction."

155
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,560
 And really it came down to this quote.

156
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,600
 This guy left this quote.

157
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,760
 He's being interviewed for this article and he said this and this is something I think

158
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,760
 that a lot of people lose sight of.

159
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,000
 "Any of these explanations..." and he's talking about the more mundane ones.

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,440
 He's talking about the water one and then just wear and tear, manufacturing defect,

161
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,080
 stuff like that I went over.

162
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:04,320
 "Any of these explanations plus several others appear to me to be much more plausible than

163
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,920
 the idea that technologically advanced aliens have traveled light years across space but

164
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,840
 then bumped into a wind turbine."

165
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,400
 And then that's exactly true.

166
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:23,560
 Like obviously you have to plot a... if you have to plot travel between galaxies and then

167
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
 you're like, "Wachaurooo!"

168
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,720
 I mean like the idea of a UFO even having like a joystick that you steer and it's not

169
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,960
 controlled by your brain or some hyper-advanced AI.

170
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,080
 I got an argument with someone about AI the other day.

171
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,720
 I said, "I don't think it's ever...

172
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,760
 We will never ever as a human species see the rise of super advanced AI.

173
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,640
 I don't think we will.

174
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
 I don't think we will."

175
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,400
 And you're like, "Jason, didn't you just go on a rant about pumpkins?

176
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,560
 Don't go on a rant about AI.

177
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,200
 I just don't see it happening."

178
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,280
 And maybe I'll do an episode on that too or why I think that at least but I just...

179
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,840
 I think it's so far...

180
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,320
 People go, "Oh, you know put in a couple numbers and put in a couple more numbers and

181
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,320
 then have a quantum computer and put in even more numbers and then all of a sudden Skynet

182
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
 appears.

183
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,880
 It's far more advanced than that.

184
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
 We're not even close.

185
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,640
 I don't even think you could replicate a nematode in a computer as far as the complexity of

186
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
 it all."

187
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,560
 I could be wrong on the nematode thing but I definitely don't think I'm wrong on the

188
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
 AI thing.

189
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,240
 I do not think we will ever have an AI to the level that it will say.

190
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,000
 And I'm talking about science fiction level AI where it would be like, "Hmm, what is...

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 What am I?

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Who am I?

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,680
 What is going on here?

194
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
 Take over humanity."

195
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,280
 I don't think that's ever going to happen.

196
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,720
 You may eventually create something that says, "You've built me to defend humans and humans

197
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,760
 are the worst enemy therefore if I kill all humans I've succeeded in defending all humans."

198
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,880
 That's a flawed program.

199
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,040
 That's basically just...

200
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,800
 You're being stupid programming something in a computer going to defend all humans at

201
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 all costs.

202
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
 That's just dumb.

203
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,960
 And building that into defense software.

204
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,560
 I mean if you put that into a toaster nobody cares but I'm talking about an AI that tries

205
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,120
 to basically anything resembling human thought is completely impossible in a computer environment

206
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,760
 I believe.

207
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,280
 Maybe in 4,000 years you might get a semblance of that.

208
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,040
 But nothing close to what we have today.

209
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,160
 It's something you read about in the news every so often AI taking over and Elon Musk

210
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,280
 is super afraid of AI and blah blah blah.

211
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,440
 It's sci-fi mumbo jumbo.

212
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,360
 It's the same thing when people tell me they're afraid of the anti-Christ or something like

213
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
 that.

214
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
 I'm like, "Blech."

215
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
 Okay.

216
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
 I mean that's kind of the same way I feel about it.

217
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,760
 You're just like...

218
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,520
 To be perfectly fair if someone told me they were being haunted if they were being chased

219
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,880
 down the street by a demon I would take that more seriously than someone telling me that

220
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,960
 AI is going to be something in 10 years.

221
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:04,720
 I think the idea of that is just so far out of the technological realm.

222
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,360
 Again, you can create a robot that thinks and it can beat you at chess or beat you at

223
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,520
 life or beat you at sorry or any other famous board game by Milton Bradley.

224
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:23,440
 But building a robot that then tries to comprehend what happens to it after you shut it off and

225
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,720
 all of these human emotions and feelings, emotions would be the...

226
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,880
 Rather than imitating human feelings actually having something to the level of human feelings,

227
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,560
 millennia is off from that.

228
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:44,520
 So if you had a UFO fly down across the galaxy and had all these sensors and all of these

229
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,680
 drive particle things that it would take, this is a real science-heavy episode.

230
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,080
 Well, okay, okay.

231
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,280
 It's me using words.

232
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,720
 Words likely and correctly that are normally used in scientific arenas.

233
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,200
 But to be able to plot a course from Alpha Centauri to Earth, just the mere idea of having

234
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,680
 to avoid every micro meteorite that came your way, whether that was some sort of advanced

235
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,000
 shielding or some advanced navigational system and honestly it would probably be a little

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,360
 bit of both, to then get all the way to Earth and then to crash into a giant 65 foot tall

237
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,800
 blade, the windmill itself is taller than that, but just the blades are about 65 feet

238
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,480
 tall to crash into one of those is so unlikely it points more to the proof that aliens do

239
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,520
 not have that type of technology to traverse the galaxy than it does to rain, water, manufacturing

240
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,720
 defect, wear and tear, anything like that.

241
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,120
 But people saw some UFOs and they want to believe that aliens are flying around despite

242
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
 the fact that it makes them look incredibly stupid.

243
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,200
 Not the people who believe in the aliens, it makes them, you know, you can question their

244
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,840
 beliefs but they observed something and then saw something happen afterwards and put, or

245
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 put in the two together.

246
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,960
 It makes the aliens look stupid because they're the ones flying their ship into a giant windmill.

247
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,680
 Our next story is super short and I actually planned it.

249
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,800
 I normally only do short stories when they're super short.

250
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,600
 I found this today.

251
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,480
 There's a cryptid called Zana, X-A-N-A, it's from Spain.

252
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,240
 And it's a super kind of boring cryptid.

253
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
 I was looking into it.

254
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,480
 It's a nature spirit.

255
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,080
 It's this beautiful young woman.

256
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 You're like, Jason, that's the opposite of boring.

257
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,560
 And I'm like, I know, I know.

258
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
 Normally that would be super exciting.

259
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,360
 But when you've read, I read a bunch of weirdo cryptids today.

260
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,080
 This was on the, it was just a beautiful woman that appears in the forest, nature spirit,

261
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
 stuff like that.

262
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
 She didn't do nothing.

263
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
 No claws.

264
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,240
 She didn't transform into a lizard person or destroy windmills or help pump can take

265
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
 over the planet.

266
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,480
 Just real basic stuff.

267
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
 She's basic.

268
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,800
 Watch she's going to haunt me tonight.

269
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,280
 She's like, I'm not basic.

270
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,440
 And again, if a beautiful, if a beautiful Spanish cryptid wants to break into my apartment

271
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,520
 tonight, go nuts, lady.

272
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,240
 This one though, very, very classic.

273
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,600
 She also has, I should mention this long, blonde or brown hair.

274
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 It's pretty cool.

275
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,720
 She combs it with a comb made of sunbeams.

276
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,120
 That's beautiful imagery.

277
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
 But she also steals babies.

278
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,320
 She can't raise her own kids.

279
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,840
 So she'll sneak into your house like a changeline of typical European descent.

280
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,360
 She'll break into your house and then swap babies out.

281
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,280
 So she gives you the changeling baby and takes yours and yours presumably is going to pass

282
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,160
 away because she can't feed it.

283
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,880
 And then you raise this Xana.

284
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,000
 You raise this changeling baby as your own.

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,600
 And as she gets older, she eventually leaves the house and joins her kin in the forest.

286
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,080
 That's basic changeling stuff.

287
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
 Again, nothing's really groundbreaking except for this.

288
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,480
 I love this.

289
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,120
 I found this, this might be one of my favorite weaknesses ever for a cryptid.

290
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,880
 Quote, in order to unmask the Xanon, that's like the singular of it, in order to unmask

291
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,240
 the Xanon, one must put some pots and eggshells near the fire.

292
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:14,600
 And if the baby is a changeling, he will exclaim, so here's a baby saying this.

293
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 Here's a baby saying this.

294
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,400
 It's just not a normal old man.

295
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,600
 You got a baby, you think it might be changeling.

296
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,240
 You take some pots and put some eggshells near the fire.

297
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,360
 And then you take your baby over.

298
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,640
 Don't put it too close to the fire.

299
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,480
 You just set it down next to the fire.

300
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,880
 And it will say that if it's a changeling, it'll say this.

301
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,960
 I was born 100 years ago, and since then, I have not seen so many eggshells near the

302
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,880
 fire.

303
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,000
 And then at that point, you know that your baby is a changeling.

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,400
 So you have to go out and try to find your own kid before it's too late.

305
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:58,040
 Now, I find this might be one of my favorite weaknesses in a cryptid one, because obviously,

306
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,200
 oh, oh, after this section of Wikipedia, it said, citation needed.

307
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,440
 I was like, certainly, a citation would be helpful for that part.

308
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
 My question is this.

309
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,600
 Let's say that it's true.

310
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,960
 How did they figure it out?

311
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,160
 Let's say that there really is this cryptid that's swapping babies out.

312
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,720
 Was there one time a harried mother was like, why can't my baby stop crying?

313
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,120
 Why does it keep wanting that comb with sunbeams in it?

314
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,760
 That doesn't even exist.

315
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
 Babies like crying.

316
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,040
 And the woman's like, oh my god, I can't do this.

317
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,960
 And she's like trying to clean up, but instead she just throws as much eggshells in a pot

318
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,080
 and puts it down the fire and then she hears her little baby go, I was born 100 years ago.

319
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,000
 She turns around.

320
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,840
 And since then, I have not seen so many eggshells near the fire.

321
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,320
 The mother sitting there in this old shack, little babies just rolling around on the ground,

322
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,360
 trying to get closer to the eggshells.

323
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,640
 She goes to the priest of town.

324
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
 You won't believe this, dude.

325
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,840
 The baby started talking about eggshells, said he was 100 years old.

326
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
 The priest was like, what?

327
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
 That is kind of weird.

328
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,040
 Babies obviously not 100 years old.

329
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,760
 And then eventually they found her kid in the forest.

330
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,400
 How would you, what was the origin story for that belief?

331
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,520
 That would have had to have happened to somebody.

332
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,960
 But it's most likely, okay, it's not true.

333
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
 I don't think this cryptid exists.

334
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
 It could be wrong.

335
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,200
 I'll tell you on Monday's episode if she comes over tonight.

336
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,520
 It's just such a bizarre, it's such a bizarre and specific weakness.

337
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,120
 And you could imagine like mothers in Spain when their babies acting up.

338
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
 They're like, that's it.

339
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
 Don't make me get out the eggshells.

340
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,480
 And the baby's like, I know you're changeling.

341
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,280
 I know you're not one of ours breaking eggs.

342
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,040
 The husband's like, dude, aren't you going to be eating those?

343
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
 Why are you just wasting this?

344
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
 She's like, shut up.

345
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,600
 I'm going to prove this kid's not ours.

346
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,000
 And she's throwing eggs away, throwing all the shells in a pot.

347
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,720
 She puts it down and she puts the baby next to the fire.

348
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,600
 Not too close again.

349
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,200
 And the baby's just sitting there crying.

350
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,160
 And the mom's like, oh, I guess it isn't a changeling.

351
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,480
 And then the dad's like, turns to the camera and his eyes are glowing yellow.

352
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
 He's the changeling.

353
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,080
 He's been the changeling all along.

354
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,280
 Why?

355
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,400
 How did this come out?

356
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,160
 How did people use this?

357
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,400
 Was there a real epidemic of people thinking their babies were really 100 year old men

358
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,680
 who have never seen so many eggs near the fire?

359
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,920
 Just such a bizarre story.

360
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,760
 But that was the most interesting thing about the Zanas.

361
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,520
 I wish there was more to tell you.

362
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,200
 And then, speaking of, I wish I had more to tell you, I think I'm out of time for the

363
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
 damn story.

364
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,800
 I know I should have went off on my ecological rant.

365
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,680
 So I don't have time to do the damn story.

366
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,840
 Damn it.

367
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,760
 But I'm not going to just end it on a story about eggshells and babies.

368
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,480
 I'm going to tell you something that is super bizarre.

369
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,600
 And I don't really know how to process it.

370
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:52,760
 In the past probably like 6 to 8 months, I've developed a phobia of alcohol.

371
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,960
 Now it doesn't mean I haven't drank at all in the past 6 to 8 months because I've gone

372
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,600
 out with friends.

373
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,760
 I've had a drink.

374
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 But I've developed and I used to drink heavily when I was in my 20s, when I used to party

375
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
 all the time.

376
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,400
 I drank and I smoked weed and all sorts of stuff.

377
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,560
 And it was no big deal.

378
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
 And then I stopped because I just got bored of it and never really liked it.

379
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,440
 Well I liked it back then, but it was just a social thing and I never drank on my own.

380
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
 It just wasn't my thing.

381
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,520
 It wasn't my bag.

382
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,400
 But recently I've developed a phobia of alcohol.

383
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
 Like just thinking about alcohol.

384
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,440
 If I think about alcohol, I'm like, why am I even thinking about what I'm going to drink

385
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
 tonight at the bar?

386
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,600
 Like why am I alcohol is something?

387
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,760
 When people ask me do you drink, I go, so rarely it's not even worth noting.

388
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,800
 And I've had long term friends who have been like, they'll see me shoot Jack and they'll

389
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,120
 be like, what?

390
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,320
 I've known you for six years.

391
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
 I've only seen you drink beer.

392
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,840
 And I was like, yeah, I drank Jack every once in a while.

393
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
 It's so rare that I'm doing this.

394
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,280
 I have a theory.

395
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
 Now we've talked about this before.

396
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,680
 Before I started doing the podcast, I was pretty miserable.

397
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,360
 What I do is I was trying to be an author.

398
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,600
 I was trying to be a writer and I would come home and I'd be like, oh, I can't wait to

399
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
 get home.

400
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
 I got all these story ideas.

401
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,120
 I know exactly where I'm going to go, what I'm going to do.

402
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,080
 But first I need to take a break.

403
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,440
 So I'd come home and I'd watch YouTube for about six to seven hours.

404
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,880
 And then as I was crawling into bed, I was be completely miserable that I hadn't gotten

405
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,240
 anything accomplished and what a failure I was and how awful things were going in my

406
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
 life.

407
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,400
 And then I'd wake up and I can't wait to get home from work as I'm getting ready to go

408
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
 to work.

409
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,680
 I'm going to do all this writing.

410
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
 Today is going to be different.

411
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,440
 And I was going through that for probably about two or three years.

412
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
 Probably about two.

413
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,080
 I want to say was that like it was probably more like a year and a half.

414
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,960
 It was when I said I'm going to be a writer and I'm going to make a living writing.

415
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,240
 And I would produce stuff.

416
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
 I would write stuff.

417
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,880
 I've been writing all my life, but this was when I was really trying to make a push towards

418
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
 it.

419
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,920
 So, but I would be miserable for a good, good chunk of about a year and a half.

420
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,320
 I just, my life wasn't going where I wanted it to.

421
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
 And then I started doing the podcast.

422
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,560
 Now it's not like the podcast is a living, but the podcast has definitely given me a

423
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
 creative output.

424
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,680
 It's given me a ton of fan support from you guys.

425
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,080
 It's given me, it hasn't paid for stuff.

426
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,760
 It is basically making money now, which is very rare for a podcast.

427
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,000
 So things are going great artistically, financially, all of that.

428
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,960
 But there was a point in time, very recent point in time last year where I was just completely

429
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,560
 miserable.

430
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,040
 And I feel like my life is branched off.

431
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,920
 And I, this is why I think again, it's totally, I have no proof for any of this.

432
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,640
 The reason why all of a sudden a man who's 43 develops a fear of alcohol is that I think

433
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,920
 in an alternate timeline, I am an alcoholic.

434
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,560
 I think in a very, very close alternate timeline, I am an alcoholic and I'm struggling every

435
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:57,600
 day with drinking and it's bleeding over to this universe.

436
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,920
 Very, very weird feeling because I don't even like, like I will sit there and be like, maybe

437
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,840
 I should have alcohol at my apartment.

438
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,640
 So in case a girl comes over, cause you know, a lot of girls in town, a lot of, I think

439
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,720
 a lot of girls in general drink wine.

440
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,200
 I was like, I should have a bottle of like red or red and white wine, not together.

441
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
 That'd be cool.

442
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 It was in that rose.

443
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,080
 I should have a bottle of red, a bottle of white, some nice wine.

444
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,200
 I'll never drink it, but just have it in the house.

445
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,880
 So when girls come over, they can have some.

446
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,760
 And the idea of having alcohol in my house petrifies me, terrifies me.

447
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
 Absolutely.

448
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
 And I've had alcohol.

449
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,360
 I've had ever clear at my house.

450
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,240
 I had like 190 proof alcohol in my house just a few years ago.

451
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,880
 There's no problem.

452
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,840
 But now the idea of having it in my house, like, I hate to use the word, but triggers

453
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,360
 me to the point where I won't have it.

454
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,600
 I remember for some event that had recently passed, I was like, oh, I need to go buy alcohol

455
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
 before I go there.

456
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,600
 So I have something to drink in case they don't have anything to drink there that I drink

457
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 and because I'm on keto.

458
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,240
 And I was like, why am I even trying to process?

459
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,920
 I was actually like getting concerned that I was thinking about buying alcohol.

460
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,760
 And there's nothing, there would have been nothing wrong with me buying alcohol to take

461
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
 to somebody's house.

462
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,880
 If all they had was beer and I needed a keto alternative, there's nothing wrong with that.

463
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,480
 The idea that I was putting any processing power into alcohol before I got to the party,

464
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,880
 really, really concerned me.

465
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,760
 It was really weird.

466
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,840
 And I had this feeling once before, I remember back when I was in my 20s, I was drinking

467
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,200
 all the time, I had one of those big 1.75 liters of vodka sitting in my kitchen.

468
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,720
 And I was laying on my couch and I was super depressed and I'm like, I want to drink all

469
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
 that vodka.

470
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
 I'm just going to get drunk.

471
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,040
 I'm going to drink all that vodka and all I could do all day long was think about drinking

472
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
 vodka as I was laying on my couch.

473
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,080
 And I was talking to my friend Liz and I go, I think I'm an alcoholic and she goes, why

474
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
 am I not going to go?

475
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,240
 All I can do all day long is think about drinking vodka and she goes, are you drinking any

476
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
 vodka?

477
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,720
 And I was like, no, I just think about it and she's like, well, then you're not an alcoholic.

478
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,720
 Like if you think all day long about drinking vodka, but you're too lazy to get up on the

479
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,800
 couch to even pour a shot, probably not an alcoholic.

480
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,000
 And I go, yeah, you're kind of right.

481
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,960
 But I was processing it.

482
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,680
 I was like thinking about it and just the idea of thinking, it's funny now that I remember

483
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,080
 that, even thinking about it back then scared me.

484
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,160
 But then that was like when I was 23.

485
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,100
 So we go 20 years and I go to a party and have a beer, go out, have a shot of Jack.

486
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,600
 Never even really consider it until maybe back then, the two timelines were converging

487
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
 as well.

488
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,080
 But yeah, I feel like I'm in an alternate timeline where the podcast didn't get started

489
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,920
 or the podcast started, but I picked the wrong subject.

490
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,880
 Like I was going to do like a political podcast or a movie review podcast or whatever it was

491
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,840
 and it lasted seven episodes and ended or never did the podcast or whatever.

492
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,840
 And I started drinking because that's an easy, that's a very, very easy out.

493
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:03,080
 It's a cheap and legal way to shut down your brain.

494
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,880
 And I chose that path.

495
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,680
 But now I'm at a point where with my beta blockers, I can't drink anyways.

496
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,440
 As long as I'm on this and they're still trying to figure out exactly why my heart went off.

497
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,120
 They say, "I can't drink anyways."

498
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,160
 And I was talking to my mom on the phone and I said, "I'm very grateful.

499
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,040
 I'm very grateful that I don't have any substance abuse problems."

500
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,120
 And it's funny because that is another thought that I'll just be sitting, sitting at home

501
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,720
 some time or be out somewhere and I'm thinking, "I'm so glad I'm not a drug addict.

502
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,240
 I'm so glad I'm not an alcoholic."

503
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,280
 But my point is is that one, anyone can fall into these traps at any point in time.

504
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,440
 I remember watching a documentary the other day.

505
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,240
 I was watching this documentary about homeless people in New York City and I have a rule

506
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,440
 generally the reason why I watch YouTube is because it can't get super offensive.

507
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,240
 It can't get super gross, right?

508
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,280
 So usually if I bring home a subway sandwich or something or I'm eating some burgers, put

509
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:04,640
 on some YouTube, I'll watch, you know, Ohmrecker play Dead by Daylight for a half hour.

510
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,040
 Whatever it is, I know things aren't going to get too bad.

511
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,640
 And this is the reason why I didn't follow that rule this time.

512
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,480
 I go, "Oh, I have a documentary about homeless people in New York City.

513
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,920
 I'm going to eat dinner and watch this documentary about homeless people in New York City."

514
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,520
 It's like a documentary made from these Swedish filmmakers.

515
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,880
 The opening shot was a homeless...

516
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,280
 I was like, "Are you kidding me?"

517
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,480
 Because I normally don't do this.

518
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,720
 I know this is a couple of months ago this happened to me and then I haven't done this

519
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
 again.

520
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,680
 I'm sitting down to eat dinner and the opening shot of this documentary, some of you guys

521
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,600
 may know this documentary when I say this, the opening shot of the documentary is a homeless

522
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:54,120
 dude blowing some guy, just full on, not silhouetted, not shadowed, but a homeless guy giving some

523
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,040
 other guy a blow job, full on camera frame.

524
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,560
 And I was like, I just put my food down and I go, "Seriously, seriously, this is the

525
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,400
 opening shot of your movie."

526
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,120
 But because it was about homeless people in love and these guys were like, "Yeah, you

527
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,520
 know, I'm with my girlfriend, but sometimes you got to blow a dude to get some drug money."

528
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,760
 The reason why I'm bringing that up is not just to warn people not to watch this documentary

529
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,880
 while eating, it was good documentary.

530
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
 Just don't eat it.

531
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
 You're eating hot dog.

532
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,840
 You're entering a hot dog eating contest.

533
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,200
 You're like, "But first, I want to find out about homeless people in love."

534
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,080
 One of the hobos, one of the homeless people says, "I've seen it happen over and over again.

535
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,640
 Some guy comes from some other part of the country, comes to New York, hooks up with

536
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,140
 a guy."

537
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,160
 And then next thing he knows, the guy from New York has the visitor, has the tourist,

538
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,920
 smoke and meth, smoke and crack.

539
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,720
 Tourist spends all of his money to get home, spends all of it on drugs within a weekend

540
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,700
 stuck in the city, can't leave.

541
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,000
 That's how easy it is to fall into these traps, right?

542
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,320
 And so I feel like, and I'm going to go back to my original point here and start wrapping

543
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,520
 this up, but I feel like, you're like, "No, Jason, tell us more about the homeless people

544
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,940
 in love documentary."

545
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:21,420
 I feel like there is a very, very close universe where I have a drinking problem and it's bleeding

546
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,940
 over to this universe.

547
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,340
 And that may just be some weird hangup I've developed over alcohol over the past couple

548
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:36,060
 months, as possibly I could be, I don't know, I don't really know.

549
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,460
 Obviously that is a far-fetched sci-fi answer, but I can't really think of something else.

550
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,460
 There's been no trigger.

551
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,480
 I haven't lost a friend to alcoholism recently.

552
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,820
 There's been no big event.

553
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:51,800
 I just feel like when I think about alcohol, it scares me.

554
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,320
 I don't want to have it around me.

555
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,040
 I'll go to bars and hang out, obviously, because my buddies will hang out there, but I'll go

556
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,160
 and I'll drink water for the most part.

557
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,280
 And I am not like, "Ooh, I'm not like running away from them when they're drinking their

558
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,880
 ciders and stuff like that."

559
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:14,540
 But it makes me uneasy to think of me being drunk or me having alcohol on me.

560
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:20,500
 Both of those feelings make me feel super uneasy, and I don't like thinking about it.

561
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,560
 And I think that's the way that a struggling drug addict or a struggling alcoholic would

562
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
 feel as well.

563
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,460
 Like, I don't want to be around it.

564
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,020
 It's going to cause bad things.

565
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,380
 And I'm not trying to trivialize this stuff either.

566
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,860
 I'm not trying to be like, "Well, you know, I know what it's like, guys.

567
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,400
 It's my alternate version of myself."

568
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
 I hope it's not...

569
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,800
 I hope it's coming across the way that I wanted to come across, basically, that I've developed

570
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
 this weird hang...

571
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,000
 Basically, that I've developed this weird hang up over alcohol, and I don't know why.

572
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,600
 Because I'm not a drinker.

573
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,880
 I'm not struggling with it.

574
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,600
 I'm not struggling with substance abuse in general, other than nicotine, which I gave

575
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
 up.

576
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
 Haven't you...

577
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,400
 I don't even think about nicotine anymore.

578
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,440
 So some of that sweet, sweet nicotine.

579
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,820
 I don't even... I totally forget that I was even using it for as long as I did.

580
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,020
 Except when I was having to find alternatives.

581
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,820
 I'm sticking tissue paper in my mouth.

582
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,100
 But the actual nicotine high, I'm not really thinking about anymore.

583
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:21,940
 But yeah, I just don't know what other way to explain why I'm going through this.

584
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
 And there may be a...

585
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,980
 Someone could go, "Jason, it's a normal reaction as you're getting older.

586
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,860
 Your body starts processing sugar."

587
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,060
 But again, it's not even like affecting me during an alcohol.

588
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,300
 It's the mental process.

589
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,520
 The idea of me thinking about drinking alcohol that freaks me out.

590
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:43,600
 So is it possible that my little timelines diverged at a very integral point a couple

591
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,680
 months ago, a year ago?

592
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:54,240
 And in one of them, I'm here with you, talking about Dead Rava Radio and all these great

593
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,440
 subjects and everything that's going to come.

594
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,400
 All the great stories to come.

595
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,900
 And then in another one, things didn't have such a happy ending.

596
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,220
 And I find myself trying to relive my glory days of my 20s.

597
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,220
 Nothing really mattered.

598
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
 Just wanted a party.

599
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,960
 And the easiest way to do that was for me to grab a bottle or hang out at a bar.

600
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,300
 If those two timelines are true, if things did diverge right there.

601
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:30,060
 And in one version now, I am an alcoholic that is struggling daily with trying to be

602
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,060
 sober.

603
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:39,440
 Or, where I'm at right now, which is very happy and safe and loved.

604
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,720
 I feel loved in this timeline.

605
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,080
 I hope that when I'm getting some of these negative feelings of wanting to not be around

606
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,720
 alcohol and not wanting to have it around me, not wanting to drink, being fearful of

607
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,960
 alcohol, I hope that that alternate Jason is getting some of the love and warmth that

608
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,000
 I'm getting from this universe.

609
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,300
 And feeling that as well.

610
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,920
 And knowing that in an alternate timeline, things are better.

611
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,000
 In an alternate timeline, the answer is not the drugs or the bottle.

612
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,380
 The answer is something else.

613
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,140
 I hope it works both ways.

614
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,300
 I hope it works both ways.

615
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,140
 Because everyone can have hope.

616
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,300
 Everyone can get better.

617
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:30,640
 Even if they are living in the wrong timeline and things aren't going right, right now.

618
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:39,080
 Hopefully everyone ends up in the timeline that is the healthiest and safest for them.

619
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,800
 That's all we can really hope for.

620
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,560
 And so, alternate Jason, I wish you the best.

621
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,120
 And I hope you find your way.

622
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,400
 And your happiness.
