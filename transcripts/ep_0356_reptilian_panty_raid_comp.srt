1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
 A bizarre conspiracy I just stumbled across just now.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,380
 And then we travel to Moorhead, Minnesota to visit Concordia College.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,800
 The girls dormitory is usually full of beautiful young co-eds studying for classes and getting

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
 ready for school.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,840
 But according to some women, it's also a place haunted by an alien reptilian spirit today

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,840
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:40,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,680
 You know, I was just, I come up with conspiracy theories quite often.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,600
 Come up with conspiracy theories myself all the time.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,240
 And sometimes they're valid and sometimes they're ridiculous.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,680
 Now this first story we're going to talk about, it started off with something that was ridiculous.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
 Honestly, it was ridiculous.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,000
 And I started looking into it and I said, "Maybe if there's, let's see if there's actually

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 something here."

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
 And I started looking into it.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
 So let's go though to really explain this.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
 Growing a magic school bus this.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Bing!

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 We're on the beach.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Whoa, what?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 How are we doing here?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,080
 We're all of a sudden wearing our swimming clothes.

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,760
 So I'm wearing shorts.

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,840
 You're wearing whatever you're wearing.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
 I don't know.

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
 I'm not going to pick.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,480
 I'm not going to pick at your wardrobe.

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,280
 You're wearing swim clothes.

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,360
 And we have a new Patreon.

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
 Lambi.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,320
 Lambi, thank you so much for supporting the show.

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
 Really appreciate it.

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,800
 Lambi will be the lifeguard for this episode.

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,480
 Making sure none of us swim too far out into the sea.

38
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,160
 But I'm like, "Come on guys, let's go."

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
 Splash, splash.

40
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
 You're like, "Dude, it's super cold."

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
 I'm like, "No, no, no, let's swim, let's swim."

42
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,860
 And after you guys end up rescuing me after I black out because I'm not a very good swimmer

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,240
 and I'm in the high tide area.

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,780
 You guys have to pull me back onto the beach and as Lambi has to do CPR on me, I will finally

45
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,780
 come back alive.

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,800
 And I'm like, "Okay, that was a bad idea.

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,040
 I'm not a strong swimmer."

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,080
 But I wanted to find this and I hold up.

49
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,220
 This is really a convoluted intro for what this is about.

50
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,240
 I hold up a plastic drinking bottle.

51
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,040
 Like a plastic soda bottle, right?

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,780
 And you're like, "Everyone's going to stand around."

53
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,400
 I'm like, "Hey, Lambi, don't quit doing that sweet, sweet CPR.

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,560
 Give me some of that mouth to mouth."

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,120
 So while Lambi is still giving me mouth to mouth, I explain this.

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
 I've had a conspiracy theory.

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
 I think recycling is a crock.

58
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,280
 I don't believe that recycling, I think it's a scam.

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,880
 Now I recycle, but I still think it's a scam.

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,280
 I think that a lot of stuff is labeled recycling, but it's just to make people feel good about

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,480
 buying it.

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,960
 I have a story coming up and I don't want to give it away because it's a really interesting

63
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
 story.

64
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,440
 But I know for a fact that some stuff is a scam with recycling.

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,120
 But we'll talk about that in another episode because that involves paper.

66
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,040
 Today, we're going to mainly focus on plastic.

67
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,040
 You're like, "Jason, how many episodes do you have planned about your recycling as a

68
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,640
 scam's conspiracy?"

69
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,840
 Well, here's the thing.

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,640
 I think it's a scam.

71
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,960
 I think, now here, and this is actually a good insight into the mind of a conspiracy

72
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,040
 theorist because I will never claim, ever claim that I am a super smart person.

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,600
 I think I have fairly average intelligence.

74
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,600
 I will never go out and proclaim that I'm super smart.

75
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,000
 I'll say I'm smarter than my brothers, of course, but I don't think I'm smarter than

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 you.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
 And to be fair, you're probably not smarter than me.

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,160
 I think most humans are average.

79
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,080
 But a key to being a conspiracy theorist is having very limited knowledge of what you're

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
 talking about.

81
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,040
 Like, when people talk to me about conspiracy theories involving film, predictive programming,

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,240
 the way the mind works, sociology and stuff like that, I dismiss that.

83
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,720
 I'm like, "No, that doesn't make sense."

84
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,280
 Because I've looked into all that stuff.

85
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,000
 I find myself more educated in, not psychology, but basically armchair psychology and sociology

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 and stuff like that.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
 I've looked into that more.

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,360
 So when people come at me with that stuff, I'm like, "No, this doesn't work because of

89
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
 these things."

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
 I know nothing about the science of recycling at all.

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,040
 So it's very, very easy for me to just come up with the conspiracy saying, "Ah, it's

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
 a scam.

93
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 It's a scam."

94
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,760
 And that's a way that we have to look at people who believe in bizarre conspiracy theories,

95
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,480
 like the one I'm about to say.

96
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,360
 People who believe that we didn't land on the moon tend to be very distrustful of the

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,320
 government and the media, and also don't really have a good grasp on how geometry and physics

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,200
 and astronomy and all of this stuff works together and how it's no different than us

99
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,040
 launching galleons across the ocean.

100
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,920
 There are both these huge feats of human engineering.

101
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,840
 People believe that we didn't land on the moon.

102
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,280
 You'll never meet a person who says, "Oh, I don't believe that cruise ships exist."

103
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,240
 I think that everyone's--I don't think there's anything outside of America.

104
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,600
 I think the ocean just goes on for forever.

105
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,640
 You--actually, that's an interesting conspiracy theory.

106
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,760
 I wonder if people--if you can find people who believe that.

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,520
 But there are people who believe we don't land on the moon.

108
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,320
 Those same people will believe that a Carnival Cruise Line ship exists, but if you went back

109
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
 500 years, you could probably find people who would say, "What?

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
 No.

111
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,200
 Christopher Columbus, that's just a myth.

112
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,840
 No one's ever built a ship that big.

113
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,480
 Nobody's ever crossed the ocean."

114
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
 It doesn't make sense.

115
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
 It's fake news.

116
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
 Fake news.

117
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
 Fake wood carvings.

118
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,760
 So, I know nothing about recycling, and it's really easy for people who don't know something

119
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,560
 to develop a conspiracy theory about it.

120
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,480
 This is the reason I believe recycling is a conspiracy theory.

121
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
 I think it's a crock.

122
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,720
 I shouldn't say a conspiracy theory.

123
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,040
 So I buy a bottle.

124
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,240
 I buy a clear bottle of Coca-Cola.

125
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,720
 I drink the Coca-Cola.

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,640
 I throw the bottle into the recycling--now, here's really where I got my conspiracy theory.

127
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,960
 You remove the bottle cap.

128
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,560
 You throw it into the garbage can.

129
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,040
 And you're supposed to remove the cap because it's supposed to be a safety thing.

130
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,400
 So basically, you are recycling the bottle, but the cap itself is almost as heavy as the

131
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,800
 bottle if you think about it.

132
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,480
 Like, yeah, the bottle's bigger, but the cap's very heavy, and you can't recycle the cap.

133
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,200
 So you're recycling only half the plastic in the bottle.

134
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,480
 If recycling was real, if bottle recycling--now, I'm gonna tell you this.

135
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,600
 I looked this up.

136
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
 I looked this up.

137
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,760
 I can already tell there's a couple of people pulling their hair out right now.

138
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,440
 If recycling is real, if you can really recycle a bottle, you should be able to recycle all

139
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,240
 the plastic, not just half of it, because that lid is so heavy.

140
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,720
 Now, you're like, Jason, this isn't really your first segment, is it?

141
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
 Well, here's the thing.

142
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 I looked it up.

143
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,880
 They have now developed a technology, like super recently, to be able to recycle both

144
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,240
 the bottle and the cap.

145
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,280
 They wanted you to take the cap off, throw the bottle into the recycling.

146
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,320
 They melt that down, and then like the cap she kind of just threw in the garbage can,

147
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,680
 but that's still a ton of plastic.

148
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,760
 So recycling companies have said, oh, we figured out a way to do it.

149
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,600
 Now, the articles I read, this might be a conspiracy theory, but they didn't say how

150
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,000
 they know how to do it, just so they can do it.

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,160
 Still suspicious, but that's not what this is about, because that's a stupid conspiracy

152
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
 theory.

153
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
 I can guarantee you that if I spent more than 20 minutes looking into it, I could find out

154
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,360
 one that the cap doesn't have as much plastic as the bottle.

155
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,120
 I mean, the cap does seem awfully heavy, but it's a stupid conspiracy theory.

156
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,560
 I do believe recycling is a scam.

157
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
 I do believe that.

158
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,960
 And again, it's looking to the mind of a conspiracy theorist at heart.

159
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,720
 The funny thing is, you can't really debunk this, because you hear how scattershot it

160
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
 is.

161
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,520
 I've kind of touched on four different topics.

162
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,280
 If I was super serious about this, the way people are super serious about Flat Earth,

163
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,760
 it would be really hard to argue logic into my head, because I would just keep changing.

164
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,600
 Oh, if you argued, well, that's not the same amount of plastic, Jason, you're just, that's

165
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,800
 a weird, that's just not true.

166
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,880
 You're making the same, it's not true.

167
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,160
 I could pivot to, well, how do you recycle a Mountain Dew bottle, which is green, and

168
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,040
 this other bottle that's clear, and you can keep pivoting.

169
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
 That's the other thing.

170
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,960
 If you've ever argued with a conspiracy theorist online or in real life, it's entertaining

171
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,640
 and frustrating.

172
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,840
 It's entertaining because there's just all areas to be around, and it's frustrating

173
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,920
 because they just keep pivoting every time you hit a target.

174
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,640
 And then once they get to something you can't answer, they go, "Mmm-hmm, that's what I thought."

175
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,880
 Or they'll always just go, "I'm just asking questions."

176
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,840
 So I'm just asking questions about recycling.

177
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,200
 But that's not what this is about, actually.

178
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,200
 I did find a legit conspiracy theory involving bottles and bottle caps.

179
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
 You're like, "Damn it, Jason!

180
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,080
 I thought you were going to move on to the next story."

181
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,080
 No.

182
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,240
 So, I will eventually.

183
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,680
 As I was doing this research, quote unquote research, I found this thing.

184
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
 They had this in 2017.

185
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,960
 I'm sure they've done it in other years.

186
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,920
 I don't think they're like, "Done and done.

187
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
 Our work is done."

188
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,360
 They had this thing called the International Coastal Cleanup.

189
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,720
 People all over the world were walking along the beach, picking up garbage.

190
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,200
 Number one thing picked up, and I've heard this before, cigarette butts.

191
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,560
 Whenever you hear about that island or trash out in the middle of the ocean, it's like

192
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,920
 a four mile or five mile, whatever, it doesn't matter, big floating island, it's mostly cigarette

193
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
 butts.

194
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,920
 This is the number one contaminant they're finding.

195
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,400
 Anyways, number two was plastic bottles.

196
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,160
 But number three, so here, let me get you the numbers here.

197
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
 You know what I'm doing?

198
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,520
 You're just telling us a ghost story.

199
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,440
 I'm getting to the ghost story.

200
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
 This is trippy.

201
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,600
 This is trippy.

202
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,760
 Number one cigarette butts, 1.8 million.

203
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,760
 Number two, plastic beverage bottles, 1.5 million.

204
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,720
 1.5 million for a plastic bottle.

205
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,520
 And bottle caps, 822,000.

206
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:59,120
 So we're looking at a difference of around 700,000 more bottles than bottle caps.

207
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,680
 Now I know what you're thinking.

208
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,840
 I know what you're thinking.

209
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,880
 Jason, didn't you just say people remove the bottle caps from the bottles to recycle

210
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
 them?

211
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,760
 And so it would make sense that you were finding more bottles than bottle caps.

212
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
 That's true.

213
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
 However, isn't it...

214
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,040
 They didn't go to a recycling center and go, "Hey, look, there's more bottles than bottle

215
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
 caps."

216
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,120
 They're walking along beaches all over the world.

217
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,240
 All over the world.

218
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,320
 And that is a vast difference between the two.

219
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,640
 So they put out a fact sheet.

220
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,880
 The international coastal cleanup people put out a fact sheet.

221
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
 And based on...

222
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,600
 It's broken down by country.

223
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,560
 We have countries that have 46,000 bottles they picked up and 41,000 plastic bottle caps.

224
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,480
 That is realistic.

225
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,920
 Because again, you could figure a good amount of them were people leaving them in their

226
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,680
 car or whatever.

227
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,960
 You figure bottles washing up on beaches, but still they should be relatively close.

228
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:01,920
 We have countries that have 76,000 plastic bottles found and only 27,000 bottle caps.

229
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,760
 In America, 225,000 plastic bottles picked up off the beach.

230
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,760
 76,000 bottle caps.

231
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,680
 And to make things just even more bizarre, they could get any weirder.

232
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
 There is a country, I can't really read the PDFs, I'm just reading all these numbers.

233
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,160
 One country, 11,000 plastic bottles found.

234
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,400
 15,000 plastic bottle caps.

235
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,000
 So here's...

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 This is...

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 This...

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,680
 The math doesn't add up.

239
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,040
 There is something going on with plastic bottles.

240
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,040
 I don't know if recycling is a scam.

241
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
 Really?

242
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,760
 It's hard for me to keep a straight face when I say that.

243
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,320
 Even though when people tell me about recycling, I'm always like, "Yeah."

244
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,040
 They're like, "Dude, you need to recycle."

245
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,280
 I'm like, "I'm just throwing paper in the garbage."

246
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,280
 I mean, I recycle sometimes.

247
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,360
 But I don't go out of my way to recycle.

248
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
 But I do think...

249
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,760
 I think they're summing up with plastic bottles and plastic bottle caps.

250
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
 I don't know what...

251
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,080
 This might be the most vague conspiracy I've ever covered.

252
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
 But...

253
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,880
 Question number one.

254
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,120
 Why did it take so long to be able to recycle plastic bottles together?

255
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,880
 It had something to do with machinery, but that's a little weird.

256
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,040
 Two, why are we finding...

257
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,320
 Why is it almost never the same amount of plastic bottles being found to plastic bottle caps?

258
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,680
 It should be within spitting distance.

259
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,880
 But we're talking about 1.5 over globally 1.5 million plastic bottles and 822,000 plastic

260
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,380
 bottle caps.

261
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,280
 Where are the rest of those bottle caps going?

262
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,880
 Maybe you know.

263
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,400
 Maybe you know.

264
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
 Maybe you know, as I'm pointing directly at you.

265
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,400
 I'm now sitting up on the beach, soaking wet.

266
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,440
 You guys are just still sitting there, sitting around the beach, and as I'm pointing right

267
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
 at you.

268
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:06,720
 A darkness falls over the land.

269
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,440
 I'm not gonna keep doing that voice for these giant triangle spaceships.

270
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
 Appear over the grass and stuff.

271
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,600
 And with them comes the monsters.

272
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,720
 A quest has been unlocked or currently being developed.

273
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,920
 Yeah, and then the monsters will stop you.

274
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,200
 Can you unlock the secrets?

275
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,800
 Can you find the hidden civilization full of food and stuff?

276
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,280
 There's a horse and then like, it's just not as bad as where you're gonna start off?

277
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:50,120
 Then join the official Dead Rabbit Radio Minecraft server completely open to the public now until

278
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,360
 somebody totally graffitizes it.

279
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:02,000
 And I have to reset stuff, but until then, join on the quest to defeat the giant triangle

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,080
 ships I made.

281
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,480
 I mean, that it's descended from space.

282
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,440
 Find the hidden map and then go to where all of the Patreon supporters have been building

283
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,280
 stuff and it's basically a hidden civilization because it's not as gross and grody as where

284
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,480
 you will spawn.

285
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,120
 So join us.

286
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,280
 The link is in the show notes for the Minecraft server.

287
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
 Join us.

288
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,880
 Well, there was an ad for our Minecraft server.

289
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,080
 So yes, come and join us.

290
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,040
 Come and join us until it gets trolled into oblivion.

291
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,600
 No, I have this button.

292
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,320
 I have this option, I guess.

293
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,200
 I hit it and it'll revert the world back 24 hours or something like that.

294
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,400
 So if people go and just completely obliterate or just start trolling people, they get banned

295
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,760
 and then everything gets restored.

296
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,960
 That's kind of cool.

297
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,480
 And yeah, I'm going to be on it after this episode.

298
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,520
 So you can get on and explain to me how recycling works and how mere differences of numbers

299
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,560
 does not a conspiracy make.

300
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,640
 But hey, man, if people can believe that trees are mountains or mountains or trees, I can

301
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,240
 believe that there's something up with bottles and bottle caps.

302
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,160
 So, or we're both idiots.

303
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,840
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

304
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:25,280
 Now our next story comes from a little magazine known as UFO Roundup.

305
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,480
 Magazine might not be the right term.

306
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
 I think it's mostly a website, but on the last episode I talked about, I found a website

307
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,320
 that was UFO sightings from the year of 1988, which I thought was weird and kind of quaint.

308
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,720
 I was looking through them and they didn't have a lot of info.

309
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,800
 The one last one is about a guy trapped in a jar and it was kind of cool.

310
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,680
 This one, I was able to find more info and boy, did I find more info on this one.

311
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,840
 We're going to Moorhead, Minnesota.

312
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,120
 So let's drive off the beach.

313
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
 We're hopping the Jason DeLappie.

314
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,200
 We're going to drive all the way from a nameless beach as I'm drinking sodas and just throwing

315
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,120
 them out the car one after another.

316
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,400
 Glug glug glug glug.

317
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,600
 Throwing them out and then I'll drive a mile and throw out the bottle cap.

318
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,000
 Glug glug.

319
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
 You're like you are, you're the man.

320
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
 You're the shadow behind the conspiracy.

321
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,560
 I'm like, whoa.

322
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,600
 Ha ha ha.

323
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,560
 Glug glug glug glug.

324
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,600
 Throwing out.

325
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,760
 We get to Moorhead, Minnesota.

326
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,680
 It's March 1988, obviously.

327
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,080
 And I'm going to read you.

328
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,120
 There's going to be a lot of reading because you really have to get the intent behind the

329
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,040
 authors really in this case.

330
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,280
 So in the 1988 website, we have this written.

331
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
 This is the summary.

332
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,240
 Quote, "The witness, this young woman, the witness had returned to Huyum Hall,

333
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,120
 the girl's dorm at Concordia College, from an early morning jog and was taking a shower.

334
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
 She soon noticed the shadow blocking the bathroom lights.

335
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,840
 Turning around, she saw a strange figure hovering above the shower door.

336
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:58,240
 The creature was described as greenish, scaly, and reptilian in appearance.

337
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,280
 The witness screamed and it apparently disappeared.

338
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,800
 Source, UFO Roundup, Volume 6, Number 2.

339
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,400
 This has all the hallmarks of a creepy story.

340
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,840
 One, you're in the bathroom.

341
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,880
 It's always creepy in the bathroom.

342
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,920
 You're taking a shower.

343
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,720
 Reptilian, alien creature watching you shower.

344
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,520
 That's creepy.

345
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
 Has the hallmarks of a good story.

346
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 Young woman.

347
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,160
 It's always a good bonus.

348
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,680
 A young college age woman.

349
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,720
 And she's in the shower.

350
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,440
 So it had the hallmarks of a good story and a spooky story.

351
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,160
 And I was able to find out more.

352
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,960
 So I was like, yes, I found UFO Roundup Volume 6, Number 2 online.

353
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,120
 And I began, I found a website that the person who wrote,

354
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,840
 the person who wrote the summary for this really didn't do the story justice.

355
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,760
 Like what I just read you was what you would basically read in a police report.

356
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,280
 When you actually find UFO Roundup Volume 6, Number 2,

357
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:59,200
 you find an author who loves the subject matter that he is writing about.

358
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,840
 Absolutely is in love with this story.

359
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,000
 So when we go to UFO Roundup Volume 6, Number 2,

360
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,040
 which will I think go down in dead rabbit radio history,

361
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,640
 as being one of the steamiest things we've covered, no pun intended.

362
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,160
 Because apparently at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota,

363
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
 Huyam Hall, the girl dormitory,

364
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,160
 there were multiple encounters of Reptilian creatures and more.

365
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,920
 So let's look at what the UFO Roundup Volume 6, Number 2 actually says about this.

366
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:40,800
 Quote, "In late January of 1986, freshman Amanda Flynn," and then we have parentheses,

367
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,760
 "all names have been changed to protect the ladies' privacy."

368
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
 Why give her a last name?

369
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,080
 That's what I, that's one of the weird things about this.

370
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,920
 It makes me think that the author was kind of building a fantasy.

371
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,480
 Maybe these girls are based on on chick ski new in high school and college.

372
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,320
 Just Amanda, Amanda's fine.

373
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,280
 I don't need to know Flynn.

374
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,640
 I don't need to look her up on Facebook.

375
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,480
 And it's fake anyway.

376
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,080
 So I'm sure there's an Amanda Flynn somewhere in Minnesota.

377
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,960
 It's just weird.

378
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,320
 These probably are his exes.

379
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,640
 In quote, "In late January of 1986, freshman Amanda Flynn was in the bathroom,

380
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,280
 clad in her underwear, washing her hair in preparation for a date that night."

381
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,360
 Parenthesis, a date with the author.

382
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,600
 I was told, no, he didn't actually say that.

383
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
 But again, we already have a difference in tone.

384
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,320
 The first one was monster in the bedroom or bathroom.

385
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,080
 And then it was just fact, fact, fact.

386
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,400
 This guy is laying out a straight up fan fiction of,

387
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
 now apparently this stuff really happened.

388
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,080
 Like I said, there was multiple reports of reptilians in bathrooms around here.

389
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,640
 But there's a big difference between saying she was having a jog and red for a shower and then

390
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,160
 clad in her underwear, washing her hair in preparation for a date that night.

391
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,920
 Here we go on.

392
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,000
 Amanda was leaning over the sink.

393
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,320
 Why was she washing her hair in the sink?

394
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,440
 Do people actually do that?

395
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
 I've seen that in movies.

396
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
 But she is in the bathroom.

397
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,240
 There is a shower.

398
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,520
 But I guess, I mean, again, now you have a girl in her underwear bent over, washing her hair.

399
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,160
 Here we go on.

400
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,440
 Amanda was leaning over the sink, scrubbing her shampoo-lathered hair with her fingers.

401
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,440
 Suddenly, she felt a thumb and forefinger pinch the elastic waistband of her panties.

402
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,680
 The chilly fingers pulled the waistband far back and let fly.

403
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,800
 Snap!

404
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,360
 I didn't add that sound effect.

405
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
 They're actually wrote snap.

406
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,440
 I have to remind you, this is UFO roundup volume six, number two.

407
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,120
 This is not an Archie comic.

408
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,160
 People read this because they want to learn about creatures from another planet.

409
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,920
 But this is written as a level of like a porkey spec script.

410
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,480
 Here we go.

411
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,440
 We're going to continue.

412
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,480
 Ow!

413
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,640
 Again, I'm not adding that sound effect in the UFO report.

414
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:56,960
 Ow!

415
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,960
 Looking at the mirror, Amanda saw a hooded and caped figure behind her, reflected in the mirror.

416
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:13,200
 The hood shadowed much of his face, revealing a gaunt, dark green reptilian chin and thin,

417
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,160
 lipless mouth.

418
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:20,640
 The black cape hid much of his body, showing only a glimpse of a scaly chest.

419
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,120
 Amanda gasped out loud.

420
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,720
 Then she got angry, thinking it was probably some fraternity brother from Fargo.

421
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,640
 What school do you attend?

422
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
 Are you attending Galaxy High?

423
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,760
 At what point do you look up in the mirror and see a reptilian person and go,

424
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,720
 "Oh, those are those guys from Fargo, the fighting Fargo lizards.

425
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,840
 Oh, I know them."

426
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,480
 What point?

427
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,520
 Why would you even consider that that might be a guy?

428
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:57,280
 Anyways, she turns around, she slaps the alien, her hand passes through midair,

429
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,240
 and then it ends with the statement, there was no one behind her.

430
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,000
 And then the author doesn't say this, but we'll assume the author was thinking

431
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,280
 that this beautiful, what was her fate, made up name, Amanda Flynn,

432
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,640
 ran out of the room, screaming, arms flying in the air, revealing her beautiful bare skin.

433
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,040
 She runs into the author's arms, "Save me, save me from the aliens."

434
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,160
 Totally different way of talking about this stuff.

435
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
 And this goes on and on and on.

436
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,800
 He does go on to report, the author does go on to report.

437
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,280
 In 1988, Kathy Oberg was in the bathroom and she decided to take a shower.

438
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,760
 And this is where he uses the term soaking herself beneath the steaming shower head.

439
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,520
 "Dude, we get it. You want to bang these chicks? We get it.

440
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,360
 You don't have to go that far out."

441
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,240
 We understand.

442
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,200
 Anyways, that was the first story that was in that little UFO roundup.

443
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,760
 She came out and she saw the alien.

444
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,680
 The weird terminology, hovering above the shower door.

445
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,120
 So how tall was this thing?

446
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,400
 How would you hover above a shower door?

447
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,080
 Like, was he two inches tall and he was right above the top of the door?

448
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,160
 Or was he floating horizontally?

449
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,360
 I don't get what that means.

450
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,480
 But anyways, and then this creature, he disappears.

451
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,240
 So we already heard that story.

452
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,160
 In 1989, sophomore Nancy Peterson, fake name, she is sleeping in bed.

453
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,120
 Here's another story.

454
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,160
 All of these stories involve women barely dressed,

455
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,560
 which makes me a little suspicious about this stuff.

456
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,320
 But she's going to bed and she feels she goes to pull her blanket up and then

457
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,280
 the blanket gets pulled up for her and she thinks it's her roommate.

458
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,240
 And do roommates tuck each other in?

459
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,040
 Like, I've had roommates before, but I've never been like, good night, good night, Todd.

460
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,840
 I've never done that.

461
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,520
 But anyways, she thinks that the roommate's tucking her in and then we get to this

462
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,760
 sentence in this great UFO Roundup Volume 6, Number 2.

463
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,520
 But as her head nestled on the pillow, Nancy's eyes popped wide open.

464
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,080
 Hold it.

465
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,920
 Since when does Margie have only three fingers?

466
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,760
 She sits up in bed and she sees a creature.

467
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,560
 She was in a bunk bed, so like, she looks and she sees the ladder at the end of the bed.

468
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,960
 She sees the creature peeking over the end of the bed.

469
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,400
 Have a nice sleep tonight as you're going to sleep and you imagine a little reptilian

470
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,760
 kind of peeking over your bed as your three-fingered roommate

471
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,120
 tucks you in.

472
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,560
 Sleep well.

473
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,440
 But anyways, so it goes on and on and on.

474
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,400
 And then there's some ghost story that also happened at Huyum Hall.

475
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,840
 It's not really even a ghost story.

476
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,560
 This girl wakes up and her roommate is walking around naked except for thigh high.

477
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,240
 The dude, the dude writing this definitely wants to bang these girls.

478
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,240
 It's like, just so we're all clear on this.

479
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
 Don't sue me.

480
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,480
 I'll say allegedly wants to bang these girls.

481
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,480
 But all of the stories involved women barely dressed.

482
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
 Barely barely dressed.

483
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:59,440
 This one, the woman wakes up, her roommate, her roommate is wearing thigh high socks,

484
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,400
 not socks, thigh high pantyhose, a choker, an opera gloves and nothing else.

485
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,720
 And begins wandering around Huyum Hall as the roommate follows her.

486
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,760
 Doesn't want to wake her up because she doesn't know what she's going to do.

487
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,680
 She's sleepwalking.

488
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,560
 And then finally her roommate wakes up and she goes, oh my goodness,

489
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,000
 like I'm naked in a middle of public and the friend puts a bathrobe on her.

490
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,440
 And then the stalk.

491
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,240
 So that's just a girl who's sleepwalking, right?

492
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,280
 A girl who the author wants to have sex with.

493
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,120
 Who's sleepwalking?

494
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,680
 Fine.

495
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,520
 That's his made-up story.

496
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,440
 But then, I mean it may have happened, but so that's that story.

497
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
 But then why is that in UFO Roundup?

498
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,120
 That's what I was thinking too.

499
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,960
 So they had to add, i.e. make up this detail to make it paranormal.

500
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,560
 The roommate goes, the roommate turns to her naked friend, well now she's in a terry cloth robe,

501
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,640
 monogrammed with the author's initials.

502
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
 Oh my boyfriend gave this to me.

503
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,240
 The roommate goes, it's so weird.

504
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,880
 Like you're walking around dressed like that.

505
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,880
 You're sleepwalking, but how did you ever come into possession of opera gloves?

506
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,200
 Dun dun dun.

507
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,080
 So it's like a ghost or reptilian gave her opera gloves.

508
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,280
 Apparently she owns thigh high stockings.

509
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,880
 Thigh high stockings.

510
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,200
 She was also wearing black pumps.

511
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,560
 She was also wearing black high heels.

512
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,560
 So she owns a choker.

513
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,960
 She owns thigh high fishnet stockings.

514
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,840
 She owns black pumps.

515
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,880
 She doesn't own opera gloves.

516
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,600
 That's the mystery.

517
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,680
 That's where she get the opera gloves from.

518
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,200
 So according to UFO Roundup Volume 6 Number 2,

519
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,520
 we are supposed to believe that there is a, there is supposed to be a,

520
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,160
 and I assume I'm kind of at a loss for words because even I'm looking at this and I'm thinking,

521
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,200
 so is the reptilian an alien?

522
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,800
 Is the reptilian a demon?

523
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,440
 The fact that it's wearing clothes makes me think it's an alien or it's wearing a cloak.

524
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,000
 It also could be a Scooby Doo villain.

525
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,160
 It could be the author of this story.

526
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,480
 Everyone's like, man, where'd you get such good details?

527
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,880
 How are you able to tell what time it was on their clock?

528
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,320
 He's like, uh, uh, but we don't know whether or not,

529
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,920
 we'll assume these stories are true just because they're just because they're hilarious.

530
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,360
 We don't know if the reptilian is an alien visiting this

531
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,160
 college, which if it is, I mean, it's a much better gig than mutilating cows.

532
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,160
 If you think about it, if you're an alien armada and you're trying to figure out like

533
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:48,080
 ways to invade earth or whatever, do reptilian stuff, this one dude gets assigned to the anal probe

534
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,040
 division.

535
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,280
 This other guy gets involved in, his job is just mutilating cows all day long.

536
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,640
 And then you get assigned to Sector Gamma 9, which happens to be a girl's dormitory in the middle of

537
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,760
 Minnesota.

538
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,160
 Your job is to just appear behind them while they're the least clothed.

539
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,160
 I mean, that, I mean, reptilians may think human women are disgusting.

540
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,160
 And then in that case, they're like, oh man, I wish it was knee deep in a cow's rectum right now.

541
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,320
 But I'm going to assume that they think humans are beautiful as well.

542
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,560
 So he's digging his work, you got to love what you do.

543
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,480
 And then there's stories of like, just basic paranormal stuff.

544
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,880
 There are televisions turning on and off, girls hearing their names called out in the middle of

545
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,200
 the night.

546
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,560
 Suspiciously, suspiciously, the voice sounds similar to the author of this article.

547
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,680
 When he came to interview them, they're like, hmm, have you been here before?

548
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
 I never recognized your voice.

549
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,320
 And he's like, no, no.

550
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,400
 He's hiding his black cloak and lizard mask behind his back.

551
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,440
 Is it possible?

552
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,400
 We'll assume that the author was not dressing up and perpetrating these crimes.

553
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,360
 Those were all jokes.

554
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,160
 They were all alleged.

555
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,360
 This is a comedy podcast.

556
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,400
 So that aside, that aside, there is that concept of high strangeness.

557
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,400
 There is that concept of the paranormal, meaning both UFOs and Bigfoot and ghosts and stuff like that.

558
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,800
 If this school is some sort of vector for those type of things, it wouldn't make sense that you would have

559
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,000
 reptilian sightings and then like basic televisions turning on and off, cold,

560
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,280
 cold spots and things like that.

561
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,840
 The brings up the interesting question is what if almost every haunted house actually has a

562
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,320
 reptilian or some other thing in it?

563
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,400
 When we talk about haunted graveyards and haunted forests and haunted ensilums,

564
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,320
 those things are creepy in and of themselves.

565
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,160
 But what if behind those darkened corners, there's things that are

566
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,440
 more sinister, more intelligent.

567
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,240
 A ghost is always just kind of a thing that floats around.

568
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,120
 The worst it could do is kind of like scary or knock a pan over, push you.

569
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,640
 And then if demon could possess you or possess someone you love, those things are horrible too.

570
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,400
 But an alien in a haunted house would have to be one of the most terrifying things because now

571
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:03,040
 you're not simply facing down a dead human, you're facing down a living alien of a superior intellect

572
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,080
 from a world that is not your own.

573
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,680
 But it does make you think the next time you're in a supposed haunted house,

574
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,080
 the next time someone tells you a story about a ghost lurking around the corner or

575
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,400
 a little girl that haunts the hallway of your apartment complex,

576
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,760
 you may laugh, you may get scared.

577
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,520
 But then you may have to think that that manifestation of a ghost is actually the

578
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,400
 byproduct of something else warping our reality.

579
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,400
 That something else could be an alien presence who's more sinister than the human mind could

580
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,120
 ever imagine.

581
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,840
 If you have to have your choice between being trapped in a haunted house with the spirit of a man

582
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:53,680
 who's trying to move on to the other side, or being trapped in the house with an alien beyond

583
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,640
 our comprehension sent here to gather intelligence on what it means to be human,

584
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:06,560
 you may choose the ghost, you may choose the alien, but in reality you may not have a choice.

585
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,440
 Both may come together part and parcel.

586
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,680
 And if that is the case, there's no such thing as just an ordinary haunting.

587
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,480
 There's no such thing as a friendly spirit.

588
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,320
 Because while you're trying to pay attention to the wrappings,

589
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,920
 while you're trying to make peace with the ghost in your cupboard,

590
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,040
 you should know that an alien intelligence could be watching you.

591
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,960
 Watching you while you undress.

592
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,880
