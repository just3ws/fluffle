1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 A man accused of a crime he didn't commit becomes a tree.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,800
 And then we travel to- that's not true, but we'll get to that.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:21,000
 And then we travel to the Himalayas, where we explore an interesting story of a CIA agent on a quest.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,700
 His mission, retrieve the Yeti's arm.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,700
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,200
 I don't know what's big down, actually I'm a lot big down.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:37,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,200
 We got a bunch of stuff to cover today, so we're gonna jump right into it.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,700
 First bit of news is my stomach's upset, so yay me. Have to deal with that.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,200
 Secondly, we got a new Patreon. We actually got a lot of Patreons over the weekend,

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
 but I'm gonna do one per episode, spread you guys out.

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,700
 Our first Patreon of this week is Lori Snyder.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,700
 So thank you, thanks Lori for donating to the show. Really, really helps a lot.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,200
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,700
 Just hope to get the word out about the show. Really, really helps out a lot as well.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,700
 Leave us a review. We have merchandise as well, so all those things.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,700
 Secondly, again, thank you Lori.

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,700
 Secondly, this is not a bit. I'm warning you guys that tomorrow's episode,

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,700
 the- you know how I put up the different art, podcast art, you see it on the YouTube,

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:31,200
 tomorrow's episode is going to contain what I believe is a haunted photograph.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,200
 It's definitely a haunting photograph, but this photograph might actually be cursed.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,200
 I was gonna do the story today, but because I was super creeped out when I looked at it,

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
 as I was getting ready to go to work this morning at like 6 in the morning,

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,200
 I was like looking at- the photo is creepy.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,200
 So if you don't want to see a creepy photo, there's- it's just gonna appear

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
 When you download the episode, and you're watching it on YouTube,

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,700
 it's just gonna be this photo for a half hour, especially if you're watching it on YouTube.

30
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,700
 There's no escape. As podcast listeners, you know, you just look at our- put our phone in our pocket, we're fine.

31
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,200
 But I'm warning you guys, if you don't want to see a cursed photo, just skip tomorrow's episode.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,700
 However, tomorrow's episode is pretty good, so it's either- do you want to be cursed,

33
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,700
 or do you want to hear a good episode of Dead Rapper Radio? It's up to you.

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,200
 But I wanted to give you guys that warning.

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,200
 Now, this episode is also good. You don't have to skip this one, and go to sleep waiting for tomorrow to come closer.

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
 Let's go ahead and get started here with our first story.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,200
 We are headed off to Mobile, Alabama, so Lori, you take control of the Carbindercopter.

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,200
 We're boarding on it. Get on- get on before the creepy photo, creepy photos, following us.

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,700
 We're like, "No, no, hurry, we're leaving some people behind." Nah, nah, we take off.

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:03:15,700
 *tututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututututut

41
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,200
 We're in the streets of Mobile, Alabama. We're in magical 1834 clothes, so, like, what is that?

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,700
 Like, rats, basically, cloth, sewn together, so I don't even know where they wore back then.

43
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,200
 But anyways, we're walking around with these clothes. It's all wool, it's all itchy.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,700
 We're walking around, and I guess everything was made of cotton in the south.

45
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,700
 Anyways, that's not the point. It's not the point. We're walking through Mobile, Alabama,

46
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,700
 and we see a dude walking down the street. We're seeing tons of dudes walking down the street,

47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,700
 but we see one in particular. His name is Charles R.S. Boynton.

48
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,200
 He's a known gambler. That's kind of what he's known for. He's a gambler, right?

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,700
 And he's walking with this other dude, his friend, acquaintance, maybe?

50
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,700
 Nathaniel Frost is this dude. And they're walking on the street together, and everyone sees this.

51
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,200
 It's a slow day, obviously. Everyone's paying attention to Chuck and Nathaniel.

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:16,200
 Later, however, Nathaniel is found stabbed to death by a cemetery, which, to be fair, is convenient.

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 It's very, very polite of the killer to stab you at a cemetery. Stabs him to death, and he was robbed.

54
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,200
 So people go, "Okay, let's look at this." Nathaniel owed Charles money, because they're both gamblers,

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,700
 and they've placed some bad bets. Nathaniel owns Charles money. Charles and Nathaniel are seen on this day, May 11th.

56
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,700
 Walking on the street, Nathaniel ends up dead and robbed. Charles probably did it.

57
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:47,200
 So Charles is arrested. He goes to trial, and he's found guilty. None of that should be shocking to anybody.

58
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,700
 He's found guilty, and he goes, "This is a quote. I'm in it. I love the... This? Okay, here's the thing.

59
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,700
 Okay, let me read this quote to you, and then we'll kind of go into it." He stands up.

60
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:06,700
 Charles stands up and goes, "I'm innocent, and as proof, a mighty oak tree will pop out of my grave.

61
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,200
 You should probably want to show evidence before you're executed."

62
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:18,200
 Like, if you have the ability to have a magical curse, you might want it to be, "I'm innocent, and as proof,

63
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,700
 a tree will appear in my hand right now, being a little palm tree in his hand." Everyone's like, "Ah."

64
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,700
 But anyways, he doesn't really think ahead. This guy apparently has the ability to spring a life.

65
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,200
 He's spontaneous creation of life. But anyways, he is executed. And then they bury him.

66
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:44,200
 But then an oak tree appears out of his grave, and that tree exists today. It's called the Boynton Oak.

67
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 Very, very famous. Okay, let me put that in air quotes.

68
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,700
 It's famous for ghost hunters in Mobile, Alabama, that you can go and you can visit this tree.

69
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:01,200
 It's a paranormal event. It's the man who said, "If I'm innocent, may an oak tree pop out of my grave."

70
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:08,700
 So, did he act--was he innocent? Now it's a true crime story. No, he most likely was not innocent.

71
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,200
 Yes, circumstantial evidence and all, but there was no--as far as I know, no other suspects.

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 I don't know if there were any, like if he had any leads. If he was like, "No, no, give me 48 hours and I'll use my oak powers.

73
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,200
 I'll use the power of the trees to find the real murderer." He's talking to acorns.

74
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 That didn't happen. He was probably the guy who murdered him. And here's the thing, though.

75
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:38,700
 Here's the--maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm--maybe I'm gonna wake up. There's a bunch of ghosts--ghosts of squirrels floating around me.

76
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,700
 Why'd you mess with Charles? He's the king of the forest. The--this is actually--the reason why I wanted to cover this story.

77
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,200
 One, 'cause it is this weird paranormal story that gets passed around a lot. And there's physical proof of it.

78
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 Charles Boynton is a real historical person. There is a real tree on his grave. I think that--and this is hilarious.

79
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,200
 If--if my theory is true, this might be the greatest scam ever perpetrated, ever.

80
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,200
 I get arrested for murdering Nathaniel Frost, right? I'm sitting in jail.

81
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:14,200
 And I want to have my--I did it. I totally did it, but I want to have my name cleared.

82
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:21,700
 What I--what I--now, some of you guys out there may go, "Jason, this is impossible." But I don't think so. I don't think so.

83
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:29,200
 So, what I would do is I would get an acorn and I'd swallow it, right? Before I died.

84
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,200
 Now, you would--I don't think you would have to time it right, 'cause if you swallowed it, like, a couple days before, your stomach acid would--

85
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,700
 and to do this segment, I had to do a bunch of research on whether or not you can eat acorns.

86
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,700
 You can. If you eat two, they actually have this thing--I didn't--this just sounds--hellish.

87
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,200
 They contain a thing called anti-nutrients that actually suck nutrients out of you.

88
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,200
 That's so bizarre that that would even exist on the planet. But anyways, you have to cook acorns to get rid of the anti-nutrients,

89
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,200
 but you can eat a raw acorn. You're just not supposed to eat a bunch of them.

90
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,200
 If you swallowed the acorn, like, say, a week before execution, you're just gonna digest it, right?

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,200
 What I imagine this guy did was he's being led up to the gallows and he's in a sweaty hand.

92
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:17,700
 In the closed fist, he has an acorn. He's holding it and he's hiding it from everyone, and they all know his famous curse,

93
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,700
 that giant tree--again, which is kind of a mild curse.

94
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,200
 "Oh, yes. Place we can put a tire swing."

95
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,700
 "You've--you've ruined the city, Charles! Damn you!"

96
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,200
 He's walking up to the gallows holding an acorn in his hand and they go any last words and he's like, "Hmm."

97
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,700
 And he like raises his hand to his mouth and he goes, "Ugh!"

98
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,700
 Like, fakes a cough and then, "Gulp!" swallows the acorn right there.

99
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,200
 And he's like, "Um...yeah, yeah, the tree thing. I'm just--my last words is I'm gonna say the tree thing again."

100
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
 And everyone's like, "Ah, that's pretty sissy." And then they hang them.

101
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,700
 And then by that time, they would--I don't--does your stomach acid go away when you die?

102
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,700
 Yeah, what happens to your stomach acid when you die? Does it just, like, sit there?

103
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:06,200
 If you dug up--this is getting grim--if you dug up someone who'd been dead for, say, a month

104
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,700
 and took a stomach out, would it be full of stomach acid? Or does it just kind of dissolve away?

105
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,200
 Does it kind of just--like, soda when you pour it and it fizzes?

106
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,200
 I know nothing about human biology or science in general, but here's my--here's my theory.

107
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,200
 Maybe he swallowed it and it didn't fall in his stomach acid. I don't know.

108
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,700
 The point is, is that he swallowed an acorn. This is my theory.

109
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,200
 I have no idea if it's scientifically sound.

110
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,200
 He swallowed an acorn and they put him in the dirt. They put him in a grave.

111
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,700
 And now I'm realizing that the dirt needs to get into the grave.

112
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,700
 Maybe he paid them extra to drill a hole into the--I don't know.

113
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:49,200
 The point is, is that a tree grew out, but I think he swallowed an acorn and then it came out of him.

114
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
 That makes more s--

115
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,700
 [laughs]

116
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,200
 You're like, "No, it doesn't, Jason." That makes less sense than a ghost curse,

117
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 like a paranormal witch magically making a tree appear.

118
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,200
 Your scenario of a man as he's being hung, swallowing an acorn,

119
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,200
 paying a grave digger to dig a hole, like, drill a hole into his wooden casket.

120
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,200
 So sand as they're burying him, sand will fall into his--

121
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,700
 Did he pay someone to come and water him every day, too?

122
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
 I don't know. He did have money.

123
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
 He robbed that dude.

124
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
 Maybe he had grave digger money.

125
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
 Maybe he could afford to pay off a grave digger.

126
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,700
 So that's my theory. I think the guy really existed.

127
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,200
 I think the tree's real.

128
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,700
 The question is, was it a paranormal event or did a man simply,

129
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,700
 through a series of comically bizarre events, manage to swallow an acorn?

130
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,200
 It would have been awfully embarrassing if he goes,

131
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,200
 "A mighty oak will appear from my grave," and then like an elm showed up or a weeping willow.

132
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,200
 People would be like, "Yeah, that's kind of a curse, but he's probably guilty."

133
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
 Everyone just leaves that paranormal tree alone.

134
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

135
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
 Now for our next story, we are headed to the Himalayas.

136
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
 So put your parkas on, get those little snow boots.

137
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,200
 And also I wanted to give a shout out to a listener who actually requested the story, Ennio.

138
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
 Ennio, thank you so much for requesting this story.

139
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,700
 I was actually working on it at the time, but because of his request,

140
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
 I actually moved it up in their production schedule.

141
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,200
 So thank you so much for the story idea as well.

142
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
 So we're headed off to the Himalayas.

143
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 The year is 1957.

144
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
 And we're not taking the carboner copter this time.

145
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 We're going to leave it back in Mobile, Alabama.

146
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
 We're hitching a ride.

147
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,200
 We are hitching a ride with adventurer Tom Slick.

148
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
 Texas man, he's an oil baron.

149
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,700
 He was really good friends with Prescott Bush.

150
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
 That's George Bush's pops.

151
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,700
 George Bush Jr.'s grandpa.

152
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,700
 Really, really influential dude in the Texas scene.

153
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:55,700
 He made tons of money slanging that black oil, that Texas tea, right?

154
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,200
 So here's the interesting thing though.

155
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
 He was this rich dude.

156
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,700
 He had all these powerful connections.

157
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,700
 But his hobby was hunting monsters, which I think is what a lot of us would do.

158
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,700
 If I won the lottery, I would probably just travel America and maybe even the world

159
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,700
 and do this show on the road, doing it at hotel rooms and stuff like that.

160
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,700
 Going to the small towns, going up to Boynton Oak, taking a piss,

161
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
 swallowing an acorn at the scene of the crime.

162
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,700
 And then the next episode, I'm in the hospital and I'm like, hey guys,

163
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
 I'm full of anti-nutrients.

164
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
 That's what he did.

165
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
 And this was in the 1950s here too.

166
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,700
 So he's looking at like the Loch Ness monster.

167
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
 He's chasing down the yeti.

168
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,700
 And I never heard of this before.

169
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,700
 In Northern California, he's after this thing called the Trinity Alps Giant Salamander.

170
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
 I was like, oh, that's cool.

171
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
 What is that?

172
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
 It's just a giant salamander.

173
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,700
 It actually, it's almost like if I found that, I'd be disappointed.

174
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
 You're looking for the Loch Ness.

175
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
 You're looking for a Bigfoot.

176
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
 You can't find those.

177
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
 You find a giant salamander and you're like, yes.

178
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
 Oh wait, no, this kind of sucks.

179
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
 It's just a big old snake.

180
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,700
 Not a snake.

181
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,700
 It's a big old salamander.

182
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
 It doesn't have no magical powers.

183
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,700
 But in 1957, Tom Slick was up in Himalayas looking for the yeti.

184
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
 And he runs into this monk.

185
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,700
 He doesn't like randomly bump into him in the Himalayas.

186
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
 He's like out of monastery.

187
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,700
 The monk's like, hey, so you're looking for monsters.

188
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
 You believe in the yeti, right?

189
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,700
 And Tom's like, I do, sir.

190
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,700
 Do you have any like information on any of this stuff?

191
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,700
 The monastery guy, the monk, is what they're normally referred to.

192
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
 He goes, yes, let's flashback.

193
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:35,700
 Years ago in Pengbochi, Nepal, except the monk knows how to pronounce that correctly,

194
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,700
 there's a Buddhist monastery, right?

195
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,700
 And in this monastery, there are rumors, flashback even farther.

196
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,700
 One day a monk, a young monk was walking through the Himalayas looking for a place to meditate.

197
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,700
 And he sees a cave and he walks into this ice cave.

198
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,700
 [waves]

199
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,700
 Storm, roiling outside the cave.

200
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,700
 The monk walks in and he sees in the cave,

201
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
 like, oh, this is a perfect place to meditate.

202
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
 I'm no longer freezing to death.

203
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,700
 I can finally concentrate on filling my mind with nothingness.

204
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,700
 And then he looks and deep in the cave is a massive yeti sitting in the cave.

205
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,700
 And the monk's like, oh, and he runs out of the cave.

206
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
 He might have walked out calmly.

207
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,700
 He is a monk after all, but he leaves the cave.

208
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,700
 And then years later, he comes back to the cave.

209
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,700
 [waves]

210
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
 Wraves the storm, walks into the cave.

211
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,700
 Yeti is dead.

212
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,700
 And the monk goes, hmm, interesting.

213
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,700
 So he cuts off the yeti's arm and the top of his head.

214
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
 Okay, don't stop me.

215
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
 Let me keep going here.

216
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
 I know you guys already have some questions.

217
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,700
 He cuts off the yeti's arm and the top of his head,

218
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,700
 brings him back and in this monastery in Pang Boach, Nepal,

219
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,700
 you can see the skullcap and the arm of the fabled yeti.

220
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
 Ding-ling!

221
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
 So the flashback ends and Tom Slick's sitting there and he's like,

222
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
 that is fascinating.

223
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
 I have to see this arm.

224
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,700
 And the monk goes, you can see the arm, but can't take it with you.

225
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,700
 That's stealing.

226
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
 It's like, belongs to the monks.

227
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,700
 And Tom Slick's like, yeah, no stealing.

228
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,700
 His eyes shift from side to side.

229
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,700
 Now, let me address this because I have a bad tendency of forgetting stuff as I go forward.

230
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
 Is the story true?

231
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,700
 Let me address this part of it real quick,

232
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
 because I didn't write this down in my notes,

233
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,700
 just as I was thinking of, just as I was telling the story out of this.

234
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,700
 A guy walks into a cave, sees a yeti and leaves,

235
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
 and then comes back a couple years later.

236
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
 Like, what was he doing in the meantime?

237
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
 That's quibbling, though.

238
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
 He's just really good at meditating.

239
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
 One day he's meditating.

240
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
 He's like, oh, I forgot.

241
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
 I ran into him at the cold creature.

242
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
 He goes back a couple years later.

243
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
 He walks into a cave.

244
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
 There is a yeti there.

245
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
 Now, it's dead.

246
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,700
 He can do whatever he wants to the body.

247
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
 What is the one...

248
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,700
 Okay, so you have a dead yeti, right?

249
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
 And you're going to take some body parts from it,

250
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
 because you can't move the whole thing.

251
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
 It's up in the mountains.

252
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
 What are you going to do?

253
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,700
 What's the one thing that yeti is known for?

254
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,700
 In America, is he known as Big Hand?

255
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,700
 Like, why the arm and the skull cap?

256
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,700
 Why not the foot and the head?

257
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
 The whole head, right?

258
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,700
 So that makes it a little suspicious to begin with, right?

259
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
 If you stumbled across the big foot body

260
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,700
 in the middle of the woods, you're like, oh, yes, proof.

261
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
 First off, let me take off one of his eyebrows

262
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
 and two fingers.

263
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,700
 Now, you take his feet, because that's what he's known for.

264
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
 But anyways, that being said,

265
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
 that little bit of information,

266
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,700
 I actually am less skeptical of this story

267
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,700
 than a lot of stuff we've covered,

268
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
 and we'll get into that in a second here.

269
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,700
 So I'm not super like, oh, this story's fake,

270
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,700
 because there is-- Tom Slick was real,

271
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
 this expedition was real, this is all historical.

272
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,700
 The question is, what was in that monastery?

273
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
 So let's go back to the narrative here.

274
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,700
 In 1959, Tom Slick, he sponsors another expedition

275
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,700
 to go to that particular monastery in Ping Bo Chi, Nepal.

276
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
 Now, I don't know if he went with them,

277
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
 or if he just sponsored it, and he might have been busy

278
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,700
 doing making some moves in Texas, selling some oil.

279
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
 He's out at a gas station pumping gas.

280
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
 He actually has a very storied pass.

281
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
 We'll get into that in a second as well.

282
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,700
 But anyways, 1959, he sends some dudes out to that monastery.

283
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
 And there's this guy named Peter Byrne,

284
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
 and they're like, take photos of the hand,

285
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
 and if you can, bring it back.

286
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
 There was a retrieval mission.

287
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
 This was not a tourist expedition.

288
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
 He goes out there, Peter Byrne goes out there,

289
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
 meets the monks, hey, guys, what's up,

290
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
 doing the monk, secret monk handshake.

291
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,700
 They walk in, and there are photographs of this arm

292
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,700
 and this skull cap supposedly belonging to the Yeti.

293
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
 Now, Peter Byrne's taking pictures of it.

294
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
 They got this evidence, and Peter Byrne goes,

295
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,700
 hey, guys, the photos are cool and all,

296
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
 but can we take the hand?

297
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,700
 Monks are like, no.

298
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
 And they're like, no, let me finish.

299
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,700
 We just want to take the hand, and we'll bring it back.

300
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
 No, no, no, no.

301
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
 We can do scientific experiments on it.

302
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
 No, no, no, you're not taking the hand.

303
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
 And then Peter Byrne goes, hey, look, over there.

304
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
 It's eternal bliss and enlightenment.

305
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,700
 All the monks turned around, and he broke a finger off of the hand

306
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
 and then replaced it with a human finger

307
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,700
 and then wrapped it up in like a mummy bandage and left.

308
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,700
 Now, to be fair, that's pretty slimy, steelying, you know, this,

309
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,700
 I wouldn't say it's a holy relic, but it was,

310
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
 it's like breaking into a church and stealing something.

311
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,700
 However, if you can't, there's a couple questions with this one, too.

312
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,700
 One, the hand itself is like this monster's hand,

313
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,700
 and he's replaced a finger bone with a human finger bone, right?

314
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
 And then you'd be like, well, that's suspicious.

315
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,700
 That finger is oddly small, and we've had this thing for years.

316
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,700
 Secondly, he wraps it up, but did he like have to age bandages and stuff like that

317
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
 to get it to look right?

318
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,700
 But thirdly, where did he get the human finger bone from?

319
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,700
 Who lost that bet on the way up to Nepal?

320
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,700
 They're like, hey, by the way, in case we pull this off,

321
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
 we need one of your finger bones.

322
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
 Did he have it with him?

323
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,700
 Was he, I'm assuming he didn't break off like the guy standing next to him.

324
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,700
 As the monks are busy, he turns to his buddy and just goes, hey, look over there.

325
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
 It's an eternal bliss in the line, man.

326
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,700
 The guy's like, what?

327
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
 I'm not even a monk.

328
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
 And he turns to look, chops his finger off.

329
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
 Like he must have had the finger ready to go.

330
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,700
 Anyways, he takes the finger and then to make this whole thing weirder,

331
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,700
 he can't get it out of the country because I think at this point,

332
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,700
 people are like, hey, look at someone's stolen part of this hand.

333
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,700
 He has to give it to the actor Jimmy Stewart.

334
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,700
 The dude from It's a Wonderful Life is in on this as well.

335
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,700
 How this hasn't been made into a movie, I have no idea.

336
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
 It's Tom Hanks.

337
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
 Every character is played by Tom Hanks.

338
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
 Jimmy Stewart takes the finger.

339
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
 This is all real.

340
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
 This is all historical.

341
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,700
 Takes this yeti finger and is able to get it through customs.

342
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,700
 Because who's going to search a celebrity's stuff, right?

343
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,700
 That's why a lot of rappers get wrapped up in drug smuggling.

344
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
 That's what happened to Juice World.

345
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
 There's a movement.

346
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
 I don't know if he was smuggling drugs for someone else or if he was just,

347
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,700
 that was his personal supply, but they usually don't check celebrities.

348
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,700
 So they've recently been cracking down on rappers.

349
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,700
 But a lot of celebrities traffic drugs.

350
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,700
 That's very, very, that's an open secret in Hollywood.

351
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
 Because they don't get stopped at customs.

352
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,700
 So anyways, Jimmy Stewart does get the finger back to the United States.

353
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,700
 Now that story was pretty much unknown until the 1980s.

354
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,700
 Someone was writing a biography on Tom Slick.

355
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,700
 Tom Slick was a very well-known Texas businessman with this bizarre hobby of hunting cryptids.

356
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,700
 Now what happened was the photos get public.

357
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,700
 Not everyone knows this finger's floating around in America,

358
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
 but the photos get published and it becomes a big thing.

359
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,700
 In the 1960s, there is this thing being written called the World Book.

360
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
 And they're putting on this big exhibition for,

361
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,700
 "Hey, we're writing the World Book and we're sending people all over the world

362
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
 to get interesting facts about the world."

363
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,700
 And the Himalayas you have Sir Edmund Hillary, who's the famous mountain climber guy,

364
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
 and Marlon Perkins.

365
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
 I have no idea who that is.

366
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,700
 Anyways, they're in the Himalayas and they're like,

367
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,700
 "Hey, you know, let's stop by and see that monster hand that we've read about on the news."

368
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,700
 And they walk into the monastery and they're looking at the hand

369
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,700
 and nobody knew about the switcheroo.

370
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,700
 The monks, I think, picked up on it because that's why that guy couldn't smuggle it out.

371
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
 But I don't think they were letting people know.

372
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
 And maybe they didn't.

373
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,700
 Maybe Peter Byrne just had a bunch of other priors

374
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
 and maybe nobody knew they were going to go through his luggage.

375
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
 Maybe nobody knew that the finger had been swapped at this time.

376
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,700
 But anyways, when Hillary and Perkins go to the monastery,

377
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
 Hillary laughed at it.

378
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,700
 He goes, "This is obviously a human's arm. This is a total fake.

379
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,700
 Someone's been conned by this. This is completely ridiculous."

380
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,700
 Completely ridiculous. It's a piece of garbage.

381
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
 So that's happened in 1960.

382
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,700
 At the same time, Peter Byrne brings the finger bone.

383
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
 He gets it back from Jimmy Stewart.

384
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,700
 He brings the finger bone to some scientist and says, "Hey guys, check this out."

385
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,700
 And they look at it and they go, "It's not human."

386
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
 And he's like, "Yes, this is so awesome."

387
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,700
 They go, "It's not human. It's humanoid."

388
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
 Whatever this belonged to.

389
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
 Possibly Neanderthal.

390
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,700
 So, not conclusive that it's yeti, but it does place it out.

391
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
 It's not a human bone.

392
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,700
 And people have looked back on this and said that Hillary was declaring this a hoax,

393
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,700
 but he didn't know he was looking at a modified arm.

394
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,700
 He might have just been focused on the pinky and go, "What? That's a human pinky."

395
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,700
 The rest of the hand he didn't really look at.

396
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,700
 But anyways, that's most likely not true.

397
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,700
 He probably looked at the whole thing and goes to the total hoax.

398
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
 They said it's not human.

399
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
 Humanoid Neanderthal, most likely.

400
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,700
 So not necessarily yeti, but still something worth writing home about.

401
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
 Because the story is a guy walks in and...

402
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
 Imagine if it wasn't a yeti, but a guy walks on an ice cave

403
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,700
 and there's a Neanderthal sitting in the cave.

404
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
 Leaves comes back years later.

405
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
 He's that...

406
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
 1962.

407
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
 Here's a detail I left out for dramatic effect.

408
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,700
 And this is going to recolor the whole story I just told you.

409
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
 And this is what you...

410
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,700
 Right now we're just at a Bigfoot story.

411
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,700
 Now things get weird.

412
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
 1962.

413
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
 Tom Slick dies in a plane accident.

414
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
 The plane just dissolves in midair.

415
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
 Just completely falls apart.

416
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
 And I'm like, "Okay, that's tragic.

417
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
 He's an adventurer though.

418
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
 And planes do blow up."

419
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
 They don't always fall apart, but they do have...

420
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
 He worked for the CIA.

421
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
 So did Sir Edmund Hillary.

422
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
 So did Marlon Perkins.

423
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,700
 The 1960 World Book Exhibition.

424
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
 They were there to walk the Himalayas.

425
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,700
 And to spy on China rocket tests.

426
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,700
 They were working under the guise of the World Book Tour.

427
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,700
 These Goodwill ambassadors traveling the world.

428
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
 All over the world.

429
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,700
 Were really gathering information on enemy governments.

430
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
 Things like that.

431
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
 Tom Slick, his entire...

432
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
 And some of you guys probably included in this in the beginning.

433
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,700
 Prescott Bush.

434
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,700
 Very tied into the intelligence organizations.

435
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
 George Bush famously led the CIA.

436
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,700
 Tom Slick worked with the CIA.

437
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,700
 His traveling around the world, hunting monsters,

438
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,700
 was something he loved to do.

439
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,700
 It was also a cover for his intelligence gathering missions.

440
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,700
 So I guess I kind of gave it away in the intro a bit.

441
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
 With the CIA hunting Bigfoot.

442
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,700
 But this whole...

443
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
 All of this stuff.

444
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,700
 All CIA, if not run by CIA operatives.

445
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,700
 Done with the blessing of the CIA.

446
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,700
 And his plane disintegrating in air is suspicious.

447
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
 It does happen.

448
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
 But it's rare.

449
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
 How often do you hear about a car driving on the road

450
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
 and they're like, "Just disintegrated."

451
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
 Like everything fell apart

452
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
 and the guy was eventually just rolling on the ground

453
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
 by himself and another car hit him.

454
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
 Planes do crash and stuff like that.

455
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,700
 But generally there is a reason for it.

456
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,700
 Am I insinuating that somebody took him out for his work as a spook?

457
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
 I am.

458
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,700
 Was it because that he uncovered the Yeti's arm?

459
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,700
 I don't know.

460
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
 Probably not.

461
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
 He probably didn't.

462
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
 He probably wasn't flying back to Washington

463
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
 with photos of Loch Ness Monster

464
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,700
 and they're like, "Take him out."

465
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
 And they blow his plane up.

466
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,700
 But when you're involved with intelligence agencies,

467
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,700
 there is a higher likelihood that your plane is going to disintegrate

468
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
 than if you're just a monster hunter.

469
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,700
 Unless of course like Mothman is chasing you.

470
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,700
 This whole story pretty much just kind of dies down.

471
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
 You had Sir Edmund Hillary goes, "It's fake.

472
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
 This hand's not real."

473
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,700
 You had the whole Jimmy Stewart finger being broken off

474
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
 and all that's not Jimmy Stewart's finger being broken off.

475
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
 He's like, "Ah, it's not a wonderful life.

476
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
 My hand."

477
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,700
 That whole story wasn't uncovered until the 1980s

478
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,700
 when someone was found all these letters detailing it

479
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,700
 when they were working on a biography of Tom Slick.

480
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,700
 The hand was just in this monastery.

481
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,700
 They're like, "No, no, no, it's real."

482
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
 But in the West they're like, "It's a fraud."

483
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,700
 In 1991, Unsolved Mysteries does a segment on this hand.

484
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,700
 It's known as the Peng Bochi Hand.

485
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
 So you have this hand and you have this skull cap.

486
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,700
 And in 1991, Unsolved Mysteries does an episode on it, right?

487
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,700
 And they're able to track down an American anthropologist

488
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,700
 who, his name's George Agogneo,

489
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,700
 and he has the pieces.

490
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
 He has the pieces and he runs a test on them again.

491
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,700
 And on the episode of Unsolved Mysteries,

492
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,700
 he says with more modern technology, it's not human.

493
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
 It's near human, but it's not human.

494
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,700
 So it's the same results 20 years apart, 30 years apart, same results.

495
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,700
 After the Unsolved Mysteries episode airs,

496
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,700
 the arm and the skull cap are stolen from the monastery.

497
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
 They have never been seen again.

498
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,700
 The theory is that they've disappeared into like a private collection.

499
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,700
 But after that episode aired in 1991,

500
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
 someone broken into the monastery, it's gone.

501
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,700
 Nothing's there.

502
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,700
 The last piece of news we have is in 2011,

503
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,700
 someone else has tested the finger bone,

504
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
 and they came to the conclusion it's human.

505
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,700
 Here's this quote, "We've got a very, very strong match

506
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,700
 to a number of existing reference sequences on human DNA databases.

507
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,700
 Human is what we were expecting, and human is what we got."

508
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,700
 I added that last part just for the sake of clarification,

509
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,700
 because I don't want to leave information out that goes against my point.

510
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,700
 I don't think it was a human arm.

511
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
 I don't think it was a human arm for a couple different reasons.

512
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,700
 I think it's possible that what this last lab tested was human,

513
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,700
 that if someone was able to break into a monastery,

514
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,700
 not like they have the best security forces in the world,

515
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
 well, they are all martial artists,

516
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,700
 but if someone goes through the trouble of stealing a hand and a skull cap,

517
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,700
 I think they can replace a bone in a laboratory

518
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,700
 from this George Agonia, go-go-ne- whatever his name is.

519
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,700
 You can break into his house and replace the bone fragment with a human bone.

520
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,700
 Jimmy Stewart's like, "No, not my other finger."

521
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,700
 And then, if they ever tested it later, it would come back as human.

522
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,700
 But the hand gets stolen, it disappears.

523
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:48,700
 If it-- this is my biggest thing about why I think this story is true.

524
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
 Why I think the story is true.

525
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,700
 It getting stolen after the Unsolved Mysteries thing is a pretty bizarre indicator

526
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,700
 that somebody with access to, you know, like being able to go to Nepal

527
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,700
 and break into monasteries wanted this hand and this skull cap.

528
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,700
 Whenever we look at stories when I'm debunking stuff,

529
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,700
 the question always is, what is in it for the people perpetrating the story?

530
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,700
 A lot of times, ghost stories are about attention or something.

531
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,700
 You know, you-- infield haunting or amityville,

532
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,700
 all these things we can find financial or psychological reasons

533
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,700
 for faking these things, i.e. fame or amityville.

534
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,700
 They wanted to sell-- they wanted to get out of their lease or whatever it was.

535
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,700
 So a lot of times we can find reasons why people would like--

536
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:40,700
 Why would a group of monks in the middle of nowhere set up an arm and a skull cap?

537
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,700
 Again, if they were going to fake it, why not take the foot and the head?

538
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
 Because you're just faking the whole thing anyways.

539
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
 You-- maybe it's easier to fake a hand, I don't know.

540
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,700
 But anyways, you have the arm and the skull cap in a monastery.

541
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,700
 Tom Slick found out about this monastery randomly.

542
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
 It wasn't like they were putting out flyers downtown.

543
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
 Come see the Yeti arm, come on, check it out.

544
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,700
 Texas billionaires get half off ticket price.

545
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,700
 It was a random thing that he showed up to, and they weren't charging money for it.

546
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,700
 It was just something that like, yeah, this monk, Joe, he found it one day.

547
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,700
 Isn't that weird looking here? Look at all of our other stuff.

548
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,700
 And then, you know, I don't know, try being a Buddhist, try enlightening yourself.

549
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,700
 And I'm just going to stay here and stare at this arm.

550
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,700
 What was the-- if it was a fraud, if this arm was in downtown Mobile, Alabama,

551
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,700
 this whole story took place in a very accessible spot, I'd be like, yeah, it's probably a fraud.

552
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
 This guy was selling tickets.

553
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,700
 But the fact that it's a monastery in Nepal, and they're like, no, we're not--

554
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,700
 you can take a picture of it, we're not letting you take it with you, we're keeping it here,

555
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,700
 makes me think that whatever he-- this is the most likely scenario of events.

556
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:57,700
 A guy walks into a cave, sees a frozen Neanderthal, and thinks it's alive, leaves,

557
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,700
 come back years later, the ice is thawed, the body is now laying down.

558
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,700
 Again, not a big scientist, he would rot, but my point is, is that--

559
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,700
 that to me, that it's probably a Neanderthal arm, at the very least.

560
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
 I don't think it's human. I don't think it's human.

561
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,700
 I think that would make more sense, that when he walked in, you see a guy frozen, standing up,

562
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,700
 "Oh, leave, come back later, it's all melted, he's laying on the ground, he's rotted away."

563
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,700
 See a bit of a skeleton chop off his hand and his head.

564
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,700
 That makes more sense to me, but whatever the case is, these people in the story,

565
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,700
 they're historically true, the hand, whether or not it's real, it did exist,

566
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,700
 and now someone has it in their private collection.

567
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:47,700
 An arm from a long, dead species, or subspecies of human, possibly.

568
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:55,700
 The arm of a mythological creature, proof, finally, that the yeti exists.

569
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
 Maybe.

570
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:04,700
 But whatever the case, it's now in the hands of a private collector, or most likely, the government.

571
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,700
 It's possible that the government of Nepal took it for safekeeping,

572
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
 but are they really watching Unsolved Mysteries?

573
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:20,700
 It's more likely that at CIA headquarters, some guy is watching Unsolved Mysteries,

574
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,700
 he's supposed to be watching security cameras, storm shadows sneaking into the facility,

575
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,700
 killing people, he's like, "Eh, I don't have any attention to that."

576
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,700
 He instead is watching Unsolved Mysteries, and he's watching this whole story, and he's like,

577
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,700
 "Oh dude, we totally forgot about that arm out of all those millions of dollars we put into researching that.

578
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
 We totally forgot about that."

579
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,700
 So, you make a couple phone calls, you have some CIA agents, you bring Jimmy Stewart out of retirement,

580
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,700
 or back from the grave, he might have been dead in 1991,

581
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,700
 you send them into Nepal, you retrieve this relic,

582
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:58,700
 and somewhere in an undisclosed location, there is a warehouse.

583
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,700
 It looks abandoned, maybe a little creepy, but it's just out there in the middle of Kansas.

584
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,700
 And if you walk into the warehouse, there's nothing there, looks like an empty lot.

585
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:18,700
 But if you know the combination, if you know the right set of girders to walk by before you hang left,

586
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:25,700
 and then look slightly 90 degrees up at the security camera, barely visible,

587
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:33,700
 you will get buzzed in to a facility full of relics, of items,

588
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:39,700
 of things that, while not important to national security,

589
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,700
 you don't want anyone else to have.

590
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:52,700
 A museum of the bizarre, of the weird, of the dangerous.

591
00:32:52,700 --> 00:33:02,700
 Because as technology advances, if you have a bone of a yeti,

592
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:11,700
 imagine an army infused with the DNA of a creature that time forgot.

593
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:18,700
 Is that bizarre to think that you could have a cloned army of yetis? Absolutely.

594
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:26,700
 But part of working for the Central Intelligence Agency is thinking 50 years ahead.

595
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:36,700
 You have to plan for the bizarre to maintain a normal American life.

596
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,700
