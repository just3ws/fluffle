1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
 A horrific series of crimes grips Fort Wayne, Indiana, but when state-of-the-art technology

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,080
 joins the hunt, there's no escape for this predator.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,320
 And they would travel to Colorado to meet a young mother and her two children who are

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,960
 staying in a hotel.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,320
 As the mother readies herself for bed and the children are playing a board game, everything

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,400
 seems completely normal.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 Until the darkness swallowed them all, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:40,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,360
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,600
 Hope you guys are having lots of fun.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
 Hope you guys have some cool Halloween plans.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
 I'm going to the Halloween party here in town and that'll be fun.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
 Right?

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,640
 I hope I paid 20 bucks a ticket for it.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,760
 But someone who's always fun is our newest Patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
 right now.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,760
 Give it up for Young Hemlock.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,600
 Everyone give her a round of applause for Young Hemlock.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,560
 See if I can borrow 20 dollars from him.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,000
 Those tickets are expensive.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,320
 Young Hemlock, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,400
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,800
 Just help spread the word about the show really.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,480
 Young Hemlock, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys for the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,320
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:31,000
 We are headed all the way out to Fort Wayne, Indiana.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,360
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is taking us on a nice floaty journey out there.

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,200
 It's April 1st, 1988.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,680
 We're in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,160
 So like people are like flying kites and laughing at all the pranks they're pulling.

33
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
 Haha, that's so funny.

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
 As this guy's like smoldering.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
 Oh, you fell for the whole fork in the socket prank.

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
 It's April Fools.

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,760
 She loves pulling April Fools pranks.

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,640
 It's 3pm and you got a bunch of little kids playing out in the yard.

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,840
 They're just like, I don't know, throwing mud at each other and doing what kids do.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,800
 That's the only thing I know.

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,080
 Skip rope, marbles, throwing mud.

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,440
 And one of these is a young girl named April Marie Tinsley.

43
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,920
 She's eight years old and she's out playing with her friends and she goes, "Hey guys,

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,600
 I have to run and go get my umbrella.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,920
 So I'll see you guys in a second."

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,400
 She leaves her group of friends to go back home to get her umbrella.

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:30,800
 By the time that dinner rolls around, the family realizes that April is missing.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,720
 So they contact the police and the police begin investigating this.

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,640
 And you know, in the beginning, you think it's just an April Fools joke, right?

50
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,340
 Your kid, she's goofing off, she's hiding somewhere.

51
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,080
 You know there had to have been that, the panic setting in, but the hope.

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
 It's all just a prank.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,120
 It's not funny, April.

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,360
 It's not funny to play this joke.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,400
 Come out.

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,040
 Where are you?

57
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,960
 Come out.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,600
 The police have this massive search.

59
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,840
 They're looking for this eight-year-old girl.

60
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,080
 And during the search, they talk to someone and they say, "I saw a white man in his 30s

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,860
 putting April into his pickup truck."

62
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,860
 So at this point, they absolutely know she's been abducted.

63
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,940
 They don't think that she's just hiding on April Fools Day because she thought it'd be

64
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
 funny.

65
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,260
 They're now looking for a kidnapping.

66
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:36,220
 Three days later, in Spencerville, Indiana, April's body is found.

67
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,840
 After her body, they find one of her shoes and they find a shopping bag that had a sex

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,880
 toy in it.

69
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:56,680
 Two years pass and the police are no closer to finding out who killed April Tinsley.

70
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:06,200
 In St. Joseph Township, Indiana, on May 21, 1990, people wake up to see a strange inscription

71
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,060
 on the side of a barn written with a crayon.

72
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,340
 You know what I mean?

73
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,820
 I can't even pronounce the word right.

74
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,180
 You know the crayons like Crayola?

75
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:29,180
 Written on the side of a barn with a Crayola writing device, it said, "I kill April M. Tinsley."

76
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,340
 Did you find the other shoe?

77
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,820
 Ha, ha.

78
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,760
 I will kill again.

79
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:45,440
 Fourteen years later, Memorial Day weekend, 2004, and the city where it all started, Fort

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,760
 Wayne, Indiana, four notes are found scattered around town.

81
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,240
 One in a mailbox.

82
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,320
 The other three letters were left on the bicycles of little girls.

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,140
 When you open this letter, you found the Polaroid of a man's lower body.

84
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,060
 It doesn't specifically say he's naked, but I'm assuming that.

85
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,580
 I don't think he was wearing a tracksuit or something like that.

86
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,780
 It's a man's pictures of his calves.

87
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,580
 I'm assuming it was of his naked generals.

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,060
 But anyways, the news report said it was a picture of a man's lower body and a note.

89
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,020
 That's creepy already, right?

90
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
 That's disturbing.

91
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,780
 Nobody wants to see that.

92
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,880
 But then it comes with this note.

93
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
 "Hi, honey."

94
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
 He's a grammar's really bad.

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,680
 Do I want to say that?

96
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,920
 His grammar's really bad.

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
 That's not me.

98
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,560
 I didn't suddenly become a caveman while I'm reading this.

99
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,880
 "Hi, honey.

100
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,600
 I've been watching you.

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,520
 I am the same person that rape and kill April Tinsley.

102
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,120
 You are my next victim."

103
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,300
 If you don't report this to police, and if I don't see this in the paper tomorrow or

104
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:09,220
 on the local news, I will blow up your house.

105
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,300
 Each of these envelopes contained the photograph of a man's lower body, the letter, and a used

106
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,700
 condom.

107
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:25,580
 July 15th, 2018.

108
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:32,480
 This saga spanned around 30 years.

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,040
 2018, on July 15th, 2018, a man is arrested.

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,000
 A 59-year-old man is arrested.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,480
 His name, John Miller.

112
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,640
 He was 29 when he was doing this stuff.

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,960
 And for 30 years, he was uncaught.

114
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,200
 For 30 years, he was able to--.

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,060
 And there's a lot of ways you can break this down.

116
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,020
 And you have to think, were these the ones that they were able to connect to him?

117
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
 Were these the notable ones?

118
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,300
 How did he go so long?

119
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,180
 And you figure a pervert is a pervert for life.

120
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,260
 So maybe they'll connect him to other sex crimes.

121
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,860
 But he's arrested now.

122
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,860
 He's been convicted.

123
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,740
 He's really only been hit with the April Tinsley rape and murder of April Tinsley.

124
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,400
 So his sentence was an 80-year prison sentence.

125
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,440
 But I don't think this would have been the only stuff he did.

126
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
 Does that make sense?

127
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
 But then again, one of the--.

128
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,000
 You know, I read true crime stuff all the time.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,360
 And you know, like the young girl in Japan who was tortured for like 10 days.

130
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
 Her name escapes me right now.

131
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,200
 I think it's called the Hello Kitty murder.

132
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,040
 And they had something similar in the United States.

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
 These stuff that--.

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,560
 These like torture porn, true crimes, all this stuff.

135
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 I don't--.

136
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,300
 And unfortunately, I don't even remember the young women's names.

137
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,060
 It's weird what sticks with you when you read a bunch of true crime.

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,460
 One of the creepiest true crime stories I've read in a long time, just happened a couple

139
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,180
 years ago, or just came to light a couple years ago, in Oregon, the police were investigating

140
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,460
 two separate murders of two 12-year-old girls.

141
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,740
 It was two 12-year-old girls that may be about a year apart, or like just maybe eight months

142
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,560
 apart in the same general region, where kidnapped, raped, and murdered.

143
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,280
 And the police were investigating this.

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,920
 And then finally, after--.

145
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
 That happened like back in the '80s.

146
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,200
 And the same thing like this.

147
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 Finally after 20, 30 years, they finally are able to identify the suspect.

148
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,080
 It was two totally different guys, totally unrelated.

149
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,440
 It was two random dudes who just in the same year decided to kidnap, rape, and murder a

150
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
 12-year-old girl.

151
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,780
 I mean, it looked like they thought it was like a serial killer.

152
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,380
 It was two totally--.

153
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,260
 I don't want to say normal, because they're not, but they went on to have families of

154
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,260
 their own.

155
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,180
 They lived the next 30 years with normal jobs and families of their own and children.

156
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,300
 Both of them, just a couple months apart, never knew each other.

157
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,420
 Both of them decided to go rape and murder a 12-year-old girl.

158
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,760
 That creeps me out more than the Hello Kitty murder.

159
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,120
 Just something about it really, really terrifies me.

160
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,800
 That just randomly, two people in the same geographical region could do that.

161
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,680
 It seems so alien, right?

162
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,280
 Like I can understand rival gang member blowing his brains out.

163
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,400
 I can understand--.

164
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,640
 I can understand like a mafioso saying, "Hey, you need to go kill this guy and you're like

165
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
 a hitman."

166
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,360
 I can understand stuff like that.

167
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
 I can even understand.

168
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,720
 This would not give me any trouble with the jury someday, but I can understand somebody

169
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,900
 coming home and finding their significant other in bed with someone else and they lose

170
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,540
 it and they chop them up with an axe.

171
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,380
 I can understand all that type of stuff.

172
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,620
 I don't understand two random dudes in Oregon both deciding to rape and kill a 12-year-old

173
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,420
 girl and what caused that in the first place?

174
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,300
 I already have a hard time wrapping my head around.

175
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,980
 And then to just go on and live a normal life and go, "Well, it got that out of my system.

176
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,660
 It wasn't as cool as I thought it was going to be.

177
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,180
 I'm not going to do that anymore."

178
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:16,080
 But to get away with it for 30 years, that's terrifying to me and that's what this guy did.

179
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:24,160
 On Wikipedia, Occupation former Walmart employee, which Walmart may just love that free press,

180
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,160
 former Walmart employee, if you went to Walmart in Fort Wayne, Indiana, over the past 30 years,

181
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,240
 you probably met this guy.

182
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,480
 He might have helped you pick out a movie.

183
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,160
 It's just that's so creepy to me, the normality of it, where you do it and then you just

184
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,220
 go back into society.

185
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,340
 So maybe this was the only...

186
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,180
 Hopefully, right?

187
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,660
 I'm not hoping that he did more, but you would think they would because isn't that what killers

188
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,460
 do?

189
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,540
 He kept trying, like he kept drawing attention to it and he got a thrill.

190
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,140
 But anyway, so I mean we have that psychological component and will they find him connected

191
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
 to others?

192
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,220
 So this story is still really coming out now.

193
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,660
 But the other reason I wanted to profile this is one of the ways they caught him.

194
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
 I didn't even know this was real.

195
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,840
 This sounds like something from Star Trek.

196
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:18,320
 One of the ways that they caught him was they have this new thing called Snapshot and they

197
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,600
 take your DNA and it can draw a picture of you.

198
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,480
 They take your DNA and it can give...

199
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,520
 They go, based on this DNA, he's going to have this kind of nose and this kind of eyes

200
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,440
 and this kind of mouth.

201
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,040
 And that was one of the ways they caught him.

202
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,740
 Now I don't think it was the only way.

203
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,020
 I'm sure the judge would be like, "That's really cool technology."

204
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,100
 And hopefully we have to test that out.

205
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,460
 It just can't spit out pictures of random people.

206
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
 But yeah, that is one of the ways that he caught him.

207
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,100
 This new technology that they're using to catch people.

208
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,940
 And that's what I don't understand.

209
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,340
 If you killed someone in the 80s, you're thinking, "I didn't leave any hair behind.

210
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,340
 I had gloves."

211
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,860
 So you weren't even thinking about hair in 1988.

212
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,740
 You'd be like, "I wore gloves.

213
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,440
 So I didn't leave any fingerprints.

214
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,320
 Sherlock Holmes will never catch me."

215
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,480
 And then anything you left on that crime scene can put you away for life.

216
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
 Which is good.

217
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,520
 I'm not complaining about that.

218
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,800
 But you wouldn't have thought of that.

219
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,720
 We did that story a long time ago about that guy who robbed a bank and he had really bad

220
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
 dandruff.

221
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
 And he threw a scheme.

222
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
 This is a real story.

223
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,800
 This is not a fever dream of mine.

224
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,480
 I'll put the episode on the show.

225
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,800
 He took off his scheme asking, he goes, "Aha!

226
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,580
 The perfect robbery or burglary or whatever it was."

227
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,980
 And he takes the ski mask off and throws it in the trash.

228
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,140
 And the police find that it's full of dandruff.

229
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,340
 And they go, "We can't...

230
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
 We don't have the...

231
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,380
 Technology is not here today, ladies and gentlemen.

232
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,220
 But someday we'll be able to test the DNA of dandruff."

233
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,900
 And they did like decades later and they arrested him.

234
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,700
 So very, very interesting story.

235
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,660
 Technology, DNA, and just...

236
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,580
 So you have that and then you just have the raw creepiness of it.

237
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,120
 For 30 years this guy walked around the community.

238
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
 You probably...

239
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,000
 If you lived in Fort Wayne, Indiana and you shopped in the Walmart there, you probably

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,400
 met him.

241
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
 Super gross.

242
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,040
 It's just another reason never to move to Fort Wayne, Indiana.

243
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,280
 Young Hemlock, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbenter Coptor.

244
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,600
 We are leaving behind Fort Wayne, Indiana.

245
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,840
 We are headed all the way out to Colorado.

246
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,160
 We don't have a specific location of this hotel we're gonna head to.

247
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,660
 The author who sent this story into Phantoms and Monsters, which is a really good website

248
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,380
 that collects first person encounters.

249
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,180
 We've covered them a lot on this show.

250
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,660
 They didn't want to give out the actual location of this place.

251
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,340
 But they actually gave us enough hints that you might be able to find that if you're local,

252
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,460
 maybe I'm in a pretty big general area.

253
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:59,140
 In the Rocky Mountains in West Central Colorado, overlooking the Colorado River and the Colorado

254
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,880
 and Amtrak railway station, there's a hotel.

255
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,800
 Well, it's had a long history.

256
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,800
 In 1879, it was a whorehouse.

257
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,480
 So that's a good way to start off your hotel.

258
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,320
 And then it became a speakeasy.

259
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,640
 And then later on it became low income housing.

260
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,120
 And after that, a hotel.

261
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,040
 And in the year 1983, a mother and her two sons are gonna spend a couple nights at this

262
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,740
 hotel.

263
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,380
 The mother had recently left the children's father.

264
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:42,780
 And she was gonna make it on her own in a new city, a new start, raising her boys.

265
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,620
 But since she's making this big move, she doesn't have an apartment yet.

266
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,780
 So they say, let's stay in this hotel.

267
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,580
 It's like $30 a night.

268
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,740
 Really cheap.

269
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,820
 Even back then that was pretty good prices.

270
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,940
 And she has these two sons.

271
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,620
 We'll call them Sam.

272
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,840
 He's the youngest one.

273
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,000
 He's six.

274
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,180
 And then you have Charlie, who's eight years old.

275
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,960
 This is their first night in the hotel.

276
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:14,000
 And Sam says, when he got out of the car, he sensed a darkness in the room.

277
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,200
 He said when we got out of the car, it was already night.

278
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,320
 So the hotel already looked a little ominous.

279
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,720
 My mom opens the hotel room door and I go to step inside.

280
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,780
 It feels oppressive.

281
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,060
 It's giving off this really weird energy.

282
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,020
 And I didn't want to go in the room.

283
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,580
 And my mom and my older brother, they laugh at me, right?

284
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
 I should be over this.

285
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
 I'm six years old.

286
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,300
 I'm scared of the boogeyman.

287
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,580
 Come in the room, Sam.

288
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,780
 My mother implores.

289
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:52,460
 Ah, you know, of course, it's just my imagination, right?

290
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,560
 Later that night, mom is getting ready for bed.

291
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
 She's standing in the bathroom.

292
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,880
 And from where Charlie and Sam are sitting, they're currently unpacking a board game to

293
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,280
 play.

294
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,640
 They can see into the bathroom.

295
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,360
 With the bathroom door open, they can see their mom and they can actually see her reflection

296
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,160
 in the mirror.

297
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,920
 And Sam's looking over there and he hears his mom washing her hands, getting ready to

298
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,560
 wash her face.

299
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,180
 And the room is...

300
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,180
 dim.

301
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,100
 There's only one lamp on in the entire hotel room.

302
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,500
 Even the bathroom light is off.

303
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,300
 They can still see their mother in the bathroom.

304
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,820
 There's enough light from the lamp to illuminate certain corners of the room, but not enough

305
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,660
 light to feel safe in.

306
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,440
 And as they're unloading this board game, all of a sudden Sam hears his brother say,

307
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
 "Stop.

308
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
 Listen."

309
00:16:51,440 --> 00:17:02,040
 And Sam stops unloading the pieces and the room falls quiet, except for a low growl.

310
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,440
 Sam and Charlie's eyes are drawn towards the bathroom.

311
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:14,780
 And they can see their mother is still washing her face in the barely lit bathroom.

312
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,580
 But she is now violently splashing water into her face.

313
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:25,500
 The faucet's running full blast and she's just splashing water in her face over and

314
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:32,820
 over and over again and the water is splashing against her skin and flying off in all directions.

315
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:39,380
 Only she swings her head up and stares straight into the mirror.

316
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,760
 Her children are watching this in the reflection.

317
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:53,880
 They see her eyes go wide as a huge grin covers her face.

318
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,400
 Then she starts laughing.

319
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,900
 The mother is staring into the mirror and watching her kids over her shoulder.

320
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,620
 They feel her gaze on them.

321
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:15,000
 She's staring at them using the mirror.

322
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,380
 She's still laughing harder and harder.

323
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,820
 Her eyes locked on them.

324
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,820
 And then the laughter becomes a growl.

325
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:33,320
 And then the laughter starts to morph back into a growl.

326
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,040
 The mother turns to face her children.

327
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,540
 And that's when Sam realizes his mother is gone.

328
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,960
 Not mentally gone, not she's lost it.

329
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,560
 His mother has vanished.

330
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:08,240
 Stepping out of the darkness of the bathroom is a nine foot tall naked reptilian man.

331
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,620
 Stares at the children growling.

332
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,820
 It's described and I know this is a plot twist.

333
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,060
 I know you guys probably didn't expect that.

334
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,040
 But that is what they saw was this naked reptilian man.

335
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,040
 That by any definition sounds like any of the alien reptiles we've covered on the show

336
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,540
 or just in lore.

337
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,720
 As you guys have been researching on your own, a reptilian, they tend to be very tall, very

338
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
 muscular.

339
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
 And that's what they see.

340
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,480
 They see naked, scaly green skin, bright orange yellow eyes staring at them.

341
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,300
 Red lips, sharp teeth, and black talons.

342
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,580
 He said specifically, he goes they weren't nails, they were thick.

343
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,060
 They were talons.

344
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:08,060
 An interesting detail he's added to this though that I have not seen in all my years of reptilian

345
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
 research.

346
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,940
 At least that I can recall.

347
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,360
 This reptilian had long black curly hair.

348
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:26,040
 So I cannot recall a time that we've come across a reptilian with a full head of hair.

349
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,880
 But long black curly hair.

350
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,080
 And this reptilian is stepping out of the darkness of the bathroom.

351
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,880
 Begins walking towards them.

352
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,320
 And it's talking to them.

353
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,060
 Some said it's in between a series of grunts and growls.

354
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,980
 They could make out what this reptilian was saying.

355
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,060
 I'm so hungry.

356
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:03,140
 And you both look very, very tasty.

357
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,900
 It's walking towards them.

358
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
 Razor sharp teeth.

359
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,740
 Black talons reaching out.

360
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:18,240
 And these kids begin screaming at the top of their lungs.

361
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,160
 Everything else was kind of this frozen moment.

362
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,360
 Watching their mother splash the water in her face.

363
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
 Watching her turn around.

364
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,280
 Even watching this reptilian appear in front of them.

365
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
 You're in shock.

366
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,640
 But as it's beginning to walk towards you.

367
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,120
 Talking about how much it just wants to devour you.

368
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,560
 These two boys begin screaming at the top of their lungs.

369
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,500
 And the creature is getting closer and closer to them.

370
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,300
 And it's talking about how much it just wants to take a bite.

371
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:55,900
 Just one bite to start with.

372
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,740
 Just a nibble.

373
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,400
 Suddenly just the loudest pounding on the front door.

374
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,380
 Someone is banging on the door as loud as they can.

375
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,200
 And they're saying is everyone okay in there?

376
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
 What's going on?

377
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
 Is everyone okay?

378
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,320
 Because all they hear is two boys screaming bloody murder.

379
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
 They're bloody murder.

380
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,440
 The murder that's about to happen.

381
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,280
 And Sam says we hear the banging on the door being my brother.

382
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,920
 And we turn and we hear someone on the other side of the door saying do you need any help?

383
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
 And instinctively.

384
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,360
 I mean we realize now we've turned our view away from this threat.

385
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,940
 This person is knocking on the door.

386
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,860
 This is a nine foot reptilian wanting to eat us.

387
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:52,340
 He goes we turned back and there stood our mother in a daze.

388
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,640
 She just kinda seemed to wobble there for a second.

389
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:03,860
 She looked around the room like she had no idea what had just happened.

390
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:13,920
 And she fell to her knees and grabbed her children and held them tight.

391
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,040
 Are you okay?

392
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,000
 Are you okay?

393
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,640
 She says.

394
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,480
 And Sam and Charlie are still trying to process this.

395
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:33,520
 Like they just saw their mom become this creature that 30 seconds ago they thought would only

396
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,740
 exist in a sci-fi or horror movie.

397
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,540
 They saw it in their room.

398
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,380
 It was there.

399
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,540
 And he's panicked about this.

400
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:49,580
 Little Sam is panicked about this but his mother is now holding him saying I promise

401
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,780
 I'll never do that again.

402
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,780
 I promise.

403
00:23:52,780 --> 00:24:00,100
 And Sam thinks about that for a second and he goes wait.

404
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,580
 So is this real?

405
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,280
 Like she didn't deny it.

406
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,720
 She didn't say that it was a trick of the light like when I think there's a monster

407
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 under my bed.

408
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,660
 She says she'll never do it again.

409
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
 What?

410
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:19,360
 And as he's trying to really wrap his head around this thing she kinda nuzzles him.

411
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,560
 She puts her face against his neck.

412
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,720
 And he gets this guttural feeling.

413
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,200
 He hears in his work and he gets this guttural feeling.

414
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,160
 He thinks she's still a monster.

415
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,040
 She looks human but she's still a monster.

416
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,160
 He's thinking that.

417
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:50,020
 As he's thinking that he hears his mother start to growl.

418
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,300
 Her face pressed up against his neck.

419
00:24:53,300 --> 00:25:00,560
 Like a loving mother would but this still isn't her.

420
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:14,240
 Sam begins to panic and his mom laughs and says promise last time.

421
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,240
 Eventually the mom gets up from hugging him and goes to the door and says oh sorry there

422
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,800
 was a rat in the room and my boys don't like rats.

423
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:25,780
 That's what all the screaming was.

424
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,340
 The next morning they left the hotel room.

425
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:35,340
 They had planned on staying there a couple days but nobody felt safe there.

426
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,380
 And for years Sam and Charlie remembered this event.

427
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,820
 They talk about it with each other.

428
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,740
 Now it's interesting that this story was just a six year old seeing this with their parent.

429
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:53,000
 But I've covered it.

430
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,040
 The fact that we have the two brothers who over time can share the story and sure that

431
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,200
 may lead to details becoming more sensationalized because people are misremembering it and

432
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,840
 they're spreading their misremembering.

433
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,320
 But you have the two boys.

434
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,400
 It's really hard to do a trick of the light when you have two different people sitting

435
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,840
 at two different angles.

436
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,740
 So that was one reason why I wanted to talk about this story.

437
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,340
 It might be true.

438
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,340
 But let's go ahead and continue.

439
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,340
 He continues to talk to his brother about it for years.

440
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,260
 It was a normal course of conversation.

441
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,260
 Hey what did you do today?

442
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,260
 I had a lot of fun.

443
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
 What about you?

444
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
 I stayed at home.

445
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
 Mom turned into a reptilian.

446
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,180
 I don't know how common it was but he goes for years we would talk about this and also

447
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,780
 for years we would ask mom about it.

448
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,900
 We'd say mom remember when we were in that hotel and that creepy thing happened and she

449
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,800
 would always say "I don't want to talk about it.

450
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,840
 I want to talk about it."

451
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,200
 And he still thought it was weird that she never denied it.

452
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,960
 Even that first night when she goes "I promise I'll never do that again.

453
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,320
 I promise."

454
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,160
 She didn't say "I don't know what you guys are screaming about.

455
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,520
 Like I just walked out of the bathroom."

456
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,680
 She sensed something had happened.

457
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,080
 Even she knew something had happened and she goes "I promise that'll never happen again."

458
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:15,020
 And that always kind of bugged Sam because it didn't mean that she had control over it.

459
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,500
 Like what exactly happened?

460
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,620
 And he goes for years I tried getting more information from her and nothing would happen.

461
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:30,220
 He goes and then really two different things have added another wrinkle to the story.

462
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,420
 One he goes "My older brother has completely forgotten about the story."

463
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,400
 He goes "We talked about it for years after the fact we both were there.

464
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,880
 We talked about it years after the fact."

465
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,240
 He goes and then at one point I brought it up and my brother had no idea what I was talking

466
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
 about.

467
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,440
 Zero.

468
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,720
 He goes for almost 25 years because this gentleman is 43 now for almost 25 years.

469
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,560
 I don't know how often he brought this up there like waiting for a movie to start.

470
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,560
 They have the theater and he's like "Hey yeah yeah can I borrow some popcorn?"

471
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,280
 "Hey mom turn into reptile."

472
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,020
 The older brother did not remember the story.

473
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,740
 He goes "Now a days my brother is starting to remember it."

474
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,700
 That's such a weird detail.

475
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,780
 But he also finally got a confession out of his mother.

476
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,700
 Years later when Sam is around 17 years old he finally is able to get the story out of

477
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,900
 his mom of what happened.

478
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,420
 And she said "I don't know.

479
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:33,600
 I remember being in the bathroom and then I was in the dark.

480
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:42,280
 I was in a place of utter blackness but I could sense you in the distance.

481
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:51,040
 I could sense my children somewhere in the void and I was walking towards you to protect

482
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
 you.

483
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:59,040
 I couldn't find you and I knew I needed to get to you.

484
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:07,240
 Something else was in my body and I was gone."

485
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,040
 And then the next thing I know I was standing over you too and you were sobbing.

486
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,560
 She then ends the story by saying "But I never did it again.

487
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,960
 Did I?"

488
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:29,560
 Then she questions exactly how much control she has over her body, over her fate.

489
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:36,400
 This creature possessed her and tried to eat her children.

490
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
 She doesn't know.

491
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,120
 This is the thing about possession right?

492
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,360
 You have such little control over your life.

493
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
 She doesn't even know if it happened again.

494
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,600
 She has to ask "I didn't do that again did I?"

495
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,160
 Did the creature ever leave her?

496
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,760
 Is it still in her now?

497
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,360
 Was she possessed or was she always some sort of reptilian shapeshifter?

498
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,640
 The story is so bizarre because you think it's a standard haunting.

499
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:11,040
 And then a creature that is most typically seen in the sci-fi community of paranormal

500
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:21,360
 UFOs, aliens, world conquering, species of outsiders popping up in a cheap hotel.

501
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
 I love this story.

502
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,560
 It's a great Halloween story for us for the kids who went through this.

503
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,920
 It's absolutely terrifying.

504
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,640
 But imagine that horror in that hotel room.

505
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,720
 And then even imagine after that like how would you have a relationship with your mom

506
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,680
 if you thought at any point she could turn into a nine foot tall lizard man.

507
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,040
 And she wanted to eat them.

508
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,800
 And then she continued to play the game.

509
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,000
 Afterwards, I'm just kidding.

510
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,120
 Horrifying story.

511
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:00,440
 A woman shapeshifting into a nine foot tall reptilian creature.

512
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,320
 You'd have to wonder every moment after that.

513
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:14,200
 If your mom ever truly came back, or the person who lived in your house and took care of you,

514
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:23,600
 fed you, and raised you, wasn't some sort of monster.

515
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,400
 And you would just be thinking, why is this person making me peanut butter and jelly sandwiches?

516
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,120
 It's not my real mom.

517
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,920
 It's this thing.

518
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,800
 Why would you ever get over that?

519
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,640
 I think I would spend the rest of my childhood, I think I would spend the rest of my adulthood,

520
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,280
 constantly wondering if my mom was really my mom, if my mom ever came out of that darkness.

521
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,000
 And still wandering that void looking for her children.

522
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,480
 And this woman standing in front of me is just an imposter.

523
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,800
 And then you would wonder what the end goal was.

524
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,440
 Why is this reptilian taking the form of my mom?

525
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,080
 These type of thoughts could drive you crazy, honestly.

526
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,800
 And if you said them out loud, they may lock you up.

527
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,240
 If you thought your real mom disappeared in a hotel and this was some sort of reptilian

528
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,160
 shapeshifter.

529
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,920
 So over time, you start to tell yourself, ah this is my real mom.

530
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,240
 It was just a one off event.

531
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,320
 But in fact, your mom is still lost.

532
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,000
 Wanting to hold you.

533
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,680
 Wanting to hug you and kiss you and say you're safe.

534
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,440
 But she can't.

535
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:59,800
 Her soul is locked behind the psychic walls of a reptilian mind prison.

536
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,200
 The mother you love is not the mother you have.

537
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:33,640
 The mother you have may be a monster simply wearing her skin.

538
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,360
 Dead Rapper Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy true crime podcast.

539
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,760
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

540
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

541
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
 Have a great one guys.
