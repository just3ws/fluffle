1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
 When a young couple gets a job working at the local YWCA, they have no idea they're

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,260
 about to work there.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,760
 Forever.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,680
 And then we've all heard stories about the Men in Black, these mysterious government

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,080
 goons who show up to interrogate anyone who reports a UFO sighting.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,760
 Well, today we hear the story of a man who took on one of these MIB agents in hand to

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,320
 hand combat.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,320
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:43,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
 I'm your host Jason Carver and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
 I hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,080
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,440
 First off, let's bring in our newest Patreon supporter walking into Dead Rabbit Command

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,640
 Flex and his muscles.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,440
 This is a muscle bound episode guys.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,600
 Give it up for Jeremiah "Sign" Graham.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,280
 Make sure you're flexing while you're clapping.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
 Jeremiah, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,880
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand it.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,200
 Just helps with the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,760
 Also, this weekend is the last time to submit your entry to the Earth First episode.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,040
 I want a recording of you chanting "Earth First" at least three times.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,160
 I'm going to mix it into a remastered version of the Earth First episode.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,080
 Deadline is Valentine's Day at midnight.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,960
 Let's get that in if you want to be part of Dead Rabbit Radio history.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,360
 I've gotten a ton of entrance already.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,720
 It's going to be great.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,600
 And I also want to give a shout out to the Asylum case studies.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,120
 This is a podcast hosted by my friend, Tressa.

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
 She had me on her show.

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,000
 She was gracious enough to have me on her show where we reviewed the movie Death Racer

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
 starring the insane clown Posse.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,000
 It's a lot of fun.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 So check that out.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,400
 Those links are on the show notes if you want more Jason over the weekend.

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,680
 Jeremiah, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,240
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,920
 We're headed all the way out to Alton, Illinois.

40
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,480
 [Dunkey noises]

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
 Driving out there kicking up dust.

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,760
 It's the 1930s.

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,280
 Everyone's like doing the flapper dances and stuff like that.

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,440
 On the streets and people are also jumping to their death.

45
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,960
 They're like, "Ah, it lost all my money."

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,640
 And while this is all going on, there's a YWCA in Alton, Illinois.

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,120
 This is a place where the young women go and work out, I guess.

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,680
 I don't really know what happens here.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,920
 Isn't it like a big clubhouse?

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
 I don't know.

51
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
 Could have researched it.

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
 But I didn't.

53
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,320
 YWCA, this place has a giant swimming pool and there's a family that works there.

54
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
 There's a father.

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,200
 His name is John Grumper.

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,920
 And then his wife, Mrs. Grumper, and they have a daughter named Elizabeth Grumper.

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,720
 And John Grumper, he did all the building maintenance at night.

58
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,400
 Mrs. Grumper, she was the maid.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
 Elizabeth Grumper was just right.

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,680
 Her porridge is perfect.

61
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,080
 And while they were working, Elizabeth Grumper would go swimming in the pool all by herself.

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,600
 So I'm imagining she's probably like six, somewhere between the ages of when you can

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,520
 swim and an adult is how old she is.

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
 We don't have her actual age.

65
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,720
 So Elizabeth Grumper is swimming in the pool every night while John Grumper is like fixing

66
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
 pipes.

67
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,640
 There you go, pipe.

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,840
 And then Mrs. Grumper is, how do you have a maid in a YWCA?

69
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,040
 What's she doing like making bedsheets?

70
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,520
 But anyways, I don't know.

71
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,280
 Maybe there's beds in the YWCA.

72
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,360
 Can I know nothing about the place?

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,240
 Well, one night when John was going about his business maintaining the place, he walks

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:50,720
 through the gymnasium where the pool is and he sees his daughter dead.

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,760
 She's floating upside down in the pool.

76
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
 I can't imagine.

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 I don't have kids.

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
 And this is really the reason why.

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,040
 I don't like losing anything, but I can buy a new laptop.

80
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
 I can buy new clothes.

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
 I can't imagine the loss of losing a kid.

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,520
 That terrifies me.

83
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,800
 It's honestly like keeps me from having kids.

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,160
 So anyways, that's what he's going through right now.

85
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,600
 One of my greatest fears, he's going through right now.

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,560
 He sees his daughter floating in the pool and he freaks out.

87
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,640
 This story is weird, by the way.

88
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,480
 This story is so odd and this is where it really gets weird.

89
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,000
 Imagine you saw, please do not imagine you were watching your child drown.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,360
 But imagine you're John Grumper, right?

91
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
 And you see your daughter.

92
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,280
 It's the same thing, you still see your kid drown.

93
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
 But anyways, he sees his daughter drown.

94
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,840
 In my, what I would do is, and I'm a bad swimmer, so I would join her, but I would

95
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
 go in after her, right?

96
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,600
 She could be blue and rigamortis and I'm still going to do CPR on her.

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
 Crabs are coming out of her mouth.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,360
 She's been in the water for three days.

99
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,360
 I'm like, yummy, yummy, yummy, free seafood.

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
 You know what I mean?

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,760
 The reason why I'm saying all this is because he doesn't do any of that.

102
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,320
 He walks in, he sees his daughter floating upside down in the pool and he runs away.

103
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,280
 He's so scared that the fact that his daughter drowned, he runs away.

104
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,080
 Now he has underneath the pool bleachers section, like so, you know, it's like a gymnasium,

105
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
 right?

106
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
 So there's bleachers.

107
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,240
 So for people, I don't know why there's bleachers.

108
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
 There's people who sit and go, ooh, he's a good swimmer.

109
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,160
 You guys are watching people swim around or she's a good swimmer because it's YWCA, but

110
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
 why would you have bleachers at a swimming pool?

111
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,920
 But anyways, so it's not like a sporting event.

112
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
 If it is, she lost.

113
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,600
 She's drowning or drowned.

114
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,960
 So he gets scared now underneath the bleachers is his workshop.

115
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,680
 He runs in there and he's hiding because he just saw his dead daughter.

116
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:01,520
 And then a couple minutes pass and he hears a eeeeeee and the door to his workshop is opening

117
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
 and he's peaking.

118
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,520
 He's working on something.

119
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,960
 He's like, oh, might as well, might as well fix these pipes while I'm in here.

120
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,360
 He turns around and he sees standing in the doorway, his daughter dripping wet.

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
 Her hair, black hair, all covered in her face.

122
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,760
 She looks like Samara from the ring.

123
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
 She's just standing there.

124
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,160
 I don't know if she's all fidgety, but she's standing there dripping wet.

125
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
 She's ghost, right?

126
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,200
 Like this might be the record for a ghost turnaround.

127
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,640
 Like she just died.

128
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,320
 Now her ghost is like opening doors.

129
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,880
 That's pretty, it's actually pretty powerful for a ghost.

130
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
 Ghost can't do that.

131
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,600
 So he does the, this is where he acts how I would act.

132
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,680
 If I was in a workshop and I saw a ghost, he grabs a tool from his workbench and begins

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,880
 stabbing, stabbing the ghost.

134
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,240
 Stick stick stick stick.

135
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:57,480
 And the ghost starts bleeding, bleeding human blood and screaming out loud.

136
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,360
 And that's when Mrs. Grumper runs in.

137
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,000
 And John is killing this ghost and Mrs. Grumper goes, no, no, no, no, what are you doing?

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 You're killing her daughter.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,520
 And he goes, no, this was a ghost.

140
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,480
 I saw her die just a few minutes ago.

141
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,080
 And she goes, oh, I pulled her out of the pool and gave her mouth to mouth.

142
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,560
 That, she was alive.

143
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
 She was alive.

144
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
 You just stab her to death.

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,440
 So now John is looking down at his dead daughter and apparently Mrs. Grumper tried getting

146
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,640
 the screwdriver, whatever it was from John Grumper.

147
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,080
 And he says she accidentally fell on the screwdriver multiple times in the liver and the kidney.

148
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,240
 And then the mom died as well.

149
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,480
 And then in his sorrow, the fact that he's looking at his dead daughter and his dead

150
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,560
 wife, he realizes that he's responsible for it.

151
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,520
 He writes a suicide letter saying that the YWCA is haunted by demons and the demons must

152
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
 have tricked him.

153
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,160
 The demons made him a coward.

154
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,880
 The demons made him kill his daughter and his wife.

155
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,640
 And he hung himself from the main staircase.

156
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,920
 Now that's not an urban legend.

157
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,680
 We've been covering a lot of urban legends this week.

158
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,920
 That's not an urban legend.

159
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,880
 That is an actual ghost story coming out of the Alton, Illinois YWCA, which is a real

160
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,520
 place.

161
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,960
 What is interesting about this, the reason why I wanted to profile this is that is dumb.

162
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,720
 That ghost story is dumb.

163
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
 It doesn't make any sense.

164
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,160
 Now I'm not saying people don't act irrationally, right?

165
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
 People do act irrationally.

166
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,840
 I read about it all the time when I'm looking at these true crime stories that I don't cover

167
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,880
 on the show because they're far due disturbing.

168
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,040
 But I still read them.

169
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,280
 People act irrationally all the time.

170
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,560
 This story doesn't make sense.

171
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,800
 This story doesn't make sense at all.

172
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,760
 And the reason why I wanted to cover it, and here's the thing, it very well could be true.

173
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
 Right?

174
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
 Because people do act irrationally.

175
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,720
 But I could only find one source on this story as much as I could look.

176
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
 And it's from the St. Louis Paranormal Research Society.

177
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:02,720
 And what they do is they charge you 25 bucks to walk around the YWCA with a flashlight

178
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,960
 at night.

179
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,160
 20 people are the max too.

180
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,480
 So you're gonna make some serious cash walking around the YWCA going, "There's a ghost!"

181
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,120
 Oh, you just missed them.

182
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
 "There's a ghost!"

183
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,240
 Okay, to be fair, I never got on a tour.

184
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,680
 I don't know if they're fraudsters.

185
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
 I don't think they are.

186
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,720
 But I'm super curious about the origin of this story.

187
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,800
 And what's interesting is they repeat it on two different web pages on the same website

188
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
 and it's different.

189
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,400
 The story is different.

190
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,120
 One of the versions has more details.

191
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,200
 The other one leaves some stuff out.

192
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,480
 This is really weird.

193
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,880
 Again, the ghost story itself, I want to dissect, let's dissect the ghost story real quick.

194
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:47,360
 First off, I've started to come to the conclusion that it's very common to see the victims become

195
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
 the ghosts.

196
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,920
 We see that a lot in Ghost Lore.

197
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,000
 Someone dies a tragic death and their ghost is haunting the hotel room.

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,960
 There's like a showgirl in a saloon and she gets shot by her lover and her ghost is haunting

199
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
 the saloon.

200
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
 It's very common.

201
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,240
 And a lot of times the murderers themselves, sometimes become ghosts, sometimes become

202
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
 monsters.

203
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,880
 But very rarely monsters.

204
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,040
 A lot of times they don't show up at all.

205
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,600
 And what was interesting was I was looking around their website and I could have missed

206
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,440
 something, but generally the only ghosts that are seen here are Elizabeth and Mrs. Grumper.

207
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,360
 And I wasn't able to confirm that these people even existed.

208
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,640
 This is one of the stories that you would assume would be in the newspaper because it's so

209
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
 weird.

210
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,600
 And also that would be the thing.

211
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
 Would he put in his suicide letter?

212
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
 I was scared.

213
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,400
 Because everyone who witnessed this is dead.

214
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,240
 He would have had to put in his suicide letter.

215
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
 I was super scared.

216
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
 I thought my daughter died.

217
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
 I ran away.

218
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,400
 I'm not going to commit suicide, but if I was going to commit suicide, my suicide note

219
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
 would be bomb.

220
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,280
 I'd be like, oh yeah, I might as well tell all you guys this now.

221
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,600
 I totally beat up Satan.

222
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,440
 I punched him in the nards.

223
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,960
 And that is why I'm killing myself because he's coming after me.

224
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,800
 I don't ever plan on killing myself, but I think people would lie in suicide letters,

225
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 right?

226
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 I don't know.

227
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,080
 Maybe I've never committed suicide, so I don't know.

228
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,400
 But I would assume you would go out with your best foot forward.

229
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,920
 You'd dress up like a little tuxedo, a little top hat, and write a stellar suicide note.

230
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
 But again, I don't know.

231
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,040
 I've read some suicide notes, and they do tend to be like that.

232
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,920
 They're quite spectacular, really.

233
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,320
 So there's some good ones out there.

234
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,600
 It's horrible as that sounds.

235
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,400
 I've been thinking about reading one on the podcast.

236
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,760
 I'm trying to find the right time for you.

237
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
 Like Jason, please don't.

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 This woman wrote a suicide letter, and it is like that.

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
 And actually, yeah.

240
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,360
 So anyways, Jason, please don't put that on TikTok.

241
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,080
 Don't put that anywhere else.

242
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
 We have that.

243
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
 We have the weird ghost story.

244
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,640
 But then we have the idea that if this story is made up, it's the dumbest made up story

245
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
 you could possibly make up, right?

246
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,080
 Like you would figure if I was a member of the St. Louis Paranormal Research Society,

247
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,520
 and I made it up, and I'm not really accusing them of making up.

248
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,120
 I'm not saying that it's real either.

249
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,480
 This is a weird story.

250
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,840
 But I would have made it more believable.

251
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,000
 I would have said there was a...

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,800
 I would have had the murder, right?

253
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 That totally works.

254
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
 I think I run it away from the body.

255
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
 There's just too many questions.

256
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
 Maybe I'm overthinking it.

257
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
 I'm looking at bottles in a suicide letter.

258
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,760
 I was like, "Oh, you goof."

259
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,440
 So anyways, maybe I'm overthinking this whole thing.

260
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
 I find it...

261
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,960
 Do find it odd that the only source for this story are the people who will charge you money

262
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,000
 to go walk around the YWCA.

263
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,560
 However, in their defense, I looked at the Yelp reviews for the YWCA.

264
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
 They're all about the tour.

265
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,880
 Like, if you go to the YWCA's review site, it's like, "Oh, it was so much fun."

266
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,960
 And so, apparently, the ghost tour is kicking.

267
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,320
 So if you're in the area, $25 isn't bad.

268
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
 It's a couple hours.

269
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,440
 You walk around, you get to be told, "There's a ghost."

270
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,320
 I just missed them.

271
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,960
 And do the EVPs and stuff like that.

272
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
 I mean, I would do it.

273
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,440
 $25 isn't a ton of money.

274
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,800
 I would have gone in there, but I'd also be a little suspicious that the story is just

275
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,320
 so ridiculous.

276
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,040
 It's too ridiculous to be true.

277
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
 Is it?

278
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,440
 You know what I mean?

279
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,520
 I mean, again, we've talked about Bigfoot wearing backpacks.

280
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,680
 We've talked about-- I don't know why I'm hung up on this story.

281
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
 I'm like, "What?

282
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
 That's a bridge too far."

283
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,240
 Anyways, I thought there was an interesting story.

284
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,280
 If you are local to the area, take the ghost tour and tell us what you think.

285
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
 I'd be very, very curious.

286
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
 You're possessed.

287
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,320
 You're like, "Oh, you're just swimming in pools everywhere."

288
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,240
 You're like, "Unless return to the watery grave."

289
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
 I'm like, "Oops, sorry."

290
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,560
 Maybe I shouldn't recommend people going on ghost tours that I haven't been on myself.

291
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,080
 Jeremiah, let's go ahead and leave behind that very odd segment.

292
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,240
 I don't know what my beef was with it.

293
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,520
 I do like the story.

294
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,360
 I did like telling the story, but it just leaves a weird taste in my mouth.

295
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,720
 But Jeremiah, if anyone thought that story was weird and they have no idea what's coming

296
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
 up.

297
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,440
 Jeremiah, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Garmenticopter.

298
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
 We're leaving behind Alton, Illinois.

299
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,200
 We're waving goodbye to a very wet ghost.

300
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,800
 We're headed all the way out to Nevada.

301
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,960
 Yeah, how come we don't...

302
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,760
 You don't see the murderers' ghost very often.

303
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
 It is weird.

304
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,800
 So I guess the implication is they're in hell, right?

305
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,080
 I guess that's kind of what we imply.

306
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,240
 Their spirit's not walking.

307
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,040
 You do get them from time to time, but it is much more rare.

308
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,040
 A lot of times it's the person who suffers, who's stuck.

309
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
 Weird.

310
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,160
 Anyways, speaking of weird, this is just absolutely...

311
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,880
 Let me see where I want to begin with this guy.

312
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,000
 Jeremiah, go ahead and put the Garmenticopter in neutral, which I guess is just landing

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 it.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,440
 There's this guy I just came across today.

315
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,640
 His name is Kevin Whiskey.

316
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:39,240
 And listen, I've lived a pretty exciting life, but it's not Super Soldier exciting.

317
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,480
 You know, I've done some cool stuff in my life.

318
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,120
 I've done some stuff I probably regret, or will regret when the IRS catches up to me,

319
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,200
 but I'm not a Super Soldier.

320
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,120
 I'm not one of these people who has pushed my mind and my body and my soul to the limit.

321
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,840
 Now we've covered very famous Super Soldiers on this show.

322
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,640
 We covered John Storm a long time ago.

323
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,400
 He's a man who believes the government hates him so much that they hit him very softly

324
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,480
 with a car while he was crossing the street one day.

325
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,960
 But that episode on the show notes, it's fantastic.

326
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
 He found me, by the way.

327
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,120
 He's one of the many people that I did an episode on.

328
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,840
 If you look at the YouTube comments, he's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

329
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,040
 So actually I think I removed it because I was using copyright photos of his.

330
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,480
 I don't know if that episode's unlisted or something like that.

331
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,480
 We'll see.

332
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
 I'll put it in the show notes.

333
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,960
 But anyways, he found me.

334
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
 And then Max Spears.

335
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,080
 You guys remember Max Spears?

336
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,400
 He was really big in the conspiracy theory community.

337
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,280
 He was a Super Soldier who went to, if I remember correctly, Romania to be part of some workshop

338
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,480
 or to give a speech about being a Super Soldier.

339
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,720
 And he ended up dying.

340
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,680
 And like when his friends found him, there was like black goo coming out of his nose.

341
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,280
 I did an episode on him as well.

342
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,800
 It was kind of the companion piece to the John Storm episode.

343
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,240
 Super Soldier, he's very, very famous in the conspiracy theory community.

344
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,920
 I'm sure a lot of you guys know the name Max Spears.

345
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,280
 Well, Kevin Whiskey beat him up.

346
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,160
 Kevin Whiskey tells the story that he met Max Spears.

347
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,800
 And he thinks that Max Spears, some of the stuff he's saying is true, but in all Max

348
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,440
 Spears was a fraud.

349
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,080
 And he tested that by tackling Max Spears in a parking lot and realizing that he does

350
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,200
 not have the strength of a reptilian trained Super Soldier.

351
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,480
 So this is the power level we're talking about.

352
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,280
 This guy beat up Max Spears and then went on to spend an entire page calling him a heroin

353
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,960
 addict and that he was just a kid.

354
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,160
 So Kevin Whiskey is a high level dude.

355
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,080
 And so on his, on this website he's talking about, he describes himself as an international

356
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,360
 pagan themed strongman.

357
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,680
 Don't know what that means.

358
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,320
 That means if he's juggling totem poles, but he's an international pagan themed strongman.

359
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:57,200
 He's also a master of heavy and he italicized heavy, master of heavy, clubs, maces, and

360
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,760
 grip strength feats.

361
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,080
 So these are all plot points that are going to come up in this story.

362
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,560
 So if you ever, he took footage, there's a YouTube channel, thankfully, thankfully,

363
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,160
 the Pakin Gods that he has a YouTube channel.

364
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,240
 There's a YouTube video of him at his mobile home park and he shows outside of it and he

365
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,400
 has at least a dozen clubs.

366
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,960
 Looks like a caveman lives there.

367
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,440
 He has these really, really heavy clubs.

368
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,080
 Out of all the stuff I doubt on this story, I don't doubt that he's strong because he

369
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,160
 owns several clubs and he has, he does YouTube video, he's holding up these kettlebells.

370
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,360
 So also he's a lifelong martial artist.

371
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,800
 He has a black belt and judo.

372
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,880
 He's a world famous occultist.

373
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,320
 I know this is not the first time you guys are hearing about him.

374
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,640
 I don't know why this show only deals with obscure people and obscure topics.

375
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,280
 I don't know why I'm talking about Kevin Whiskey.

376
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,440
 Everyone knows this dude.

377
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,160
 Politicians call him up.

378
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
 Politicians call him up.

379
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
 And he actually, we talk about Max Spears.

380
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,080
 He has a whole page saying what a punk Max Spears was and how he was just a heroin addict

381
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,560
 who died from bad heroin and he easily beat him in the parking lot.

382
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,320
 Not only does he have his own page about Max Spears, on his main page, his About You page,

383
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,400
 he has this quote, "Unlike Max Spears," the dude's dead by the way.

384
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,280
 Max Spears has been dead for a couple years now.

385
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:27,400
 "Unlike Max Spears and others, my arms have actually prevailed over otherworldly forces."

386
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,680
 So all these other super soldiers, Max Spears said that he fought off a reptilian once.

387
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
 He says, "No.

388
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,920
 I have actually done it."

389
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,560
 And we're actually going to look at a time that he did.

390
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,000
 One day, Kevin Whiskey was driving from Idaho to California.

391
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,760
 And right when he passes the Nevada state line, a feeling of dread encircles him.

392
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
 What?

393
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
 Oh, no.

394
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,160
 Oh, what's going on?

395
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,840
 Everything was so good in the state before Nevada.

396
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,440
 What would that be, Colorado?

397
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
 Or Arizona, whatever.

398
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
 New Mexico.

399
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,280
 You're like chasing by a map, please.

400
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,520
 I'm driving through Nevada.

401
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,320
 All of a sudden, I feel just horrible.

402
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,960
 Now it's not just because he's in Nevada.

403
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,240
 It's not because Nevada is just a state of Tatooine.

404
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,920
 He's driving through and he feels this like just a sense of dread.

405
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
 He's driving down I-5.

406
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
 He's driving down the freeway.

407
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
 And here we go.

408
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,200
 Quote, "A sudden wave of panic hit me so hard.

409
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,640
 I thought I was blindsided by a vehicle.

410
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
 Harnow."

411
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,760
 "I white-knuckled the steering wheel and stomped the brakes."

412
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,960
 So he's sitting there on his truck, completely stopped on I-5, just sweating.

413
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,320
 Nevada, Nevada, what are you doing to me?

414
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,400
 He's frozen in just fear.

415
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
 So he sits there and he knows how to get out of this.

416
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
 He's been trained to get out of this, right?

417
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,640
 Pagan themed, a strong man.

418
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
 Use your powers.

419
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,720
 Now remember, in the real world, here is a truck stopped on I-5.

420
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,000
 Middle of the day, the story's taking place, right?

421
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,600
 So as this Pagan strong man is doing his controlled breathing exercises, I'm good.

422
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,240
 I'm the best.

423
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,200
 Mommy loves me.

424
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
 I love myself.

425
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,440
 As he's sitting on the freeway on a very, very busy freeway, breathing, doing his controlled

426
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,400
 breathing for a few minutes, he's finally able to regain his wits.

427
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,840
 He goes, "Yes."

428
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,360
 I'm finally snapped out of the dread.

429
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
 It wasn't the blaring honking of horns.

430
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,960
 It wasn't the several car pile-up I caused by coming to a complete stop on I-5.

431
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
 No!

432
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,160
 It was my controlled breathing I learned from Gwyneth Paltrow when I was saving her from

433
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,200
 the Pleiadians or whatever made up story.

434
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,720
 And so he starts driving down the road again.

435
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,880
 He just freaked out.

436
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,240
 He just came to a complete stop.

437
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,800
 He couldn't even bear to be in Nevada any longer.

438
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,360
 He's driving on the road and then all of a sudden, the feelings of dread come over him

439
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,920
 and then he starts getting suicidal ideation.

440
00:20:52,920 --> 00:21:04,760
 "Soon, I caught myself imagining, and vividly, ways someone might commit suicide in the desert."

441
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,720
 Isn't there only one really?

442
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
 You just watch.

443
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,160
 Just go for a long walk in the desert.

444
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,600
 The only other things I can think of is death by cactus, pissing off a roadrunner.

445
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,000
 There's not many ways that I could think of someone to kill themselves in the desert,

446
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 but he's seeing them vividly.

447
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,560
 He's seeing himself holding up the sign that says, "Help me."

448
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,160
 He's thinking about suicidal ideation, thinking about killing himself in the desert.

449
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,400
 "No, no, get rid of those thoughts.

450
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,560
 Get rid of those thoughts, crazy thoughts."

451
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,120
 And he's driving down the road and then he's pulled over.

452
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,400
 He's like, "What?"

453
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,040
 And if you think this story is disjointed, imagine driving behind this guy because what

454
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,560
 has happened now in a matter of minutes is he slammed on his brakes in the middle of

455
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:55,600
 the freeway, imagined himself falling off of a cliff with a box of TNT from Acme, and

456
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 then pulled over.

457
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,760
 For who knows how long he doesn't know when he pulled over or why he pulled over.

458
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,800
 He's pulled over on the side of the road and then as he's sitting on the side of the

459
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:10,440
 road, he is hit with a white hot flash of anger and he guns it and he's taken off down

460
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,600
 the road.

461
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,480
 So just to be clear, this guy exists.

462
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
 This is not urban legend.

463
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
 This is not happened in the 1930s.

464
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,720
 He is coming to a complete stop and then gunning it on the freeway multiple times.

465
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,560
 He's probably at this point only like three miles into the state of Nevada and then all

466
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:30,440
 of a sudden, whoo, whoo, whoo, he looks in his rear room mirror and he sees a black sedan

467
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,560
 with the little visor lights, right?

468
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,360
 It's like an undercover police car and he's like, "You pigs."

469
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,880
 Oh, those stinkers.

470
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,440
 Those pig old stinkers, those bad boys.

471
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,160
 Those pigs, he keeps calling them pigs.

472
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,120
 Those pigs is actually making me hungry.

473
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
 Oh, those pigs.

474
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,560
 I knew they were going to pull me over.

475
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
 They're always on my website, mightandmagic.com.

476
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,240
 I actually thought his website was a lark when I first found that mightandmagic.com.

477
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,520
 I thought it was like for some chooser and adventure.

478
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,200
 Anyways, he's driving the car and he sees this undercover cop behind him.

479
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,640
 He's like, "Oh yeah, dude.

480
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
 Let's do it."

481
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,400
 Pagan Strongman versus law enforcement of Nevada.

482
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,120
 I think we know who's going to win this one.

483
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
 But this isn't a law enforcement from Nevada.

484
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,200
 He learns this when he pulls over like he should, right?

485
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,680
 I mean, he can call this guy a pig all he wants, but it would be a huge issue if he kept driving.

486
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:28,720
 He pulls over and the black sedan pulls over and out of this black car steps a man in black.

487
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
 You know what's interesting?

488
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,680
 When I was prepping this story, I thought, "We've never talked about the men in black

489
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
 on the show."

490
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,680
 And I'm not going to.

491
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,680
 They're very, very common.

492
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,440
 I don't think we really, I don't really don't think we've ever talked about men in black

493
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
 on this show.

494
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
 It could be wrong.

495
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,800
 This might be the first time or maybe second, but out of 800 and some odd episodes, it's

496
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 weird.

497
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,440
 But men in black pops out.

498
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,560
 He is six foot, six feet tall.

499
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,600
 Nothing but gangly limbs, very weak looking.

500
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,120
 Do you even lift, bro?

501
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,040
 As he's wearing a black trench coat and a black fedora, this gangly, tall man is walking

502
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,800
 towards Kevin Whiskey.

503
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
 It's so funny.

504
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,880
 This guy thinks he's so important.

505
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,120
 This guy thinks he's so important.

506
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,720
 I'm looking at notes and I couldn't remember his name.

507
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,080
 Anyways, he's watching this gangly man walk towards him.

508
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
 And here we get a quote.

509
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,640
 This is where we really get into the mind of Kevin Whiskey because we know he's a terrible

510
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
 driver.

511
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
 We know you don't want to be anywhere near him.

512
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
 But listen to this.

513
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,280
 As he's watching this man walk towards him, he goes, "I flashed back to my childhood and

514
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:40,360
 the very tall, awkward kid I pulverized with a baseball bat, rescuing a cat he was setting

515
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,240
 on fire to.

516
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,720
 For a brief moment, I mused it was him seeking revenge.

517
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,160
 I smiled at the idea of hurting him again."

518
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,680
 That didn't happen, dude.

519
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,360
 I can guarantee you, whatever else in the store, I find it more believable that you

520
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,840
 took on Max Spears in a parking lot than when you were a kid you pulverized another kid

521
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,920
 with a baseball bat because he was setting the cat on fire.

522
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,080
 And it's almost like he wrote the first part going, "Yeah, I beat this gangly freak.

523
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,360
 I beat you taller than me.

524
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
 How dare you?"

525
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,080
 And then he's like, "Oh wait, that makes me the bad guy.

526
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,960
 I better give myself a reason for the violence."

527
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,040
 But he's like, "Maybe it's this dude, right?

528
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,400
 Maybe it's this dude.

529
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,600
 Maybe the guy that I pulverized with a baseball bat became a government agent."

530
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,280
 But anyways, this man in black is walking towards him and he knows exactly what this

531
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
 is.

532
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,960
 He's a contactee, experiencer, as he puts it.

533
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,800
 He does a lot of stuff with UFOs as well.

534
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,520
 So as this man gangles up to him, he said he looked into his eyes.

535
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,520
 Kevin looked into this man in black's eyes and he had albinism pink eyeballs.

536
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,520
 He also described the guy's face as being like a burn victim.

537
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,240
 But I was like, "What?

538
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,960
 That's not an albino."

539
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,560
 He has albinism pink eyes and they're hypnotic.

540
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:06,880
 Kevin really quickly learns that if he looks right at the dude, he starts to like, I don't

541
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,200
 know, fall in love with him or something.

542
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,120
 He's like, "Oh, I want to be a man in black too."

543
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,360
 So he has to keep looking away from the man in black, looking around, which is so weird

544
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,440
 because honestly that sounds like such weak behavior.

545
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,880
 Like this guy's like, "Oh, if it's this kid I beat up with a baseball bat, oh, I can't

546
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,320
 wait to beat him up again."

547
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,160
 But when it's just like a member of a government agency, he's like, "Oh, I can't look at him."

548
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
 They're like, "Why not?"

549
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,880
 He's like, "Oh, because I'm afraid I'll get hypnotized."

550
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,720
 Or you just can't look at people in the eyes, which is nothing to be afraid of.

551
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,200
 Kevin, I mean, that's fine.

552
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
 That's fine.

553
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,600
 But anyways, it turns out that this guy is not a cop.

554
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,880
 I guess you could have figured out because I've used the term man in black over and over

555
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
 again.

556
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,760
 This is a man in black and he has no eyebrows.

557
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,360
 He speaks in a very high-pitched voice.

558
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,440
 He's like, "So, Kevin.

559
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,960
 What do we know about your website, magic.com, on WordPress?

560
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,560
 Oh, you fool.

561
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,920
 You think you can get away with this?"

562
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,720
 He says his name and he's saying all this stuff and as he's talking, even though Kevin's

563
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,000
 not trying to look him in the eyes because he's afraid of him, he notices this dude has

564
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,040
 razor-sharp piranha-like teeth.

565
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,480
 Speaking in this really weird high-pitched voice, this story's so bizarre.

566
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,080
 So this man in black, he's telling him like, "You're a loser."

567
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,320
 I'm actually going to give him a deeper voice.

568
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,560
 You're a loser, Kevin.

569
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
 You're a loser.

570
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
 You've always been a loser.

571
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,120
 You don't know what's going on in your life.

572
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,480
 You think that you're moving towards something, but you're not.

573
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,440
 You're just a loser like every other human.

574
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,080
 And it's weird.

575
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,600
 That's not far from what he said.

576
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,960
 He did basically say, "You don't know how you feel.

577
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,440
 You don't know what you are doing in that shit show you call your life and certainly

578
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,000
 don't know where you are going, not now or in general."

579
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,640
 Which again, don't rub the salt in the wounds, Mr. Minin Black.

580
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,880
 I get it that you can probably read my mind.

581
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,040
 You can find my inner fears.

582
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,440
 But imagine that every time you got pulled over by a police officer, they actually judged

583
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
 your life choices.

584
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,880
 Not in the fact that, "Oh, I see you're using meth.

585
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
 I'm going to arrest you."

586
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,800
 But just like, "How come you didn't finish your community college degree?"

587
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,760
 You're like, "Oh, I should have done it."

588
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,000
 How come you never asked that girl out in high school?

589
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
 Also, here's the ticket for $220.

590
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,400
 That would be the worst.

591
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,560
 So this goes on for a while.

592
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,280
 There's this quote unquote witty dialogue between the man in black and Kevin and they're

593
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
 going back and forth.

594
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,240
 And Kevin, you know, he's getting worked up about this.

595
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,640
 He's not going to let this guy ruin his trip to California.

596
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,800
 And he finally has enough of all of these threats, all of these veiled truths about how

597
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,240
 his life is going nowhere.

598
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:42,280
 Kevin says, "I make you two promises, you aberrant, fish-faced mutant piece of shit.

599
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,080
 One, I am going nowhere with you.

600
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,560
 And two, what do you think number two is?

601
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,600
 I'll give you three seconds to guess.

602
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,960
 One, I'm not going anywhere with you.

603
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,160
 Two, I'm posting this online."

604
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,280
 And because of this, because he now knows that this is going to go on this very, very widely

605
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,880
 traffic website, mightandmagic.com, because a lot of people go there expecting it to be

606
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,120
 a D&D resource.

607
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,120
 The fish-faced mutant loses his temper and goes, "Looks like we're about to have another

608
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,480
 missing person."

609
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,520
 And he lunged at Kevin whiskey.

610
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,000
 There's a fight going on now on the shoulder of I-5.

611
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,160
 You have this six foot six gangly man reaching into this car, fish teeth snapping inches

612
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,080
 away from Kevin's face.

613
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,980
 Man in black is using one arm to try to grab the car keys because it's time for another

614
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
 missing person.

615
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,360
 And while his freehand is clutching Kevin's throat, now I know what you guys are scared.

616
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,560
 I'm scared too, but you know who's not scared?

617
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
 Kevin.

618
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,360
 Kevin knows exactly what to do.

619
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,640
 Kevin is ready for this.

620
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,040
 "Those years of crushing closed, heavy hand grippers till blood dribbled out from underneath

621
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,960
 my fingernails.

622
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,160
 Ripping giant monster-class kettlebells off the ground to overhead till the skin on my

623
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,420
 hands tore open.

624
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:16,500
 And swinging large clubs and maces till my forearm muscles swelled."

625
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,980
 So ridiculous.

626
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,480
 Here's the thing.

627
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,500
 We know that you're lying, right?

628
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,660
 But don't make it this obvious, right?

629
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,460
 I don't think you can squeeze your hand closed enough that your fingernails start shooting

630
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,860
 out blood.

631
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,100
 I think that's a totally unrelated medical condition, but whatever.

632
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
 And then what was the other one?

633
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,420
 Oh, a lifting monster-class kettlebells off the ground till his hands, the skin on his

634
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,000
 hands to be fair, the skin on his hands tore open.

635
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,240
 Those are called blisters, dude.

636
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,960
 Everyone gets them.

637
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:55,400
 And swinging large clubs and maces till my forearm muscles swelled so much I couldn't

638
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
 make a fist."

639
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,400
 Is that possible?

640
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,060
 At that point, it's kind of like one of those, what do they call them?

641
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:10,780
 Like cankles where the calf and the ankle just become one because of excess weight.

642
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:17,420
 Wouldn't that be like, how can your forearm get so big that you basically have to like,

643
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,860
 how would you even eat then?

644
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,580
 You're just drinking slurpees all the time.

645
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,580
 Whatever.

646
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,540
 He remembers doing all that stuff.

647
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,580
 It's going to pay off dividends because he's able to fight off this man in black.

648
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:33,140
 So the man in black is so strong, but Kevin's stronger and he actually breaks the man in

649
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,140
 black's thumb.

650
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,940
 He screeches.

651
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,440
 He starts punching the man in black, but remember, they're fighting in the car.

652
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,520
 So half of the man in black, I should have given him a fake name, but anyways, half of

653
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,960
 the man is outside the car and the other half is punching Kevin.

654
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,480
 Kevin's trying to fight in the car.

655
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,080
 There's not a lot of room to do the wind up because trust me, if Kevin was up with,

656
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,140
 if this is a standup fight, one punch, this man in black would be down, but because in

657
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,980
 a car, he's just kind of punching this guy.

658
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,540
 And at this point, I think we should start to consider the fact this might have happened,

659
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,540
 right?

660
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,340
 He might have actually been beating someone up who was inside of his car.

661
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,660
 Now I don't know if it's a man in black.

662
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:16,060
 I highly suspect that it wasn't, but there is a chance that he did get pulled over while

663
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,740
 he was driving on I-5 because he was starting and stopping the car and slamming on the brakes

664
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,140
 and pulling over for no apparent reason.

665
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,880
 He got pulled over and in real life, this is a deputy for the Nevada Highway Patrol or

666
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,280
 State Patrol, whatever they are, and he's currently getting punched by international

667
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,960
 pagan strongman, Kevin Whiskey.

668
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,480
 But the man in black starts punching him back.

669
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,320
 Like, even though there's not a lot of room, the man in black is no longer trying to grab

670
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,320
 his throat to grab the keys.

671
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,560
 The man in black is punching him and he realizes, "Oh dude, this dude's super strong."

672
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:51,960
 So he actually uses, because his muscles are so big, his muscles are so big, he raises

673
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,600
 up and he's able to protect his head with what he calls his meat shield because his

674
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,300
 forearm and his bicep.

675
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,940
 Now I said earlier, I don't debate that this guy's strong.

676
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,060
 He actually does have pictures.

677
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,060
 He's muscular.

678
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,060
 I don't think I would call any part of his body a meat shield, but apparently he thinks

679
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:17,780
 when he closes his bicep and his forearm, it forms some sort of impervious meat barricade.

680
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,540
 And so he's punching him.

681
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,960
 But you know, Kevin does know that the odds are stacked against him.

682
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,520
 He does say, quote, "He had me like a cornered animal."

683
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,080
 That animal was a lion.

684
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,240
 Which I guess the analogy kind of makes sense because the lions are powerful, but a cornered

685
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,440
 animal is a cornered animal, right?

686
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,680
 You're not in the winning position.

687
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,360
 Like, I don't care if you're a cornered elephant.

688
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,760
 I mean, I would if I was there personally, but still, you're on the defensive.

689
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
 He's punching.

690
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,660
 He's punching the meat shield.

691
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,060
 And he realized, I gotta get out of this.

692
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:59,060
 So he uses his thumb and sticks it deep into the man in black's ear hole, as he describes

693
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
 it.

694
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,180
 He drags the man in black almost all the way into his car.

695
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,740
 And now they're wrestling in the car.

696
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,740
 How big is this car?

697
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,740
 Who knows?

698
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,180
 The point is, is that the story's almost over.

699
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,780
 So he's wrestling this guy in his car and then he looks over and, you know, he still

700
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,340
 might lose because this guy is a man in black.

701
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,480
 He's a train agent from some other place, possibly a water planet.

702
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,520
 Kevin sees a screwdriver in like a belt, like a tool belt sitting on a seat and he's like,

703
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
 "Uh, uh."

704
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,880
 Or I'm almost for sure he's gonna find this episode.

705
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,240
 So let me get my facts straight.

706
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,200
 It's a screwdriver in a tool belt somewhere in the car because he'll be like, "Well, first

707
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,080
 off, it wasn't in the seat.

708
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,760
 Secondly, I am that strong."

709
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,520
 Anyways, he sees the screwdriver tucked away somewhere in the car and Kevin grabs the screwdriver.

710
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,220
 And then this happens.

711
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,180
 Now again, this story, there's three possibilities with this story.

712
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:57,460
 One, he's totally making the story up and when this story supposedly took place, he was

713
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,680
 sitting at home, could have been playing WWE 2007 on the PlayStation.

714
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,980
 That's possibility one.

715
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,180
 Possibility two is that this man is actually a trained super soldier, international pagan

716
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,860
 strong man who politicians call up to cast spells.

717
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:21,640
 He uses wordpress and he lives in a trailer park and he fought a real man in black in

718
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,120
 the desert.

719
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,520
 Face to face, deadly combat.

720
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:33,760
 Or the story is real in the sense that Kevin Whiskey got pulled over by a police officer

721
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:42,240
 and in his mind he has transformed very, very real events into something magical where

722
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,200
 his might is evident.

723
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,120
 So I'll let you figure out which one you want either.

724
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,280
 He's completely making the story up.

725
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,560
 He really fought off a man in black or he fought a deputy.

726
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,880
 He fought a member of law enforcement as he was trying to get his keys.

727
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,440
 You guys figure out which one you want to believe as I read to you this last paragraph.

728
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,960
 Max has a screwdriver in his hand.

729
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,480
 "Handling the screwdriver like an ice pick" I really hope you didn't pick the deputy

730
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
 one.

731
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:21,480
 "Handling the screwdriver like an ice pick, I savagely perforated" Perforated?

732
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
 Is that how you pronounce it?

733
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,080
 I know it's going to come after me, it's so funny.

734
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,480
 I know it's going to come after me.

735
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,520
 Secondly, you don't know how to pronounce the words I use in my stuff.

736
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,120
 He put holes in this dude.

737
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,800
 "Handling the screwdriver like an ice pick, I savagely perforated" Perf- whatever.

738
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,920
 I savagely put holes in his face and the top of his head like Swiss cheese.

739
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,120
 His blood was red.

740
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:51,400
 I was not necessarily expecting that.

741
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:58,040
 That ending line there, that ending line there where he's like, I don't know, this guy I

742
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:04,800
 thought was a space alien is now bleeding very realistic, very red blood.

743
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:13,200
 Kind of makes me think that if there is an unsolved police murder in Nevada, you might

744
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,320
 want to check on this guy because he just pushes the body out of his car and drives away.

745
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,440
 He actually says as I'm pushing the body out is this guy's like, say goodbye, tell my

746
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,920
 boy if I love her.

747
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,960
 As he's pushing this dude who just got stabbed in the face and the head several times of

748
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,440
 the screwdriver falling onto the hot Nevada asphalt, he says I thought about getting out

749
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:41,200
 of the car and finishing him off and taking a trophy, but no, I will just leave a man

750
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:48,080
 stabbed in the head and face here on the road, on a very, very busy road and I will

751
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,320
 drive away and he does end up like this because you know this guy is super popular, right?

752
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
 This guy is so famous.

753
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,560
 He knows they're checking his website.

754
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,400
 He goes, if by chance the men in black, if that man in black in particular ever wants

755
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,200
 a rematch, you know where to find me.

756
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,280
 A trailer park somewhere in Idaho.

757
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,080
 Just look for the one, just look for the place that has the most kettle bells.

758
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,560
 That'll be me.

759
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,880
 Kevin Whiskey.

760
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,680
 This is so weird because again, he's either making it and if he's making it up, then he's

761
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,320
 either, there's even a substance to that.

762
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,240
 He's either a huckster or he has a mental illness.

763
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,120
 Like I think someone, I'm not saying he has a mental illness.

764
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,080
 I'm not trying to diagnose him.

765
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,360
 Future judge who's really not in this case.

766
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,480
 I think he's either making it up and he's a huckster and that's where I put a lot of

767
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,080
 these super soldier type characters, right?

768
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,360
 Because you know, it's a good way to make money, right?

769
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,840
 The super soldier thing.

770
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,640
 You just say a super soldier, you'll get donations, you'll get your own YouTube channel, all

771
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
 this stuff.

772
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,400
 Books, deals, conferences.

773
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,960
 I'm not jealous either.

774
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,320
 But that's a grift and the reason why I do get upset about it is that young men like

775
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:03,160
 Max Spears, I covered this on those episodes, but it was like episode 50 and 60 or whatever.

776
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,360
 Young men like Max Spears who are looking for something in life, looking for the place

777
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,080
 in life, fall for this stuff.

778
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,880
 And I don't know if Kevin is totally making it up to make money.

779
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,520
 I don't know if he's totally making it up to boost his ego.

780
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,040
 I don't know if he thinks it's real and it's some sort of hallucination or it turns out

781
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
 to be some dream puzzle.

782
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,600
 Because I've been going through his website.

783
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,200
 Trust me, we will be returning to this guy.

784
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,480
 He figured out the missing 411 mystery.

785
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,800
 He knows what's happening.

786
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,360
 So is it a grift?

787
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,760
 Is it him just making it up because it's fun, funny, right?

788
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
 The story's pretty funny.

789
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,320
 I get stabbed in the screwdriver.

790
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,520
 That I'm accepting of all those, right?

791
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,240
 If it's mental illness and he's hallucinating stuff, you know, I wish him the best.

792
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,280
 What my concern is, is that he's not making it up.

793
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,400
 And here's the thing, I don't believe that he's international paranormal.

794
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
 What was it?

795
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,000
 International pagan, strong man, right?

796
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,400
 He has all these feats.

797
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,920
 He's the first person to ever lift 80 pounds of kettlebell over his head or something like

798
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
 that.

799
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
 I don't know if that's real.

800
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,840
 I doubt he's the first person.

801
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,520
 But if he's experiencing real events, if he actually is driving on the road and stopping

802
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,920
 and starting the car and pulling off to the side and acting super weird, it's incredibly

803
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
 dangerous, right?

804
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,440
 I don't need to, you're like, "Really, what?

805
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
 Oh no, you're stopping the car right now to listen to podcasts.

806
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
 Oh, they don't, they don't.

807
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,160
 Cars are just flying by you."

808
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
 Super dangerous.

809
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
 That's concerning to me.

810
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,640
 Like if he's making it up, I was like, "Ah, it's a good grift."

811
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
 Whatever.

812
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,040
 Like if I had less scruples, I would do it.

813
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,200
 I would have totally said I was from Atlantis three years ago and all that stuff.

814
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,040
 But I don't like the grift.

815
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
 I like the fun.

816
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,280
 I like sharing stories with you guys that I find interesting.

817
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,280
 But if he actually thinks this is happening, and I do, it's funny because yeah, I actually

818
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,120
 believe that there is a group like Men in Black out there and they may actually call

819
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,120
 themselves the Men in Black.

820
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,440
 I do believe there's a group of government agents that harass UFO contactees.

821
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,480
 I think that's pretty common knowledge in UFO lore.

822
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,240
 And then some people say the Men in Black are from other planets or they're interdimensional.

823
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,120
 I'm actually open to all that stuff.

824
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:14,400
 But I don't believe is that this man lifted clubs so much that he became so muscular he

825
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
 can't close his fists.

826
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
 I don't believe that.

827
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,720
 I don't believe that at all.

828
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,560
 And so when you have a detail that's absolutely so ridiculous in the story to make you the

829
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,600
 strongest guy in the world and you're beating up a reptilian, everything comes suspected.

830
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,160
 So funny because the individual elements of it, I can kind of believe.

831
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
 Right?

832
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
 I believe that.

833
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,920
 I believe muscular people can drive cars.

834
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,040
 I believe that there are Men in Black and I believe some of them may be alien.

835
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,600
 There's no reason why I wouldn't think that.

836
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,240
 But I don't believe this story.

837
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,280
 So again, either he's making it up or I'm wrong and this actually happened.

838
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,680
 This is a historical event.

839
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,360
 Or he stabbed a dude in the face on I-5 with a screwdriver.

840
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,280
 Like he straight up assaulted this guy and then just drove away.

841
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,680
 Like the most likely scenario is this dude made it up.

842
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,440
 The second most likely scenario is he murdered a man.

843
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,120
 He took a screwdriver and dug it through the back of this dude's skull and then stuck

844
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,520
 him a few more times in the face and then pushed him out of the car.

845
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,320
 And what's creepy about it is it does line up to a police encounter, right?

846
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,020
 And I'm thinking why would the Men in Black have police lights on their car?

847
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:33,480
 So there is a scenario of this where he gets pulled over by an unmarked police car because

848
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,200
 he was driving it radically.

849
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,280
 The cop showed up and was like, "Hey, can I see your license registration?"

850
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,920
 Asking totally normal questions.

851
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,680
 And Kevin sees a monster in front of him.

852
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,240
 He's full on hallucinating.

853
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,520
 There's a monster standing in front of him talking in a really high pitched voice.

854
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,840
 "You're such a loser, Kevin and your mother doesn't love you and your dad was right about

855
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
 you.

856
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
 You should have been aborted."

857
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,960
 And he's like, "Ah!"

858
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,360
 And the officer is really just saying, "Hey, yeah, so can I get your license?

859
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,560
 I've been standing here for three minutes."

860
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,720
 And then a fight breaks out.

861
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,480
 The officer goes to pull the keys out of the car, which they very well can do, right?

862
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
 In that type of situation.

863
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
 They can't.

864
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
 They just pull you over and take your keys out.

865
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,680
 But I mean, if they think you're a flight risk, if they think you're dangerous, they're

866
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,240
 going to try to stop that car.

867
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,320
 And then someone, Kevin, dragged this officer into the car and began stabbing him in the

868
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,240
 head with a screwdriver and pushed him out of the car.

869
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,600
 That's the second most likely scenario with this story.

870
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,800
 First most likely scenario, he's a grifter.

871
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,920
 And grifters got a grift, right?

872
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,400
 But the second most likely scenario is that when I was randomly looking for funny and

873
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,560
 weird and spooky stories to share with you guys, I came across the man admitting to murdering

874
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,880
 someone on I-5 and just driving away.

875
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,480
 And I was just clicking around his website.

876
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,920
 This was the second article I found.

877
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,320
 The first one was how missing 4-1-1 happened.

878
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,320
 This was the second one.

879
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
 The third one was him beating up Max Spears.

880
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,840
 And I was like, I have no idea.

881
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,400
 I have no idea where this journey is going to take me.

882
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,760
 I could be a lark, right?

883
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,400
 I could be only halfway through it and it's super funny.

884
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,720
 And it turns out this guy's playing a joke on all of us.

885
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,120
 But if he is joking, he's gone to full extremes.

886
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,360
 He did buy dozens of clubs and kettlebells.

887
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,200
 So we may be looking-- I would love to look at more Kevin whiskey stuff.

888
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,320
 Again, he's probably going to find me.

889
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,280
 He'll probably challenge me to a kettlebell off.

890
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,640
 At best, he might actually try to murder me for all I know.

891
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,240
 He might come after me with a screwdriver.

892
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,440
 Yeah, absolutely insane story.

893
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,600
 Best case scenario, he's making this up for attention and for money.

894
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:51,240
 Worst case scenario, I just read you a confession of a man who got away with murder and is still

895
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,240
 out there.

896
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:59,320
 And if you're a resident of Idaho, be careful driving behind any trucks because it's possible

897
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:06,360
 you may actually be driving behind international pagan strongman Kevin whiskey.

898
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,440
 And he is a bad dude.

899
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:15,040
 Because you know what they always say, never get in a fist fight with a man who's so strong,

900
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,080
 he can't even make a fist.

901
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,440
