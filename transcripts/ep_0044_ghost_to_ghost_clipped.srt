00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Why ghosts are normally seen wearing white bedsheets

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,380
 Ghosts who aren't really ghosts and it's the government trying to control our pancreas today on Dead Rabbit Radio

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:22,880
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,680
 I hope you're having a great day, you know

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,320
 We're gonna dispense with a lot of the pleasantries the little introduction

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,360
 I normally do because we have a lot to cover and the first story is probably one of the most important

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,800
 That's the story that Art Bell has passed away now a lot of you may not know who Art Bell is but honestly

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
 I'm sure a lot of you do

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,680
 Art Bell was the host of Coast to Coast AM. It was a radio show and

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,240
 He was the host of it for quite a long time

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,660
 It basically was the precursor to every sort of paranormal talk show you could possibly think of including this one

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,880
 Art Bell

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,040
 was an inspiration to anyone who is a fan of the paranormal of conspiracies

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,120
 He had this great way of letting people say whatever they wanted. He didn't judge them

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,040
 He had a lot of great content. He produced over the decades that he ran the show

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,480
 Unfortunately, there was an event involving his child. I remember that

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,440
 He stopped doing the show and people thought oh, you know, it's

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,080
 Because of the government's trying to silence him. He's he's revealing all of these truths and it turned out

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,240
 It was much more mundane and far more evil his child was molested

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
 so he took some time off to be with his kid and

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,240
 He ended up stepping away from the show George Norrie took it over who I also feel is a great host

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,880
 I used to listen to coast to coast AM all the time all the time. It was really the best place

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,640
 It's you know, I think in a lot of ways it probably still is the best place to get that type of information

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,640
 It's just very conversational

25
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,400
 I used to what it was kind of my late-night routine a lot of truckers will listen to it people who work night shifts

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,240
 It's just a great show. It's just a really great casual show

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,800
 But unfortunately Art Bell has passed away now and of course there's already conspiracy theories about that

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,120
 He passed away. He had some painkillers and some muscle relaxants in his system that were legally prescribed to him

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,640
 He was in his 70s and people are already still saying that the government killed him

30
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,320
 I mean at a certain point you kind of have to accept that sometimes

31
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,160
 Great men pass away. So for those of you who aren't familiar with him

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,800
 I wanted to play a quick segment from one of his shows to set this up

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,120
 And this is a very famous segment to set this up a man called the radio station because it was an open call show

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,240
 So you'd get all sorts of crazy people on there a man called the radio station and

35
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,240
 Said that he was calling from area 51

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,280
 There's been statements where they said that they found the man who placed the call and he was faking it or they found

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,000
 The man who placed the call and he was off of his meds or whatever

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,600
 The phone call you just heard is I believe from like the 90s of the early 2000s

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,160
 So again enough time has passed but at the time I didn't hear that live

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:18,040
 But I knew of it at the time that was a very panicky moment for people in the paranormal conspiracy because it sounds so real

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,080
 Is it's more likely that it's from a crazy guy and it was a weird coincidence

42
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,400
 You know, but again, it's just kind of a terrifying call and a terrifying moment and an overall terrifying show

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,720
 So Art Bell, thank you for bringing us something new and opening up the

44
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,520
 The market of paranormal radio paranormal

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,360
 Podcast paranormal books. We appreciate everything you've done and we're gonna miss you

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,920
 Let's get started with the show

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
 So we have some great stories for you today

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,400
 Some really cool ones actually one of the ones I found when I was looking up

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,980
 Murderous ghosts, but I'm gonna save that one for a second because I'm gonna get into one that was on the conspiracy list iceberg

50
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,640
 It's another one of those weird ones that you just look at a couple words put together and you think oh, that's just made up

51
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,280
 You know before I do though, I'm gonna open this can of delicious diet Pepsi diet Pepsi the choice of a new generation

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,000
 We're still we still don't have any sponsors by the way

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,840
 So what this is is this is a theory called pancreas denial

54
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,200
 Pancreas denial a lot of people have questioned. What does that mean?

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:36,480
 What does it mean are people denying the bakery pancreas exists or is it something else now the course I?

56
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,440
 Found nothing initially when I started my research

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,800
 The only thing I had to go off of was again some posts on 4chan where people said that

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,920
 Wizards are trying to keep us from accessing the chakra in our pancreas

59
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,280
 So they're poisoning us with food to ruin the pancreas and eventually have to have it removed

60
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,520
 Now the pancreas is basically what keeps every human on the planet from having diabetes. It's a digestive organ

61
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,280
 Very important you can live without it, but you'll have diabetes

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,920
 So I looked into that and I was like, you know, okay magic

63
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,000
 That's my favorite topic and I kept looking around so I had to do a bunch of research on what the pancreas did and

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,280
 Like what I just told you could you live without it, but I didn't feel like I had the whole story

65
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,560
 I felt like there had to be something else

66
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,200
 So I kept looking and I kept digging into this now apparently yes

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,100
 The third chakra which is related to the basically the power of you

68
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,720
 The power of who you are as a person is

69
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,780
 Located in the pink pink real area. I guess there'd be a good way to put it

70
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,000
 So this pancreas is

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,800
 According to this website it controls feelings of power self-esteem and our relationship with our inner self

72
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,200
 So this chakra is basically what would balance us and make us feel good

73
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,800
 And it's located in that area

74
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,240
 So by basically infecting the food supply and the drink supply with toxins

75
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,320
 Whether that be like heavy toxins like lead things that can definitely affect us or just quote-unquote

76
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,720
 Poisons like high fructose corn syrup which definitely affects your pancreas and definitely affects issues with diabetes

77
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,880
 You're basically polluting that what it does is it breaks down your self-esteem

78
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,280
 It breaks down your connection to who you really are

79
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,720
 So you would be more likely to say follow a strong man leader or follow an authority figure because you don't have any self-esteem

80
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,800
 Yourself and I'm thinking there still has to be something else about this

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,000
 There still has to be another idea behind pancreas denial. I finally hit on something

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,160
 It found something a lot of times these stories get broke on these very obscure

83
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,880
 websites now I have I know that

84
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,640
 Sometimes coded messages will be sent on the internet sometimes if I want to send a message to somebody else in an organization

85
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,320
 I will write something out on

86
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,040
 Say a website for the babysitters club and you will then I'll tell you hey if you want to know where the drug shipment is

87
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,280
 Go to the babysitters club forum see the post about is Michael cheating on Becky and you'll find the instructions there

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,440
 It's very common technique. That's nothing new. It's a very common technique people to be able to communicate with each other

89
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,600
 so I found

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,440
 the term pancreas denial on a gay erotica

91
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:37,560
 Fanfiction about the band BTS now if you're not familiar with who BTS is they're the hottest boy band right now

92
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,580
 I don't know why but anyways, they're also known as the Bangtan boys at seven kids from South Korea

93
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:52,080
 The huge band so I found this I just saw this story that one of the all the store all the tags were like

94
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,860
 Boy on boy and BTS and all the stuff and then out of all of those one of the tags was

95
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,560
 Pancreas denial so I thought okay, maybe I'm onto something

96
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,320
 Maybe somewhere in this gay erotica about the Bangtan boys

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,040
 I will find the answer I've been looking for and I then went to proceeded to read a

98
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,560
 5,000 word

99
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,400
 Gay romance novel about the Bangtan boys. I don't know who these characters are

100
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,600
 I don't know anything about these guys, but now I know that they are all banging each other and

101
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,040
 I'm reading the story and you know it's a young author. Hey more power to you

102
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,440
 I'm not gonna criticize this the writing in of itself because I think it was written for a particular audience

103
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,000
 I'm not a member of that audience

104
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,840
 But anyways halfway through the story the guy says you know

105
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,080
 The the the hunky one the one with all the tattoos. I think he was a yungi yungi

106
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,520
 Do you know do you know these guys the main story was yungi and

107
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,400
 Jung cook

108
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,160
 Those are the two leads in the story anyways, so I'm reading this story and

109
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,160
 Yungi is like this motorcycle riding bad boy with tattoos all over his arms and

110
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,960
 Jung Kook is some sort of communist who keeps keeps going on the side like

111
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,760
 side diatribes about how

112
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,880
 Marx is a hero and capitalism has failed and the patriarchy is being destroyed and feminism is ruling the planet

113
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,040
 It's really bizarre to say the least and then halfway through it

114
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,840
 Yungi is like I'm gonna be a doctor

115
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,720
 I'm gonna study the pancreas and Jung Kook is like oh, okay

116
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,360
 That's that's cool and then later on in the story after they've been banging for like two months

117
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,680
 And they went to a Soviet film festival and he's like yungi's like oh, yeah, I love watching Soviet cinematography

118
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,200
 I don't I

119
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,800
 Anyways, so then at you yungi calls up junkook and says I

120
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,640
 Need to meet you. I have something to tell you and

121
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,720
 Junkook is like oh my god like I don't know how to deal with this like is he gonna break up with me

122
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,440
 Guys and I'm sparing you like two-thirds of the story

123
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
 I don't even know why I'm explaining this much of it

124
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,760
 But anyways, so I the first two-thirds of the story was them meeting and a bunch of like gay gay sex

125
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:20,280
 So so where was I oh, yeah, so yungi meets up with junkook and says I'm a member of a cult

126
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:26,340
 We believe and I'm like yes, here we go in this totally obscure story

127
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,800
 I'm finally going to get maybe a little bit more evidence of what is going on

128
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,220
 With pancreas denial it was in the tag it had to they have to talk about it

129
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,160
 Yungi yungi sitting there all steadily with his arm tattoos looks at

130
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,680
 junkook in his shiny eyes as it's described and says

131
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,640
 Yes, I am a doctor and I want to stay to the pancreas, but I'm a member of a cult

132
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,840
 We believe wizards

133
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,360
 We believe wizards are trying to poison the food supply and

134
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,680
 Make our pancreas is not work so they can control us. God damn it

135
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,120
 I read 5,000 words about a fanfiction about of a band that I know next to nothing about

136
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,240
 Spent all that time and they're like texting each other and all sorts of nonsense to get the same

137
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,820
 Stupid information. I got in 30 seconds from a reddit post

138
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:28,360
 But I still had to follow my lead I thought maybe this is some sort of coded communication

139
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,440
 I tried finding the author had a Twitter link the Twitter is not there anymore

140
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,320
 Which is a little odd the story was just written in July of 2018

141
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,520
 So it doesn't really pre-date any of the posts I've seen online about pancreas denial

142
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,840
 I was hoping once I saw that because I did finish the story they end up happily ever after I

143
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,200
 Don't want to you know a hobo shows up and says

144
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,840
 You know junkook. I know it scares you that he's in a cult

145
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,040
 But do you love him for who he is in junkook?

146
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,300
 Oh, you know what you know what hobo I do so they end up together

147
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,320
 I didn't want to not tell you how it ends

148
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,760
 But the link will be provided if you want to read yourself and don't hurry like the author was doing

149
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,360
 She's having fun. So I don't think any of you guys would ever harass anyone like that. But yeah, I mean all of this stuff

150
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,080
 I hope when you're hearing this stuff, you're not like oh, we're gonna go after that. Yeah, it's just she's just a kid

151
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,040
 having fun, but and I know you guys are better than that the

152
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,400
 Thing was as I go. Okay. Well, maybe it is still some sort of code and information

153
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,960
 But it's not she writes a ton of this stuff is where she wrote a lot of it close together

154
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,320
 But I mean I was grass minutes draws at that point

155
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,200
 I think that the pancreas denial she had also read

156
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,680
 something like I had just a short phrase and

157
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,120
 Somehow built a story around it, which I guess is kind of the same thing I do but it was just such a weird aside

158
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,040
 So I was back really to square one

159
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,680
 I think if from a conspiracy standpoint the idea works that pancreas denial is the idea that

160
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,080
 the pancreas is one is a

161
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,160
 It's a major

162
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,080
 Chakra that can be that you can live without so you can't live without your brain chakra

163
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,120
 You can't live with or head chakra or whatever it is

164
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,760
 You can't live without the heart chakra

165
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,960
 But you can live without the pink that the chakra there

166
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,440
 And so if I was a wizard and I knew that if I was a wizard, oh my god, I can't believe

167
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,480
 If I was a wizard and I knew that the pancreas was important

168
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,480
 I knew people could live without it. I would poison the food supply like I make sense. I don't believe that that's happening

169
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,560
 I don't believe that wizards are actually doing that but from a conspiracy standpoint. I can see that I can see people

170
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,920
 believing that anyways, we're gonna go ahead and get on on the next story so

171
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,440
 The next story I found when I was looking up

172
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,800
 Murderous ghosts and I talked about that before I was trying to find stories about people who had been murdered by

173
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,400
 ghosts or supernatural creatures in general

174
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,400
 And I found one of the most compelling articles

175
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,960
 I've read in a long time and I remember when I finished it. I thought I'm so glad I'm doing this podcast

176
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:10,400
 Because just a month ago if I had found this article, I would have maybe read a first couple paragraphs and then

177
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,440
 Skipped it because my time, you know, my time was so important even though I did nothing with it

178
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,320
 But now that I'm kind of forced I guess compelled is a better thing to read these articles and find stories

179
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,760
 I've read it and I'm like this was a fascinating article. It covered a lot of amazing things

180
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,280
 So what happened the narrative hook is at the very beginning of this article and this is all true

181
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,080
 This is all historical is that a man killed a ghost. He's on trial for killing a ghost

182
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,080
 But it wasn't a ghost so this guy shot

183
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,800
 Like a laborer who was wearing all white walking down the street and a man jumped out of the alleyway and shot

184
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,720
 The laborer killed him because he shot him because he was a ghost

185
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,440
 So you're thinking well, why would a guy jump out and the story the article gets you hooked right from there

186
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,920
 You're like, why would it guy jump out and shoot at a ghost?

187
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,840
 So what happened was back in the 19th century in Britain? They had a major problem with ghosts

188
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,240
 What it was so back then if you were poor

189
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,960
 They wouldn't necessarily really wouldn't put you in a coffin. They'd bury you

190
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,040
 But you're poor they would wrap you up in the bed sheet that you died in if you died in bed

191
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,320
 Or they would just grab a bed sheet if you're dead somewhere else

192
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:26,120
 They tied the feet and the and the head and they throw you into the ground and bury you so most bodies

193
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:33,200
 Were covered in white sheets now that is why ghosts traditionally are just a white sheet

194
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,320
 I had never known that I and I had wondered that before why do ghosts appear in?

195
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,280
 Traditional media as just being a white sheet walking around so right away

196
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,760
 I'm like this article is fascinating

197
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,120
 but the problem they had in the 19th century was people dressing up as ghosts and

198
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,080
 Jumping out at people as a practical it started off as a practical joke

199
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,920
 Then people started putting a white sheet on and mugging other people give me your wallet

200
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,900
 Give me your pincers or whatever give me your shillings and it would scare people so badly because they actually thought these were

201
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:13,040
 Zombies they thought these were ghosts. They thought this was the dead popping up out of nowhere and attacking people and then

202
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,400
 People started wearing the sheets and raping women now

203
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,920
 I'm sure halfway through the rape they realized they wasn't a ghost

204
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,240
 But that's not the point the point is the initial attack would shock you because you honestly thought it was a ghost attacking

205
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,640
 What made it worse was that all around?

206
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,680
 Britain people would say there's a ghost in the area

207
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,280
 There's a ghost because you would see first it like I said it was a practical joke

208
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,880
 People would stand in the graveyard in a white sheet and freak people out

209
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,200
 And so when you were walking down a dark alley and a guy jumped out in a white sheet

210
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,360
 Your first inclination is going to be that's the living dead because you've already heard all the stories about that and

211
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,840
 It got to the point where so many women were being harassed by ghosts who people thought were ghosts

212
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,000
 That they began forming vigilante teams and they would walk through the cities

213
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,080
 Looking for ghosts. So there was that clown scare in America not too long ago

214
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,040
 This would be the equivalent of that but when we see people in clown outfits, we are like, oh

215
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,120
 They're just they're just ghosts. I mean, they're just people dressed up as clowns

216
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
 These people honestly thought these guys were ghosts

217
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,320
 So this one guy he wore all white because he was a labor that was the clothes that he wore and other people in town

218
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,920
 Were saying hey, you shouldn't be out at night. You kind of look like a ghost and he's like, I don't care

219
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,040
 What are they gonna do to me? I'm not a ghost. I'll beat him over the head with my billy club or whatever

220
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,000
 I have a hammer but one day he was walking on the street and his

221
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,160
 Who's I believe it was at his sister's house and she's like, please don't go out or at least change your clothes before you go home

222
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
 Because you look like a ghost and he's like whatever

223
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,960
 He's walking on the street another guy who was part of one of these vigilante groups looking for ghosts

224
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:55,000
 Saw a man in all white thought it was a ghost pulled the trigger and immediately realized that he was wrong

225
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
 Shot a man and killed him. He was arrested

226
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:04,080
 Charged and found guilty for killing a ghost for killing this man within 45 minutes

227
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,800
 He's convicted of manslaughter and this is how crazy things were back then with the trial system

228
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:15,000
 He gets tried for manslaughter. The three judges say no, that's not good enough. You can't split it down the middle

229
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,680
 he's either guilty of murder or he's totally innocent and

230
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,920
 You have to figure it out and then the jury goes

231
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:27,900
 Well, I guess he's guilty to murder then he was sentenced to hang at next Monday. None of this 10 20 year thing

232
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,120
 He was sentenced to hang next Monday now

233
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:37,840
 Luckily the King got involved and said, you know what? No, we're not going to have we're gonna delay his execution

234
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,100
 And then eventually this had just parole him like it was a tragic mistake

235
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,920
 It shouldn't happen in the first place and that kind of quelled down the fake ghost scare of that time because it just

236
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,120
 I mean nobody wanted to get shot and it was the same thing you've heard the legend

237
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:57,000
 You may have heard the legend of Spring Hill Jack who apparently was a supernatural creature who leapt around London and was harassing women

238
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,560
 Well, he was sexually assaulting women is what he was doing and so people used the paranormal

239
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,600
 to cover for their activities

240
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,280
 Dress up as a ghost

241
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,640
 Pinch a woman's butt dress up as a ghost, you know drag a woman into an alley

242
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,840
 Your Spring Hill Jack you're attacking women who's driving people insane

243
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,920
 Plus they have the superstitions that these things were real

244
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,080
 So I know you'd like to think well, we've advanced we've changed

245
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,800
 We've evolved but people still use this ploy and unfortunately it still works

246
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,840
 This just happened this year by the way

247
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,120
 So there is this young 15 year old girl who was super petrified of the paranormal of the occult of the supernatural

248
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,040
 She would never listen to this show. She would never watch X files anything like that. She's totally terrified of that

249
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:47,280
 She starts hearing noises in her house late at night and she's petrified

250
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,360
 She can't figure out what it is. She thinks the ghost is coming after her then one night a little note gets passed underneath your book door

251
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,920
 Gets up. She reads it. It has very clear instructions

252
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,940
 If you want me to stop haunting you have sex with Liam Clark

253
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:09,360
 No, I don't know if it actually said that but that was the intent because Liam Clark was a 35 year old neighbor

254
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,080
 or he wasn't a relative but he knew the family and

255
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,240
 She kept getting these notes saying if you want me to stop haunting you you have to have sex with Liam Clark

256
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,680
 And she didn't want to have sex with him. She's 15. He's 35

257
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,520
 But she wanted the haunting to stop so badly. So what does she do?

258
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,160
 She has sex with him and of course this happens in Britain too. Maybe it's a weird thing over there now

259
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
 Of course eventually he's arrested

260
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,960
 because she

261
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,280
 Tells somebody this guy who pretended to be a ghost is now in prison for 26 years

262
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,240
 He put this girl through psychological and physical torture

263
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,160
 Pretended to be a ghost preyed on her worst fears and really that is what they did back in the 17th 18th 19th century

264
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,840
 It was the same gimmick prey on their fears make them vulnerable

265
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,760
 Attack them. So maybe people societies don't change. I don't know. It's it was just kind of a weird

266
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:07,860
 Side note a weird kind of I don't want to say end cap to this story because I'm sure it's gonna continue on whenever someone can figure out

267
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,860
 Someone's weakness like this. They're gonna keep doing it

268
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:16,000
 Well, I guess that's kind of ending on a sad note, but you know not all of our stories are gonna be super happy

269
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,080
 Yeah, actually this episode was quite depressing, but I thought they're really interesting. Well the the bangtan boys was pretty funny

270
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,440
 That was worth it. That was the hot

271
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,380
