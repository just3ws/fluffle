1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
 Today we travel back to the iceberg to take a look at a classic conspiracy.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,600
 Did crocodile hunter Steve Irwin fake his death?

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,840
 The answer won't surprise you, but it's a little weird.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,280
 Then we travel to Tremecastan to look at a bizarre story that crosses the border between

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,360
 Poltergeist and UFO today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:32,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back!

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,240
 To another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
 day.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,320
 We got Veronica running co-host duties again today, Veronica the Haunted Doll.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,640
 I think she's gonna be here for the rest of the week.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,840
 And then let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Claire Gorman.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,200
 Claire, thank you so much for supporting the show.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
 I totally love it.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,400
 You're gonna be our captain this episode, our pilot, our driver, whatever vehicle we

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
 take you're in charge of.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,240
 If you can't support the Patreon, totally understand.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,640
 Just help get the word out about the show.

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,400
 That really helps out a lot as well.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,280
 I recently got a new review from Josh Ridge.

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,200
 Really really appreciate that.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,160
 And ChurchgoingMule finally got one of his friends to listen to the podcast.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,880
 The episode they first listened to was the disgusting episode about the person smoking

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,400
 meth and melting.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,520
 I've actually gotten a couple of people have emailed me and said, "That's the first episode

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,000
 I couldn't finish."

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,200
 A lot of you guys actually emailed me on that.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
 So job well done to myself, eh?

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,920
 That episode is pretty disgusting.

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,400
 But we're not gonna talk about disgusting stuff today.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,720
 We are going to have an investigation into an old timey conspiracy.

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,000
 So Claire, let's go ahead and toss you an ore for the Dead Rabbit rowboat.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,320
 And we're gonna row all the way from Oregon.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,280
 We're headed down to Australia.

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,640
 That's why you paid for the Patreon.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,600
 So you can work your upper body strength.

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 And we're going down.

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,240
 We go down to Australia.

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,880
 So the reason why we're here, we're walking around.

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,280
 We see a giant bronze statue of crocodile hunter Steve Irwin.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,600
 It's this giant statue of him.

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 He has a crocodile.

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
 He's like, "Get in headlock."

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Did he love...

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,240
 I never saw an episode of that show.

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
 I'm assuming...

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,080
 I'm assuming this show wasn't him.

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,800
 Like actually like fighting crocodiles.

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,320
 I think he just like jumped down and goes, "Crikey!

50
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
 There's a crocodile!"

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,200
 And there's like a photo of a crocodile.

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
 It's just a photo.

53
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,560
 He's not even live.

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,040
 He's holding up an 8x10.

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
 It was like a kid's show, right?

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,920
 Where he was like on Saturday mornings or something like that.

57
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,680
 I guess I could have done my research for it.

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 I remember it was popular.

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,000
 But maybe not a kid's show, but it was just like, "Look at a wallaby."

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,320
 And then there's just like a wallaby walking by.

61
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
 And he's like, "Crikey!"

62
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,160
 And it's just 22 minutes of him staring at the camera.

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,960
 I knew it was super popular, but he wasn't actually hunting and beating people up.

64
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,400
 Or animals.

65
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,160
 But we're looking at this bronze statue.

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,760
 He's not choking the alligator.

67
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
 He's giving it a hug.

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,080
 Steve Irwin, if you don't know.

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,880
 Apparently, I don't know anything about him either.

70
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,600
 Super famous adventurer/zoo owner/conservant...

71
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,000
 What's those people who conserve stuff?

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Environmentalists.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Is that word?

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Because I know how to pronounce it.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Conservator/conservatory?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I don't know.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Anyways, he was a dude who liked the environment.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,240
 He was a dude who wasn't like blowing these animals away.

79
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,720
 He was like learning about them.

80
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,040
 I'm probably going to research that.

81
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,820
 But anyways, we're going back to the iceberg because on the conspiracy theory iceberg,

82
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,920
 we have the listing.

83
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,600
 Steve Irwin faked his death.

84
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,120
 Now that is so common with celebrity deaths that they're faked.

85
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,000
 There's some interesting information to this one.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,120
 So what happened was back in 2006, September 4th, 2006, Steve Irwin was filming himself

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,880
 swimming in the water.

88
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,800
 And it makes it sound like he's in the backyard.

89
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,320
 He was in the middle of nowhere.

90
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,360
 He's in a wilderness expedition.

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,600
 He's swimming in the water and a stingray swims by him and then sticks him with the

92
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,920
 stinger right in the heart.

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,600
 I guess it hit him 20 times.

94
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,280
 I always thought that it just stabbed him and he's like, "Ugh."

95
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:38,280
 But no, apparently it just like, "Bababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababab

96
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,680
 Which doesn't exist.

97
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,440
 There were scientists saying, "A stingray attacks are so rare on humans.

98
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,680
 We'd like to analyze that footage."

99
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,280
 But yeah, maybe, but you might also just be some weirdo who wants to watch it.

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,520
 So the family never released the footage and I'm sure at this point they've destroyed

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
 it.

102
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
 Which is probably good.

103
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,680
 I mean it is basically a man getting killed.

104
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,120
 But because there was no footage of it, the rumors started and honestly if there was footage

105
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,080
 of it, the rumors would start because this usually happens with celebrity deaths.

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,280
 People started to think that he had faked his death.

107
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,800
 So that happened back in 2006.

108
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,160
 By December 17, 2007 we started to see conspiracy theories pop up.

109
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,120
 They may have been around before, but this was the earliest one I could find.

110
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,480
 The conspiracy theory at first was this.

111
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,920
 In December 17, 2007 this conspiracy theory pops up.

112
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,280
 And basically the conspiracy theory is that Steve Wenzu was facing financial hardships.

113
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
 He's like, "Ugh, I'll crikey, where are we going to spend all this money?"

114
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,600
 He's like, "I can feed the ostriches to the bear and that'll keep the bear alive for another

115
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
 week, but oh man I just don't know."

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,120
 He's looking at all these ledgers, he's looking at all these photos.

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,600
 He has the food chain posted up in his office and he's like, "I don't know.

118
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,200
 Can I feed the pandas to the panthers or will they just become buddies and then attack me?"

119
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,680
 I don't know and he's thinking, "Wait a second, there's an easier way to do this."

120
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,640
 Instead of all the money I'm getting from being a huge celebrity and leveraging my fame

121
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,400
 to get some loans or investors, I'm not going to do that.

122
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,160
 I will fake my death.

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,880
 I'll tell everyone I got killed by a stingray, tell everyone I recorded it, and then not

124
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
 release the video.

125
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,720
 That won't be suspicious at all.

126
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,760
 So he faked his death and then uses the insurance money to fix the zoo.

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,560
 So the ostriches are like, "Phew, that was close."

128
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,800
 But the pandas and the panthers are looking at each other from the different cages and

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,480
 they go, "Someday we will unite."

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,720
 "Someday we'll become the panpans.

131
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,920
 We will take over this land."

132
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,160
 But that was stopped that day.

133
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,120
 So that's conspiracy theory number one, that he faked his death to help pay for his zoo.

134
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,880
 February 2, 2009, I found a reference to this conspiracy theory, so a couple years later,

135
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,280
 that the zoo was doing fine.

136
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,680
 The zoo had no financial difficulties whatsoever.

137
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,160
 But Steve Irwin was getting sick and tired of the celebrity life.

138
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,040
 He's like, "Oh man, sure does suck getting paid to do what I love.

139
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
 That's horrible.

140
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,120
 Who wants to do that?

141
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,120
 I would much rather just be this crazy dude running around the outback wrestling alligators

142
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
 off camera.

143
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,320
 The American dream or the Australian dream."

144
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,960
 So he fakes his death and then disappears into the wilderness.

145
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,200
 To this day, some believe during a full moon you can still see Steve Irwin punching ostriches.

146
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,000
 But that doesn't really work either.

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,960
 That's not a super compelling conspiracy theory.

148
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,400
 Because it would require him to leave his family behind and everything like that.

149
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,280
 In 2018, so we have a pretty big time jump, and I think the reason why is because it

150
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,160
 was huge news at the time, obviously.

151
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,760
 He was a big celebrity at the time, but there's probably a good chunk of you guys who are

152
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,680
 like, "Who's Steve Irwin?"

153
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,840
 Or like me, I had a passing knowledge of him at the time.

154
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,680
 I knew of him more as a cultural icon.

155
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,240
 I never had watched the show.

156
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,960
 I couldn't tell you the theme song or anything like that.

157
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,480
 This is one of those celebrity deaths that just kind of disappears.

158
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,680
 It's not like Elvis Presley.

159
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,240
 He's definitely very important to the people who loved him, but as a cultural icon I think

160
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,160
 that the memory is faded.

161
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,160
 So in 2018, we see a Reddit thread on the Writers Prompt, and it's like they put forward

162
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,200
 the - it's not even a conspiracy theory, but because it was a Writers Prompt, trying to

163
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,600
 get people to write stuff about this - Steve Irwin faked his own death to pursue his true

164
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,200
 passion, hunting cryptids.

165
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,600
 So that is - I think that one could have more staying power.

166
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,840
 Against Steve Irwin, I think that his cultural cache is kind of - or cultural cache.

167
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
 I think it's cache.

168
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,120
 Anyways, his cultural power has waned.

169
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,760
 That one actually - I could see people believing that one.

170
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,240
 If someone had put that one forth very early on, that might have worked.

171
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,040
 But the financial hardship would be an easy one to prove or disprove.

172
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,080
 And then again, he was a quite successful media personality.

173
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,520
 He wouldn't have a hard time getting investors or loans if his business wasn't running.

174
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,480
 But we have this Writers Prompt saying that.

175
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
 So why am I going through all of this stuff?

176
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,360
 We've talked about celebrity deaths before - Miley Cyrus, Avril Lavigne, Elvis Presley,

177
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,720
 I don't think we've ever talked about Elvis Presley in particular, but you've heard about

178
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,040
 fake celebrity death Michael Jackson, Tupac Shakur, who I did not believe was dead.

179
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,480
 For the first seven years I say he's faking it.

180
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
 I 100% believe Tupac was alive.

181
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
 It's like seven day theory.

182
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,840
 He's going to come back on seven years.

183
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,000
 He's totally not dead.

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,360
 I 100% believe Tupac was alive.

185
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,960
 So I get why people believe in these theories.

186
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,720
 Because you love these guys, right?

187
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,160
 Tupac was like, "Ugh, I love Tupac.

188
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,800
 I've made my peace with it now."

189
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 But for the first seven years, 365 times seven, that's how many days I did not believe Tupac

190
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 was dead.

191
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,160
 Honestly, not ironically, I honestly believed he faked his death.

192
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,600
 I get why these things last.

193
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,560
 I get why these conspiracy theories last.

194
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,920
 This is common, so why would I be talking about this?

195
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,640
 It's on the iceberg, so we like to cover stuff on the iceberg.

196
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,360
 Hats off to some weirdo on Twitter, aka Jack for putting together the iceberg Excel sheet.

197
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,520
 But there's an interesting little footnote to this story, and that's why I wanted to cover

198
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
 it.

199
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,200
 In 2015, Bindi Irwin, his daughter, was on Dancing with the Stars.

200
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,840
 So she's a minor.

201
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,520
 She was 17 years old at the time.

202
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,400
 And to be on Dancing with the Stars, well really to sign any contract, it's not just

203
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,480
 the US government law saying to be on Dancing with the Stars, you must have this.

204
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,320
 If you're a minor, you have to get permission from your parents.

205
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,000
 Her mother signed off on it.

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,880
 So at this point, Steve had been passed away for nine years, and it was again a very famous

207
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,520
 celebrity death, and it was all over the news.

208
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,360
 But when she gets the paperwork to get processed to be on Dancing with the Stars, the judge

209
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,240
 does not accept it.

210
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,480
 It doesn't accept it.

211
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,560
 Because the father's signature isn't on there.

212
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,080
 People are like, "What?

213
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,440
 You know who her dad is, right?

214
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,200
 Like he's been dead for nine years, this very, very famous celebrity death."

215
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
 This is how it was written.

216
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,240
 This was on TMZ, they were reporting this.

217
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,640
 This is how it was written.

218
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,840
 The judge said, without proof of Steve giving up his rights to Bindi's money, the court

219
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,040
 is unable to find that it is in the best interest of the minor to be bound by the terms of the

220
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
 contract.

221
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,240
 And then this quote continues, "It's unclear if the judge is unaware Steve died in 2006,

222
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,440
 or if she's just a stickler for a death certificate."

223
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
 That's a weird thing.

224
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
 It did get solved.

225
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,440
 She did get on to Dancing with the Stars, but it's kind of interesting to think that

226
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,560
 if this conspiracy theory was still alive in 2015, this would have been a huge thing.

227
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,360
 This would have been a massive thing.

228
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,320
 So the court is basically saying that there's no proof that Steve Irwin's that.

229
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,120
 It's interesting because it's not really what they're saying, but it's like the judge

230
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,080
 is saying I need to see proof that he's dead.

231
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,800
 We know that she got on Dancing with the Stars.

232
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 I don't know where she placed.

233
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,160
 That's another show I don't watch.

234
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,240
 But we know that she got on Dancing with the Stars, but it's interesting that that would

235
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,040
 be like asking for Michael Jackson's death certificate or Tupac's death certificate.

236
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,200
 It was a highly, highly publicized death.

237
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,880
 Unless this judge was Doogie Howser, like straight judging at the age of 16, she shouldn't

238
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,360
 have been aware of it.

239
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,480
 So if this was an active conspiracy theory, I think this really would have reignited it.

240
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,680
 Instead, it's really a footnote.

241
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,840
 And I just stumbled across it on my fourth quarter of researching this story.

242
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,960
 I was doing all this stuff, looking for these old links.

243
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,640
 How far back could I trace a conspiracy theory?

244
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,280
 And I came across that and I go, "That's interesting."

245
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,960
 So apparently she did show the judge a death certificate or it got solved in some way.

246
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,560
 But the fact that the judge was questioning it could mean that the judge doesn't own a

247
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,640
 television, never reads magazines, is Doogie Howser's age, or that they didn't believe

248
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,920
 that Steve Irwin was dead in the first place.

249
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,680
 An interesting little footnote to an otherwise fairly mundane and normal conspiracy theory.

250
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
 Celebrities dying.

251
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,920
 We never want to believe that they're dead.

252
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,480
 Maybe even a judge is wondering.

253
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,320
 And then as the judge gets the death certificate, she's like, "Okay."

254
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,440
 And signs off on the paperwork and then she walks into her office and someone in the court's

255
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
 like, "What?

256
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
 That's weird.

257
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
 Look."

258
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,400
 And they see underneath the judge's robe, so they see a little stingray tail.

259
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,960
 Spooky.

260
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:22,240
 It's supposed to--the implication is that the stingray was the judge.

261
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
 You guys got there.

262
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,600
 The judges said, "They're like, "Your Honor, why do you have to be in that tub?

263
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,840
 Why do you have to be in that giant tub of water?

264
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
 Need paperwork.

265
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
 It's just floating there."

266
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,960
 That's why judges' robes are so flowing so they can hide their stingray-esque bodies.

267
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
 But you didn't know that.

268
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,560
 I put that on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

269
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,880
 All judges are actually stingrays.

270
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,560
 Claire, let's go ahead and leave this courthouse before all the aquariums break.

271
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,880
 We get overrun.

272
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,680
 It's up to the PanPans to save us.

273
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,080
 Hopefully, the Panther-Panda Alliance can stop these stingrays from taking over the

274
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
 planet.

275
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,440
 We got more important stuff to do.

276
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,840
 We got more important stuff to do because I got to tell you another story.

277
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
 Let's go ahead.

278
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,960
 Claire, I want you to call in that carpenter copter.

279
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
 It's hovering over the main street.

280
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,080
 We're climbing up ropes real quick as this huge melee is breaking out.

281
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
 We are headed out to Termecastan.

282
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,280
 And while we're headed out to Termecastan--and I turn to you, I turn directly to you, and

283
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,400
 I'm looking right at you.

284
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
 Not you, Claire.

285
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,080
 Claire, just keep flying the helicopter.

286
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
 Keep flying the helicopter.

287
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
 Don't look at me.

288
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,200
 But everyone else, I'm looking at you.

289
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
 And I say, "New, today on Digital."

290
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,320
 Anne Haish and Thomas Jane star in the gripping psychological thriller, The Vanished.

291
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,560
 Directed by Peter Faccinelli, a family vacation takes a terrifying turn when two parents discover

292
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,320
 that their young daughter has vanished without a trace.

293
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,220
 Stopping at nothing to find her, the search for the truth leads to a shocking revelation

294
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,520
 where nothing is what it seems in this intense thriller.

295
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,240
 Don't or rent The Vanished on Digital today and watch it at home tonight.

296
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,040
 Rated R from Paramount Pictures.

297
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,600
 We're flying away from the courthouse.

298
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,360
 We are headed out to Termecastan.

299
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,600
 We're going back to the year 2009.

300
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,240
 We see a house.

301
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,120
 We're going to land by it.

302
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,080
 We're specifically headed to a town called Mary in Termecastan.

303
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,640
 At this point, it is part of the Soviet Union.

304
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,880
 It's part of the USSR.

305
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,720
 And we are flying that helicopter nice and low so we don't get the attention of any

306
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,240
 service to air missiles.

307
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,760
 Claire, I really hope you know how to fly this thing.

308
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
 She's like, "I don't.

309
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
 Of course I don't.

310
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,800
 I'm not a helicopter pilot."

311
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,720
 But somehow she miraculously lands that helicopter.

312
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
 We are safe and sound.

313
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,360
 Thank you so much, Claire.

314
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,960
 There we're going to meet a woman named El Maslovskaya.

315
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,640
 She's 45 years old.

316
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,280
 She's at home with her family.

317
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,360
 Now we know about this story because she wrote a couple of letters to the newspaper.

318
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,160
 This story was eventually talked about in a book called The Other Life by Vladimir G.

319
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
 Azhaza.

320
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:10,640
 This is an interesting story because it crosses the line between close encounter and poltergeist.

321
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,280
 And I'm honestly surprised we don't see this more often.

322
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,040
 So this story really kind of stuck out to me.

323
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,320
 We're going to meet a woman named El Maslovskaya.

324
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,520
 We're going to call her Lori because I can pronounce that and it's easy to remember.

325
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,200
 So Lori, she's 45 years old and she's at home with her family.

326
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,760
 They're having a good old time.

327
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,640
 And then that's not worth talking about on Dead Red Radio.

328
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,840
 It's just a normal day.

329
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,800
 One night though, she's up by herself.

330
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,480
 She's walking through her lonely house.

331
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,560
 Everyone's asleep.

332
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,640
 She looks down the hallway and she sees a humanoid figure standing at the end of the

333
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
 hallway.

334
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,160
 It's just for a second, right?

335
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,880
 And you guys know that feeling.

336
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,360
 You guys may not have seen that, but when you look down that empty hallway, you imagine,

337
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,280
 what if I saw someone on the end of that hallway?

338
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:00,160
 She sees this figure at the end of her hallway and then *psst* disappears in a flash of light.

339
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,260
 Definitely terrifying experience, but two months passed so it just kind of gets lost in her

340
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,260
 brain.

341
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,960
 She's not really thinking about it.

342
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,160
 Two months passed, she begins to hear a voice in her head.

343
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,800
 "I want your daughter.

344
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
 I want your daughter."

345
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,480
 Obviously you'd think maybe I'm having some sort of intrusive thought.

346
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,640
 Maybe I'm going crazy.

347
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,760
 Why is something saying they want my daughter?

348
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,640
 The voice was specifically referring to Lori's three-year-old daughter.

349
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,680
 She doesn't really know how to process it.

350
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,040
 Obviously not.

351
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,600
 But things get even weirder when her children are just sitting there playing with their toys

352
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,520
 and they hear, "Mommy, did you?

353
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,400
 Did you beam something into my head?

354
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,520
 I hear a voice in my head.

355
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
 Mommy."

356
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,600
 Like, what did the voice say?

357
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,560
 The daughter looks up and goes, "Dad, it wanted me.

358
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,760
 That it wanted me."

359
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,160
 The children are hearing this voice in their head.

360
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,320
 So Lori now knows it's not that she's simply going crazy.

361
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,200
 The voice starts giving very specific commands and it's giving them to the mother, it's

362
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
 giving them to Lori and the daughters.

363
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,800
 Even though the messages seem to really be directed at the three-year-old daughter, the

364
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,600
 voices command the three-year-old daughter to wake up at midnight and walk into the middle

365
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,800
 of the street because the aliens would be there to take her home.

366
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,480
 Now the mother obviously isn't going to let this happen.

367
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,080
 She's telling her daughter, "You can't walk out on the street.

368
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,720
 It doesn't matter what the voices tell you.

369
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,800
 You can't walk out on the street."

370
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,360
 The aliens are telling them that they want to take her to their home planet called Solig

371
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,880
 and they're refusing to let the daughter walk out into the street.

372
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,120
 At that point, the voice gets irate and begins threatening the family.

373
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,360
 It specifically threatens, "If you don't give us your daughter, we're going to burn your

374
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,280
 apartment down with laser beams."

375
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,520
 So Lori packs up her kids, she goes to the neighbor's house and she's like, "Hey guys,

376
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,640
 I'm going to tell you why we're here.

377
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,520
 Just let us in your house because our house is super spooky right now.

378
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,280
 We're kind of afraid laser beams might be coming."

379
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
 They're like, "What?

380
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
 Can we just spend the night?"

381
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
 And they're like, "Yeah, sure."

382
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,400
 Lori and her kids stayed at the neighbors and while they're at the neighbor's house,

383
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,240
 "Let her out.

384
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,760
 Let your daughter walk outside.

385
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,880
 Do it.

386
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,380
 Do it."

387
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,320
 Lori and her kids are just looking at each other.

388
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
 The voices are still there.

389
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,640
 It's not location specific.

390
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
 At this point, they're like, "Well, if we're going to get blown up, the aliens are going

391
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
 to come and get us.

392
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,640
 We might as well come and get us at our own place.

393
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,040
 Obviously, if we go somewhere else, it's not going to change anything."

394
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,080
 So they do go back to their own house and they start to get what would normally be considered

395
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,400
 out of this alien contact would be considered poltergeist activity, electronic circuiting

396
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,040
 messed up, television's changing channels.

397
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,120
 They're smelling strange odors in different rooms.

398
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,240
 But then you get back into the, that's all very ghost-like.

399
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,920
 Then you get back into the alien level stuff.

400
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,720
 Their lampshades are burned.

401
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,160
 On the edges of them, they're burned.

402
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,720
 And the voices are saying, "That was our laser beam.

403
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,080
 We're burning your lampshades to send you a message."

404
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,840
 Which in that case, I'd be like, "That's going to take like 10 years to burn down in

405
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
 my apartment."

406
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,640
 If your laser beam can singe a lampshade, it's going to take a while for you to take

407
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,000
 down my apartment.

408
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,400
 They begin to be troubled constantly.

409
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,840
 24/7, they're having this issue.

410
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,880
 Lori said, "Even when they close their eyes, they could perfectly see images being transmitted

411
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,840
 into their brain."

412
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,960
 Now the voices in their head is no longer an alien voice.

413
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,080
 It can actually imitate the voice of the other people in the house.

414
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,480
 So Lori could be sitting there and she could hear her daughter's voice say, "Mommy, I want

415
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
 to go outside.

416
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,040
 Let me outside at midnight, mommy."

417
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,360
 So it's trying to trick everybody.

418
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,840
 She also noticed during this whole thing, her children actually started to regress mentally.

419
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,840
 Now, she had two daughters.

420
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,200
 She had a three-year-old and 11-year-old.

421
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,600
 I should have said that earlier.

422
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,920
 She didn't have like 50 kids with her.

423
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,800
 She had a three-year-old and 11-year-old.

424
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,600
 And she said her children started to act like babies.

425
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,800
 It was almost like they were mentally regressing during this whole time period, which honestly

426
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,040
 would make sense.

427
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,340
 One, people who go through trauma, especially children, a lot of times can regress mentally.

428
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,000
 But also, if something's trying to control their behavior, what's easier to control,

429
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,080
 an 11-year-old or a baby?

430
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,120
 Even a three-year-old versus a baby, like if you can reduce their mental capacity.

431
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,800
 And actually, now that I think about it, it's interesting she could probably view them

432
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,840
 and tell they were acting younger.

433
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,480
 But I wonder if someone outside the house, I wonder if Lori was acting younger as well.

434
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
 Who knows?

435
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,480
 Like she could have also been mentally regressing but not have noticed it.

436
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,440
 But she, it's her and her two daughters there and she's starting to notice this stuff.

437
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,920
 At one time, she's driving home and the 11-year-old's sitting there and she goes, "Mommy, mommy,

438
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,440
 they're offering to give us a lift."

439
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,160
 And she's like, "What are you talking about?

440
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,240
 They're just driving down the highway, you know?"

441
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,880
 "Mommy, mommy, they're gonna give us a shortcut home.

442
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
 What are you talking about?"

443
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,520
 And at that point, her 11-year-old daughter points up and there's a UFO, Haya in the sky,

444
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,160
 following them home.

445
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,480
 At this point, right, at this point, she's like, "Listen, my kids are becoming idiots.

446
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
 I might be too.

447
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
 I don't know.

448
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,360
 There's no one to tell me whether or not I'm acting super young."

449
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
 What in the world's going on here?

450
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,960
 She starts writing letters to the local newspaper saying, "I'm hearing voices.

451
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,360
 My whole family's hearing voices.

452
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,840
 People are threatening to blow us up with laser beams.

453
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,400
 We're being followed home by UFOs.

454
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
 Why are they following us home?

455
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
 They know where we live.

456
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
 They're constantly trying to abduct us."

457
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,760
 The newspaper actually seemed to take these letters very seriously because they interviewed

458
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
 a psychiatrist.

459
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,200
 They brought in a psychiatrist and they had him look at the letters and they go, "So what

460
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,600
 do you think if somebody is having these type of delusions?"

461
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,160
 And the psychiatrist goes, "Oh, that's easy answer.

462
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,720
 We locked the whole family up in a psych ward."

463
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
 All of them.

464
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
 The three-year-old?

465
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,240
 Yeah, especially the three-year-old.

466
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,320
 Let's put them all in a psych ward because they're all nuts.

467
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,760
 That's the ending of this story.

468
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,560
 It's interesting because this happened in 1990.

469
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,560
 It was reported in that book, "The Other Life" in 1998.

470
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,440
 So there's an eight-year time span.

471
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,400
 But the story ends with the psychiatrist saying we should lock them up.

472
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,680
 We've covered quite a few stories that have come out of the Soviet Union before the fall

473
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,520
 of the Berlin Wall.

474
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,800
 They don't usually end well.

475
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,000
 A lot of times the KGB shows up.

476
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,960
 The State Secret Police shows up at some point.

477
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,120
 We covered that one story.

478
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,280
 I believe we covered it where the guy saw UFO and people were like, "Don't tell anyone.

479
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,600
 Do not tell anyone you saw this because the KGB are going to show up."

480
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,920
 And then like 10 years later, the KGB showed up and they're like, "Hey, we heard 10 years

481
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,520
 ago you got abducted by a UFO."

482
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,960
 And he was a kid at the time.

483
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
 Now he's an adult.

484
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,480
 He's like, "I have no idea what you're talking about."

485
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,240
 And everyone in the village is like, "Okay, good move.

486
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,640
 Good move because they don't take kindly to these stories."

487
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,000
 We didn't really get UFO stories out of the Soviet Union until the fall of the Berlin

488
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Wall.

489
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,360
 So you have that.

490
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,120
 You have the chance that this story, this woman reported it in the media and then one

491
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,800
 day she got a knock on her door and it was KGB and they said, "Well, we'd like to interview

492
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 your family.

493
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,920
 We can offer you some treatment."

494
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,160
 And these people just disappeared.

495
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,800
 It's also possible, we can be a little optimistic, that nothing happened.

496
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,240
 The voices eventually went away.

497
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,440
 No laser beams were directed at this house.

498
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,520
 Everyone survived and the girls grew up and the mom moved on and all of that stuff.

499
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,560
 But there's always this conclusion.

500
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,840
 How long could you put up with that type of behavior?

501
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,520
 This is something that we look at when we talk about gang stalking.

502
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,320
 They're constantly being pushed to the edge to do something.

503
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,960
 That's their fear.

504
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,400
 But this is voices being beamed, not into only your head, but the heads of your family

505
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
 members.

506
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,560
 To the point that they're suffering psychological problems because of this.

507
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,280
 How long could you resist those commands?

508
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,280
 Your single mother taking care of two daughters and these voices are commanding you to let

509
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,640
 one of those daughters just walk out into the street and be taken away.

510
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
 A horrifying thought for any parent.

511
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,680
 But if there's no earthly remedy for that, even with your eyes closed, you're still

512
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,920
 being tormented.

513
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,480
 Your house is being destroyed.

514
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,760
 These voices are being beamed into your head.

515
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,720
 You find your family suffering mentally.

516
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:24,480
 How long could you resist before you sat there and started to weigh the pros and the cons?

517
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,480
 All they want is my three-year-old daughter.

518
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,920
 We've been suffering from this for months and it can end tonight at midnight if I just

519
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,000
 give them my three-year-old daughter.

520
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,280
 We obviously in a state of sanity would say, "Well, I would never make that deal.

521
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,080
 I would never ever make that deal.

522
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,280
 That's abhorrent."

523
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:54,920
 But after constant physical aggression, mental torture, and watching your children go through

524
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,880
 the same thing, would you still make that decision?

525
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,880
 Would you still say, "No, I'm going to hold on one more day and hope things are better."

526
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,160
 But when you wake up the next morning, the first thing you hear is, "We just want your

527
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,280
 daughter."

528
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,320
 How long could you put up with that level of mental intrusion?

529
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,800
 Hopefully Lori held on and the aliens moved to another victim.

530
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,920
 But we'll never know.

531
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,420
 The story simply ends.

532
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:33,400
 It could end with them still in a mental institution somewhere in Termeqistan, just lost in the

533
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,080
 system.

534
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,560
 It could end with them being a happy family who is able to overcome this alien threat.

535
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,600
 Or it could end with a mother and her one daughter still to this day trying to pick up

536
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,780
 the pieces from that alien assault.

537
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,840
 Still to this day trying to deal with the fact that one day the mother broke and she

538
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,920
 let the three-year-old daughter walk out into the street.

539
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,840
 And just when they hope that everything is over, just when they hope that everything

540
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:11,480
 is done, that 11-year-old daughter today, she would be in her 40s.

541
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,120
 She would be around her mother's age when this all happened.

542
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,840
 Maybe she spent those last few decades trying to forget her sister had ever even existed

543
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,720
 and made the pain less raw if she forgot that her sister existed.

544
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,720
 She moved on and had her own family and forgot about the horrors and that decision her mother

545
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,120
 made.

546
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,160
 But she is a mother herself now.

547
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:41,040
 And despite all attempts to forget, one day the memory is brought back when she hears a

548
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:52,480
 voice in her head asking for her child to be marched out into the street at midnight.

549
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,080
