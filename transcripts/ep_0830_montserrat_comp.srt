1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
 A man goes to take a bath and makes a terrifying discovery.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,420
 Then we travel to Spain to take a look at a series of UFO sightings that led a local

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,940
 bishop to uncover an ancient relic.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,180
 Is it possible that aliens have long explored this area and are they responsible for the

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:26,340
 dozens of missing people who have vanished in the mountains today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:37,700
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,580
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,020
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,380
 Hope you guys have a lot of fun this upcoming weekend.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,900
 I actually just woke up from nap.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,500
 I just woke up like 4 minutes ago.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,460
 So let's see if I can get my energy going because I've still got my sleepy time eyes

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,460
 on.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,900
 I've got the little hat, the pointy hat with the little ball on it.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,060
 Everyone else who's always sleepy, always a big lazy bum.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,620
 Let's welcome in our newest Patreon supporter, walking in right now, rubbing his eyes.

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,900
 Give it up for Soft Pink Aurora Borealis.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,540
 Wooo come on in.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,820
 Wake him up, wake him up.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,260
 You're clapping right in his ears.

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,060
 Borealis, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,460
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,380
 Just helps read the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,820
 Now Borealis, let's go ahead and start off by tossing you the keys to the dead rabbit

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,820
 dirgeable.

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,820
 It's our quietest vehicle.

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,780
 We'll take a nap on this trip as well.

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,500
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,900
 We are headed all the way out to Russia.

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,260
 Specifically, we're headed to Tyumen, Russia.

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,820
 Since 1997, Tyumen, Russia has had a pretty serious serial killer problem.

32
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,580
 I mean there's never not a serious serial killer problem.

33
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,700
 It's not like, "Oh this guy, he's an affable chap.

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,140
 He does murder a couple people."

35
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,820
 But I mean there's serial killers, right?

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,540
 There's guys like stabbing people in the back, "Ugh!"

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,340
 And like chopping them up and stuff like that.

38
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
 That's all bad.

39
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,660
 Again, I'm not saying that that's an okay serial killer.

40
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,900
 But the worst kind of serial killer is the one that kills children.

41
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,900
 I think we can all agree on that.

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,780
 I don't think that's a controversial statement.

43
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,100
 I'm not going to lose any subscribers for making a statement like that.

44
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,940
 And if I do, if I do, you're a sicko.

45
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,060
 This is the episode you stop listening to, you sicko.

46
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,860
 We know why.

47
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,540
 1997, someone's been kidnapping children and murdering them.

48
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,780
 At this point, up to about 2021, seven kids in total have been killed.

49
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,460
 And boys, girls, doesn't matter.

50
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,620
 Age range is between 8 to 16, so that's a pretty broad age range.

51
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,180
 But all of them have eye squints.

52
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,380
 So eye squints is where, I don't know if that's like a regional term.

53
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,700
 I have always heard of it called lazy eye, I guess.

54
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,860
 Maybe that's not politically correct.

55
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,980
 But where one eye looks, where they're looking and the other eye kind of looks off in a random

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,980
 direction.

57
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,140
 Eye squints.

58
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,940
 Someone has been kidnapping and killing children with eye squints.

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,940
 Right?

60
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,180
 That part alone.

61
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,500
 You're a weird motif for a serial killer, because you've got to get really close to a victim.

62
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,620
 Okay, now if you guys want to shut this off, because it might get grim.

63
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,340
 You're not a sicko if you don't listen to this part.

64
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,300
 Think about how close you'd have to get to a victim to figure that out.

65
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,860
 If you were just driving around town and you wanted to murder blonde women, right?

66
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,100
 You'd be like, "Oh, it's them right over there."

67
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,340
 But imagine if you wanted to murder blonde women who wore red bracelets on their left

68
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,340
 hand.

69
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
 You'd have to get out of your car.

70
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,340
 You'd have to do more work.

71
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,580
 You'd have to get out of your car and walk around and pretend you're a salesman and

72
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,980
 be like, "Hey, I sell juggling balls here."

73
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,420
 And you're throwing the balls at women.

74
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,420
 They're like, "Ah, ah."

75
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,420
 And as they're juggling them, you're like, "Ah-ha, I can see your left wrist."

76
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,420
 Eye squints and kids.

77
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,140
 You'd have to get super close to your victims to even pick them out.

78
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,420
 I wonder if this guy ever approached a kid and was like, "Oh, yeah, I'm totally going

79
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,420
 to murder this."

80
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,420
 Never mind.

81
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,420
 His eyes are normal.

82
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,420
 And then walked away.

83
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,420
 Weird.

84
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,700
 But anyways, that's not the weirdest part of the story.

85
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,740
 The city, literally that is not the weirdest part of the story.

86
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,260
 The city's on edge.

87
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,700
 What happened was, from 1997 to 2021, right, that's a long span.

88
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,860
 There's only seven kids that have been murdered, but one is too many.

89
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,420
 But you figure this guy's been in operation for, what, at this point, 24 years?

90
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:30,540
 2021, a young girl, Nastaya Merinova, eight years old, she goes missing.

91
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,460
 And they're like, "Okay, it has to be the same guy.

92
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,460
 She has the ice squint.

93
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,180
 It has to be the same lunatic who's doing this."

94
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,380
 And the police have been searching for this guy for 24 years.

95
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
 They never gave up.

96
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,580
 They're like, "Ah, he's the hide-and-go-seek champion.

97
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,580
 He's at home base.

98
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,580
 We can't get him."

99
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,940
 Putin sends in, he's tired of this stuff, right?

100
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,460
 Vladimir Putin sends in an old classmate of his, old college buddy of his.

101
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,700
 Lieutenant Colonel Vegenji Karnitsky, a.k.a. the maniac hunter.

102
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,500
 I don't know if that's a nickname he got in college or a nickname he got through his years

103
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,700
 and years of capturing maniacs, but that's his name.

104
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,140
 That's his official name now.

105
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,700
 His name is the maniac hunter.

106
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,300
 Vladimir Putin's like, "Hey, dude, go take care of this for me."

107
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,860
 He's like, "Yes, I'll do my job, Vladimir."

108
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,020
 So Vegenji goes out to avenge them.

109
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,940
 Maybe that's why his name is Avengy.

110
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,060
 Anyways, so he's walking around and he's trying to find this guy.

111
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,940
 Let's go back in time a couple weeks.

112
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,740
 Let's go back in time about seven or eight weeks.

113
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,940
 We're gonna meet a man named Vitaly Berezoni.

114
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:43,300
 He's 40 years old, father of two kids, but divorced, separated technically.

115
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,940
 Let's be specific here.

116
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,300
 Separated from his wife, father of two kids, he's living on his own.

117
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,700
 He used to be a member of Gru.

118
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,020
 Not Gru the Wanderer, not that fun chap with the sword.

119
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,020
 No.

120
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,180
 That was a joke that only three people got, but it was worth it.

121
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,500
 Gru is military intelligence.

122
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,620
 It's like a police unit.

123
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,780
 It's kind of like the CIA FBI kind of rolled into one.

124
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,180
 Kind of like a kinder, softer KGB.

125
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,940
 They only step on your testicles twice per interrogation, as opposed to the infinite

126
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,220
 amount of times that the KGB did it.

127
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,900
 But we have this man.

128
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,180
 We have Vitaly.

129
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,180
 Used to work with Gru.

130
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,860
 Got a job as a police sergeant.

131
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,100
 That didn't work out too well for him.

132
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,260
 And then he's working at a furniture factory.

133
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,740
 So he's currently working at the furniture making company and to add all of this to his

134
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,300
 illustrious resume, hardcore alcoholic.

135
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,860
 This man has a drinking problem.

136
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,300
 So at one point he's sitting in his apartment and he's coming to, oh man, what did I drink

137
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
 last night?

138
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,980
 He's actually trapped in vodka bottle.

139
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,220
 He's like, how did this happen?

140
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,820
 How did it get shrunk down?

141
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,820
 Oh well.

142
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,660
 So as he's sobering up, he's trying to figure out how to get out of the bottle.

143
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,780
 He goes, oh man, I need to take a bath.

144
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,580
 Like I obviously like smell.

145
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,700
 Oh, horrible.

146
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,740
 So he walks into his bathroom and in the bathtub is Nastia.

147
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,100
 Nastia, the girl who went missing.

148
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
 I know I pronounced her name differently.

149
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,540
 You're like, who's that, Jason?

150
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,380
 Just learn how to pronounce these people's names, please.

151
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,780
 The young girl, the last girl who went missing, she's in his bathtub dead.

152
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,820
 He's looking at the dead body of an eight year old girl and he sits down on the toilet

153
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,820
 and he's like, how drunk was I?

154
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,820
 As he's sitting there on his toilet, he's freaking out and he goes, I do not remember

155
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
 a chain of events.

156
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,260
 I don't remember how this girl got in my bathtub.

157
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:44,500
 I don't remember kidnapping this girl, but despite my alcohol soaked brain, I clearly

158
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,820
 remember killing this little girl.

159
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,060
 I remember that detail, but I don't remember how she got here.

160
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,260
 So he doesn't know what to do at this point.

161
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:00,020
 He has this dead girl in his bathtub and he's like, I'm not a murderer.

162
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,500
 I guess technically I am a murderer.

163
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,060
 I murdered her, but I'm not some crazy serial killer that's running around town.

164
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,060
 How do I get rid of this body?

165
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,820
 This is something that normal people don't have to deal with, how to dispose of a body.

166
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,100
 So he wraps her up in plastic.

167
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,020
 We've seen enough of that in like television shows and he stuffed her behind his washing

168
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:27,060
 machine and then he's like, okay, I guess now is the washing machine's going.

169
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,820
 She'll just kind of just evaporate.

170
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,020
 She'll just kind of disappear.

171
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,940
 Seven weeks go by and he has this body stuffed behind his washing machine and it starts to

172
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,460
 smell, not the washing machine, the body.

173
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,100
 He's like, oh, they've talked about this part in the movies.

174
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
 Now what do I do?

175
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,180
 I have to get rid of this smelly corpse.

176
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,820
 So obviously this is a big missing persons case.

177
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,700
 He knows the girl.

178
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,140
 He's seen photographs of her.

179
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,820
 He knows the cops are looking for her.

180
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,140
 He goes, I didn't kidnap her.

181
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,700
 I know they're going to arrest me for kidnapping and that's not true.

182
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,100
 I did murder her, but I didn't kidnap her and they're going to make me a victim of all

183
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
 these other crimes.

184
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,740
 I had nothing to do with.

185
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,020
 I just murdered this one girl.

186
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,380
 So he goes, oh, you know what I should do?

187
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,700
 I should dump the body in a location where I know they've already searched because no

188
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,380
 one will ever search there again.

189
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,380
 Done and done.

190
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,660
 So he does that.

191
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,100
 He puts her in a box, takes her out to a place that had already been searched and dumped her

192
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,660
 and just walked away.

193
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,060
 Now his plan would have worked.

194
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,740
 I think the first step of his plan, I think the first point was in murdering someone in

195
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
 the first place.

196
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,380
 But his plan might have worked in hiding the body.

197
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,500
 If they didn't just check the location again, of course people are going to constantly be

198
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 looking through this area.

199
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,140
 They don't check a place once ago.

200
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,100
 No girl and then never walk by there again.

201
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,420
 She's found.

202
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,820
 And the box that he put her in was from the company he works for.

203
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,580
 It was like the box for a chair or a couch or something like that.

204
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,900
 So the maniac, so this dude's at work at the furniture making factory and one day the maniac

205
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:18,460
 hunter shows up and you know from the name of his job there's a maniac nearby, right?

206
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,340
 He never goes to like a fro-yo store and is like, "Ah, my delicious vanilla blend."

207
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,780
 No, he's only there if he walks in here for a while, no matter how delicious the food

208
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,820
 is there, he's there to catch a maniac.

209
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,460
 So he walks into the furniture store and he starts saying, "Okay, one of you guys is a

210
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,460
 murderer.

211
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,540
 I'm a serial killer because she was buried in a box from this factory."

212
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,300
 And I was like, "Ah, so I'm going to take DNA from everyone.

213
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,540
 I'm going to take DNA right now.

214
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,180
 I'm going to scratch your face with my maniac hunting hands."

215
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,100
 And so basically they went through this factory and they said, "Can we get some of your DNA?"

216
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
 And the guy's like, "Yeah, sure.

217
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
 I didn't do it all."

218
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
 Go to the next side, "Yeah, sure.

219
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,600
 I didn't do it all."

220
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,100
 Well, they get to this idiot.

221
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,380
 They get to Vitaly and they go, "We want your DNA."

222
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,740
 And he goes, "I didn't do it, but I'm not going to give you my DNA."

223
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,020
 The maniac hunter just looked at him for a bit.

224
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
 "Okay.

225
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
 Okay.

226
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
 That's fair."

227
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
 And then he turns around.

228
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,500
 The maniac hunter turns around and goes, "That's the guy.

229
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 That's the guy."

230
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 And they just put him under constant surveillance.

231
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,540
 And they said that they got a sample of his carpet and was able to match it to some fibers

232
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
 on her body.

233
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,540
 I doubt they had a child.

234
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
 I doubt they had a search warrant for that.

235
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,300
 At that moment when he's probably like, "Oh no, I'm not going to do it."

236
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,300
 There was probably investigators racing back to his house before he got there and tore

237
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,780
 the place to pieces.

238
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:46,340
 So he gets arrested for it and he tells the cops, "Mr. Maniac Hunter, listen.

239
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,740
 I'm not a serial killer.

240
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,220
 I only murdered one girl and I didn't kidnap her.

241
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,860
 I don't remember anything.

242
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,820
 I do remember murdering her, but I don't remember kidnapping her.

243
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,980
 I don't remember stalking her and I definitely don't remember killing seven other kids.

244
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,140
 I'm not that dude.

245
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,540
 I'm not this maniac that you think I am.

246
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,980
 I only murdered one girl."

247
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,220
 As of now, he got arrested in August, 2021.

248
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,260
 As of now, he hasn't been sentenced.

249
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
 He hasn't been sentenced.

250
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,380
 That's such a weird defense to say, "Yeah, I murdered just this one girl, but I didn't

251
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,580
 murder the other seven and I don't remember kidnapping her, so you can't charge me with

252
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,180
 kidnapping, but I did murder the girl."

253
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,300
 That's such a weird defense and it's honestly kind of a creepy defense too.

254
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,700
 He needs to go to prison for murdering this one girl.

255
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,700
 What I find so interesting is I don't know, I'm not a juror, right?

256
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,860
 Luckily, because I would definitely not want to be the juror on this trial.

257
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,100
 I don't know if he committed the other murders.

258
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
 And here's why.

259
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,980
 A lot of the other kids who went missing, they never even found them.

260
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,420
 The cops are like, "She has to be dead."

261
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,360
 Like they never found these kids.

262
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,860
 This last one that he actually admits that he killed, he's an idiot.

263
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,140
 He puts her in a box.

264
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,740
 First off, he just wraps her in plastic and keeps it in his house.

265
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,220
 I said apartment earlier, sorry for that, but he keeps her in the house for seven weeks,

266
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,500
 wrapped in plastic and then he throws her in a box from his place of work and dumps

267
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,660
 it in the field with all sorts of fiber evidence on the body.

268
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
 That's an idiot.

269
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,980
 An idiot does that type of stuff.

270
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,720
 So I don't know honestly if he killed the other kids.

271
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
 I think the killer may still be out there.

272
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,400
 Now I would not let this guy go free for the murder he did commit, but I'm kind of based

273
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,360
 on the couple articles I read.

274
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,960
 I don't think he did all of them because he messed up the last one so badly.

275
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,520
 He made it so easy to catch him, you'd think they would have caught him like after the

276
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
 first two.

277
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,600
 You know what I mean?

278
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,260
 So the Taiyumen serial killer may still be out there.

279
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,500
 And just because we caught one maniac doesn't mean the maniac hunter's job is over.

280
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,020
 He should still be out there beating the streets, beating up punks in the face, pump, pump,

281
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,980
 pump, pump, pump, give me your DNA and finding the real killer.

282
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
 Although it could have been Vitaly.

283
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,220
 It could have been Vitaly, but who knows?

284
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,220
 Who knows?

285
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,660
 I am a conspiracy theorist so I always assume what is, is often not that thing.

286
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
 That sounded more eloquent in my head.

287
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,380
 Borealis, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Garment of Compteer.

288
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,500
 We're leaving behind Russia.

289
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,820
 We're headed all the way out to Spain.

290
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:27,820
 D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-

291
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:46,860
 I don't think we've talked about this website before.

292
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
 It's just weird stories.

293
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,220
 It's a lot of really obscure weird stories.

294
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,460
 It's dope.

295
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,700
 So I got this story from Bizarrengrotest.com.

296
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
 Check it out.

297
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,340
 I know from the name you think it's way worse, but we're going to Spain, specifically we're

298
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:07,420
 going to a mountain range near Barcelona, Spain, and we're going to Montserrat.

299
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,540
 We're going back to the year 1880s.

300
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,700
 So we got on like our big old heavy woolen robes and we're like walking.

301
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,660
 We're walking with a bunch of dudes through Spain.

302
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,820
 There's sheep everywhere.

303
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,320
 Bah, bah.

304
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,420
 And it's a Saturday night.

305
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,540
 We're just kind of sitting there and we're hanging out.

306
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,820
 And we see a light start floating down Montserrat.

307
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:34,460
 Dude, did you see that?

308
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,980
 That was pretty dope.

309
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,140
 I immediately get burned for being a witch by using the words dude and dope and they don't

310
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,220
 understand them.

311
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,660
 But the next week we're out there again.

312
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,340
 I came back to life because I really am a witch.

313
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,860
 The next Saturday night we're out in that same location.

314
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:58,580
 We look up at the mountains and we see another light kind of traveled down that same trail.

315
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,260
 This happens six Saturdays in a row.

316
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,660
 And again, this is 1880s.

317
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,460
 So there's really not a lot to do on a Saturday night.

318
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,300
 So the townspeople are like, oh dude, you know what's going to happen tonight?

319
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,260
 Oh yeah, dude, we're going to totally see the light come down the mountain.

320
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,980
 And it becomes such a spectacle.

321
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,220
 So many people are seeing this thing that eventually the bishop in the area is basically

322
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,740
 pestered into figuring out what it was.

323
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,740
 You figure it's some sort of divine light, right?

324
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,740
 We're 1880.

325
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,780
 They're not thinking UFOs are not thinking aliens.

326
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,860
 This has to be angelic at best.

327
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,980
 So the local bishop is like fine, I'll do it.

328
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,740
 So he gets a search party together.

329
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,500
 They know where the light starts and they know where the light stops.

330
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,900
 And they are figuring that where the light stops is probably the most important plus where

331
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,980
 it starts is way high up the mountain.

332
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,900
 The bishop's like, no, I'm not walking way up there.

333
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:56,100
 They go to where the light stops and in the mountain, there's a cave there.

334
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
 I'm like, what?

335
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,780
 This is totally dope.

336
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:08,300
 And they walk into this cave and at the end of the cave is a statue of the Virgin Mary.

337
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,060
 It's a little statue of the Virgin Mary and there's a little baby Jesus there as well

338
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,060
 or like toddler Jesus.

339
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,420
 It looks like he's four or something like that in the statue.

340
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,140
 The bishop's like, okay, okay, this just got real.

341
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,900
 There's obviously something behind this.

342
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,660
 This is known as the black Madonna, this statue, which is funny.

343
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,260
 You see photos of it everywhere and I was like, whoa, but it's like 38 inches tall,

344
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,740
 which isn't really that impressive.

345
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,980
 It's just like a tiny little statue.

346
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,580
 I thought it was like a life-size statue.

347
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,180
 You're like, Jason, Jason, it's a statue that was carved.

348
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,860
 We don't know who made it and aliens are showing us where it's at.

349
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
 You're not impressed by the size.

350
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,460
 I just thought it'd be bigger.

351
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,340
 Apparently, yeah, we don't know who made it.

352
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,940
 It's been dated back to the year 50 AD.

353
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,020
 So Jesus was crucified and then flew up to heaven when he was like 33.

354
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,460
 This would have to be one of the earliest relics of that date is real.

355
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,860
 If it was made in 50 AD, what is that like 17 years after Jesus was like, see you guys

356
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,420
 later.

357
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,780
 Some guys, some guys right then started making this statue.

358
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,940
 They believed that it was carved in Jerusalem and then brought here from the earliest days

359
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,740
 of the church and it would have had to be.

360
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:24,260
 It's known as the black Madonna because it's made out of like black stone, like polished

361
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,260
 stone or wood.

362
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,140
 It's made out of like, but the skin tone is black on the statue.

363
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,660
 And what's interesting and we see this a lot, the area, we don't know who put the statue

364
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,660
 there, right?

365
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,060
 It was lost for 830 years.

366
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,020
 No one knew what was there.

367
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,660
 And even before the time of Christ, the Romans built a temple to the goddess Venus here.

368
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,660
 So they're obviously like, didn't matter what religion you were, when you were passing through

369
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,420
 the area, you saw weird things on this mountain.

370
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,740
 So first it was a temple to Venus and then it was someone had hidden away this statue.

371
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,540
 And actually it's interesting, it probably wasn't hidden away.

372
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,700
 There probably were ceremonies in this cave, but all the people who knew about the cave

373
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
 had died.

374
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,540
 Whether they were purposely killed or just died off or met another end, we'll get to

375
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,780
 that in a second.

376
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,700
 You had it originally be a worship place for the Romans and now, nowadays it's a worship

377
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,380
 place for the Christians.

378
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,500
 And the place has such a reputation for high strangeness for weird things that during World

379
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,900
 War II, Heinrich Himmler, he's the founder of the Anurbe.

380
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:35,780
 Anurbe, it was a German think tank where they sat around and thought about ways to use

381
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,780
 black magic to destroy everyone else.

382
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:44,180
 They wore the group that you often see like Indiana Jones-esque adventures.

383
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,220
 You don't want to join because your face will melt, there's like a 90% chance you're

384
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,180
 going to get whipped in the nards by a archeologist.

385
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,780
 It's just not a good group to be a member of.

386
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,700
 The Anurbe, they are trying to find all the holy relics like the Sphere of Destiny, like

387
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,260
 the Holy Grail.

388
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,900
 They come to this mountain.

389
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,740
 Heinrich Himmler comes here and he's like, hey, I'm going to start digging around looking

390
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,020
 for this holy grail.

391
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,140
 And the monks of the mountain were like, no, oddly enough he left.

392
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,460
 I would have assumed he would have come back and with a bunch of troops and be like, get

393
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,700
 out of our way, monks and start digging stuff.

394
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,260
 But I guess at this point they had invaded the east and he's like, I could either spend

395
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,860
 a lot of time digging for something here, fighting monks every day, or I probably should

396
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,300
 go hang out near the eastern front where we're currently getting frozen to death.

397
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,780
 I have more pressing matters.

398
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,220
 And there's never really been any proof that the holy grail was there.

399
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,900
 So you have this religious icon.

400
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,300
 You have this place that seems to be charged with positive energy.

401
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,740
 But that's not even the weirdest stuff.

402
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,100
 Like that alone, it's a cool story, right?

403
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,580
 Tiny little statue, holy grail, Heinrich Himmler versus monks.

404
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,140
 That's all cool.

405
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,140
 But the UFO sightings are what really makes this place unique.

406
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,820
 And I'm not talking about lights in the sky.

407
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,700
 Although I was just talking about lights in the sky.

408
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:13,420
 These aliens, if these stories are true, this location is on par with the Bermuda Triangle.

409
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,740
 Like it should be one of the most well-known paranormal spots in the Lord.

410
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,200
 This is absolutely nuts what we're about to talk about.

411
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,140
 For ages, there are reports of people disappearing in this region.

412
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,620
 Now listen, whenever there's mountains, whenever there's beauty, there's always danger as

413
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
 well.

414
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,380
 People go hiking, they'll leave the trail, they'll get lost.

415
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,980
 People hiking will fall into a crevasse and die.

416
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,620
 Maybe we never find the body.

417
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,100
 Just because people go missing around wilderness areas doesn't necessarily mean paranormal.

418
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,780
 We see it all the time.

419
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,460
 So there's been a lot of missing people in this area, but we're going to take a look

420
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,620
 at some of the weirdest ones.

421
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,340
 In 1973, this woman, she's walking through the mountain range, she disappears.

422
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,340
 And later her decomposing body is found and when they find it, she's all like dried out

423
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,180
 skin, bones, but she still has pants on.

424
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:10,460
 And in her pocket, there was a note that said she was going there to meet the quote "Supreme

425
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,460
 Bean."

426
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,700
 And the local authority said this is suicide, right?

427
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,420
 She probably went up there, she's obviously having some sort of psychotic break, because

428
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,980
 there's no Supreme Bean up there.

429
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,540
 The cops' eyes are going side to side, they're like, "Oh no, did she find out the secret?"

430
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
 It's a suicide.

431
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,740
 She's going up there and she just poisoned herself or these are really bad cops in the

432
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,100
 area, they're like, "Ah!"

433
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,340
 Or she hung herself, whatever.

434
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,340
 We don't know, but we do think it was death by suicide.

435
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,300
 1980, there's a young girl, 18-year-old girl who's walking through the region.

436
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,900
 She's over by the Montsrott.

437
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,060
 And she disappears.

438
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,700
 Two days after she disappears, there's a huge search party for this girl.

439
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,260
 Two days after she disappears, she's found.

440
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,220
 And she's walking through the woods, she's completely disoriented and they're like, "Come

441
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,220
 here, we've been looking for you."

442
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
 And they're like, "Given her water and stuff like that, cookies."

443
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,220
 She's like, "Who?"

444
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,020
 As you go missing more often, chips ahoy!

445
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,900
 She starts talking, like when she's brought back to her family, she starts talking about

446
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,100
 UFOs all the time.

447
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,900
 She has a sudden interest in UFOs and aliens.

448
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,140
 And her family says she was never into that stuff.

449
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,060
 She was bullying those nerds in high school.

450
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,220
 She was never into UFOs or aliens and now when she's, that's all she's talking about

451
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,220
 when she gets home.

452
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,260
 She's like, "Oh, and the aliens are really cool."

453
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,460
 And then shortly after that, shortly after she is found in the woods, she's brought

454
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:41,420
 back home, she disappears again and has never been seen since.

455
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,620
 It's pretty common that every two to three years someone just vanishes.

456
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,300
 And again, it's a wilderness area.

457
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,340
 People are going to get lost.

458
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,740
 But we start looking at these other stories.

459
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:59,940
 And Amparo V. Lidane in 1985 kept telling their friend, "The mountain calls to me.

460
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,380
 The mountain says my name.

461
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,380
 I can hear it.

462
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,860
 I can hear it right now.

463
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,060
 I'm going to go.

464
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,060
 I'm going to go to that mountain."

465
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
 You'd be like, "No, no, no.

466
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,060
 Don't go to that mountain.

467
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,060
 Like, you're acting super weird.

468
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,460
 The mountain's not calling you.

469
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,260
 No, no, I swear that it is."

470
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:19,500
 And Amparo constantly was talking about how the mountain was calling to her and she would

471
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,660
 go on these long hikes through the mountain and she would say, "Sometimes when I'm up

472
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,220
 there, I would get sick.

473
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,900
 I would feel this sickness in my stomach."

474
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,300
 And it was telling me not to go any further, but I also knew I had to go further.

475
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,140
 But I'm too scared.

476
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,380
 So she would come back down and she would tell her friend, "I need to go back out to

477
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,380
 the mountain.

478
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,380
 It calls to me.

479
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,940
 I just hope I can deal with the sickness this time."

480
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,260
 One day she leaves to go up to the mountain, never seen again.

481
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,780
 She specifically was saying it was the crevices.

482
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:59,780
 It was the caves of the mountain whispering to her, drawing her nearer.

483
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,540
 But that sickness would overcome her.

484
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,140
 But did she fall down a crevasse?

485
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,620
 She get lost in a cave?

486
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,900
 Carlos Texador, December 16, 1990s, young man who ran away from home.

487
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,660
 And he has picked up.

488
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,740
 A car is driving through the region and they see him walking on the street and they pick

489
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,340
 him up and they ask him where he's going.

490
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,660
 He goes, "I'm going to Montserrat."

491
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,660
 And he said that he has to be there.

492
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,340
 There's going to be a decisive trial with God and the Devil at midnight and he has

493
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,260
 to be there for that trial.

494
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,420
 The people who picked him up, who might have actually been the police, honestly.

495
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,340
 I don't know if it was just a wandering car.

496
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
 It was actually the police that picked him up.

497
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,100
 But he has returned to his family and they're like, "Dude, this guy's talking about God

498
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,980
 and the Devil are going to meet up on the mountain at midnight.

499
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,620
 Like, what is going on?

500
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,940
 Just keep him away from that area."

501
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,380
 A bunch of people go missing there all the time.

502
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,020
 The very next day, his family is taking him to the doctor to get checked out because he's

503
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,860
 having these loony-tuned beliefs.

504
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,100
 He jumps out of the car and runs away.

505
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,980
 January 3, 1991, he's found at the bottom of a cliff on Montserrat.

506
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,420
 Again, natural dangers all over the place.

507
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:19,060
 When they do the autopsy, they say his time of death was the day he ran out of the car.

508
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:26,020
 That day, he got up to Montserrat and fell off that cliff.

509
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,780
 You go, "Jason, these are all tragic, right?

510
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,940
 These are all tragic deaths and it is in an area where UFOs used to be."

511
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,980
 Like, you're not really mentioning much UFOs right now.

512
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,740
 I forgot to mention that.

513
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,060
 There's also a lot of UFO sightings during all of this stuff as well.

514
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,180
 But sure, I mean, Jason, people are constantly, like, every summer.

515
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,660
 People are drowning in the lakes and the rivers and people are getting lost in the mountains

516
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
 during the winter.

517
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,580
 This is pretty common, unfortunately.

518
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,420
 The most recent one that's notable, this would have been in the 1990s as well.

519
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,100
 I don't have an exact date, but this guy goes missing.

520
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,620
 And everyone does a search party thing, right?

521
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,940
 I'm sure it is a really, really exciting job if you're a search party out here, but

522
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,260
 also probably draining because you're constantly doing it.

523
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,980
 This guy goes missing and they send a helicopter up to look for him.

524
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,900
 Spotlights shining down.

525
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,980
 "Hello?

526
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,500
 Is anyone down there?"

527
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,100
 People are going, "Yes, yes, they can't hear him."

528
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,980
 Over the loud helicopter, "There's no one down there.

529
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,420
 No one's yelling back to us."

530
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,220
 Helicopter keeps flying by.

531
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,620
 This helicopter's out searching for this dude.

532
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,900
 They find a different dude who hadn't been reported lost yet, but was lost.

533
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,340
 No one noticed that he was gone for the past couple of days.

534
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,060
 The helicopter, though, sees this guy frantically waving.

535
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,140
 So they go to him and he's like, "Yeah."

536
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,140
 They see him.

537
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,460
 They're like, "Oh, you're not the guy we're looking for.

538
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,460
 See you later, loser.

539
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,700
 Wait till someone reports you missing."

540
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
 No!

541
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,340
 They're talking to this guy and he's like, "Yeah, it totally sucks."

542
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,780
 First off, apparently I have no friends.

543
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,500
 No one will notice I'm missing, but I've been lost for like three days and I'm super

544
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,820
 sick to my stomach and I'm freaking out and freaking out, but luckily there is this girl

545
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,020
 I've been hooking up with.

546
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,780
 I've met this girl and this is so insane.

547
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,020
 I've met this girl in the mountains and we've been hooking up.

548
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,540
 So that was kind of nice.

549
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,060
 I mean, sure, I'm lost and I'm at least half to death, but at least if I'm dying, I'm

550
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,700
 trying, I'm still getting laid.

551
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,620
 The helicopter pilots are like, "What is totally weird, but anyways, let's get you on the helicopter.

552
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,580
 We'll fly you home."

553
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,860
 So they rescued this guy, but they also need to obviously now find the first guy who went

554
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,660
 missing and this woman who's probably missing too, right?

555
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,020
 This isn't a hookup spot.

556
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,500
 This isn't like a place where you just go to bang.

557
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,780
 She obviously has to be missing as well.

558
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,780
 So the search crews come in the area and never says if they found the first guy they were

559
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,140
 looking for, but they found the woman.

560
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:07,780
 In that same area, they found the corpse of a woman who had gone missing years earlier.

561
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,700
 So was he banging a ghost?

562
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,460
 Was he banging a zombie?

563
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,420
 Was he banging a corpse?

564
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,220
 Was it completely unrelated?

565
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,700
 Was he hallucinating a woman?

566
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,060
 Like, what was that?

567
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:31,060
 They never found another woman there, but nearby they found a dead lady who had also gone missing.

568
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,060
 That's super creepy.

569
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,540
 That is terrifying because you think like you finally get some warm comfort.

570
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,180
 You have no friends at home, no one to report you're missing, and you meet this chick in

571
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
 the middle of the woods.

572
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,420
 Then he's like sitting at home.

573
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,620
 He gets a call from the rescuers and they're like, "Hey, yeah, we found that woman."

574
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,620
 He's like, "Oh, right.

575
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,620
 Did you get her phone number?"

576
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,380
 And they're like, "Take her for the phone number to the local morgue."

577
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,860
 He's like, "Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude."

578
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,180
 They'd be like, "You might want to go get checked out."

579
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:02,260
 Both mentally and for any like necrophiliac STDs because to break it to you, the woman

580
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,100
 you've been having sex with for three nights is dead.

581
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
 Not afterwards.

582
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:12,500
 Before, before you were seeing with a corpse, dude.

583
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,020
 The last, this, that is just, that's just terrifying, right?

584
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,540
 I think that's everyone's worst nightmare.

585
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
 Accidentally having sex with a dead person.

586
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,700
 Actually, there's probably no one's worst nightmare until I said it out loud.

587
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
 People were like, "You know what?

588
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,020
 I never thought about that, but that definitely is my worst nightmare."

589
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,260
 Now I'm ranking that up there.

590
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,060
 Accidentally having sex with a dead body, but that's weird.

591
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:38,580
 Another weird thing, the UFOs are still commonly seen in the area, but you know how I kept

592
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,820
 saying, you know, people go missing in wilderness areas, people fall in crevasses and stuff

593
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,900
 like that?

594
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,300
 No one has gone missing in this area since 1998.

595
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:54,380
 According to all these, which I find, to me that seems like the most impossible thing

596
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,700
 about it.

597
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,660
 Like in the wilderness area, according to multiple, according to multiple reputable websites

598
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:07,140
 like bizarreandgrotesque.com, no one goes missing anymore.

599
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:13,060
 So it almost seems like whatever powered this region, whatever gave this region its mysterious

600
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,380
 draw, is gone.

601
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:21,620
 They're still UFO sightings, but this thing that was calling to people, making people

602
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:27,500
 jump out of moving vehicles and walk into caves because they're calling for them to

603
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,140
 feel the presence of a supreme being, that's gone.

604
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,100
 So what used to be there that isn't there anymore?

605
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,340
 Why did it get removed?

606
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,420
 We don't know the answer to that.

607
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,220
 We don't like so many great stories, right?

608
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,540
 We don't know the answer to a lot of paranormal stuff, but I find it chilling to think that

609
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,300
 this area was drawing people who were believers of religion.

610
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,700
 Even before the time of Christ, the Romans built their temple to Venus, and then you

611
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,680
 had this statue that was built by the Christians, and then you have these people just randomly

612
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:05,420
 walking through the area, feeling the call of the place and talking to the supreme being

613
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,380
 and talking about God and the devil, but what they're really headed towards is something

614
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:20,620
 alien, something cold and metallic and detached from human society, aliens.

615
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,660
 But I think it would be absolutely terrifying if you were a young person, a young man, young

616
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,380
 woman, and you felt yourself drawn to the mountains and you believed it was God talking

617
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,300
 to you that you were going to be one of the prophets.

618
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:40,380
 You were so close to the Creator Himself that despite what society tells you, despite what

619
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:46,500
 your loved ones tell you, despite what physics tell you, you will jump out of a moving car

620
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,300
 and run up to that mountain to meet God.

621
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,420
 Who doesn't want to be sitting at the right hand of their God, right?

622
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:07,020
 And you go up to that mountain and obviously if you went up that mountain and you tripped,

623
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,540
 you fell on a cave and died.

624
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,260
 I mean that would suck, but then you're dead, so then you're floating around in heaven and

625
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,020
 God's like, "I need to get here eventually, you clumsy oaf."

626
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,700
 But what if you're running up there and you see that bright light shining and you start

627
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,500
 running towards the light, you know who it is.

628
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,740
 That's the one true God and you're running towards that light and it gets brighter and

629
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,580
 your body fills up with joy, but there's a little bit of panic in there.

630
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,660
 Your stomach clenches just a little bit.

631
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,540
 But why are you scared?

632
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,540
 That's God.

633
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:51,020
 The next thing you know, you're stark naked, shivering in a stainless steel cell.

634
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,420
 No windows, no doors.

635
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:59,780
 It's so cold in here.

636
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,700
 You don't even know how much time passes before you find yourself in a new room strapped down

637
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,900
 to a table.

638
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,180
 These aren't angels.

639
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,420
 These aren't angels now.

640
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,660
 These aren't angels next to me.

641
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,740
 God.

642
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,220
 And where are you?

643
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:31,060
 You see these beans standing next to you, coldly analyzing your body, pricking your skin with

644
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:41,980
 needles, slicing your flesh with blades, calmly running their experiments.

645
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,380
 Your sobbing cries do not stop them.

646
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,900
 Your prayers do not stop them.

647
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:57,140
 You alternate between finding yourself in this cold cylinder and being placed somewhere

648
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,380
 else in this God-forsaken, literally God-forsaken facility.

649
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,500
 He's not here, but they are.

650
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,620
 They're everywhere you look.

651
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,380
 There's no hope of escape.

652
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,660
 There's not even hope of having hope.

653
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:21,300
 It's almost as if your prayers can't even pierce the alien materials that this facility

654
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,740
 is built out of.

655
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,940
 You lose track of time.

656
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,380
 You lose track of everything.

657
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:33,060
 The only thing you know is loneliness and pain as the aliens experiment on you over and

658
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,860
 over and over again.

659
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,340
 When they're finally done, when all of the experiments they've needed to run on you have

660
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,140
 been completed, they discard your body back onto earth.

661
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:51,340
 Get down deep into a chasm like a butcher throwing away useless bones.

662
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:57,820
 These people may have thought they were going to meet their creator on Montserrat that they

663
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,100
 were going to become one with the infinite power of the universe.

664
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:11,660
 Instead, they just became another one of many humans that have been experimented on by alien

665
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,380
 interlopers.

666
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,980
 They believed they were on the cusp of experiencing everlasting love.

667
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:32,500
 Instead they found themselves victims of cold-hearted alien torment.

668
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,940
