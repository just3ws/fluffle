1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 Is the movie The Conjuring Haunted? Yes, I'm still looking for a haunted movie.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,400
 And then we look at a book that was so mysterious.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,800
 A man asked an angel for a translation.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,400
 The book goes missing for 400 years.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,400
 And then things get really weird. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,040
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. I'm having a great day even though

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,160
 I just recorded this episode and then ended up being an hour long with two additional stories.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
 And I was like, there's no way I can edit this down.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,520
 Scraped it, moved a couple stories around. I like this version better even though I just

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,000
 started recording it because sometimes it's, sometimes I record an episode. It's almost like

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,400
 a rough draft. And as I'm recording it, I'm like, I'm just not feeling it. I'm not feeling this

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,680
 episode. I need to do it again. Now I got all my, I don't know, bees in my bonnet. What's the thing?

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,880
 Ducks in a row, ducks in a row. Now I have all my ducks in a row and I'm ready to go.

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,920
 This one will not be 56 minutes long either, by the way. I want to let you know I woke up this

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,680
 morning and guess what was laying on the ground next to my couch, aka where I sleep? Yep. My black

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,600
 boxers, they turned up now. Did my boxers disappear? Did a ghost steal my boxers and then return them

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,640
 because they heard my podcast? Or did I just not see them the other times that I was looking for

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,360
 them? Who knows? Completely valid. Obviously I probably just didn't find them. And you know,

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
 a couple people who listen to this podcast have been over to my apartment. I'm sure the past two

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,000
 days they've been yelling, just clean your apartment. You won't have to worry about your clothes

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,080
 disappearing if your apartment is clean. My response to that is you should come over and help me

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,120
 clean my apartment. It's a win-win. I get a clean apartment and you get the knowledge that all the

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,400
 clothes that I'm wearing are 100% clean because they're not missing it somewhere in my house.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,400
 Ghosts, if you stole my boxers, that was awfully mean of you, but also thank you for giving them

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,840
 back. If I had just misplaced them, ah, no harm no foul. Let's go ahead and get started on with

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,520
 the episode. So what we're going to talk about right now is I'm going to start off with the book

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:40,080
 of Soy Good. Book of Soy Good. There was two copies of this book. We're back, well let's go back in

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,160
 time to the 1500s. Now there was two known copies of the book of Soy Good and what it is, it is a

31
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,360
 magical text. What makes it interesting is that it is focused on the Christian Kabbalah. So you go,

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,440
 what's the Kabbalah? So what Kabbalahism is, it is a Jewish mystic practice. It's basically like

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,280
 magic. It would basically be religious magic. It's kind of a bastardization of what it is, but

34
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,240
 that's what it is. It's magic that comes from God, not from any sort of dark sources. I think you

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,600
 could argue that maybe Moses was practicing Kabbalahism when he threw a staff turn into a snake,

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,640
 and it's based on like the, what is it, the seraphot? That's like the nine orb tree thing. It kind of

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,720
 looks like the big, it looks like the nine realms from Thor. I mean that's probably the best comparison

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,400
 I can have it. Anyway, so you have the Jewish mysticism, which is Kabbalahism, and Christian

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,040
 thinkers and philosophers and particularly magicians wanted to have their own versions,

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,480
 so they created Christian Kabbalahism. So you took all of the Christian beliefs, then added in all of

41
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,840
 the old Jewish mysticism. It was the rage of Europe for a short time, but it really didn't catch on.

42
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,960
 Christians don't like magic in general, but anyway, so this book had, was full of Christian

43
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,880
 Kabbalistic imagery and spells. It had the names of angels, which you very rarely see.

44
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,160
 Generally we have books that are like the names of the demons, but this book contained the names of

45
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,480
 angels, so that made it very rare as far as the knowledge inside of that. It had something in

46
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,440
 it called the Book of Rays, and it allowed you to understand the evil forces of the universe.

47
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,480
 And then it went into things like about the humors, which is like blood, bile, mucus,

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,400
 something else, and then the four elements and stuff like that. So it was basically like this

49
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,080
 overall mystical magical text, and you're thinking, Jason, places were full of those things back in

50
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,840
 the 1500s, but there was something particular about this book, not just the names of the angels,

51
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:56,480
 which again made it rare, but the book ended with 36 tables of random letters, 36 tables,

52
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,800
 36, and each table had 36 rows and 36 columns, and it was just random letters,

53
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,600
 and no one could make heads or tails of it. They knew it was important, but they couldn't

54
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,320
 make heads or tails of it. No one knew who wrote the Book of Soyga, but it fell into the hands of

55
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,000
 John Dee, and he was the one who really, really made it famous. Now John Dee at the time, we're

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,280
 still in the 1500s, was a preeminent scientist and rational thinker of England. The Queen used him

57
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,320
 for a long time, and he was the one who proposed building a public library. He says, "You know,

58
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,720
 we have all these rich people who have all these private libraries. We should have a place where

59
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,280
 our libraries, where everyone kind of puts their books together for, I can borrow this one and

60
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,680
 people can borrow this one. It's for the public, it's for everybody." He was a main proponent of

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,280
 that. At the same time, he was really into magic. He was really into astrology. He was into scrying

62
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,160
 and mediums and things like that. He saw them as much as he was a scientist, like a mathematician

63
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,560
 and an astronomer. He felt like science and magic both had the same goal. It was to understand the

64
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,680
 workings of the universe. He comes across the Book of Soyga, and he becomes obsessed with it.

65
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,480
 He reads the book, and he's like, "Oh, that's pretty good. It's Page Turner. Has all these

66
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,240
 mystical thoughts in that? Names of the Angels? Things like that? Book of Rays? Always want to

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,840
 read that?" He's reading it, and then he gets to the end, and he goes, "What is going on here? The last

68
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,120
 36, there's just a bunch of tables. It's like, basically, I'm going to call them 36 pages, but

69
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,320
 basically the end of the book was just these tables, 36 pages of 36 columns, 36 rows." He's like,

70
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,760
 "What does this mean?" He begins to drive him mad in a way. So he hooks up with his buddy, who's a

71
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,200
 medium, and he goes, "Listen, I need to find out what these tables mean. Let's contact an Angel."

72
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:01,760
 So they contact the Angel Uriel. Now, everything I've told you before is fact. It's historical

73
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,480
 fact. Now we're going to get into the weird stuff, the beginning of the weird stuff, actually. He

74
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,680
 contacts Uriel, and Uriel appears. So if you're a skeptic, you're like, "That's lame, but anyways,

75
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,960
 let's accept this for a second." So Uriel appears to John Dee, and John Dee goes, "What's up with these

76
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:28,640
 last 36 pages?" And Uriel goes, "Those were given to Adam from God." What? Okay, that's cool, but I

77
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:36,720
 mean, what do these pages mean? Uriel goes, "The only person who knows what those pages mean

78
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:44,160
 is the Archangel Michael." And then John Dee goes, "You know, I heard a legend that if you are able

79
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,200
 to decipher the last 36 pages of this book, you only live for two and a half years. And Uriel

80
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:57,680
 responds, 'No, you'll live to be a hundred and some odd years.'" And he's like, "Oh, okay, great. That's

81
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,200
 great, but can you help me in Uriel's like, 'Peace!' And he leaves, right?" So John Dee really doesn't

82
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,640
 get the answer that he wants, which is what is in the pages. He doesn't get a little more information

83
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:15,200
 that God gave them to Adam, and that only Michael can translate them. Now, why he didn't then summon

84
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,640
 the Archangel Michael? I don't know. Maybe he didn't know the summoning spell for that, or maybe he

85
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,520
 tried. What we know happened after that factually is things did not go well for John Dee. He ended up

86
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,040
 running into some money trouble and had to sell parts of his library. He ended up leaving England

87
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,320
 for a while when he came back. Someone broke in and stole a bunch of his books. And he eventually

88
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:47,920
 passes away. But because of his reputation as such a deep thinker, people for 400 years tried to find

89
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,280
 this book. His name was linked to the book of Soegah, because like I said, he was obsessed with it.

90
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,400
 People knew he was researching it. People knew that he highly valued this book, and they knew there

91
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,840
 was only two copies. And at this time, there were no copies. Nobody could find them anywhere.

92
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,160
 They were gone. People thought they're in some private person's collection,

93
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,000
 or it was destroyed, or who knows. But the books didn't exist, and people looked all over. They

94
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,400
 would go to the British public library. It has a real name, but like the Royal Library. And they

95
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,600
 would look for, look under S for Soegah. They couldn't find it. They'd look under B for Book of

96
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,880
 Soegah. Couldn't find it. So they're like the government, they don't have a copy of this.

97
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,840
 The main library doesn't have a copy of this. It's gone for 400 years. No one sees it anywhere.

98
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,600
 In 1994, there was a researcher. She was looking into John Dee and, of course, the book of Soegah,

99
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,000
 because they were so closely connected. And imagine this. I keep saying like he's close

100
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,440
 connected. Imagine if, let's say, Stephen Hawking in his later years, his past 20 years,

101
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,040
 said he found a book that explained the secrets of the universe, and it's called "Alebaster,"

102
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,280
 and then he dies. People are going to try to find that book. And that's basically what John Dee

103
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,280
 was considering the book of Soegah. He was not just this weird mystic dude. He was an amazing

104
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:17,440
 scientific mind who also believed this wacky stuff. And then he just dies and the book goes missing.

105
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,000
 And so you had mystics looking for the book and you had, you know, philosophers looking for the

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,640
 book, historians looking for the book. No one could find it. In 1994, Deborah Harkness is a

107
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,480
 researcher who, again, is researching John Dee and the book of Soegah. She's going through his diary.

108
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,440
 In the Royal British Library. She's going through his diary. And she sees an entry

109
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:48,320
 where for whatever reason, he changed the title of the book from the book of Soegah,

110
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,200
 which is what everyone knew it as, to Alderia, and then officially changed the title of the book

111
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:03,120
 to "Alderia Civ Soegah Vocor." She's looking at it and she's like, "What? Oh, she go- no joke. She

112
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,520
 goes look in the section for A's in the historical manuscripts, sitting on the shelf, or maybe behind

113
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:16,320
 glass. I don't know. But she goes to the section where the A's, and there it is, filed away, "Alderia

114
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,400
 Civ Soegah Vocor." She takes the book. It's the book of Soegah. He had changed the name. And so when

115
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,880
 people had gotten it, it has moved around libraries and stuff like that. It had a different name on

116
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,120
 it. So when it finally did filter into the Royal British Library, I don't know if that's the official

117
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,160
 name, but it was there. So they have it. They found it and they're able to translate it. It was

118
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,320
 originally in Latin. Now it's in English and does have that information and the names of the angels,

119
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
 the book of Rays. It's all complete. But of course, what everyone is curious about, because all of

120
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,240
 that stuff, I mean, other than, you know, the angel names, most of it is pretty well known. The 36

121
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,560
 tables, the 36 pages. This is what people were looking at. So they're looking at it and they're

122
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,680
 like, "Yeah, it's just random letters. This doesn't make sense. Why is this even in here?"

123
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:09,360
 Okay, so now we're going to jump ahead to 2006, where we have another researcher named James A.

124
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:18,960
 Reads. Now James, Jimmy, I'll call him James, James is, loves breaking codes. He loves getting into

125
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,520
 these, his fingers dirty and looking into these mysteries. He had previously been working on the

126
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,880
 Voynich manuscript. What the Voynich manuscript is, it is a book. We don't know who wrote it. We

127
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,880
 don't know really when it was wrote. We don't know where it was written. It's written in an

128
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,960
 indecipherable language. It's a whole book. And there's drawings of weird herbs and animals in it.

129
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,400
 And people are like, "What is this?" Some people thought it was just gibberish. Other people think

130
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,480
 it's some crazy code. Most people have tried decoding it. All have failed. He was working on

131
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,680
 the Voynich manuscript and he goes, "You know what? I think I'm going to try something easy.

132
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,960
 Let me get a crack at the book of Soega. Let me look at those tables."

133
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:04,240
 Now luckily, nowadays, we have computers. This is amazing. He was able to take these random sets

134
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,360
 of letters and ran all these computations through them. He basically, it came down to,

135
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,280
 there was, between all 36 pages, there was 46,656 letters. 36 pages, 36 columns, 36 rows.

136
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:26,560
 And he was able to crack the code. So on the pages themselves, we just see the 36 columns,

137
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,080
 36 rows, and random letters. But each page had a purpose. The letters weren't random. They were

138
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:43,520
 each attached to a magic word. A magic word forward and backwards was the key. And he'd go,

139
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:50,080
 "Well, how do we know that?" Because when he was able to crack the code, he was able to link 24

140
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,440
 of the pages to the Zodiac. So each Zodiac sign had two pages. So if you put in, there were specific

141
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,960
 words that were used, magic words equated to those Zodiac signs. So Aries was Nisram. So you'd

142
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:12,800
 have one page that was just Nisram, Marsyn, Nisram, Marsyn, Nisram, Marsyn, all the way down the 36

143
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:20,400
 rows. And it matched up. And then you'd have another page for Aries, which was Marsyn, Nisum,

144
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,640
 Marsyn, Nisum. They matched. 24 pages for the Zodiac signs, seven for the planets that were

145
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:34,000
 known at that time, four for the elements, and one for something called the Magistrate or Magistate.

146
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,360
 The letters weren't random. They were able to be matched to known mystical words of that time.

147
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:52,320
 The question is why? The fact of that, you could create this code. 36 columns, 36 rows,

148
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,840
 36 pages. Numerology was very, very important in Kabbalistic theory. And so was names and languages,

149
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:09,920
 names particularly. 46,656 letters. A code created by hand without a computer

150
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:18,400
 that was unbreakable until we had a computer that appeared completely random until you found out

151
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:28,000
 the magical phrases that unlocked the code. Why? Who made it? This is where it gets weird.

152
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,160
 Let me give you a little precursor, though. If you've ever played Minecraft, there was the option

153
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,080
 for what is known as a seed. There's a little seed option. You type in a word, it will randomly

154
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,720
 generate an entire world based on the algorithm of that word. If I typed in or numbers, whatever,

155
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:57,680
 if I typed in 111, I will get one world. If I type in 112 or 111, I don't get a slight variation

156
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:06,320
 of the original world. I get an entirely new world. So keep that in mind. This is from the website,

157
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,400
 blog of wonders. The article is "Soyga, the book that kills." So this is the blog that puts this

158
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,720
 theory forth. And I think it's the closest thing that we have to understanding what the book of

159
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,520
 Soya, what those 36 tables are supposed to be. So I'm reading this article and they quote the

160
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,560
 Gospel of John where he says, "In the beginning was the word, the word was with God, and the word

161
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,720
 was a God." The book of Soya, this is the hypothesis here on this blog and it's quite amazing. The

162
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:45,840
 book of Soya, the 36 tables, they're universes, they're realities, they're futures, they're

163
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:54,800
 something blank. The 36 columns of 36 rows are blank until the word is entered in, until you

164
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,840
 give it the seed and then it generates and it would continue to generate infinitely.

165
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,840
 If you went more than 36 columns, if you repeated that magical word over and over again

166
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:15,520
 across a thousand columns, it's going to keep spreading. What we see in these tables in the

167
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:26,720
 book of Soya is a glimpse of these other worlds, of these other realities. A book of tables given to

168
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:36,320
 Adam, showing him not just the power of God's creation but the power of words, the power of

169
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,680
 language. Enter the word, you're given the code. The question is, who came up with the code?

170
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:54,400
 Was it to hide something or was it to reveal something? If we knew the code, we have the seed.

171
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:03,120
 I can put in Jason and it would say Jason, no such, Jason, no such, Jason, no such across 36

172
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,160
 columns or 36 rows. It would say Jason, no such, Jason, no such, Jason, no such across 36 rows and

173
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,600
 it will populate a random set of letters. But are the letters random? Do they show something else?

174
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,240
 Why create such an elaborate code if it was completely random? The only thing I can think

175
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,000
 of is to create the code is if you thought that it was revealing something or hiding something.

176
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,080
 And maybe it doesn't. Maybe the person who created the code was off their rocker and they were just

177
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,520
 smart enough to come up with this code. But if the code was completely random, how were we able

178
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,760
 to match it up to the astrological symbols, the four elements, the seven planets, and the magistrate?

179
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,720
 If it was completely random, we should have gotten no answers for it. There was a purpose to the code.

180
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:03,280
 Is it if you speak that magic word, if you view the universe through that magic word,

181
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,040
 through that seed, the page being blank is a blank reality. But when the word is spoke,

182
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:24,240
 as God spoke existence into reality, are you basically seeing realities and futures on these

183
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:32,160
 tables? Is there something mystical about this code? Is there something scientific about this code?

184
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:43,280
 Is it random? Did an angel tell a leading scientist that this book was giving from God to Adam?

185
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:51,760
 Who knows? I mean, obviously the logical answer is no. But even if you dismiss,

186
00:19:51,760 --> 00:20:00,240
 even if you dismiss the angel helping translate the book, even if you dismiss the creation story

187
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:08,000
 of Genesis, what we are left with is a mathematical code that really shouldn't have been possible to

188
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,800
 create over four or five hundred years ago. And to what end why it was created. If you spent

189
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:27,200
 enough time, you might have been able to do this, but who and why? But the bigger question is what

190
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:37,360
 does it mean? I can see why John D was obsessed over these tables. I get it. Because if you think,

191
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:45,280
 if he had a hint of the truth that if you had these mystical words, the table would quote

192
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,880
 unquote make sense, you still wouldn't know what it meant, but you would know why it existed.

193
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
 You would know why the letters were there in the first place in that order.

194
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:03,760
 This is blowing my mind, honestly, because I think about it on two levels. One, I think about it

195
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:12,320
 on the mystical level that are these basically visions of other worlds and other realities where

196
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,160
 that word was spoke. Instead of whatever word was spoke that created our universe,

197
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:28,080
 if instead of saying earth, they said Nisram. But then on a scientific level, the fact that

198
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,640
 somebody could create such an advanced code that wasn't random but appeared random, chaos theory,

199
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:44,480
 basically. Fascinating stuff. Fascinating stuff. But then again, do you break the code,

200
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:51,440
 do you die in two and a half years or do you live to be a hundred? There's just another weird mystery

201
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,680
 on this thing, Book of Soyga. I don't know, man. It's blowing my mind, honestly. It's blowing my mind.

202
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:10,880
 So, you know, I don't even know if I have time for another story.

203
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:20,960
 I think I'm going to save the haunted movie thing for tomorrow because I think this kind of is

204
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,720
 just going to exist in its own episode. You know what, yeah, we're going to call it here.

205
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,320
 Conjuring can wait. Haunted movie one can wait. We're going to go ahead and end it here because,

206
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,120
 again, this story is just blowing my mind. Who wrote it? When? Why? How?

207
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,280
 It's a mystic. The goal is a scientific. I don't know. Talking about the Conjuring being haunted

208
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,920
 film seems a little anticlimactic after that. So we're going to go ahead and end it here.

209
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,880
