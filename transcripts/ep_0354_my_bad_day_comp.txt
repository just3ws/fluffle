 My day sucked and I'm gonna tell you about some other sucky sucky days
 I've had and then because this is a show about the paranormal conspiracy and true crime
 I'm gonna tell you short story about a guy who gets abducted by aliens. We're gonna make it work today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. Yeah, I'm not having a good day
 You know what the thing is is I hope you're having a good day and I hate breaking openings
 I like to keep the openings the same. It's funny because as a listener of stuff of consuming stuff
 You have a routine and you want to hear the same thing all the time. That's why I've never changed the intro
 I've never tried. Oh, let's do something different like it's been the same since episode one. The only thing that's changed
 It hasn't been the same since episode one the format's been pretty much the same
 I've just kind of tweaked and I think we're at now, but I don't want to lie to you guys either
 Today sucked so today's episode. I actually didn't plan on doing it. It's 9 30 right now at night
 And I was like I'm not gonna release an episode not gonna release an episode and I thought
 99% of life is just showing up. So just show up. You did say you're gonna take some extra days off this season because your
 Vacation was kind of wacky, but just show up Jason even if it means you got to go a little off topic now
 Maybe at the end of this I'll have a better day. Maybe the end of this you'll have a better day
 Maybe your day suck you see the thing is just like my day and sorry this first part is gonna be kind of vloggy
 So if that's not what you're here for if your new listener, I apologize
 That's not what you're here for and you're an old listener. You're like Jason just tell a story about a ghost
 Fast-forward or listen to it at a high speed, but if you just want to hear about my bad
 Which I don't know if any of you do anyways, let's talk about it woke up. Did you jitsu and that one great?
 That one totally fine no jiu jitsu for next week though
 I had a doctor's appointment today that I'd planned the long time in advance. It snowed
 I couldn't make it my ride couldn't take me to the city that it's in I
 Ended up not going to work because of the
 Doctor's visit, but then I could go to work, but I left my glasses at home
 So I couldn't go to work and I broke my phone. I
 Was goofing off and I broke my phone now. I have two phones. I have two phones. You're like Jason
 It's not a bad day. That's not a bad day at all. You had the day off work and you didn't have to go to the doctor
 There was snow involved so that sucked and you have two phones
 I'm playing about breaking this one phone the phone that I broke I've had for like four years
 I have two phones because one I don't even have it activated. It's where I put all my music on and
 Then I have a phone so I never have to worry about listening too much music that my phone dies or talking to too many people that which never
 Happens, but you know, it's also I'm on the phone on the internet the other phone
 I'd use the listening music so it just sucked losing my phone and I just was having I came home
 And you're like, yeah Jason you have the damn work. He didn't have to go to work boo-hoo poor Jason
 I came home and I sat here and I just
 Was sad I was sad
 Didn't feel good
 So I thought now I'll tell you this right now the bad day experiences you'll probably find quite humorous to me though
 I was like I'm at home. My mom sent me a Christmas present. She sent me her Christmas
 Jason that's not the definition of a bad day. You're getting Christmas presents
 I admit the Christmas present had been sitting here for a while and I said I'm not having a good day
 I'm really sad. I'm going to open up my Christmas present. Maybe that will cheer me up now mom
 If you listen to all the episodes she doesn't she listens to one every so often if you're listening to this episode
 I totally love you and I totally love your gift
 But I do have to say that as I was already kind of sad
 I owe you guys really Jason. You're so ungrateful
 I opened up the present and I got a shirt, which is what I wanted. I got a sweater
 Which I actually have that exact same sweater. They step those sweater stain real
 Really easily you're like Jason you're super ungrateful. No, no, no, no, I love the sweater
 I won't get a stain on this one because I have the exact same sweater with a huge stain on it
 She buys me a pair of socks, which I asked for I said
 Can I get some nice warm socks because she sent them to me about two years ago? I lost them already
 She sends me socks, okay, and it's just one of those things
 You know when you're already having a bad day everything is is seems to be wrong
 She sends me there's these socks and I look at them and it's size
 13 to 15 socks
 Now again on a normal day if I had opened that up on Christmas Day
 I would have simply laughed but because my day was already just a series of
 Unfortunate incidents. I'm thinking just my mom know who her son is. I'm not Shaq
 Who has size 13 to 15 socks and so they're pretty comfy though
 So I'll give her that and then my mom and I feel really bad about this one actually my mom sent me two gift cards
 and
 Everyone else has no presents right now. They're like, I don't even have presents. He sends me two gift cards and
 It's $15 each one for Dairy Queen and one for Taco Bell and I would looked at him and I'm like
 But I'm on Keto too. I can't even spend these right now and I remember sitting back
 So I'm so ungrateful. I love you mom so much. I remember sitting remember it just happened today
 I sit back in my chair. I'm looking sitting back in the chair and I'm looking at these gift cards
 I'm thinking I can take a break off the keto. This is fine. Like this isn't like super
 This isn't a bad present. It just goes it's it would I'd have to stop doing my diet to eat these places
 But also it's snowing. So I can't even leave my house
 I can't even leave my house to walk the mile two miles to the restaurant to use these things today
 You know, you know, you don't have to you don't have to eat today
 But then I'm thinking well, this is my problem. I think if I'm gonna break my keto on day X
 I'm just gonna break it now. So if I know that I may have a birthday party coming up or a
 celebration Christmas party on Friday compelling podcasting. I know if I have a
 If I have a party on Friday and it's Wednesday, I'll just go well, I'm gonna break the keto on Friday
 I'll just break the keto now, which is stupid
 But that's what I do. So I get a gift card for
 Taco Bell gift card for Dairy Queen and then I order a I had a free Domino's Pizza
 If for because I ordered Domino's pizzas in the past. You're like, he's no new pieces
 You have to order before a corporation gives you a free pizza. So anyways, so I go I'm going to eventually
 But go to Taco Bell. So I'm just gonna eat pizza today
 I order a Domino's pizza and I just devour it and then I went and I hung out with the friend
 I went took a nap because I still feeling quite miserable
 I did end up going to hang out with a friend for the past couple hours and I came home
 And that made me feel better and then I came home and said I'll record this podcast
 So you're like Jason. Are you really gonna spend eight minutes telling us about how crappy your day is?
 Yes, actually, well no because I'm gonna spend more time and the reason why and we're done with that day
 The reason why I'm telling you these bad day stories is because maybe you're having a bad day today
 Maybe you're having a bad holiday. Maybe you're having a bad holiday. So I want you to hear some funny
 Stories miserable Jason stories that I think are quite humorous
 So let's see if I can get both of them in and maybe it'll cheer you up. Maybe it'll make your bad and don't worry
 I'll talk about aliens. I got an alien story at the end. Don't worry. Don't stop listening to it yet
 So that was my bad day today and again, you're sitting there thinking Jason that is not a bad
 You're not okay. So this was my bad day. I had jujitsu, which was totally fun. I got the day off work
 I didn't have to go to the doctor's office
 I ate a pizza
 And opened a Christmas present and I'm like oh my day suck here check this bad day story out
 So one day I was suit this probably about two or three years ago
 So I was 350 pounds at the time and I was super poor
 I had very very little to no money at this at the point of the story
 I had a zero money all I had was a
 Subway gift card that I think my brother gave me now
 I didn't subway on before I had enough money on the subway gift card for one sandwich
 It was like seven or eight bucks left on the card. No other money on me zero a lot of times people go on broke
 They have like a couple thousand and savings. They're like whoa. I'm not touching my savings like I mean
 I'm my checking accounts bro. No, I was flat broke. I didn't even have cans to recycle broke
 So I go to subway and I buy myself a footlong spicy Italian
 Which is what I ate back then and I have this big green jacket. I had this jacket
 I think I bought it like shortly after 9/11 so the jacket is like 18 years old
 It's this giant jacket with these giant pockets and it's just like just drapes over me
 It looks like the jacket the bad guy wore and blade to so that's always I always pretend
 I'm that dude. I don't remember his name, but I'm always hiding in the shadows
 Distending my jaw so I'm why that was a good movie actually the first one is the best to play through it was terrible
 But I am this is not a movie show. I'm walking. Oh, I saw the trailer for the new grudge movie that movies
 Terrifying we'll talk about that later, but you're like no Jason talk about the now. That's more on topic
 I'm walking from subway home and at this point I have like maybe 35 cents on my subway gift card
 No other money. This was my dinner
 This was the only food that I had available because I was broke and so I walk home
 It's about a mile and a half again two miles from the fast food restaurants to my house
 I walk home. I come into the apartment. I start taking my stuff off. I go
 I guess I should have said earlier
 I put my sandwich in the jacket pocket
 put the sandwich in my jacket pocket and walked and listened to my music on my old phone that's broken out
 Thanks, but the story reminds me that I'm well
 I get really attached to stuff like that because it's been on so many adventures with me. I'm walking down the street
 I have this sandwich in my pocket big foot long the its jacket giant jacket huge pockets
 You're like Jason. I don't think you have foot long pockets
 Well, the pocket had a hole in it
 So it went into the interior of the jacket
 So use basically like a normal hole like a pocket hole and then you could put your hand through the hole
 And then you could be inside the jacket
 So it's basically a jacket
 It's basically a jacket with a giant hole in the pocket into the interior of the jacket
 Does that make sense? You're all of you at one point said yes
 And then so I put the giant foot-long sandwich in the in my jacket and it kind of is sticking out
 It's sticking basically in my jacket. I remember one day actually got to tell this story too. I always put food in my pockets
 I remember once I had this big jacket on and I just bought like three bean burritos at
 Taco Bell I put them in my pocket put the whole bag in my pocket
 I'm walking on the street this young guys walking on the street. He's walking towards me. I'm walking towards him
 This is happening a couple years ago in Hood River - he's kind of like, you know, he's a tough guy, you know walking on the street
 And I'm walking I'm like a tough guy walking on the street. We're getting closer and closer. I'm sizing him up like
 Oh, you know, could I take him like what if he did this? Could I do this? You know what guys do and
 Well, he's getting closer and then I just bust out laughing I start laughing so hard because in my
 mental exercise of whether or not I could fight this guy and I imagined him
 Punching me doing a gut punch and just be free. I was just shooting out of my pocket
 It would be the most bizarre thing if you were in a fight and you just swung super hard and you felt just goo
 And just a bunch of just refried beans shot out of a dude
 Like oh no, he runs away. Anyways walking on the street with a subway sandwich. I get home
 I go to grab my subway sandwich. It's not in my pocket
 Now I'm thinking
 This is the only food I have in the world right now. I have no other food
 So I must have set it down. I must have like the first thing I did instinctually empty my pockets
 I'm looking around my apartment. Where's my subway sandwich? It's kind of hard to miss something that is a foot long
 But I'm looking around looking on the table. I keep patting down my jacket. Where's my sandwich? Where's my sandwich?
 And after about five minutes, I make the grim
 Not discovery I come to the grim conclusion that I must have dropped the sandwich somewhere again
 The only food that I had in existence at this point with no money to buy more and you're thinking Jason
 You could just gone a day without eating. Well sure good, but I
 Really wanted that sandwich
 And I go I got a backtrack and I'm thinking could I go to subway? This was my logic
 I'm gonna walk all the way to subway
 Because I obviously it's not before subway
 It's not moving on its own and maybe I'll get to subway and I'll explain the situation
 Hey, just bought the sandwich and I lost it
 Maybe they'll give me another one because I was a regular there, but I was really obviously I was depressed because I hadn't eaten that day
 I had no money to buy food
 I was really looking forward to the sandwich that I could get with the little money that I had and
 I
 Had lost it so I walk and I remember going out leaving my apartment
 I remember the sky being particularly gray that moment and I thought listen best case scenario is
 It's laying on the side best case scenario
 It's right there the worst case scenario is it fell out of my pocket while I was walking across the street
 It's much of cars have run over it and then there's no salvaging it. I
 Walked for a mile just scanning the ground
 Scanning the ground every time I'd be like oh there it is. It's just a balled-up newspaper
 I
 Walk a bit further. Oh there it is
 Just a watt. I didn't realize how dirty would river us until I was trying to find a foot long
 Wrapping because it was in like that sandwich bag when napkins wrapped around it. So I knew it would be long and white
 and walking I
 get about a mile out and
 I see a
 Subway napkin on the ground and I go aha. I'm closed
 I felt like basil the great mouse detective. I think his name was basil. I think basil is a
 Not a fruit. It's a spice
 And I go aha close. I can smell it. I can smell the pepper chainies from here
 There my sandwich was a couple feet away
 in the gutter
 Just sitting there now now it had fallen out of the back
 So the bag is just blown away at this point, but in the gutter
 There is a perfectly wrapped subway sandwich with a napkin still attached to it the other napkin had blown away and
 I remember thinking I'm very
 Very very grateful that it wasn't raining because the gutter was told and you're like Jason this story is not going
 Or I think it's going as I'm approaching my prize. I
 Remember thinking well, it wasn't raining the gutter is dry bone dry
 There's a couple leaves blown around the sandwich is perfectly wrapped
 It hasn't even been touched not even a squirrel had come over in the half hour this whole journey has taken I
 Felt like Frodo
 That doesn't make sense Frodo wasn't looking for something Frodo was trying to destroy something
 Technically Mount Doom was my stomach
 This sandwich was the ring and now I was ready to complete my task. What's funny is across the street. There was a house
 And I remember as I bent down to pick up the subway sandwich
 I imagine someone in that house was probably watching television flipping through channels and
 For some reason that had caught their eye
 There was something white just sitting in the gutter a foot long white object sitting in the gutter and they're like
 I don't know what that is not gonna worry about it. They're flipping the channel and then a short time later
 They see a 350 pound man walk up
 Stare down at the object in the gutter
 Now like what what I wonder what that was
 Guy reaches down picks it up
 Looks at it and at that point you recognize that it's a foot long sandwich in the gutter and
 Then you watch the three this 350 pound man
 Put it in his pocket
 And walk down the street dude that sandwich tasted delicious
 Because I had to work for that sandwich and I was grateful
 I was super super grateful that even though I had to go backtrack to get that sandwich
 I was able to eat that night. That was a bad day
 That actually was a pretty crummy day, but you're like Jason the poor you got the sandwich. Yeah
 Yeah, but I felt so miserable even having obviously like I've been poor most of my life like right now
 I'm actually doing pretty good for myself, but I've been there's been a most of my life
 I've been like do I eat today or do I drink a Coca-Cola?
 Like I've had long stretches of my life like that be and here's why I'm not very good with money
 Like even when I was making good money
 I made poor money choices now I make less money than I have in the past
 But I make much better money choices not perfect money choices
 But a big part of being poor is
 Making good money choices. It's not gonna solve all your problems
 Sometimes you are actually underemployed
 But for me now that I'm making better keto helps a lot actually because I've just buy meat and bulk
 Yeah, I make better money choices now. So I there's very it's not as likely that I'm completely out of money
 I was completely out of money a couple months ago, and that's why Chris K
 The founder of the Golden Rabbit Brigade. He's like he got a start a patreon and
 He gave me some money because I was talking about not having food or something like that
 That used to be a regular occurrence for me now. It's once in a blue moon
 I I will always appreciate Chris K reaching out to me like that. That was great
 But yeah, I would be like do I do I buy a dollar hamburger at Walmart today?
 Or do I buy a Coca-Cola a refreshing cocoa?
 It's been a lot of my life like that childhood and
 Adult life like that. It's only been recently that I've been more stable with my finances, but anyways
 That's why I just it was a reminder of just the abject poverty. I had placed myself in
 But anyways, so that was a bad story. I think I have enough time for one more
 You're like Jason. Do you have a sad story that actually involves you being sad at the end of it?
 If you get it we want to hear a story where you're completely miserable at the end but a funny story
 Well, here's another one. I remember this was Thanksgiving or the couple days before Thanksgiving
 I was absolutely miserable. The weather was garbage. This was a couple years ago
 The weather was absolutely garbage. I
 Was miserable. I was homesick. I don't get homesick often, but it does happen. I was homesick
 All my friends had moved away recently. I was very lonely. I wasn't happy with my life
 This was way before the podcast. This is probably I think might have already said this was like three or four years ago
 And like I did at this Thanksgiving
 I generally will do Thanksgiving by myself. I buy everything and I think this might have been actually the first time
 I was doing full Thanksgiving by myself. I think that's might have been why it was so miserable
 I wasn't going anyone's house wasn't
 Going to any like local relatives anything like that and I remember
 But I'm really bad at like putting stuff in shopping carts
 I'll shop just by putting stuff in my arms and then I'm like, oh, I need this I need this and eventually
 I'm just like carrying all this garbage through the store now. I'll tell you this
 it actually I
 You guys might call me wrong on this my female listeners might call me wrong on this
 But women seem to be impressed by you being strong enough to carry all that stuff
 So
 Men if you're looking for love go to Safeway and just grab bunch of stuff and walk through the aisles right now
 I just heard the sound of 500 female listeners shake their head. They're like, no you look like an idiot when you do that
 You just get a shot in the car
 But anyways, I remember I was like, okay
 I need mashed potatoes and I need stuffing and I need green beans and I need like these meat dishes like these turkey edible thingy
 Well, there it's all edible. But like these prepared turkey thing
 Loading all this stuff up and I go I
 Need gravy and I don't know how much gravy I need it. So I got three jars of gravy
 And I'm walking through the store and I'm like trying to hold all of this stuff
 I'm trying to hold a non-prepared Thanksgiving feast in my arms is what I'm attempting to do
 And I remember I'm walking through and I just was miserable. I wasn't having a good time
 Super just disappointed in life and in myself. I'm walking but I'm going to have Thanksgiving. So everything will be okay
 I'm walking and walking and then I hear
 And
 I turn around and what had happened was one of the jars of gravy
 slipped out from my arm and
 It made this
 Sound as it did it was like if someone was trying to grab a wet melon
 But made a glass and containing gravy and it smashed into the ground spreading brown gravy all over the middle of the Walmart aisle
 And I just stood there and I was like oh great
 Horrible and then I was like this is bad. So there's like junk chunks of glass in here
 I remember waving over one of the employees and I was like, hey, sorry about this
 I knocked this over or just fell out of my arms and the boys like I you know, whatever that's fine
 And I then I debated should I go buy another one I already have this too and I thought I don't know how much gravy
 I need for one - I need to put this stuff down
 I just can't go grab another jar of gravy start walking through the store drop that one too eventually
 There's just a dotted line of broken glass through the store, but I feel really bad for breaking it
 It was just another reminder of how crappy you life was going right now
 So I went I bought all my stuff I throw it in my backpack now
 I have a tendency because I wear big jackets to put stuff in my pockets just like the subway story
 Helps distribute the weight nowadays when I go shopping
 I'll buy like two or three six packs of dye root beer or dye Pepsi and some of it
 I'll put on my backpack and other ones I'll put in the pockets of my jacket or in the pockets of my pants
 So I can carry a lot of stuff just distributing it. I'm like a real-life death stranding character
 except without a little fetus attached to my chest the
 It's funny. I've never played that game, but I think about it all the time
 Especially when I'm walking in the snow how you have to keep your balance the I throw all my stuff in and I remember thinking this is again
 When I was 350 pounds, so I was like I'm gonna eat I'm gonna eat on the way home
 That's how you get to become 350 pounds because I was like I'm gonna cook this stuff
 I think the food was for tomorrow or the I don't think it was Thanksgiving Day
 It was this was the day before Thanksgiving. I was going to take this stuff home
 But I wanted to get Taco Bell
 To eat before I had to walk home because I was 350 pounds and that was a long walk
 I carried as much as I was so I go to and I also I felt like garbage and carbs was gonna help me feel better
 I go to Taco Bell and I'm just sitting there
 Eating my burritos all alone
 Sad not feeling good not feeling good about myself
 Not feeling good about life, but as I'm eating these carbs
 I'm on my phone like searching around on stuff on phone
 Just reading funny stuff, and I'm starting to feel better and certain feel better getting distracted
 Okay, this isn't gonna be so bad. I got a good meal in me now
 I think that also had a lot to do with my moods. It was a tendency to go
 I don't never eat in the morning
 I never eat in the morning and then I would be like noon and I would eat something then I would tend to over eat
 So I'd already be a little not feeling good from not eating in the morning
 And then I'd overeat and then I'd feel bad after that, but anyways I
 ate my Taco Bell
 Ready to go so I get all my stuff throw away my garbage at
 Taco Bell I go to put my jacket on and I have this tendency to kind of swing my jacket around this ultra
 Dramatically way put it on jacket same jacket from the subway story to green jacket with a big hole in the pocket
 And as I'm swinging the jacket on I hear a
 *gasp* a boop!
 And I remember just standing there with my back to what I knew was standing behind me
 I immediately knew I recognized that noise. I just heard it about 45 minutes earlier and I
 Understand physics. I realized that I had put the two cans of gravy two bottles of gravy in my jacket
 And when I swung it around dramatically one of them flew out of the jacket
 smashed onto the ground
 And I remember just kind of just kind of hanging my head
 Now there's nobody else in the Taco Bell except me and there's maybe two or three employees behind the counter
 And I turn around and I'm looking at a smashed jar and
 gray brown gravy just
 And I knew from the experience of Walmart when I was apologizing to the employee there when he was trying to clean it up
 How hard it is to clean up gravy
 Super hard. You can't really sweep it up. You can't mop it up
 You're kind of boned either way and I remember I picked up the glass immediately because I didn't want someone to walk in
 And then I walk up to the counter and said hey really sorry about this, but I accidentally dropped a jar of
 I accidentally dropped a jar of gravy over in the area there and
 The guy goes oh, that's fine. We'll take care of it
 I was like, oh, okay
 So then I go over there and I kind of finish putting stuff on it and this is it's gravy dude
 It is a danger. It's something that someone's going to slip on first off now
 Taco Bell smells like great
 You could the second you walk in or you're just in there. You just smell gravy
 And I'm looking and I'm just standing there and I stood there for probably about five minutes of the people behind
 People behind the counter weren't helping I walked back up. I go hey, can I like borrow a broom or some paper towels?
 I'll clean it up and they're like no no no we'll get it. It's totally fine because this is the thing as I was leaving the Taco Bell
 I go this this is the problem here
 I'm the only one in the Taco Bell
 Eventually someone else is going to walk into the Taco Bell and they are going to smell gravy which is going to be odd
 That's the one thing you don't that's really the one flavor. You don't expect to smell in a Taco Bell
 But then you're going to imagine this you walk in a Taco Bell in the middle of the day
 You look and on the floor in the middle of the floor is a brown ooze just sitting there
 In a place that sells no gravy
 It's never had gravy ever in a KFC. You wouldn't even bat an eye
 But you're at a Taco Bell you walk in there is a brown there's 16 ounces of brown ooze
 Just sitting on the floor in front of you. What would what would go through your head?
 Now I don't you could go. I would just assume somebody spilled gravy some idiot
 Brought gravy into a Taco Bell and then spilled it
 But I remember leaving and I thought that would be that would be so puzzling to me
 it'd be the same thing as if you walked into McDonald's and
 There was a chicken fried burrito or a quesadilla just sitting on the floor
 You'd be like what where did this come from and it's just sitting there the employees are completely ignoring it
 You would think that it was a Mandela effect now Taco Bell has always served gravy. What are you talking about? It's always been here I
 Walked home now to jars of gravy short completely miserable again felt like
 I just was not on a good path and I remember walking and I get to my apartment complex and right then I
 hear a hey, buddy and
 I look up and my buddy Jonas who had been in LA for probably about a year at this point
 He just walked up to my apartment knocked on the door to see if I was there and I wasn't obviously I was
 Contemplating my horrible existence walking on the street
 And he walked out and he goes hey, I was just at your apartment seeing if you're home
 I walked up to him. I just gave him the biggest hug and I'm like I'm so glad you're here today
 Because that was the day I needed some cheering up. So now we're sitting at a fireplace. I'm puffing on a big
 Pipe and you're like Jason
 Those are stories. Yes, they are all sad stories. They're kind of funny. They're kind. I think they're funny
 They're you're like oh, they're kind of funny
 But they all ended happily they all ended happily that's I've had worse days than you Jason and yes
 You have and obviously I've had worse days than the stories. I've told I could tell you miserable days
 Where I've lost loved ones or people made horrible decisions that affected their lives or ever I'm not gonna tell you those stories
 Puffing on my pipe because this isn't a competition. This isn't a competition the story
 There's point of this odd episode where recording isn't I have worse days than you
 It's that the point of the episode is one
 there's an episode being recorded tonight and two I
 Even when we have bad days
 We don't know how they're going to end. We don't know how they're going today
 I was really miserable, but it had a good ending the sandwich
 Subway sandwich story had a good ending the the gravy story in the end in the end
 Actually that one jar of gravy when I poured it it had three jars of gravy in it
 It was a Thanksgiving miracle. He may know was it was just one jar gravy, but it was enough
 It was enough for me. I don't know why I thought I needed three jars of gravy
 so
 You may be having a bad day. You may be having a bad weekend
 But you don't know how it's gonna end so keep going keep walking keep looking for that subway sandwich in the sewer
 Because things might work out. I think things always work out in the end. Sometimes it takes a long period of time
 But things still get done. I planned on not doing an episode today
 I 100% by the time 3 p.m. Rolled around I said nope not doing an episode. I am not doing an episode today
 I'm so crummy. I'm feeling so bad. I'm not doing an episode today
 Took a nap did everything to avoid doing it and here we are recording an episode and you're like yes
 You know quote air quotes episode. Let me tell you an alien story real quick
 You're like yes, you're settling in you're putting on your alien pajamas. You're like, all right. I fast forwarded fast all this stuff
 For this I found a website. It's specific the part of the I'm sure it does more than this
 But the website part that I saw was specifically alien encounters in the year
 1988 so I got some good ones
 Now this one takes place in Salzburg, Pennsylvania
 You're like ooh, this sounds awesome March 18th 1988
 This UFO comes down
 It's shaped like a V flying around
 Wait says on my notes. No sound was heard so
 There you go UFOs falling down so this guy
 We've got to make this quick because for a time you're like Jason. No, don't you dare make this quick
 You just spent all that time talking about eating food out of the sewer
 Technically was the gutter not the sewer but anyways, so this guy is traveling to his friend's house
 It doesn't say if he's walking skiing driving. It's from 1988. What do you expect this guy is going to his friend's house?
 The next thing you know is he's walking around in a grocery store. He's super disoriented. Oh, I don't know where I'm at
 I'm super hungry. It's basically me. He's basically me two years ago. He walks in the grocery store
 Disoriented he's hungry. He's thirsty and then he looks at his watch and he's like oh
 My god two hours have passed. I've just left for my friend's house. I know it
 But now I can't see anything
 Low blood sugar. He's eating food eating Twinkies. They're like sir sir. He didn't pay for that
 He's like a alien abduction get out of my way. He realizes two hours have passed now at first off
 He doesn't think that aliens are abducted. He does remember seeing
 Something fly over his car. So that kind of scared him then his car stalled
 But he's like it might have been connected to that
 It could have just been you know my watch broke and I'm just really really hungry
 I aren't eating all this food dropping gravy
 They're like sir. No, he's like, I don't know aliens are making me do this knocking gravy over
 Anyways, it's weird enough. He can't figure it out that he goes to a hypnotherapist and this is what he recalls
 He remembers his car stalling out in the middle of nowhere and then a fourth
 This is quite short honestly a four foot tall alien
 Wait, and he's not a gray because graze are normally short
 But it's his four foot tall alien with like a long head and pinchers
 Staffs have to have to have he walks up to the car. He walks up to the car. He's wearing clothes graze are always naked
 I've always heard that theory that you know the the idea that aliens are
 Demons that's a common theory, but the reason like reptilians will tend to wear clothes
 The reason why gray aliens don't wear clothes because they never were exposed to original sin
 It has to do with how humans ate the apple according to the Bible story humans ate the apple
 And then they realized they were shameful because they were naked and they started wearing clothes
 Other alien races wear clothes the reason why graze don't wear clothes is because they were never exposed to original sin
 I should actually do some more research on that. I think that'd be an interesting topic for show
 They're
 They're they're pure. They're pure beings
 They don't have shame in that sense that other species do but anyways
 I mean nudists there nudists you can say don't have shame, but it goes more deeper than that into the psyche
 So anyways this reptilian. He's wearing a purple robe purple bluish gray robe
 I don't know where I got purple from forget. I said purple bluish gray robe with a fringed bottom
 I gotta say this if a four foot tall alien with pinchers was coming at me. I'm not looking at the bottom of his robe
 I don't know where that deal to detail come from. It also had an insignia on its chest doesn't get a lot of detail
 This whole story doesn't have a lot of detail. This is where I thought was the most interesting and I honestly got a little too excited
 Because I misread it here's from this report
 The witness was then placed in a jar like object and then taken inside a large
 Cigar shaped craft so now I'm imagining like from a 1950s comic book a dude in a jar
 Like no, let me out
 It's like a cover of like a guy in a jar banging on it
 There's like an evil scientist or an alien standing over it pointing at it and it's like amazing tales 10 cents
 You can't tell me you didn't just picture that
 comic book cover in your head
 I was like dude a guy being placed in a what's a jar like object. Just say it's a jar. I guess there
 I guess a jar what he's in a jar of gravy. So now that's the cover. He's like whoa
 He's swimming in gravy. There's a scientist
 There's an evil guy pointing at a jar gravy and then in the background you see me running
 He's see me running towards the jar gravy to rescue him to knock it over. But anyways a jar
 I don't know what the difference is between a jar and jar like object, but anyways
 So this guy he realizes he's putting a big old jar and he's like pounding on the glass comic book covers going on and
 then
 I'm gonna read this sentence the way that it's written
 And then I'm gonna read it the way that I read it
 And he'll realize why I was more excited about doing this story
 So this is how it's written the next sentence and this is the last sentence actually of this description
 Inside the craft the witness was apparently examined by several similar beings
 So, you know, he's in a jar and then he sees a bunch of other four-foot aliens come up and tap on the glass selling
 Now when I read it originally I was like hot dog and story is gonna be amazing and I did a bunch of other research
 I couldn't find any more information about this encounter and what I just read you, but I was like this is amazing
 I'm super excited because this is what I thought that last sentence said inside the craft the witness apparently saw
 Several similar beans. So I was like, oh, there's other people in jars, dude
 So it's like he wakes up and he's in a jar and he looks there's like
 50 100 maybe a thousand jars of different alien species all banging on the side. That's so awesome, dude
 He's no I miss just misread it. He's just in a jar. There's aliens poking at it. I was like, damn it
 I was just reading it
 Actually before I started recording this episode that you know what that goes perfect with my bad day because I honestly thought I was
 Going to tell you a story about a guy trapped in a jar with a bunch of other aliens like these aliens were collecting species from around the
 Cosmos and they're all putting them in jars and then 10 minutes before I decided to record this episode. I
 Looked this story up. I read the last sentence and I went
 Still an interesting story. How many times do you hear about people being put in jars when they're still alive?
 But it would have been more interesting if there was a bunch of jars everywhere
 So that's the episode that's the episode I
