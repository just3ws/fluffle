 Seven years ago a man who claimed he was abducted by aliens
 Said that he knew the date that they would show themselves to all of humankind and that date was just passed into law
 by the United States Congress and then we take a look at the theory of
 Video games getting too smart for their own good. What happens when programmers are constantly crafting games?
 24/7 all around the world
 Is there a chance eventually one of them could become self-aware and make you their target today on Dead Rabbit Radio?
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover first off
 Let's bring in one of our supporters work give it up give it up to William Burdell's William Burdell's
 Walking in he's drinking milk. I'm running out of stuff for you guys to do as you guys entered Dead Rabbit Central
 He's drinking milk. Hopefully you're not lactose intolerant. William actually donated during my Thanksgiving live stream a very generous donation
 So I appreciate that you're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode. You can't support the show financially
 You know exactly what I'm gonna say. It's okay. Just help spread the word about the show that helps out tremendous
 And it's fan art Friday. So take a look at this awesome fan art from Twitter
 Twitter user named Slappy Sleepy Slappy Sleepy drew this I think actually I couldn't find this guy on Twitter
 But I haven't my know it's Slappy Sleepy made this so awesome. Thank you so much Slappy Sleepy William
 I'm gonna toss you a shovel in a bag of coal
 Let's hop in the carpenter caboose
 We're taking the train to our first story and our first story is actually something I touched on yesterday
 So chica chica chica chica chica chica train is moving across the countryside yesterday
 I told a story and I said I don't even know if it's true
 I don't even know if my recollection of it was true because I couldn't find it anywhere online
 Couldn't find any bookmarks for it
 It was about a man who I said was in Malaysia who built a box to hide underneath in a woman's restroom
 Well, I found it. I've actually found the story. So I wanted to go in a little more detail with this one
 It's fairly short William go ahead. I see you are see you're already going to Malaysia. No, no, no turn left
 We're headed to New York City. It was way off. I was just on the top of my head
 I thought it took place in Malaysia chica chica chica chica. We're headed to New York City
 It's February 13th 1992. It's one day before Valentine's Day. Everyone's looking for love
 But Joseph Cornetta
 31 year old resident of New York had something else in mind
 He built a coffin sized box and took it into a woman's restroom at a place that he worked
 He was the plumber so it kind of makes sense. That's a good cover story plumber's walking in the bathrooms
 I mean they normally don't disappear
 They normally don't walk in and then never walk out
 but he built this coffin sized box wrapped it in brown wrapping paper and would go into the women's right it was there all
 The time so now I have more information and kind of feel you and you're like Jason
 I don't want you to fill me in the story was gross yesterday
 He built this coffin sized box and it was there all the time and you have to step up on it to wash your hands
 Or to look in the mirror every so often
 He would go in when there is no one there and again that gets perfect cover as a plumber
 It's almost like his whole life led up to this scheme. He builds this coffin sized box
 He would go and he would hide in it and women would have to step on it to use the sink and he would look up their skirts
 the way that his scheme
 unraveled was that a woman saw a creepy guy go into the
 Woman's restroom and she she reported it. She goes. That's weird. She sees this guy go in he never comes out
 So she actually alerts security and a female security guard goes in there and she's looking around
 She's like that is weird because this woman just saw this guy come in a while ago and he's never come out
 It was a ghost to me who's a ghost plumber then she's like in the bathroom. She goes on might as well wash my hands
 so she steps up on the platform and
 She falls through it she falls on top of this guy now
 It's coffin size so she didn't like plummet like 10 feet, but she fell on top of this guy
 She jumps off of the platform and lifts it up apparently she she hulk
 Apparently a wooden coffin can't hold her and she can also just pick it up
 Yeah, and when she picked it up underneath it was Joseph Cornetta and he was charged with third-degree burglary
 That's weird. I get maybe they didn't have voyeurism laws back then New York
 They might not have them nowadays for all I know but that is a true story. I didn't dream it up
 I did find it in a book of wacky news and I put something in the show notes
 So you can look at it yourself if you're so inclined, but I wanted to go ahead and clear that one up William
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the dead rabbit durgible. We are headed out to I did not plan this story to fall on this date
 It was supposed to be on yesterday's episode supposed to come out yesterday
 We're touchy the keys of the dead rabbit durgible. We're headed to the United States Congress. This is not political
 This is nothing to do with what happened recently at all, but we do have to go to Congress for this story
 We're flying back to the United States Congress and after flying to the United States Congress
 We have a little meeting set up like a table. That's all it's a folding table and a couple of chairs in the dead rabbit durgible
 We're all sitting around it and I go okay guys. It's a bizarre story. That's going on
 I got an email from Scott and he turned me on to the story. So I tip a little hat to Scott
 I see him send to the table. Thank you very much for sending this my way
 What's happened is?
 Recently at the end of December Congress passed a 2.3 trillion dollar relief bill and in it this if you're not familiar with
 American politics or American lawmaking
 I don't know if other countries do this it's something that America does and every every stripe of the political divide
 It hates this part, but you can have a bill that's for
 Legislation a relief legislation, you know like helping businesses and things like that economy building and then you can just throw in a bill
 You can be like oh, I have this bill that I wrote last summer that I know won't pass otherwise
 So I'm gonna put it in this larger bill and you don't have time to read all 5,000 pages of the legislation
 You just go oh my constituents want me to take care of this so hopefully there's nothing
 Totally evil in this bill. They do it all the time
 You'll see them pass a bill like a defense bill to fund the military and then there'll be like a bill to build a
 fly fishing arena for 10 dudes in the middle of Alaska
 It happens all the time this time though. It's pretty dope
 All those other times it was a total scam and a ripoff shame on you politicians
 But this time it's dope what happened was senator Marco Rubio from Florida
 Drafted this bill called the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021 and this is what this says
 This is groundbreaking stuff the Pentagon and the FBI have
 180 days from the passage of the bill. This is this is not conspiracy theory
 You can look at these links. These are all real. This is mainstream news
 I'll have it in the show notes. You can Google it yourself and it'll pop up like CNN
 C-Span military comm all this stuff the Pentagon and the FBI have
 180 days from the passage of the bill and it's already passed it passed at the end of December to reveal what they know about
 an identified aerial phenomenon a.k.a
 anomalous aerial vehicles a.k.a
 UFOs
 From the passage of that bill
 I think it was passed on like the 28th to the 29th of December the Pentagon and the FBI have to reveal
 What they know now this bill requires a
 Portion of it to be unclassified material and needs to be available to the public
 However, because of the sensitive nature of the matter there is part of the bill also says you can't have a classified component that only like the armed services
 Committees see in Congress, but the senators are here's the thing they go listen if something's going on
 That's a threat to national security
 Congress needs to know about it if it's something that's going on that's so beyond our capabilities
 The elected representatives need to know about it. The military can't keep these secrets
 Here's a couple portions of this bill
 If you're like this in a this to hear you this isn't a policy wonk podcast
 Let me read you this because this is the wording is very very important in this bill
 Whether request this is one of the things they're requesting in this bill they want quote the identification of potential aerospace or
 other threats posed by the unidentified aerial phenomenon to national security and an
 Assessment of whether this unidentified aerial phenomenon activity may be attributed to one or more foreign adversaries
 So it's not necessarily saying we want to know that a bunch of grays are invading
 They're saying we want to know what you know
 Does China have this technology does Russia have this technology does North Korea have this technology does?
 Question mark have this technology another thing they're requesting is quote identification of any incidents or patterns
 That indicate a potential adversary
 May have achieved to break through aerospace capabilities that could put United States strategic or conventional forces at risk
 unquote
 So that goes back to that thing because all of the sightings of UFOs they all break the what we know is the laws of physics
 so
 Has an earthly adversary gained this technology and you're hiding it from us for whatever reason we need to know
 That hundred and eighty days countdown started in December. It's going to put us somewhere in the beginning of July
 When this report is due you know what's interesting about it like on the one hand I can see
 Congress going we want to know about threats
 To the nation we're elected representatives. We want to know what the threats are
 Pentagon tell us what I find really odd about this is that the FBI is particularly called out
 They do say other agencies that are adjacent to the Pentagon and
 FBI need to comply to this as well, but those are the two that were named in the it's not even a request
 This is law. They have to do this, but why the FBI?
 You know obviously it makes you think of the X files, right because the FBI is
 investigating aliens and ghosts and killbillies eating their own kids
 Why like what are they doing doing with the UFO phenomenon?
 Here's an interesting part of this bill what they're requesting from the FBI is quote
 detailed analysis of the data of the FBI which was derived from investigations of
 intrusions of unidentified aerial phenomenon data over restricted United States airspace
 so apparently Mark Aruvio and other people in Congress know that the FBI as
 Currently or in the recent past been looking into an identified aerial phenomenon
 over the United States
 Now we always know it's like the military right like that's a given the FBI is particularly called out
 We want all the information you have about
 Investigations because they know they're running them. We want that paperwork. We want to know what you know
 So this had popped up in the news
 About a week or two ago
 I think it was towards the end of my break and I was gonna cover it
 But Scott's email kind of made me ramp it up because Scott's email added another wrinkle to the case
 Seven years ago. There was a reddit thread posted by a man with the account
 Throw away alien now. He's not throwing away aliens
 He's the accounts name that because he goes this is a first line of his post is throw away account
 Because I'm afraid if you're not familiar with Reddit a throwaway account as you started up just for one thread
 And then you get rid of it so no one can find out who you really are
 He tells a story. He was first abducted when he was 12 years old back in 1987 and it's a really interesting read
 It's odd because his account is very nonchalant even though at the beginning he states that he's afraid
 It's very nonchalant the way he talks about it first off. He dispels a bunch of myths
 He says there's no probing
 That's everyone's first question right even if like if someone tells you that's why a lot of abductees don't come
 Forward because a lot of people go as you get probed. We mean maybe they're not that blunt about it
 But that's always the joke right he goes
 I was abducting when I was 12 and I get abducted every couple years
 Generally once they abduct you they keep abducting you and he goes even the word
 Abduction's not the right thing. He goes you're invited onto the ship
 And we've covered that a lot on this show where the aliens will be like
 Do you want to come with us and people are like no in the aliens are like, okay, and they leave
 And then you have the people who get abducted but they're like I lost time and you wonder at a certain point
 Did they give permission and then they just got in too deep over their head?
 He says you're not really abducted they ask you and then you go along but at that point then they just kind of keep showing up
 Open that door once you're not gonna be able to close it
 He says I've seen people cut open like put to sleep and cut open and they fiddle around with people
 But then they sew him back up and the guy's fine
 He goes the worst thing that he can recall really happening to him was them taking tissue samples
 They take tissue samples off your lower back or your buttocks
 Which would be interesting because that could be where the probing story comes from but he goes a lot of stuff
 They do is very
 Uninvasive is that a term not non-invasive? I think is the actual term
 Fairly gentle. He says they would show him
 Earth television shows and we're talking about great aliens what he's describing is great aliens and he also says this another thing
 We've come across a lot on the show. He goes. They're not really gray
 Like they are they're kind of a beige, but their skin that is a suit their bodies. That's a suit. They wear
 It's a super tight
 Space suit and we've come we've covered that a lot on this show. They're not little naked dudes walking around
 It's a really really tight suit they're wearing he says they would show him television shows and they would just watch him
 They would gauge his response to what he's watching Webster
 He's like what this show sucks put back on different strokes for those shows even on in 1987
 They're showing him go-bots. He's like what this sucks put back on transformers
 He goes the aliens basically show no emotions
 But two of them they would show sadness from time to time and then they would show irritation when you asked them questions
 They hated it. They absolutely hated they had asked you questions non-stop as they're running these studies on you
 But if you started asking them questions, they're totally done with them
 They don't know one here at all. He also said that although they can beam and this is weird too because I've seen this so many times in
 The stories we covered and I never even really questioned it. I didn't really think of it
 There's so many times that a great aliens show up and they're beaming telepathic messages into some farmer's head
 Do you want to eat some pancakes and the farmer says sure I'll eat some pancakes?
 He says the great aliens can beam telepathic messages into your head, but they can't read your mind
 You have to verbally answer them
 That's weird because that happens all the time. I never thought of that before
 So many times the people are talking and the aliens are using telepathy because the aliens can't read our minds
 According to throw away alien he says there he goes you can never verbally talk to these guys
 He goes there he described their languages sound and like
 That's dummy song
 It was like this weird
 It's weird noise once there was a boy
 He also compared it to like the sound of a trumpet
 I'm not gonna do trumpet sound because I know some of you guys listen to this show while you're falling asleep
 Interesting little tidbit to this he says that they actually love earth music two types of music in particular
 I've always theorized do what aliens even be able to comprehend music if you went to an alien planet
 Could you comprehend their music like would it make would you be able to tell it was a musical arrangement on another planet?
 I've always been curious about that, but he goes aliens love
 Bluegrass, bluegrass music.
 Come on down and swamp, dam, dam, dam, dam, dam, dam, dam.
 Actually don't know what bluegrass music sounds like,
 but I assume it sounds like that.
 Come on, I'm not gonna keep trying to do bluegrass music,
 but imagine the word swamps in it a lot.
 They also love the sound of this African instrument
 called the Sheikir.
 It's like a Gord, it's a percussion instrument.
 So this Gord that has these like strings on it.
 (makes a compression sound)
 (makes a compression sound)
 Come on down to the swamp right now.
 (makes a compression sound)
 I don't know what that instrument sounds like
 either I gotta lift it up.
 But I'm still busy reading about a man
 hiding in a woman's restroom in a coffin.
 Because I don't know, this is interesting
 'cause he says their voices sound like a trumpet.
 This would kind of make sense.
 But he says their voices remind him of a trumpet
 and it also sounds like (makes a compression sound)
 like this hum thing.
 So maybe a blend of the two.
 As much as I talk trash about a gray aliens,
 I will agree with him on this.
 He said gray aliens hate jazz.
 They despise jazz music.
 But I can just imagine the aliens are like flipping through
 earth television stations trying to find something
 for this dude to watch and they come across like
 PBS Jazz Hour.
 (laughs)
 They're like ships going out of control,
 everyone's trying to hold their ears and pilot
 an interstellar craft at the same time.
 Hurry up, change it, change it.
 They hate jazz, they hate jazz.
 And they hate classical music.
 I almost feel like I've had so much hate and anger
 towards the grays and then this could bring us together.
 'Cause I also despise classical music and jazz.
 I feel like maybe they are my space brothers.
 Maybe they can come on down and swamp with me
 and listen to some bluegrass music.
 He says they've been here for like 10, 20,000 years.
 He says these monitors on this screen,
 he said these monitors that they're looking at
 would show him images of the past.
 So he actually saw them.
 This is really interesting note.
 He said that I saw the aliens at the construction
 of the pyramids.
 He didn't say they were building them
 because we have a lot of good theories
 of how humans could build the pyramids.
 So I think he could have easily just said
 I saw the aliens build the pyramids.
 And then you'd be like, oh,
 you're chasing that support where you zone out
 on the story, all these other claims.
 Well, yeah, they hate jazz.
 I hate jazz.
 That makes sense.
 He says that he saw them at the building of the pyramids,
 not building them themselves.
 So that was interesting detail.
 Because again, he could have easily just said,
 if he's making it up,
 make up parts of the popular mythos.
 He also said that he saw footage of this massive stone
 building, like this giant stone tower,
 somewhere in Europe 10,000 years ago.
 And it would have been demolished in the meantime.
 So the whole lost civilization thing,
 that's a really cool visual story on that as well.
 And it's interesting because he,
 that's pretty much the end of it.
 He kind of wraps it up with that.
 And he's basically open to questions.
 And then he has this original thread
 and then at the bottom it says edit.
 He's edited it at a certain point.
 The edit was also seven years ago.
 The last thing he wrote was no more questions.
 They are not happy with me.
 Sorry.
 And the account has never been used since.
 It's only been used on that one single thread.
 It's never been used since.
 He did answer someone's question and they were like,
 what are the aliens think about nukes?
 Do they want to stop war?
 And he goes, no, they don't really care about nukes.
 He goes, at least they never asked me about nukes.
 He goes, at one point,
 they did show me some footage of them abducting
 some soldiers during World War I.
 They did seem pretty curious about human wars.
 They didn't really care about nukes.
 A lot of times nuclear disarmament and environmental stuff.
 Aliens are always trying to wanna clean up our environment
 and stuff like that or disable our nukes.
 Because they never even brought that up.
 And this guy's been being abducted from 1987
 to what, seven years ago, 2013.
 That's a lot of time to be hanging out with gray aliens
 and them never bringing up.
 And he never mentioned the environmental thing as well.
 So that was interesting.
 So what does this have to do with Congress?
 This Reddit thread that was set up seven years ago,
 this account has not been used since,
 he says in this post,
 the gray aliens told me they were gonna make themselves
 know into the world in July of 2021.
 He goes, it's either,
 he goes, it's kinda hard to understand them sometimes.
 You know, with the constant humming in your ear.
 He goes, they either said July 8th or July 18th, 2021.
 But he says that's when the gray aliens
 are gonna let everyone know they're here.
 And so the reason why,
 this thread has just been gathering dust
 over the past seven years.
 The reason why it's taking flight now, no pun intended.
 The reason why it's in hyperspace now
 is because July is six months after the passage of this bill.
 Where the Pentagon and the FBI and any adjacent group
 has to tell America and more secretive stuff
 to the members of Congress,
 but they have to reveal what they know about UFOs,
 unidentified aerial vehicles.
 So a bizarre coincidence?
 Did this guy know this?
 Are aliens such a master of reality
 that they could see into the future and they go,
 well, eventually, you know,
 some dude in Florida is gonna write this bill
 and he's gonna sneak it in during this relief package.
 And we're just gonna tell this kid,
 or is it possible that Marco Rubio is a gray alien?
 No, I'm just joking.
 Is it possible that there are aliens
 behind this bill as well?
 I guess that's just as ridiculous as saying Marco Rubio.
 But you know what I mean?
 Like maybe there are forces saying it's time.
 Or actually maybe, there's a lot of maybes in this,
 but maybe they know the aliens are coming in July
 and this way it kind of gives everyone an out.
 If the Congress announces,
 hey, look it, we know that these things
 are from out of this world.
 And then a bunch of ships flow up and they're like,
 hey, look it, we didn't lie to you.
 We actually told you the truth.
 It's the most likely scenario is
 it's a super weird coincidence.
 Like the rational scenario, super weird coincidence.
 But a coincidence nonetheless.
 And as Garrick once said, I believe in coincidences,
 coincidences happen all the time.
 I don't trust coincidences.
 So we'll see what happens.
 It will it be another date that just passes?
 And that actually, this is interesting
 'cause it won't be.
 The Pentagon and the FBI have to reveal that information.
 The information could be there is, it's all this.
 It's all Chinese technology.
 It used to be Soviet technology.
 It could be that.
 And that would answer a whole lot of questions.
 Or it could be the Pentagon's straight up go.
 We don't know what these things are.
 They're not from around here.
 So this isn't, Scott goes in his email, he goes,
 I thought it was just one of those,
 one of those many fake into the world things
 that pops up every single month
 in the conspiracy theory community.
 And I go, no, this is real.
 The bill is real.
 So the date won't, something will happen in July.
 The very least we're gonna get information
 from armed services and the Federal Bureau
 of Investigation involving UFOs.
 At the very, very least and at the most.
 Come on down and swamp me.
 We're, we see a bunch of UFOs float.
 I'm all like, my galactic brothers,
 the first thing they do is they destroy every jazz bar.
 Just doing that, I walk in with the bat.
 I'm like, I'm with the aliens now,
 smashing tubas.
 We don't have time for the full gaming story
 I wanted to tell,
 but I wanted to wet your whistle.
 Wanted to wet your whistle with this one.
 William Bertels, I'm gonna touch the keys
 to the carbon helicopter very quickly.
 We are gonna fly on out to Sacramento, California.
 (imitates car engine)
 At this whole segment, we'll do it Monday
 about how video games may be coming more self aware
 than we think and not super advanced video games,
 but like basic games being played so often
 that they may actually start to turn on the players.
 We've got some cool, cool stories for you
 in involving that, but in the video game realm,
 William Land the Carboner Cofter right here
 by American River College,
 where long time listeners of the show know that I went
 to college, some of my happiest years,
 I've had a lot of them, so it's tough competition,
 but some of my happiest years were at American River College.
 I'd always go to the jack in the box.
 You can take this journey yourself
 if you're in circle.
 You know guys, I'd go to the jack in the box
 and I'd get a chicken teriyaki rice bowl,
 (makes chicken noises)
 drink a Coke, I'd go back to school.
 (laughs)
 Jason, that's not how you're gonna wrap up this episode.
 No, it's not just product placement.
 One time though, I remember I was on a bus for some reason.
 The jack in the box has nothing to do with this story.
 I just really like chicken teriyaki rice bowls
 and I'd also get a large order of jalapeno poppers,
 but in the egg roll.
 But one time I was on a bus driving through this area,
 so there's like a little shopping center.
 There used to be a military surplus store
 with who I could only describe,
 the guy who owned it as a domestic terrorist.
 He was basically Otto from the Simpsons.
 Every time you walked in there,
 'cause I always wanted to buy pants,
 buy like cool army pants.
 You always thought that the Fed thrown away at any point.
 He did not want customers in there.
 I swear he was selling weapons in the back.
 But one time I'm taking a bus through this area,
 and I look out the window as the bus is driving,
 I look out the side window,
 and I see two men walking down the road.
 There's a shorter overweight man and a taller skinny man.
 They, this is, (laughs)
 this is how I'm ending my Friday episode,
 but this story's true.
 Tall skinny man, short overweight man.
 Both of them have mustaches.
 The shorter man is wearing red.
 He's like wearing a red shirt and blue pants.
 And the tall skinny guy is wearing a green cap,
 a green t-shirt and blue pants.
 And I'm like, this guy's kind of look like Mario and Luigi.
 Right?
 (birds chirping)
 (laughs)
 Hold on, hold on, don't look up.
 Don't look up yet.
 Like this guy's kind of look like Mario and Luigi.
 Now the bus is driving.
 If I was in my car, I totally would have stopped
 and asked them, "Hey, are you Mario and Luigi?"
 But I didn't have that power.
 The bus is driving by,
 and I see them in some sort of animated argument.
 Like it's overblown,
 like you know how people argue in a silent film?
 Like that, it's exaggerated argument
 as they're walking down the street.
 And then to make it even more like some bizarre scene,
 Mario, he has a red baseball cap on,
 he takes his cap off and hits Luigi over the head with it.
 And Luigi covers up his head with both hands.
 Like someone just hit him in the head with a baseball bat
 and it's so animated.
 I can't hear anything,
 but he covers up his head with both his hands
 and I see his mouth go, "Ow!"
 Like super ridiculous.
 And I remember the bus driving
 and I am craning my neck now
 and I see them just continuing to walk down the street.
 I'm pretty sure that was actually Mario and Luigi.
 Now again, it's probably not,
 they're probably not eight bit characters
 in the real world.
 I found the whole thing so bizarre.
 Everything was perfect about it.
 The way they were dressed, the way they looked,
 if anything was different.
 And the thing that pushed it over the edge
 was they're over the edge antics.
 It's like watching a real life three Stooges.
 Like if you took your hat off,
 take your hat off right now,
 go by hat and sit down next to someone
 and hit him on the head with your hat.
 They're gonna be like, "What?
 "What'd you do that for, man?"
 Maybe they're sleeping and they're like, "Ugh, what was that?"
 They're at no point will they hold their head
 with both their hands and go, "Ow!"
 Unless they're a newborn baby.
 Even in the Fontanella and don't do that.
 If the person next to you is younger than a year,
 don't do that.
 Actually, don't do that to any child,
 but there was something so,
 it was like, it was so bizarre.
 It wasn't the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
 It wasn't even in the top 1,000 bizarre things
 I've ever seen, but it's a good way
 to end the Friday's episode.
 It's a good cliffhanger for Monday's episode.
 Is it possible that you play a video game for so long
 that it becomes self-aware?
 And it knows you are a human player
 trying to control its destiny.
 We'll explore that story and more next week
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is gonna be your email address.
 You can also hit us up at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio.
 Yes, I did, I did in Friday's episode on a story
 about an overweight man and a skinny man
 getting hit with a hat.

 and true crime podcast.
 You don't have to listen to it every day.
 Glad you guys listened to today.
 I love you guys, have a great weekend, I'll see you Monday.
