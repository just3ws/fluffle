1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 (laughing)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,720
 That last one sounds a little bit like Santa Claus

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,200
 or should I say Satan Claus.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,240
 It's episode 666 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,360
 Be prepared for this level,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,560
 this level of nonsense this episode.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,160
 Episode 666.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,160
 First off, we meet a woman who has one-on-one communication

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,800
 with the devil.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,240
 Every time she makes breakfast.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,240
 And then, we travel to the depths of hell ourselves

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,640
 to meet a man who promises us he can give us

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,080
 all the gold in the world if we worship him.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,440
 Then, we stay in hell, 'cause it's episode 666,

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,600
 to take a look at some of the most fearsome demons

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
 that inhabit the bowels of the underworld.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,680
 And, it's an interactive adventure.

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,680
 Today on the 666th episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,420
 (upbeat music)

20
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:24,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,240
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,280
 I'm your host, Jason Carvin,

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,160
 or I'm having a great day.

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,640
 Episode 666.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
 Can you believe it?

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,520
 This show is now one of the episode-wise,

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,060
 longest running paranormal podcasts in the world.

29
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,200
 It's amazing.

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,680
 It's amazing.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,280
 You may say quantity over quality.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,420
 I wouldn't, I like the show, but you might say that.

33
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,560
 But, 666 episodes, I think that's more episodes

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
 than The Simpsons, really.

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 And guys, it would be impossible without you.

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
 Thank you so much for listening.

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,120
 We got another 1,000 episodes in the show.

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,920
 But right now, we got this devilishly,

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,480
 delightfully good episode, hopefully,

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,680
 hopefully, of episode 666.

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,560
 First off, we gotta give a shout out

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
 to our newest Patreon supporter,

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command dressed up as a sexy,

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,320
 just as a sexy devil.

45
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,640
 One of those costumes from the Halloween story.

46
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,120
 It's Justin Mosier.

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,680
 I wanna give a round of applause

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,360
 as he's walking in, picking the tight costume

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,200
 out of his butt.

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,020
 Justin, you're gonna be at,

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,320
 let's give him a better round of applause.

52
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,800
 That was kind of lackluster.

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,960
 He's really pulling off that outfit.

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,640
 Justin Mosier, you're gonna be our captain,

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,600
 our pilot this episode.

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,980
 If you guys can't support the Patreon,

57
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,480
 or if you don't have a sexy Satan costume,

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,160
 and who doesn't, that's okay.

59
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,640
 Just helps rid the word about the show

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,040
 really, really helps out a lot.

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,840
 Justin, go ahead and poke us,

62
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,440
 poke us in the butt with your pitchfork,

63
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,000
 and force us into the Jason Jalopy.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,760
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
 It's all spooky.

66
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
 I just shut the lights off.

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,120
 That's all the decoration I did for this episode.

68
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,920
 Click, you're just walking around in the dark.

69
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,120
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,040
 We are headed out to Small Town USA.

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,000
 Justin is driving the Jason Jalopy.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,960
 We're listening to spooky sounds.

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,440
 I got a CD of spooky sounds.

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
 We're listening to the whole time.

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
 I'm like, all right, this is my favorite track.

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,080
 It's just a man screaming.

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,000
 Notice Justin got a little turned on

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,600
 by that song, I have to change the CD.

79
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,920
 We are in a small town.

80
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,200
 It's May 4th, 1984.

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,560
 We're sitting in the kitchen of a woman named June O'Brien.

82
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
 Now, before we get started,

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,520
 I have a real problem with this story.

84
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,240
 I really need your guys' help.

85
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,320
 I'll probably be telling this,

86
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,960
 and you guys will be like, what in the world?

87
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,160
 He's doing this, but I'm so puzzled by this.

88
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,080
 On May 4th, 1984, the Today Show

89
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,000
 does a segment about supermarket tabloids.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
 And it's celebrity tabloids examined.

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,680
 It is the name of the piece.

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,400
 And it features June O'Brien,

93
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,960
 and she has a haunted toaster.

94
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,880
 And you guys may have seen the YouTube clip.

95
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,680
 I'm gonna put all this in the show notes.

96
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,440
 She goes, this toaster is possessed by the devil.

97
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,000
 It's just a silver little toaster,

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,360
 like the brave little toaster, but possessed by the devil.

99
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,160
 She goes, this toaster is possessed by the devil.

100
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,200
 Sometimes it'll say, I am the devil.

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 We don't get to hear that.

102
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,320
 That's not actually on video,

103
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,440
 but she does say that.

104
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,600
 Sometimes she hears it.

105
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,960
 What is on video is that she pulls a piece of toaster,

106
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,800
 and she goes, look at what this rascally man did

107
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,760
 to my toaster.

108
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,380
 And it's all burnt, but then there's a part

109
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,960
 that's not burnt that says Satan lives.

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
 It's fake, right?

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,500
 It's fake.

112
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,660
 I'm asking you, I'm asking you as you're sitting

113
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,500
 in her kitchen.

114
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,840
 That's fake, right?

115
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,920
 Then she puts a piece of toaster

116
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
 to show the audience that this is real.

117
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,840
 She puts a piece of toaster in the toaster.

118
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,280
 She keeps trying to get it to go down.

119
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,120
 It won't.

120
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,720
 It's an average toaster from the 1980s.

121
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,440
 And then flame shoots out of the toaster.

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,200
 This is all on video, single take.

123
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,560
 And she kind of jumps back.

124
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,800
 And it's a good sized flame.

125
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,760
 And so the interviewer goes,

126
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,080
 why don't you get rid of the toaster?

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,860
 It is possessed by the dark lord of hell.

128
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,160
 It's ruining your toast as well.

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,800
 And she goes, well, sometimes it makes really good toast.

130
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
 So that's why she keeps the toaster.

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
 And I'm watching that.

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
 And I go, oh, this must have been

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,360
 it's celebrity tabloids examined.

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
 They were talking about national inquiring all this stuff.

135
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,680
 I was starting to look around.

136
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,600
 I was like, oh, you know, it's from 1984.

137
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,280
 I'm sure they did like a 20 years later,

138
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,080
 the hoax of the lady, how they pulled that hoax off.

139
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,600
 Or this was debunked.

140
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,960
 No, every single article you can find on this

141
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,440
 or that I could find says that it was a real event.

142
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,920
 Treats it as if it's real.

143
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,360
 And I'm talking about like stuff from like the Huffington post

144
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
 which has better things to write about

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,040
 than this.

146
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,680
 How was this real?

147
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,800
 Am I missing something?

148
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,720
 Does everyone know this is a hoax?

149
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,480
 And that's why the articles are just like,

150
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,200
 there's nobody's tome enough to think this is real.

151
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,760
 We're not even gonna waste the paragraph

152
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,060
 saying it was a hoax.

153
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,920
 Is it real?

154
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,880
 I'm seriously asking you guys.

155
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,100
 Do you guys know something I don't?

156
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,560
 That's what this episode has become on episode 666.

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,120
 I'm just gonna start asking you questions

158
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,640
 the rest of the series.

159
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,520
 Here's the thing, there's no debunking on the episode itself.

160
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,440
 There's no debunking in the future

161
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,520
 when people are talking about it on the Huffington post

162
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,880
 or Gawker or anything like that.

163
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,360
 No one's like, yeah, everyone had a good laugh, but.

164
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,520
 So you're going, Jason, maybe it is real.

165
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,360
 Well, that same segment had a story about a man

166
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,480
 who was walking.

167
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,840
 He had like a vinquilitris dummy in a case

168
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,840
 and he was walking across the frozen lake

169
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,440
 and he fell into the lake.

170
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,960
 He's about to die and then a little hand, little hand,

171
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,600
 a little wooden hand reaching the water

172
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,240
 and pulled him out and it was his howdy-duty doll.

173
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,520
 So this is fake, right?

174
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,640
 That's fake, like the possessed toaster.

175
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,840
 That's in the realm of possibility for me.

176
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,720
 Howdy-duty, one, how did he get out of the case?

177
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,180
 You know what, I'm not actually gonna break it down

178
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,720
 by like how can he lift up a man?

179
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,080
 It is a doll that becomes animate.

180
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,120
 None of it makes sense.

181
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,680
 That's in the same segment.

182
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,040
 So that's fake, right?

183
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,120
 I'm asking you, that's fake, right?

184
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,800
 And here's my other clue that this is fake.

185
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,000
 The reporter for this segment was Richard Dominick.

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,160
 I looked him up, I was about to go knock on his door

187
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,680
 and be like, please tell me the toaster's fake.

188
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,800
 Richard Dominick went on to become

189
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,160
 the executive producer of the Jerry Springer show.

190
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,920
 So I'm leaning towards the toast was fake

191
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,040
 and the Howdy-duty was fake.

192
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,280
 I just don't understand why no one else, am I that?

193
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,080
 I don't wanna, what's the opposite of jaded?

194
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,440
 Gullible, right?

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,480
 Gullible, that I see this and go,

196
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,000
 what is this real and no other article says that it's fake

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,960
 because it's obviously fake.

198
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,680
 It would be the same thing.

199
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,760
 If every time you read a review of a Transformers movie,

200
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,200
 they stopped in the middle of the review and they said,

201
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,080
 okay, plot and cinematography aside,

202
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,400
 this movie is fake, this is not a real movie.

203
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,560
 Optimus Prime did not shoot Kelsey Grammer

204
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,320
 with a giant blaster.

205
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,880
 It did not happen.

206
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,560
 And I'd be like, oh, I was wondering why no one

207
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,000
 is freaked out, I was wondering why I saw

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,720
 Kelsey Grammer on the news the next day.

209
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,480
 I thought Optimus Prime shot him with that weapon

210
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,000
 that was designed to punch holes through starships.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,900
 He just blasted a man.

212
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,720
 Oh, okay, good thing I got to that.

213
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,840
 Am I that daft?

214
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,640
 Anyways, we will find out when I get your emails

215
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,920
 and YouTube comments and you guys are like, yes,

216
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
 it was obviously fake, dude.

217
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,140
 Justin, let's go ahead and leave behind this woman's house.

218
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,480
 We have some nice pieces of toast, some butter

219
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,440
 and some jam, eating those up.

220
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,040
 Call in the dead rabbit dirgeable.

221
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,480
 We're going to take a one-way ticket.

222
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,640
 Hopefully it's not a one-way ticket.

223
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,920
 Hopefully we make it back.

224
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,040
 Hop in the dead rabbit dirgeable.

225
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,240
 Wait, that's super flammable.

226
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
 Do we have a burrowing machine?

227
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,160
 Justin, we're going to break out a new machine, I think.

228
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,400
 Let's hop in the dead rabbit driller.

229
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,320
 It's just the Jason Jalopy with the hand cranked drill.

230
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,640
 I got to crank it the whole time.

231
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,820
 Oh, my arms are getting sore.

232
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,320
 You do it, you do it now.

233
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,640
 I get like two feet into the soil

234
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,680
 and now you're cranking it

235
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,720
 and I got my feet kicked up on the dashboard.

236
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,800
 The dead rabbit driller, Jason Jalopy

237
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
 with just the hand drill on it.

238
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,000
 We're leaving behind this woman's house.

239
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,640
 We're drilling straight to hell.

240
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,800
 (humming)

241
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,280
 It is episode 666.

242
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,680
 Now I was very adamant for a long time

243
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,160
 that I wasn't going to do anything special for episode 666

244
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,880
 and it wasn't for any reason.

245
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,840
 It was because I can't even plan a Halloween episode.

246
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,880
 I don't understand why you guys haven't figured that out yet.

247
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,080
 I'll record a Halloween episode on Halloween

248
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,080
 and it gets released on November 1st.

249
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,480
 I'm really bad with this stuff

250
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
 but everyone was clamoring for a 666 episode.

251
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,480
 So I started trying to come up with ideas

252
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,000
 that were quickly shot down by the people who love me

253
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 and surround me.

254
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,960
 They're like, "Don't do that.

255
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,360
 "Don't summon a demon.

256
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,080
 "It's a terrible idea."

257
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,280
 So this is plan B.

258
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,720
 We're gonna talk about summoning a demon.

259
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
 As I'm sitting in an haunted closet

260
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,040
 where I'm gonna just simply talk about summoning a demon.

261
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,240
 Justin, we've now breaking through the mantle of the earth,

262
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,800
 the dead rabbit driller is driving around hell.

263
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,560
 So let's talk about summoning demons.

264
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,520
 It's something that I think everyone kind of goes through

265
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,560
 a failure, Jason, I never did this.

266
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,840
 Yeah, you did.

267
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,080
 You're telling me you never watched like Buffy or Angel

268
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,200
 or any like the craft or something like that.

269
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,680
 Come on, tell me you never thought about like

270
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,520
 how cool it would be.

271
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,360
 You don't necessarily have to be a bad guy

272
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,560
 but like you summon a demon and then it's like,

273
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,680
 go beat up my bullies.

274
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,720
 It's like, rip me their guts out.

275
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,160
 It's eviscerating him.

276
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,920
 You accidentally like summon a demon, the god of war.

277
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,560
 And he's just like, killing some kid who like,

278
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,840
 who like stalled your quarter one time,

279
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,800
 rips his face off and makes him eat it.

280
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,880
 We've all had not that fantasy

281
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,760
 but we've all thought about like mastering the dark arts.

282
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,440
 And again, maybe you don't wanna use it for evil.

283
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,520
 Maybe you don't wanna use it to mutilate bullies.

284
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,360
 You think wouldn't be cool to like use magic and,

285
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,240
 you guys are shaking your head this whole time.

286
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,920
 You're like, Jason, we've thought about this.

287
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,760
 How to summon a demon and become insanely rich?

288
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,800
 This is an article written by Clive Williams.

289
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,520
 It's for a website called Exemplor.

290
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,120
 And he talks about this demon named Maman.

291
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
 He's the demon of greed and wealth.

292
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,560
 So if you wanna become rich and successful,

293
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,760
 it's probably the guy you're gonna talk to.

294
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,560
 So in this article, he gives us a couple key points

295
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,920
 we need to summon Maman.

296
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,880
 First off, you wanna get an owl rope bracelet.

297
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,760
 An owl rope bracelet is a bracelet made

298
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,940
 from the skin of a Norwegian owl.

299
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,840
 Now when I read that, I go, that's interesting.

300
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,600
 This is a demon that's from Judeo-Christian lore,

301
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,360
 which is mainly for the most part based around Israel,

302
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,000
 the Middle East.

303
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,360
 You told a dude in ancient times,

304
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,440
 if you talk to some dude walking around

305
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
 the wilderness of Israel,

306
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,880
 you talk to a Sumerian or a Mesopotamian

307
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,320
 who were actively messing with these old gods,

308
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
 these old demons, worshiping them,

309
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,200
 having civilization destroyed,

310
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,440
 not learning their lesson, worshiping some other guy.

311
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,840
 You told him, hey, if you wanna talk to this guy,

312
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,880
 you need the skin of a Norwegian owl.

313
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,080
 They'd look at you and go, what's Norwegian?

314
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,120
 What's an owl?

315
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,620
 I don't even think there's any owls in the Middle East.

316
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,600
 It would be like telling us if you wanted

317
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,440
 to complete a ritual, you'd have to go to Neptune.

318
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,240
 And that's really the start of the complications

319
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,320
 with this stuff.

320
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,520
 I've looked into demonology.

321
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,540
 I think, again, every paranormal researcher

322
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,520
 goes through that phase.

323
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,960
 They look into demonology.

324
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,800
 They look into the rites of exorcism and things like that.

325
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,920
 And when you dig deep enough,

326
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,600
 you start to realize just kinda how ridiculous this stuff is.

327
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,440
 'Cause Maman is, I'm not saying that when

328
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,960
 God cast the demons from hell,

329
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,520
 they all went to one location.

330
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,840
 Like I'm sure a couple of them landed in Norway.

331
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,960
 But it's bizarre to think like if this is legit

332
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,280
 and this demon is from Judeo-Christian lore,

333
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,920
 why, that is so far away.

334
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,800
 That is so far away.

335
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,560
 And you're telling me nobody summoned this dude

336
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,800
 until the first explorer reached Norway.

337
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,920
 He's just sitting in hell.

338
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,000
 He's like, oh man, why did I have to have

339
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,560
 the weirdo thing, right?

340
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,200
 There's some other guys like, I can't be summoned

341
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,520
 unless someone goes down to slip and slide three times.

342
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,360
 So I'm screwed.

343
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,960
 It's gonna take like 3,000 years before I show up.

344
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,920
 Anyways, you need Al-Skin.

345
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,560
 This other website, to verify that,

346
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,960
 this other website talking about Maman,

347
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,560
 this is, and we get into this.

348
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
 This is really important.

349
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,120
 Spelling errors are,

350
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,280
 spelling errors are not things you wanna have

351
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,580
 when you're trying to summon a demon.

352
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,480
 There's this other website that said,

353
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,120
 "You needed Al-Sink."

354
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,120
 Like what?

355
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,520
 What is that like?

356
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,040
 Like they're, like, you know,

357
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,880
 sometimes they're slang term for stuff.

358
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,840
 Like you call it duck feathers down,

359
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,400
 but it's just like feathers.

360
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,080
 Like what's an Al-Sink?

361
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,680
 Now imagine you were actually trying to summon Maman.

362
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,360
 You're trying to summon the demon of wealth

363
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,880
 and you're looking for an Al-Sink.

364
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,720
 There's no such thing unless you actually,

365
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,400
 there are actually sinks of Al's or videos

366
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,900
 of a little baby Al's in Sinks, so that's cool.

367
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,640
 That was the real treasure all along, Maman.

368
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,180
 Have you seen a bunch of YouTube videos

369
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,160
 of little Al's in Sinks?

370
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,120
 You also need a Maman pendant that has his sigil in it.

371
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,760
 So I Googled that and there were predictably

372
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
 multiple versions of his sigil.

373
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,800
 'Cause it's so funny because I wasn't actually

374
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,200
 gonna summon Maman, but I started to think,

375
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,600
 oh, that would actually be really interesting

376
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,880
 if you could be walking down the street and you could go,

377
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,040
 oh, that person, that person summoned Maman.

378
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,840
 They're spinning around, they're vomiting everywhere.

379
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,320
 But imagine you were at a cocktail party.

380
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,760
 I've never been to a cocktail party now

381
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,920
 that I think about it, ever been to a cocktail party.

382
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,200
 I don't even know what makes a cocktail party

383
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,400
 different than a normal party.

384
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,760
 But I'll figure that out, I'm assuming they just drink

385
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,560
 the whole time, but isn't that a normal party?

386
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,820
 Anyways, if you're at a cocktail party,

387
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,720
 fictional thing, it doesn't exist.

388
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,320
 And you see them wearing a little pendant

389
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,840
 and you could see the sigil and you'll go,

390
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,980
 oh, that person, that person also has a bracelet

391
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,080
 made out of Al's skin and probably an Al's sink at home.

392
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,040
 But there's so many different versions of a sigil

393
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,640
 that it was useless and one of them was pretty

394
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,120
 a common symbol that I've seen around

395
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,280
 on skateboards and stuff like that.

396
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,000
 I don't think the 16 year old who smells like weed

397
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,920
 is worshiping Maman.

398
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,720
 Probably just thinks it's a cool logo.

399
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,480
 But anyways, you get a Maman pendant,

400
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,080
 but you really don't know which version is his.

401
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,280
 But anyways, this article here by Clive Williams

402
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,080
 has the incantation.

403
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,200
 The incantations are hard to find

404
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,080
 for these demon summoning things.

405
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,720
 A lot of times they'll say, go to the lesser key of Solomon.

406
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,280
 That's a book that really lists all the demons

407
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,680
 or you have to go find some grimoire.

408
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,360
 You have to do some, you have to pronounce the word

409
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,640
 right first and then the great demons are like,

410
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,760
 okay, now you can come in.

411
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,520
 We didn't know what you're talking about before.

412
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,240
 Here's this, I'm gonna read this to you.

413
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,400
 You might think it's dangerous

414
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,480
 'cause I'm reading it in the haunted closet,

415
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,080
 but let me read this to you.

416
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,640
 Evil, small lit, evil, small lit,

417
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,520
 evil, small wick, evil, small wick,

418
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,520
 yamroi, yajui, gog, l'arv, yamroi, yajui,

419
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:02,900
 og, larv, yamroi, eb, es,

420
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,260
 wit, syke, rof, yif.

421
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:13,560
 The reason why I felt comfortable reading that

422
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,600
 is because I translated it first.

423
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,280
 And this is the thing.

424
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,240
 When you're talking about demon summoning,

425
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,260
 you gotta get stuff right.

426
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,680
 This actually says, Clive Williams, Clive Williams,

427
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,580
 Clive Williams, Clive Williams, May your writing go viral,

428
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,400
 may your writing go viral, may you be blessed

429
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,680
 with riches for life.

430
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,520
 So it was a bit of a joke and when I read it

431
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,360
 and once I cleverly deciphered it,

432
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,440
 once I realized it was written backwards,

433
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,020
 I started, I was trying to see if it was an example,

434
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,040
 like he was like, but you do this in your own thing,

435
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,640
 but no, no, he puts this out and I'm not faulting the guy,

436
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,400
 like maybe he's just trying to take the piss out of

437
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,440
 the kid on the skateboard who owes him money

438
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,240
 for that weed he sold him, I don't know.

439
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,680
 But there are people who are going to skin owls in Norway

440
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,480
 and spin 1999 on some pendant and then read this backwards

441
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,200
 and light a candle and stuff like that.

442
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,040
 Yeah, it's just a waste of time.

443
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,320
 It's not this segment, not this segment,

444
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,600
 but it's funny because when you look at people

445
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,400
 who believe in demonology, I'm sure not all of them,

446
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,880
 but I'm sure there are some 12 year olds

447
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,600
 who were suckered in by this and they wanted to have

448
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,000
 enough money to take their girlfriend out

449
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,760
 to a cocktail party, right?

450
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,360
 To the cocktail party down the street.

451
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,640
 So they did this incantation and obviously didn't work.

452
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,800
 It's obviously a joke if you took more than five minutes

453
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,960
 to read it backwards.

454
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,600
 With the thing with demonology is there's so much information

455
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,400
 and at the same time, so little information.

456
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,520
 And people are, at the end of the day,

457
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,880
 I think people who do try to summon demons,

458
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,320
 it's because of two things.

459
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,320
 One, they're seeking power, it's three things.

460
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,920
 One of them is seeking personal power.

461
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,600
 One of them is trying to prove that they exist,

462
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,440
 some sort of validation.

463
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,740
 And the other one is they're desperate.

464
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,400
 They're desperate and that's the saddest one.

465
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,520
 Like someone just trying to figure out,

466
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,480
 like I wonder if demons exist and they do these rituals

467
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,120
 and nothing happens then that just confirms

468
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,600
 what they think, but there are people who are desperate

469
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,440
 who they're backs to the wall,

470
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,240
 they don't have enough money, things like that.

471
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,360
 So let's go ahead and hop in the carbonar copter.

472
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,280
 Justin is also canoodling up to the real devil.

473
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,840
 He's like, "Hey, you think I can get a job here?"

474
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,520
 No, Justin, you can't.

475
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,000
 You're going up to heaven like the rest of us.

476
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,440
 Justin, let's go ahead and hop in that carbonar copter.

477
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,840
 We're leaving behind Maman.

478
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,320
 And we are headed out to the lower depths of hell.

479
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,520
 Get that heat shielding ready and go.

480
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,520
 (imitates gunfire)

481
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,520
 Guys, go ahead and pick a number between one and five.

482
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,600
 Choose carefully, because this will be the demon you summon.

483
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,400
 There's 72 demons listed in the lesser key of Solomon.

484
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,640
 It's this book that was anonymously written.

485
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,600
 It was on demonology.

486
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,880
 It's from the mid 17th century.

487
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,200
 Then about a hundred years later,

488
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,120
 the infernal dictionary came out,

489
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,240
 which kind of piggybacks on and adds to the lore

490
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,640
 of these 72 demons.

491
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,000
 A lot of these demons are like demons of war

492
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,960
 and demons of lust.

493
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,280
 There's a demon that can make women take their clothes off,

494
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,560
 which is also known as only fans.

495
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,600
 There's a lot of these demons out here,

496
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,160
 but I found the five lamest demons.

497
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,040
 I went through the entire list and I found the five demons

498
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,640
 that if you summoned them,

499
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,080
 you would wish you were on some sort of hellish battlefield

500
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,840
 fighting for glory.

501
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,320
 Nope, nope.

502
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,200
 Pick your number between one and five

503
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,600
 and get ready to summon a loser demon.

504
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,440
 (mouse clicks)

505
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,840
 We're in the lower depths of hell.

506
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,760
 We're walking around.

507
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,960
 There's a bunch of cubicles there.

508
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
 There's a bunch of demons at a call center.

509
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,000
 They're waiting to get summoned.

510
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,240
 They're like, "Ding it, he hasn't got the Albracely yet.

511
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,880
 "Muman is like pound in the table.

512
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,720
 "He's stuck down here."

513
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,720
 We see a demon sitting in the corner named Andrea Puss.

514
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,840
 Andrea Puss.

515
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,520
 Andrea Puss is sitting, I don't even know

516
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,800
 if he wants to summon this dude.

517
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,200
 He's just sitting there and he's like,

518
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,440
 "Hey guys, hey guys, come here real quick, come here."

519
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,760
 And we know it's not gonna be real quick.

520
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,480
 He knows he's gonna talk our ears off

521
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,280
 'cause he's been doing this for 10,000 years.

522
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,120
 He's never been summoned before.

523
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,480
 Andrea Puss is a giant peacock

524
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,560
 that's just kind of sitting there being like pssps.

525
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,800
 Come over here, look at my feathers,

526
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,640
 aren't they beautiful?

527
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,680
 They're all on fire.

528
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,880
 They're all burnt and cinched.

529
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,920
 We're like, "Yeah, Andrea Puss, they look great."

530
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,080
 And he's like, "Yeah, he's pretty dope, right?"

531
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,160
 We're like, "Yeah, dude, they're super feel so bad

532
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,640
 for this guy."

533
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,800
 He screams a lot.

534
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,800
 He screams a lot, right?

535
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,600
 That's kind of his thing.

536
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,120
 He raises great noises.

537
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,600
 So when he's summoned him,

538
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,000
 immediately there's just this giant peacock screaming

539
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,160
 in your summoning circle.

540
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
 Ah!

541
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,200
 So you got that to deal with.

542
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,040
 So first off, they don't list this in the summoning spell,

543
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,840
 but wear earplugs.

544
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,360
 Secondly, we've summoned Andrea Puss.

545
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,200
 It's this giant peacock.

546
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,680
 This is what this is, this infernal demon.

547
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,880
 One of the angels that turned against God

548
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,520
 and was thrown down to hell, this is what they do.

549
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,520
 They don't teach the art of war.

550
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,140
 They don't convince people to fall in love.

551
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,680
 They will teach you though.

552
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,520
 They will teach you.

553
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,360
 Some of you guys might like this.

554
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,520
 I would think it would be super boring.

555
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,480
 Astronomy.

556
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,800
 You're like Jason.

557
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,320
 I would have loved to learn astronomy

558
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,760
 from a giant peacock.

559
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
 That's the most amazing thing ever.

560
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,040
 Well, maybe, but I mean, like,

561
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,560
 you're just gonna sit out in the boonies,

562
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,680
 look up the night sky and there's this peacock going,

563
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,080
 that's the big dipper.

564
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,600
 Jason, that's not astronomy.

565
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
 That's like third grade stuff.

566
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
 He'll teach me how to like quasars and black holes.

567
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,900
 And I'm on a peak, I just jump on the peacocks back

568
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,740
 and fly around.

569
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,580
 Okay, fine.

570
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,340
 If you picked number five,

571
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,160
 there's a little saddle that appears.

572
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,000
 If you pick number five,

573
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,440
 you can attach it to the back of Andrea Puss

574
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
 and you can fly him around and you can look at stars.

575
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,840
 But also, he knows geometry.

576
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,920
 He knows geometry.

577
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,040
 So you're like, Jason, I love geometry

578
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,000
 and astronomy go together.

579
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,120
 Fine, whatever.

580
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,280
 Maybe you, I'm all disappointed.

581
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,120
 I'm all disappointed.

582
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,160
 I'm like, dang it.

583
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,120
 I thought this one was fun.

584
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,800
 I do think it's funny.

585
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,000
 Giant peacock.

586
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,560
 I imagine him with a little like tweed jacket

587
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,720
 with the elbows, with the leather elbows.

588
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
 He's teaching geometry.

589
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,400
 Anyways, he teaches you a string.

590
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
 You're like Jason.

591
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,080
 These really, the five you chose.

592
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,520
 Listen, that was the weakest one.

593
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,680
 That was the weakest one out of the five.

594
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,320
 I didn't think it was hilarious, but don't worry.

595
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,760
 Now, I'm just not gonna be,

596
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,560
 I'm just not gonna be crapping on sciences the whole time.

597
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,960
 'Cause a lot of times these demons do teach you stuff.

598
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,000
 But for whatever reason,

599
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,160
 this giant peacock will teach you astronomy and geometry.

600
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,600
 To me, that's dumb just 'cause I could get a book.

601
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,120
 But you're like, Jason, you can learn

602
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,640
 from a giant peacock or you can learn it from a book.

603
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
 I'll learn it from a book.

604
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,840
 So number five is flying around the universe

605
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,720
 with this, I wish that big number five,

606
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
 I'm still all disappointed in that one.

607
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,520
 The sound of my voice, I'm like, oh man, you're like,

608
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,480
 dude, that's, he's on the back of,

609
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,520
 you're trying to summon a demon right now.

610
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,240
 You're on the back of a peacock flying through the universe

611
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,960
 and you're totally poo pooing it, Jason.

612
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,280
 What's going on?

613
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,520
 Whatever.

614
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,060
 We're walking through this call center.

615
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,600
 You're looking back up at number five.

616
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,160
 You're like, take me with you.

617
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,480
 We're walking through this call center still.

618
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,200
 And we see a guy standing in the corner

619
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,520
 and he has his back to us and he's like,

620
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,240
 we don't know what he's doing.

621
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,920
 We don't want to know it's hell.

622
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,160
 All bets are off.

623
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,280
 He's actually standing in the corner

624
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
 'cause he's super shy.

625
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,400
 He's all gross.

626
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,200
 He's a big old monster, even by health standards.

627
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,600
 When a demon is described as a monster,

628
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,440
 you know it's bad.

629
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,360
 When there are other demons

630
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,280
 like the body of a spider, the head of a frog

631
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,680
 and this guy's described as a monster,

632
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,480
 you know things are bad.

633
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,120
 You know he's getting made fun of.

634
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,040
 This monster is named Bifrons.

635
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,200
 He actually has like a pretty big backing.

636
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
 He actually controls six legions of demons.

637
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,280
 Go do that.

638
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,120
 Go do that.

639
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,960
 They're going to do that.

640
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,280
 Just don't have to look at them anymore.

641
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
 They're like, fine.

642
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,960
 Just station us far away from you.

643
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,840
 He's like, oh, I just want friends.

644
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,160
 I want six legions of friends.

645
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,960
 So you meet Bifrons and it's this monster man.

646
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
 He's a looks like sloth from the Goonies.

647
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,280
 But on fire and horribly burned.

648
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,200
 Ugh, he's standing there.

649
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,160
 And he goes, if you chose number one,

650
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,480
 come with me young person, come with me

651
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,720
 and we will go into my layer.

652
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,560
 So he opens a door and you walk in

653
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,080
 and it's actually pretty nice house.

654
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,940
 Bifrons keeps the place clean.

655
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,560
 You walk in, you sit on this little couch

656
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,640
 and he goes, yes, you have chosen to summon me

657
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,240
 by picking number one.

658
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,240
 So what I can do for you is I teach science.

659
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,440
 I teach the science and the arts.

660
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
 You're like, you look at the door, you see me.

661
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,500
 You're like, Jason, these aren't bad.

662
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,200
 It's good to learn.

663
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,400
 It's good to learn stuff.

664
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,480
 And I'm like, hold on, hold on.

665
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,840
 'Cause some of these demon skills overlap.

666
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
 He teaches science and art.

667
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,800
 So you see like all this beautiful artwork around.

668
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,400
 You see like an astrolabe.

669
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,880
 You see a photo of number five

670
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,600
 in a peacock flying through space.

671
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,440
 Like that's weird.

672
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,180
 How do they get that photo already?

673
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:24,000
 He also teaches you all about gems and wood.

674
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,160
 Showing you emeralds.

675
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,160
 He goes, this is an emerald and this is how it's formed.

676
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,240
 And this is wood and this is how seeds grow.

677
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,440
 He's telling you all of this stuff.

678
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,640
 Tells you about herbs.

679
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,480
 He's sitting there.

680
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,240
 He's like, I know the real KFC recipe

681
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,280
 and I'll share it with you

682
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
 'cause you chose number one.

683
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,920
 You're like, this is amazing.

684
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,320
 But then he goes, I'm going to show you my favorite trick

685
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,440
 'cause other demons know all about herbs and stuff too.

686
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,040
 That's not their specialty.

687
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,480
 This is my specialty.

688
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,600
 He snaps his fingers

689
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,920
 and now you're in a graveyard that goes on for eternity.

690
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,820
 Bifrons is gone.

691
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,960
 You're just looking at it.

692
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,760
 Tombstone after tombstone.

693
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,840
 (laughs)

694
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:11,280
 He goes, my biggest trick.

695
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,320
 The real reason they call me a monster

696
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,240
 isn't because of my hideous face

697
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,480
 but because of what I'm capable of.

698
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,320
 You see, I'm able to transfer the corpse

699
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,240
 from one grave into the other.

700
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,880
 You're like, what?

701
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
 It's the dumbest power ever.

702
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,160
 He goes, I know.

703
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,720
 I know, that's why he just shows me for this list.

704
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,080
 Sure, I can teach you about the arts and the sciences.

705
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,640
 I could just do my little do-do-do-do-do

706
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,240
 and you see where you're standing.

707
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,880
 That was the body of a woman

708
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,440
 but now it's the body of a young boy.

709
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,800
 So gross.

710
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,280
 And he goes, I know in this eternal graveyard,

711
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,000
 that's my hobby.

712
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,840
 That's what I love to do.

713
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,920
 I just have to mix and match the bodies

714
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,920
 but that grave over there is missing one

715
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,800
 and then you find yourself in a casket

716
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,960
 and then by from,

717
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,760
 he went from zero to 60 real quick.

718
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,360
 Number five,

719
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,880
 number five is on a peacock.

720
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,360
 Exploring the universe, you're getting buried.

721
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,720
 You're getting buried alive by a monster.

722
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,880
 He's throwing dirt on the top of the coffin.

723
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,480
 You're pounding, you're pounding.

724
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,640
 But Bifron doesn't care.

725
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,320
 He goes, another corpse for me to teleport

726
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
 from casket to casket.

727
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,360
 That is what Bifron loves to do.

728
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,200
 I mean Bifrons.

729
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,240
 That is what Bifrons loves to do.

730
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,760
 So I just lost one fifth of my listeners.

731
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,760
 They're like, I'm never listening to this show again.

732
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,600
 It's horrible.

733
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,440
 That's horrible.

734
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,280
 I got buried alive.

735
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,640
 Well, your ghost is floating around

736
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,480
 the rest of the episode.

737
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,000
 So, you know, there's that.

738
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,680
 You just gotta float around with little Casper legs

739
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,840
 and eat slime or odd dogs.

740
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,520
 We're continuing to walk through this call center

741
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
 and we see a man.

742
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,080
 He's actually picking up a lot of phones.

743
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,760
 He's like, yep, Croc-L right here.

744
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,560
 Oh, man, you calling for Croc-L?

745
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,480
 You calling for Croc-L?

746
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,320
 We noticed the phones aren't plugged in.

747
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,920
 He's just trying to seem like an important person.

748
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,160
 Everyone else is like, oh, Croc-L, that's so,

749
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,560
 that's so sad.

750
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,040
 He's pretending he's getting phone calls.

751
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,960
 He's going ring ring.

752
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,760
 He's making the sound effect.

753
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,920
 Croc-L is sitting there.

754
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,440
 He actually shows up as an angel.

755
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,080
 So long white robes, wings, the sandals,

756
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,400
 a little halo.

757
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,360
 He is in hell.

758
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,840
 So it's not a great disguise down here.

759
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,320
 We weren't fooled, but Croc-L is actually an angel.

760
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,760
 But he likes to speak in what's known as dark

761
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,120
 and mysterious ways.

762
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
 So I assume he always puts like a gravelly voice on

763
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,960
 like Christian Bale in Dark Knight,

764
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,680
 which I'm not going to do because I have to do

765
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,360
 two more demons after this and I don't want

766
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,320
 to ruin my throat.

767
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,520
 But he's like, nevermind, I'm not going to do

768
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,360
 what I'm going to try.

769
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,840
 And he turns to us and he goes, well, well, well,

770
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,000
 I'm busy on this phone right now.

771
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,680
 I'm taking a call, but let me put them on hold

772
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,400
 and I will talk to you young people.

773
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,760
 Croc-L says, if you chose the number three,

774
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,720
 crawl underneath my wing.

775
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,920
 We're looking at you.

776
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,600
 We're looking at you like, I don't want to go,

777
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,440
 I don't want to go.

778
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,800
 And he's like inviting you to underneath his wing.

779
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,840
 It's all dirty.

780
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,520
 It's all super dirty.

781
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,720
 And you crawl under his wing if you chose number three

782
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,640
 and he envelopes you.

783
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,280
 And then you teleport away.

784
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,040
 And now you're in a classroom.

785
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,520
 You're in a classroom and it's just you sitting

786
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,080
 at a desk, all the other desks are empty.

787
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,320
 And Croc-L is standing there with a tweed jacket

788
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,920
 and a little leather on his elbows.

789
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,960
 Croc-L is known to teach geometry

790
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
 as well as the other liberal sciences.

791
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
 So you can actually get a pretty good degree

792
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,240
 from this guy.

793
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,720
 The Peacock, sure you can travel the universe,

794
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,480
 but you're just going to learn one subject.

795
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,000
 From Croc-L you can actually get like an associates degree.

796
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,840
 It'll take a while, right?

797
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,760
 It'll take a while, but liberal sciences plus geometry,

798
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,220
 that'll be your math elective, you're good to go.

799
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,820
 So at your graduation, you're there for two years,

800
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,640
 you actually get your associates degree.

801
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,460
 I've recorded two years worth of episodes,

802
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,360
 you gotta catch up.

803
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,360
 But you eventually do graduate from Croc-L University.

804
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,220
 And on your graduation day, he goes,

805
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,760
 "Now I'm going to show you what I'm really known for."

806
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,320
 You're like, "Damn it, I know something bad's going to happen."

807
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,720
 Crawl underneath my wing.

808
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,480
 Crawl underneath my wing again.

809
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,320
 You're like, "Oh man, that's where you've had

810
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,260
 to sleep every night, that was your dorm room."

811
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,780
 And you're all underneath his wings.

812
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,240
 He takes you out into a beautiful lush field.

813
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,260
 You just see rolling hills of green grass

814
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,420
 and you're walking around and you're like,

815
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,540
 "Oh, this is pretty dope, dude."

816
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,460
 And he's like, "I know, I know, it is pretty dope.

817
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,340
 It is my special power of all the demon powers.

818
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,900
 This is what I'm most known for."

819
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,900
 He goes, "Do you hear that?"

820
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,900
 Splish, splash, splash, splash, splash, splash.

821
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,100
 You're like, "I do it."

822
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,740
 Sounds like it's water all around me.

823
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,420
 And he goes, "I know, splish, splash, splish, splash.

824
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,420
 My ability is helping people find water."

825
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,700
 And you go, "That actually kind of makes sense

826
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,900
 out of all the stuff you've talked about."

827
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,980
 That makes sense, like in olden times,

828
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,860
 you would want to find wells.

829
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,660
 So calling on a demon who could actually help you

830
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,420
 locate water, natural springs, things like that

831
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,260
 would be super useful.

832
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,220
 Sure, if you were trying to build the pyramids,

833
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,940
 you might want to know geometry,

834
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,900
 but if you're just trying to live your life,

835
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,300
 Croquel is the dude.

836
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,900
 And while he's helping you find water,

837
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,460
 he can teach you a little bit about the humanities.

838
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,620
 So you're walking around and you're like,

839
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,740
 "Look, over there."

840
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,900
 And it's a little body of water.

841
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,620
 And he goes, "Mm-hmm."

842
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,380
 And then you go, "Look, over there."

843
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,380
 And he's like, "I know where all the water is at everywhere.

844
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,500
 You don't have to keep telling me."

845
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,100
 He's gonna, he spent two years with you at this point.

846
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,700
 He's a little tired.

847
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,380
 And he goes, "Go ahead and take a swim.

848
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,500
 Go ahead and take all your clothes off.

849
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,980
 And take a swim.

850
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,500
 Little Croquel, watch a naked human swim around

851
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,340
 in the water."

852
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,460
 And you're like, "Uh..."

853
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,900
 So you take your clothes off

854
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,060
 and you're swimming around in the water

855
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,820
 and Croquel's just standing there

856
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,820
 standing there for an uncomfortable amount of time.

857
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,420
 And then you notice the water's getting warmer.

858
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,860
 You're like, "Oh..."

859
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,500
 And then he realized that it keeps getting warmer

860
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,660
 and warmer and you're like,

861
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,220
 "Oh no, am I gonna get boiled alive by this guy?"

862
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,140
 And he's getting warmer and warmer.

863
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,380
 And then it stops getting warm

864
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,380
 because he can make water warm.

865
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
 He can't make it hot.

866
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,420
 He can't make it boil, but he can make water warm.

867
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,780
 So if you chose number three,

868
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,220
 if you chose number three,

869
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,620
 you got an associate's degree

870
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,020
 and you found a nice warm bath.

871
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,260
 You got to take a warm bath.

872
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,060
 You didn't get to take one for two years.

873
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,780
 But now you got a degree in one hand,

874
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,660
 holding a diploma.

875
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,500
 The rest of you is submerged in warm water.

876
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,580
 No tricks.

877
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,180
 That's actually it.

878
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:16,700
 So this episode is a little inconsistent, I know.

879
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,700
 But that would be lame.

880
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,500
 If you went through the trouble of summoning a demon

881
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,420
 and all they did was say, "Look, again,

882
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,260
 if I was an old, timey dude,

883
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,300
 that would be super useful.

884
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,540
 But nowadays..."

885
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,020
 Jason, I can't believe you gave such a gruesome ending.

886
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,820
 I totally expected to get boiled alive

887
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,180
 that other person got buried alive.

888
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,700
 Ah, they'll get used to it.

889
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,220
 Or the oxygen will run out, one of the two.

890
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,620
 As we're walking through the call center,

891
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,980
 we see a crocodile in there.

892
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,620
 We're like, "That's weird, right?"

893
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,020
 We didn't know if there was any animals in here.

894
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,140
 Do animals have souls?

895
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,340
 Or they go, "What did a crocodile do to go to hell?"

896
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,540
 But then we see a little bit more of the crocodile.

897
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,060
 And we see like it's two little legs,

898
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,900
 and we see more of it.

899
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,300
 And then we see an old man,

900
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,140
 an old pale naked dude sitting on this crocodile.

901
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,980
 And I turn.

902
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,420
 I turn to you guys and go,

903
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,980
 "If you picked number two,

904
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,500
 "that's you, right?"

905
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,340
 You're gonna, you know,

906
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,780
 this naked old guy,

907
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,420
 riding on the back of a crocodile.

908
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,140
 We're looking at a gauri's.

909
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,100
 He's sitting there on his crocodile, he's petting it.

910
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,260
 He's like, "You wanna pet my crocodile?"

911
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,020
 He says, "It's straddling it.

912
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,780
 "You wanna pet my crocodile number two?"

913
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,420
 And you walk, "Oh man."

914
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,260
 So you're like petting it.

915
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,900
 And the crocodile's actually pretty chill, dude.

916
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,820
 It's just kind of like relaxing, you're scratching it.

917
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,140
 Do crocodiles have ears?

918
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,580
 You're scratching it behind the eyes.

919
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,420
 It's like, "Oh yeah, that's the spot."

920
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,780
 A gauri's has 31 legions of demons.

921
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,980
 So a lot of people are listening to this old man

922
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,300
 on the back of a crocodile.

923
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,700
 You know you have to be pretty low-down with a total pole

924
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,700
 if you get your orders from a naked old man.

925
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,100
 You know that you're not doing too well.

926
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,100
 People are like, "Who's your boss?"

927
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
 Ah, dude, it's awesome.

928
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,940
 It's this guy with like eight wings,

929
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,500
 10 eyes, flames for vocal cords.

930
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,300
 Who's your boss?

931
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,700
 Old, naked man on a crocodile?

932
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,260
 Oh man.

933
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,580
 A gauri says, "Hop on the back of my crocodile, kid."

934
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,820
 We're going on a little adventure and then he winks.

935
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,180
 There's a little magical wink.

936
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,020
 And (whooshing)

937
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,020
 Crocodile's walking hella slow, dude.

938
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,620
 Crocodiles are like, "What are the slow?"

939
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,380
 How did you pick that as your motor transportation?

940
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,940
 Crocodiles are super slow.

941
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,420
 They can go 30 miles an hour.

942
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,020
 So it like zips along for a bit

943
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,500
 and then just starts going real slow again.

944
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,460
 You're riding the back of this crocodile.

945
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,260
 And a gauri takes you to a New York street.

946
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,340
 The year is 1982.

947
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,980
 There's a bunch of muggers on the street.

948
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,340
 They're having a mugger convention.

949
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,060
 They're mugging each other.

950
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,140
 You just see random acts of violence

951
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,980
 in the streets of New York.

952
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,820
 It's loud.

953
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,740
 It's smelly.

954
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,940
 There's a crocodile walking down Times Square.

955
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,500
 You're sitting on the back and super weird.

956
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,220
 There's a naked man driving it.

957
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,380
 No one's even paying attention.

958
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,860
 The city is such a cesspool at this point.

959
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,020
 And a gauri says, "You know why we're here, boy?"

960
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,300
 He's calling you boy, which is making you super uncomfortable.

961
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,540
 The fact that you're with this old man,

962
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,580
 he keeps referring to how young you are.

963
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,180
 He keeps referring to you that,

964
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,620
 but he doesn't mean it that way.

965
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,820
 He's unintentionally creepy.

966
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,860
 He puts his hands on your knee.

967
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,420
 He turns around and he says,

968
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,180
 "You know why we're here, boy?

969
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,180
 I have the ability to help find runaways."

970
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,180
 You're like, "What?

971
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,020
 That's kind of weird.

972
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,980
 That's kind of a bizarre ability to have."

973
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,660
 He's like, "Yeah, why didn't you get in line quick enough?"

974
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
 I was running an alligator.

975
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,540
 When they were giving out special powers,

976
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,500
 I was the last in line.

977
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,580
 I have the ability to find runaways.

978
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,780
 So he sits there and he goes,

979
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,580
 "Runaways, come back."

980
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,980
 And then you see a couple people go, "Huh, what?"

981
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,220
 They get out of their cardboard houses,

982
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,060
 or one of them is about to step off the bus

983
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,340
 and they look up and then they get back on the bus

984
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,940
 and the guy who gets out of the cardboard house

985
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,380
 walks out, picks up the phone, calls his mom,

986
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,020
 "I'm coming back home, mom."

987
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,820
 I just heard a crocodile yell,

988
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,500
 "Runaways, come home."

989
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,900
 The mom's like, "Billy, are you still doing drugs?"

990
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,100
 Yes, I am, but I'm still coming home.

991
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,900
 He has the ability to find runaways.

992
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,340
 He also has the, that's fine, that's noble, right?

993
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,660
 And again, I think that would make sense

994
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,180
 in like a hunter-gatherer society

995
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,620
 'cause if you ran away from that,

996
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,380
 you're like, "Are you gonna go gather more stuff?"

997
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,740
 Yeah, sure, and then you run off

998
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,460
 and you're at like some arcade.

999
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,980
 You invent an arcade here in the middle of the wilderness,

1000
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,820
 playing arcade.

1001
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,500
 In early societies, people would run away,

1002
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,220
 they would almost always die

1003
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,180
 and it would definitely impact the society.

1004
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,300
 So to have a demon that could actually hunt down runaways

1005
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,540
 or send them back home, that's pretty noble.

1006
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,420
 I could see people using that.

1007
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,500
 But then they also have the ability,

1008
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,820
 this is weird, it's not an opposite thing.

1009
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,020
 (laughs)

1010
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,420
 When I read this, I go, "What, it doesn't make sense.

1011
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,940
 "What's the opposite of a runaway to you?"

1012
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:08,940
 He has this power that if you're standing still,

1013
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,140
 he can make you run.

1014
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,300
 That's not the opposite of a runaway.

1015
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,420
 That doesn't make any sense.

1016
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,500
 What does he have that power?

1017
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,820
 Someone's checking, there was someone's walking down the street

1018
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,140
 and they stopped to check their watch

1019
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,020
 and then all of a sudden they're like in Toronto,

1020
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,540
 they're like, "What am I doing here?"

1021
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,660
 They ran all the way.

1022
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,980
 Doesn't make any sense.

1023
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,340
 Why would you have an opposite power?

1024
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
 The person who talked to you was strong to me.

1025
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,380
 He also didn't give you brain damage.

1026
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,900
 It was just the thing he did.

1027
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,500
 He didn't have to do an opposite.

1028
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,020
 Now if you picked number two,

1029
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,700
 you've been running for a couple days now,

1030
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,020
 you got great legs but you're like,

1031
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,220
 please let this torment end.

1032
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,140
 And every show often he goes,

1033
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,740
 "Runaways, come back."

1034
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,220
 And then you show back at his house,

1035
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,700
 that's you live with him now.

1036
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,620
 That's where he returned to.

1037
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,460
 And you'll talk for a bit.

1038
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,740
 And you have to constantly be moving.

1039
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,140
 If you stand still for just a moment,

1040
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,420
 you start running away.

1041
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,300
 But after this goes on for a millennium or two,

1042
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,260
 after he gets tired of dealing with this,

1043
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,220
 he's gonna teach you a new power,

1044
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,280
 the power he's most known for.

1045
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,780
 He says, "Come here, you look so good."

1046
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,140
 You're a young man, you've grown up so much.

1047
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,260
 Ooh, look at those legs.

1048
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,580
 Now it is creepy.

1049
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,100
 He goes, "Listen."

1050
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,260
 I've taught you about running.

1051
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,020
 You can't teach me about running away.

1052
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,940
 You made me run away.

1053
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,220
 He's like, "Okay, okay.

1054
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,700
 Now I'm gonna teach you my biggest power."

1055
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,460
 And then the earth begins to move under your feet.

1056
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,340
 (groaning)

1057
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,580
 You're pretending to be shocked.

1058
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,900
 You just want this to be over with.

1059
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,340
 You're like, "Oh, okay, this is so amazing."

1060
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,180
 He has the power to cause earthquakes.

1061
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,900
 Agarys has the power to actually destroy the land.

1062
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,980
 So because you've been such a noble servant of his,

1063
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,660
 such good entertainment, running everywhere,

1064
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,460
 he touches you and gives you the power to create earthquakes.

1065
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,820
 He has another power.

1066
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,140
 He has the power to teach you immoral expressions.

1067
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,100
 Technically he has the power to cause earthquakes as well.

1068
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,740
 But I can't think of anything funny to do with that.

1069
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,180
 So instead, we're gonna skip that superpower

1070
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,380
 that's actually functional in the real world.

1071
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,460
 Like you could fight crime,

1072
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,460
 but like burglars are trying to break into a bank

1073
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,780
 and you're like, "Not today."

1074
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,220
 You can't come with good catch lines.

1075
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,900
 You spent 2,000 years in hell.

1076
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,740
 But then you shake the world

1077
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,380
 and you destroy all of civilization

1078
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,500
 to stop two bank robbers.

1079
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,140
 They drop the coins.

1080
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,860
 You're like, "Another job done for number two."

1081
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,500
 You turn around and the world is flattened.

1082
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,940
 There's no building standing.

1083
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,220
 Hey, nevermind.

1084
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,740
 I check out something funny.

1085
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,780
 That's what happened.

1086
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,340
 If you picked number two,

1087
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,380
 you try to use your powers for good,

1088
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,460
 but you accidentally kill everyone,

1089
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,140
 stopping a bank robbery.

1090
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,420
 There you go.

1091
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,260
 There you go.

1092
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,260
 That is if you pick number two.

1093
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,380
 We got one more left.

1094
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,740
 I'm not running out of steam.

1095
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,940
 I swear, it's just getting really hot in here.

1096
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,020
 Now it's just me and number four

1097
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,540
 walking through the Hellish Call Center

1098
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,300
 and there's a dark room off to the side.

1099
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,300
 If you pick number four,

1100
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,620
 you gotta open that dark door in hell

1101
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,620
 and walk through it.

1102
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,660
 Hello, hello, hello.

1103
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,980
 Is anyone here?

1104
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,820
 Here?

1105
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,660
 Here?

1106
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,340
 You don't hear anything,

1107
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,940
 but you can sense there's something in this room.

1108
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,700
 And you hear someone go,

1109
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,900
 "My name is Gamigen."

1110
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,020
 That's a real demon name.

1111
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,500
 It's not a D&D character that a 12-year-old came up with.

1112
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,500
 "I am Gamigen and I see that you're here to summon me."

1113
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,700
 You're like, "Yeah."

1114
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,940
 I'm the one who started this episode

1115
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,700
 and I was curious, so I kept finishing it

1116
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,260
 and I picked number four, so here we are.

1117
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,220
 What are you gonna do to me?

1118
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,420
 And he goes, "I am going to teach you

1119
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,420
 "the liberal sciences like that other dude."

1120
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,860
 That other dude, previous, but that warm bath thing.

1121
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,780
 That's lame, man.

1122
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,740
 I'm a gossip.

1123
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,620
 I'm the worst kind of gossip.

1124
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,460
 I gossip about people after they die.

1125
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,700
 I can actually tell you,

1126
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,220
 people who have died the sins they've committed.

1127
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,780
 You're like, "Well, yeah, I mean, I guess that'd be more

1128
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,780
 "useful if you told me what they were doing

1129
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,060
 "while they were alive.

1130
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,820
 "Can't really do anything about it after they're dead.

1131
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,780
 "If they're stealing from me,

1132
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,900
 "I kind of want to know about it while they're alive."

1133
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,500
 He goes, "Yeah, not the best trait,

1134
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,660
 "but it's way better than that warm bath thing."

1135
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,620
 And you're like, "Yeah, it is way better."

1136
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,540
 He goes, "I can also, if that didn't sell you on it,

1137
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,100
 "you want to know I can tell you about people who drowned.

1138
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,220
 (laughs)

1139
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,020
 "I can tell you, I can name every single person

1140
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,500
 "who's ever drowned in the history of the world."

1141
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,780
 Argy, Argalo, he starts naming him off

1142
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,980
 and he gets the D and you're like, "Oh my God,

1143
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,500
 "how much time has passed?

1144
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,980
 "I don't want to keep hearing people

1145
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,780
 "drawn in the ocean."

1146
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,140
 That's horrible, he's like, "No, no, no, drowned at sea."

1147
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,700
 I don't know the people who died in oceans

1148
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,220
 or tributaries or lakes,

1149
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,940
 only people who drowned in the sea.

1150
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,020
 You're like, "What?

1151
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
 "That's even more useless.

1152
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,180
 "He's like, "Yeah, yeah, I guess that's why

1153
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,380
 "they keep me in this little room."

1154
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,980
 But you see, unlike those other demons

1155
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,260
 who eventually leave, I'm sorry about your friend,

1156
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,100
 you got buried alive.

1157
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,140
 (laughs)

1158
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,380
 It was so grim compared to the rest of them.

1159
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,580
 They leave eventually.

1160
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,700
 I stick with you forever and ever and ever.

1161
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,580
 You'll never get rid of me.

1162
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,900
 Good old gammy-gin, friend to the end, that's my motto.

1163
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,420
 Also, I can name everyone who died in the sea,

1164
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,460
 that's also my motto, that's underneath the motto.

1165
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,940
 You're like, "Oh man."

1166
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:45,780
 And then you see gammy-gin.

1167
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,980
 He walks towards you.

1168
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,180
 It's a little pony.

1169
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,060
 Gammy-gin shows up as a pony

1170
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,100
 who will never leave your side.

1171
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:02,580
 He gives you a little saddle that's just for you.

1172
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,660
 He made it out of human flesh

1173
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,140
 of people who drowned in the sea.

1174
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,860
 You're like, "Ugh, gross, do I have to use this?"

1175
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,740
 He's like, "Yes."

1176
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,460
 And put this bit in my mouth.

1177
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,860
 This is feet out of the or bones of sinners.

1178
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,340
 You're like, "Ugh, gross."

1179
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,660
 But you get on top of gammy-gin, your friend to the end,

1180
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,740
 a little pony that you get to ride out of hell.

1181
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,060
 And for the rest of your life,

1182
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,740
 you're sitting now, you have to go back to your real college.

1183
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,180
 He's answering all the questions.

1184
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,060
 He's like, "Ugh, actually, no."

1185
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,540
 Emily Dinkinsen did not mean that in her poem.

1186
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,180
 I know I'm a talking pony from hell.

1187
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,500
 You actually, that is good.

1188
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,180
 So you get to have a friend to the end.

1189
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,980
 You get to have a pony right around whenever you,

1190
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,100
 like I said, account sheep at night.

1191
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,980
 He just names off the list of the dead who've died at sea.

1192
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,300
 And somehow you find that calming.

1193
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,500
 He's the best man at your wedding.

1194
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,300
 He's like helping you tie your bow.

1195
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,060
 He throws your bachelor party.

1196
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,300
 It's a bunch of demon babes show up.

1197
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,860
 This is an amazing thing.

1198
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,900
 Gammigan truly is your friend to the end.

1199
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,580
 On your deathbed, you're laying there.

1200
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:11,580
 You're like, "Gammigan, now that I'm super old and naked

1201
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,060
 "and I'm about to crawl on top of this crocodile,

1202
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,300
 "I want you to know that you truly were my friend.

1203
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,940
 "I never would have made it

1204
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,540
 "through all those liberal art classes

1205
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,420
 "if it wasn't for your jokes.

1206
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,980
 "And you constantly setting the teacher on fire.

1207
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,500
 "Oh, the days.

1208
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,220
 "And then you were always by my side.

1209
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,980
 "All that stuff, all those memories.

1210
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,660
 "This was a beautiful moment, Gammigan.

1211
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,020
 "And you're like petting his mane.

1212
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,020
 "And he's like trying to hold back a tear.

1213
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,540
 "The first tear that this demon has cried

1214
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,020
 "since he was thrust out of heaven.

1215
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,820
 "And Gammigan looks at you and goes,

1216
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,140
 "I love you, number four.

1217
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,140
 "I love you, number four.

1218
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,700
 "You never learned your name.

1219
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,900
 "Throughout all of that,

1220
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,100
 "he never ever learned your name.

1221
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,500
 "He called you number four the whole time.

1222
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,620
 "But then he goes, I love you,

1223
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,380
 "but I want to remember you.

1224
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,940
 "I want to make sure that I never forget you.

1225
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,180
 "And you're like, no, Gammigan.

1226
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,180
 "No, please just let me die peacefully.

1227
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,020
 "He grabs you with his hooves.

1228
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,460
 "He grabs you with his ultra strong hooves.

1229
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,180
 "He drags you out of bed

1230
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,900
 "where you were about to die peacefully.

1231
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,900
 "He drags you across the country to a sea,

1232
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,020
 "a glimmering sea underneath the moon.

1233
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,620
 "And he holds you down with those little hooves.

1234
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,340
 "He holds your head underwater.

1235
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,020
 "And as you gurgle and gas for air,

1236
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,660
 "he goes, if you drown at sea, I'll never forget you.

1237
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,660
 "I'll never forget you.

1238
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,780
 "I'll never forget you.

1239
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,940
 "I'll never forget you.

1240
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,620
 "I'll never forget you."

1241
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,660
 So there you go.

1242
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,660
 (crickets chirping)

1243
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:01,660
 If you picked, who got buried alive?

1244
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,620
 I don't even remember who got buried alive now.

1245
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,020
 But if you picked number four,

1246
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,220
 I think it was the even ones that got shafted this episode.

1247
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,900
 If you picked number four,

1248
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,500
 or number, who did get buried alive?

1249
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,340
 I don't remember.

1250
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,580
 So if you picked number one,

1251
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,020
 number four, you did not have a good,

1252
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,580
 well, at least number four had a long life.

1253
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,660
 So there we go.

1254
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,100
 Episode 666 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

1255
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,140
 I hope there are 666 more episodes,

1256
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,420
 and further and further on.

1257
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,340
 Guys, I hope you had as much fun listening

1258
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,660
 to this episode as I had recording it.

1259
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,700
 I had an absolute ball,

1260
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,980
 but it is time for me to return to the crypt.

1261
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,380
 Also known as my recliner in the living room,

1262
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,660
 so I can watch episodes with practical jokers

1263
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,300
 and other YouTube videos.

1264
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,540
 (evil laughter)

1265
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,120
 (upbeat music)

1266
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:00,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

1267
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:11,620
 (upbeat music)

1268
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,200
 (upbeat music)

1269
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,780
 (upbeat music)

1270
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,360
 (upbeat music)

1271
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,940
 (upbeat music)

1272
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,520
 (upbeat music)

1273
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,100
 (upbeat music)

1274
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,680
 (upbeat music)
