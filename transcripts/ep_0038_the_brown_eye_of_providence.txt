 A man is found crucified in South Korea. Is it murder or suicide? And does the all
 seeing eye on the back of the dollar bill really is it really a butthole today
 on Dead Rabbit Radio?
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your
 host Jason Carpenter. Hope you're having a great day. I'm having a great day. It's
 107. I think this might be a record for Hood River. It says on my phone it only
 feels like 101 so I guess that's some sort of solace but I disagree. I don't
 know if it necessarily feels like 107 but we're just a little more humid up here
 than you know other places I've been in that been this hot. What's up with this
 heatwave? It's driving me nuts. The only good thing I like about the heatwaves means
 we're going to have a very mild winter and I hate the snow so I'm totally fine
 with there being a mild winter. I'm totally good with that. So last night
 the play wrapped up. I've talked about being in it before. We just got done with
 another play we're doing Spoon River Anthology. It's actually kind of
 interesting. I might go back and read it. Oh I mean yeah I see I technically when
 I'm doing a play I don't pay attention to anything else anyone's doing on stage
 unless it relates directly to me and my character. Just kind of a little method I
 have. Also cuts down on people asking me for advice on how to do stuff because I
 just go I don't really pay attention to what you're doing. After the end of the
 party I'm I'm known for mixing my drinks and not like in the traditional like a
 little martini a little grenadier. Stuff like that I took. So we had Coca-Cola
 because I was taking a break on the keto. We had Coca-Cola and we had some wine so
 I mixed half Coca-Cola half house red. It was delicious. I'm not a big alcoholic.
 Well I'm not a big alcoholic but I'm not a big I don't drink a lot of alcohol I
 guess would be a better way to put it. It tastes really good. It tasted like
 basically cherry Coke and I was very proud of myself and somebody named it
 the woke you know like wine and coke but when I woke up this morning I'm pretty
 sure that's I'm pretty sure that's when Michael Jackson was giving to kids
 allegedly allegedly he gave them something called Jesus juice which was
 wine served in a soda can. So provided that the soda can was completely empty
 when he gave them Jesus juice I think I'm in the clear but if you ever come
 across some red wine and some Coca-Cola you know one time I mixed I got curious
 what would happen if you mixed Coca-Cola and Pepsi in together and it tastes
 like RC Cola. It tastes almost identical to RC Cola so I'm wondering if the RC
 Cola factory is just like two vats of Coke and Pepsi pouring into individual
 bottles I don't know but I you know I was funny I never thought of mixing those
 two before I wonder how many people have. Try it try mixing other drinks I I
 don't know where I'm going with this I'm just gonna go ahead and jump into the
 first story because I think that kind of ran out of steam so a while back we did
 food-based conspiracies and that's when we did deep soy and fake cabbage and all
 of that and this week I wanted to do another theme one so I've decided to
 do sex-based conspiracies conspiracies or paranormal events that have to do
 with sex and there's a lot of them actually we have some really good ones
 this week the first one we're gonna talk about is an interesting one
 apparently let's do a quick overview so the all-seeing eye is the pyramid and
 the top has the eyeball it's a very familiar logo if you've ever handled
 US currency it's supposed to be the the eye of Providence is what it's known as
 people have said you it's a Masonic symbol it's a lot of times it's tied
 into the Illuminati and it's just kind of this logo like we're always watching
 people have said it's like the eye of Lucifer or you know it has all these
 negative connotations especially when it gets tied into the Illuminati actually
 you know I've seen kids like little kids hold up their hands like a triangle and
 they're like Illuminati I'm in the Illuminati and blah blah blah and they
 don't know what they're doing but it's still a little chilling still a little
 creepy but anyway so this guy on Reddit of all places this was where I could find
 the most information on this conspiracy theory I don't necessarily because I
 found other sites that talked about it don't think that he came up with it
 himself but he's definitely put it in the most I hate to use the word logical
 but the most coherent form of this conspiracy theory so the theory is if
 he first off starts off by saying why isn't porn why doesn't porn have the
 same copyright hounds that every other industry has like if I posted a video of
 Pacific Rim uprising on YouTube I'm gonna get hit with a DMCA notice so it's
 basically a takedown notice saying that I've violated copyright however when we
 look at porn websites they it's all pirated material and he's specifically
 saying they'll use major pop songs in those videos so you'll see a video and
 it'll just be a compilation video of cream pies or whatever oh I guess I
 should say this is gonna be this week's probably gonna be pretty explicit
 episodes they're gonna have explicit tags you might want to wear your headphones
 I probably should have said that in the beginning but anyways so I'll keep the
 cursing low but the subject matter still still gonna be kind of intense so you
 have a Britney Spears song said to a compilation of facials or whatever and
 he's saying why isn't the why aren't these videos being taken down by the major
 companies and that's a fair point honestly it's a fair point we'll get to
 that he then postulates saying that the reason why they don't get taken down by
 Hollywood is because Hollywood is part of this Illuminati conspiracy to degrade
 humanity to make humans feel less feel more isolated from me from themselves
 and to basically make us immoral and then goes on to say how come there's a much
 a straight anal porn all of a sudden now if you haven't picked up by now this
 guy watches a lot of porn and I'm not just saying that it's some sort of
 something I've picked out he actually says that he came to this theory quoting
 him it was something that just came out at me in a flash in a matter of
 speaking while I was watching a girl get plowed from behind by a BBC so he's
 watching a ton of porn and coming up with these conspiracy theories he's
 saying why is straight porn so anal specific nowadays why is there so much
 of it and his reasoning is that the Illuminati and the Freemasons and they're
 kind of one in the same and in his view they want to break down humanity and
 make us debase and immoral people and the whole idea of the Freemasons is to mock
 religion to mock God and his kind of overall point is if you if the pyramid
 if the all-C and I is supposed to be a replacement for God it's supposed to be
 a parody of religious symbols then maybe the pyramid is a parody of itself
 meaning that it's not a pyramid it's actually a it's the backside of a vagina
 between the legs with the anus perched atop as the eye of providence and those
 are his exact words so basically we're not looking at the all-C and I we're
 looking at this butthole now I know you're thinking Jason this is just one
 lunatic online why are you why are you doing a segment on this guy well what
 was funny is not it's not just him there's other people who believe this
 stuff so this other article they're talking about something called AN this
 is talking about like Egyptian mythology Egyptian iconography and they go into
 say that the AN represents the anus which is obviously associated with
 darkness things done in darkness and the darkness in the bowels of office sorry
 and the darkness in the bowels of the orifice of perjait purgation
 purgation so this isn't just this guy like there are people are making this
 connection that the all-C and I is actually supposed to be I have to say
 I've looked at a lot of buttholes today researching these articles there's a
 lot of pictures of buttholes so all the links are going to be non-safe for work
 the thing is is like I know what a butthole looks like you don't have to
 do put a close-up picture of it on your website if you're trying to convince me
 that first off it makes me less likely of your argument because there's
 nothing that looks less than a human eye than a butthole the only thing they
 have in common is they're both circles that's ridiculous but you're gonna look
 at a lot of buttholes if you click on the links I probably should sit down in
 the beginning too so is the all-C and I representative of the human butthole now
 he goes on the the guy who wrote the reddit article he starts connecting this
 more saying that you know the Freemasons have connections to North Norse
 mythology and that Odin is often seen carrying a giant dildo around which I
 missed that in the Thor movies but Odin is represented in carrying a giant dildo
 around that he penetrates himself with and and you thought it stopped there no
 witches and broomsticks the broomsticks were dildos they weren't like broomsticks
 they flow around on they're dildos they masturbated with as they thought of
 Satan and little known fact the Nazis have taken over the planet since
 September 11 2001 and they are using the power of the butthole to control us all
 all of that stuff according to this guy is absolutely true now the thing that I
 the trouble I usually have with conspiracy theories is they do tend to
 cast a wide net he would have done a much better job these people would have
 done a much better job convincing me and like I said I go into all these
 conspiracy theories with the hypothesis that they are true if he said the butthole
 the all-C and I is really human butthole and it's because the Masons came up with
 it and the Masons love but sex and they have gay sex all the time or something
 like that and they kept it there I would still think it was a little ridiculous
 but when you try to tie it into witches and Nazis and North Missal North
 mythology and Egyptians and 9/11 and all this stuff it just totally ruins the
 point and when you tell me you came up with this theory while watching
 interracial anal porn and then he brags also that he never pays for porn oh and
 to go back to the copyright thing there are entire companies dedicated to
 shutting down pirated and copyrighted porn so his his idea that none of it is
 ever none of it is ever taken down because the Illuminati is controlling
 the porn industry it's not true there are companies that porn and porn
 companies and anyone can hire to go into these websites and give them DMCA's the
 problem is is that when you take a video down someone else just uploads it there
 is huge money behind porn and I go back to the point I've made a couple times on
 the show stop watching porn it's just not healthy for you I don't care about
 the moral issues behind it because that may not affect you it actually
 physically affects your body you watch a lot of porn it makes you impudent you
 stop watching porn you will stop being impudent that's steady after steady after
 steady show and it causes erectile dysfunction and then stop watching
 porn it also causes you to come up with crazy conspiracy theories but again I'm
 gonna circle back one more time is it possible that the all-cni is
 representative of something other than the all-cni sure why not it's a it's a
 icon is it possible that it represents a buckle you know what honestly this is
 one of those things that if it's either or if somebody was able to provide me
 more coherent proof that wasn't brought up while they were watching porn and they
 go no we actually like if you look at the early text the people who came up with
 it thought it'd be funny or no it is like this esoteric symbol that the eye
 represents both what sees and what leaves the body I'll be like okay yeah sure as
 it stands now I think this guy's just kind of nuts but you know it's one of
 those things that and again either way it wouldn't really have any bearing on my
 life whether I would laugh every time I handed someone a dollar bill thought of
 it but yeah it's one of those weird conspiracies that it's it's possible I
 guess it's highly unlikely but it's possible there's other stuff that we've
 covered that I'm like no that absolutely didn't happen there's proof that it
 didn't happen but this is one of those ones that I mean you get a bunch of guys
 together and they start designing stuff maybe they do decide to have a laugh now
 what the what the all-cni is supposed to represent they always talk about the the
 eye of Providence you'll hear that referred to in conspiracy circles or
 the all-cni it's considered the all-cni of God it's supposed to be the eye of
 God watching over humanity that's why it's called Providence like it's this
 divine providence so I mean it is an old symbol I don't think it was supposed to
 be a butthole I think it's easy if you stare at something long enough or if you
 watch enough porn and you're thinking about it and you're seeing all these
 buttholes quench in front of you and they look like they're winking and I'm not a
 big fan of anal anyways but you know it looks like it's winking to make sure
 they get an eye whatever I think that the gentleman who wrote the first off I
 think he needs to stop watching porn so now I don't think that the eye of
 Providence is a butthole I think that kind of went without saying I do think
 that like he can weave an interesting story and maybe he should use maybe
 should stop watching porn and write I mean like he could write basically say
 national treasure meets you know like filthy facials volume 7 and have kind of
 this hero going on this quest to unearth this orgy Freemason group that's
 drawing these images in our money that makes us want to have butt sex with each
 other someone would buy that I think that'd be an interesting story bunch of
 Freemasons run around banging each other drawing buttholes everywhere they have to
 follow the clues they're looking at like the Constitution and they work out
 every other word and it gives you a web address that's on Ex Hamster the you go
 to you go to the you go to Mount Rushmore and like if you come on the
 four faces in the right order like this vault opens up and it's full of these
 it's full it has Odin's dildo in there I mean you know he could come up with
 these great scenarios just you using this core idea maybe he actually has
 something but no the eye of the Providence the eye of Providence is not
 but I'm glad I was able to finally put that at rest that was actually one on
 the conspiracy list as well so like I said there's a lot of weird stuff on
 there but we that one's done it's settled unless more information pops up
 which it probably won't but in but in case it does next story is really bizarre
 and it's one that I came across years and years ago it's funny because I used to
 just research weird events and then you know find I get books I read websites
 and I kind of bookmark stuff and I that was just kind of it I would just
 research it and then call it a day and as I started doing this podcast I've been
 going back through some moment old bookmarks I came across this story and
 it's still surprised me I was still like that's absolutely impossible so this
 story is back from 2011 so you know quite old you know news wise so in South
 Korea I found this man crucified and crucified in the traditional way his
 feet were nailed to the to the bottom of the cross his hands were nailed to the
 cross he had a rope around his neck and he had a mirror oh and he had a crown of
 thorns just like Jesus you know Jesus did and imagery had a crown of thorns on
 he had a stab wound in his stomach where the Romans stabbed Jesus and there was a
 mirror in front of his face oh and there was two smaller crosses on the side
 those were empty but anyway so some guy finds it and they goes back he
 puffs off calls the cops the cops show up and they're looking around and they
 see all this stuff they're like okay yeah there's his feet you know they'll to
 that and stab wound and the mirror was in his face so he could look at his own
 suffering and you're I'm reading this I'm reading the article years ago me like
 oh man that's super brutal and I was reading it again last week and I am
 like oh man that's awful like was it like a drug deal gone wrong was a day
 like some sort of mafia Asian mafia send in a message you get to the last
 sentence in the article it says police still aren't sure if this case was a
 homicide or a suicide and I'm like what are you what are you how do you
 crucify yourself how do you commit suicide via crucifixion I know there's
 some crazy ways you can kill yourself but that's
 wait for that dog to pass I must have psychic powers right when I said that
 oh well maybe I don't that's the way people usually come up they say may have
 psychic powers they just think something and something happens and then they're
 like I'm gifted anyways so it's a hundred and seven I can't shut the windows
 that's the problem but I'm not gonna worry about it he's a happy little puppy
 he can bargol he wants I don't care anyway so I read this article and I was
 like okay this happened in 2011 they have to have some sort of resolution to
 this by now and the cops did finally rule he killed himself and they actually
 had to put on a presentation to prove because no one would believe how do you
 kill yourself you crucifixion so the police reenacted it listen to what this
 guy did so apparently he was this hyper religious guy and before he ended up in
 the quarry where they found the crucifix he had emptied his bank account he had
 planned they found notes about his crucifixion he canceled his mobile phone
 contract according to this now of course you could always say someone made him
 I'll do that to kill him and all that stuff but the cops are actually able to
 figure out how he did this so they said that and this might sound a little
 extreme and go all that sounds ridiculous but this is the cops hypothesis so he
 nailed his own feet to the cross first okay then he lifted his back up and put
 the rope or the rope is hanging off the cross already he put his head in the
 rope now that's Jesus didn't die have a rope around his neck but it takes quite
 a few quite a few days to actually die of crucifixion I think he's just beating
 that process up anyways then he stabs himself on the side so his feet are
 nailed to the crucifix who puts his head in the rope he stabs himself on the side
 oh man this sucks and then he drilled holes in his hands and there was already
 nails in the cross and he lifted his hands up and pushed the nail like head
 through his hand and got him both in there and then just slumped and if they
 died of a combination of blood loss and suffocation because when you when you're
 crucified even without the rope you can't hold up Jesus wasn't crucified
 through his hands by the way that's a misnomer he was crucified through his
 wrists but what happens is when you crucified people we know that
 scientifically your body will slump and your head will kind of push down into
 your chest and you can't breathe so you lift yourself up to get a couple more
 breaths but it's you have really no upper body strength it's not like these
 people are on a torch now they start to slump again they start to not breathe
 again you do that for about two or three days and you die a couple hours
 depending on because your lung capacity so it's very torturous way to die you
 can you imagine back in the day they talk about these accounts for people
 would travel down roads and they would just be crucified soldiers like
 crucified prisoners lining the road I mean we complain if we go to Cancun and
 there's a head in the pool could you imagine going to Bulgaria and there's
 500 people crucified and you're like this isn't where I want to be right now
 that was just and but you would just be like oh something was to happen here
 well I still got to go do business in this town you know it's bizarre but you
 just see that and you can't help them you can't help them because then you'll end
 up on there so anyways yeah there was a suicide apparently and again it's
 possible that this guy was murdered and this was all an attempt attempt to
 cover it up but the neighbors were like he was super religious they didn't really
 shock anybody he made the plans if there's a will there's a way as grim as
 that sounds if you want to crucify yourself you will plan out how to and
 that probably helped them to where they found how he planned they found notes on
 his crucifixion the police probably be able to go okay that's how he got his
 hands nailed into the cross he drilled his hands beforehand the nails are already
 there and he just hoisted it over you know at some point I'm sure he totally
 regretted doing that I mean he could have been caught up in some whole
 religious fear fervor but after like hour four he may have been like I'll never
 see Big Bang Theory again well that's gonna be all we're gonna have today for
