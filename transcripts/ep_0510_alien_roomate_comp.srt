1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 When two women are home alone, they hear someone rummaging in their backyard.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 When they go to confront the man, they find out he's on a mission from God.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we take a look at a woman who encounters alien life in her kitchen.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 The conversation was going quite swimmingly until she asked the alien to move in with her today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I got my haunted doll Veronica here. She's running co-host duties for us today.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Corey Dennis.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Corey, thank you so much for supporting the show. I always say it really, really helps out a lot.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I mean it guys. I feel like sometimes I'm just saying stuff like, "Hope you have a great day."

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 You don't have to listen to every episode. I mean this stuff. It probably sounds like a chant.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I do hope you guys are having a great day. And it means a lot when you guys support the Patreon.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 But if you can't support the Patreon, I mean this as well. That's okay too.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 When I say that stuff, it sounds mechanical, but I want to let you guys know I mean it.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Every single time I say it, you guys are so awesome. You guys rock.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I almost feel like my voice is getting a little emotional, but I want to let you guys know that.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I do hope you guys are having a great day. I hope you guys know.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I've been saying it for almost 500 episodes now. I truly, I am getting emotional when I'm saying this.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I truly do mean it. I truly do mean it guys. And it really, it's awesome when you guys support the Patreon.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 It's awesome when I'm online and I see other people talking about the show.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 You guys rock, dude. You guys rock so hard.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Corey, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 We're going up to Washington.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 A short journey from Oregon. We're headed right over the river. We're headed to Burien, Washington.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 This is actually an update to a story we did a while ago. It was episode 475.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Would you test the Devil's Trap?

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 In that story, we did something about randonautica, about how these teenagers had found body parts in a suitcase out on the border of Seattle.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Well, they've solved the case. I wanted to do this update. They've solved the case.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 There was actually two people, two dismembered people, in the trash bags in the big suitcase.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It was Jessica Lewis. She was 35 years old. And Austin Wenner. He was 27.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Both of them had been executed. Both of them had been shot.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Once they had the identities of the people, they could kind of figure out who it was.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 So a couple weeks before these bodies were discovered, the cops got a report of gunshots fired.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 They heard gunshots in this neighborhood. So the police went out there and people were saying the gunshots came from the home of Michael L. Dudley, a 62-year-old man.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 He was renting out a room to Jessica and Austin at the time.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 They were saying for $1,500 a month, a room, but they couldn't pay it.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Whether they lost their jobs because of the lockdowns, I don't know. I don't know what the circumstances were.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 But they couldn't pay it. Gunshots are heard in the area. The police go out there. They have to get a search warrant.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And they go into the room and they see bullet holes in the room and they see blood.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So Michael goes, "Oh, the blood was the girl who lived here?" She cut herself. She spilled blood.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 They're like, "Okay, that kind of makes sense, but what about the bullet holes?" And he's like, "Uh..."

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 He didn't have an answer for the bullet holes. So the cops left.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And then when the couple weeks go by, because what do you... you don't know.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I mean, a big part of police work, a huge part of police work is the confession.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I read so much true crime and it comes down to, do you confess or do you not confess?

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 If you... you can get found guilty either way just through a bunch of other evidence, but a lot of times it comes down to,

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 "Well, we don't know. There was gunshots. There was blood. I don't know how much blood there was."

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 The cops did say it looked like someone had been painting.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So it's not like the cops are like, "Ugh, we're just nothing to happen to there."

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 They just didn't have anything to go on at the time. But when these two bodies show up on the seaside,

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 they're able to actually identify the bodies, then they go, "Where'd these people live?"

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And they find out it was this guy's house. He's been arrested now.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 He was charged with two counts of first degree murder.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So at that point... so at this point we're still... it's all a legend and everything like that.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 But interesting follow-up. In that episode, I thought, "I wonder if they'll ever catch this guy?"

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 If those bodies had floated away, because the teens were following the Randonautica app to there,

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 the bodies had floated away, there's a chance that this dude never would have been caught,

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 because young people tend to be transient. It's easy to lose people, to lose younger people.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 But allegedly this guy murdered them and hopefully he is... if he's guilty, if he's guilty, I mean...

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 (laughs)

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 ...sure potential if there's gunshots in his house and there's bullet holes and stuff like that.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 But that is the follow-up to that story.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 So Corey worked to put... that's a sad story, but hopefully justice is done in that case,

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 but it's awful. We don't know the whole scope of it, but apparently they couldn't pay,

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 so he shot him. Ugh. Anyways, Corey, we're leaving behind Burian, Washington.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 We are headed out to Union, New Jersey. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 We're heading out to Union, New Jersey. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And it's like slowly going, "Ahh, ahh, make it extra creepy," right? I don't know, maybe it was just propped open, maybe there was a rock there.

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 But in my version, it's all, "Ahh, ahh, there's a crow, there's a giant black crow sitting on the shed."

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And they see stuff getting thrown out of the shed and they're like, "What's going on in there?"

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And they keep walking towards the shed and they're like, "Hey, hey, what's going on?"

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 They might have had more choice words to say, because obviously there's a weirdo in there, right?

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 They're not ET looking for something. Like, obviously, it's some dude rummaging through their stuff.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 What happens, though, is when they draw attention to themselves, a man jumps out of the shed, holding a knife in one hand,

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 and not a bouquet of flowers in the next one, the hatchet.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 So the worst combination of weapons, right? Outside of a chainsaw and a lightsaber.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 He jumps out of there with a knife and a hatchet and starts chopping these two women up.

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 They're completely defenseless. Like, you've probably figured at first the noise was a raccoon.

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Once you got out in there and saw stuff all spread across your lawn, probably figure it's a weirdo.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 But they weren't prepared for that. Their neighbor also hears the ruckus.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So he's already outside and he hears the attack going on on the other side of the fence.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 He grabs a baseball bat, jumps over the fence and just straight smashes this dude over the back of the head with his bat.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Just like, pfft. Now, he lives, despite the sound effect I made, his head wasn't made of paper mache.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 He actually lives, but the assault has stopped.

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Let's go back a day.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Never gonna meet a man named Morgan Mez. He's 25 years old.

88
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And he's sitting there and he's like, "Oh man, I just woke up. Don't know what I'm gonna do today."

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 "Oh yeah, I'm gonna smoke some synthetic weed."

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Remember when that stuff was super legal and you could buy it at the gas? This guy does. This guy totally does.

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But you used to be able to buy spice at gas stations.

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 He's sitting there, he's smoking synthetic weed.

93
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 He smoked 15 to 20 blunts.

94
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So even he doesn't know. He's just ballparking it, right?

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 That day, he smokes 15 to 20 blunts.

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And then the sun sets and he's like, "Oh dude, it was a really unproductive day. I better start doing some stuff."

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 But first, let me smoke 15 to 20 more synthetic blunts.

98
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 As he's smoking this stuff, he begins to think that he is a character in the Bible.

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 So I don't know if he imagined himself in a coat of many colors walking around with a staff,

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 or if he just imagined that he was in the Bible, he just couldn't find the right passage.

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 He just thought he was some sort of biblical character and he believed that God was giving him a mission.

102
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 He believed that there were children being held in hell, and the portal was somewhere near him.

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 He just needed to find that portal to rescue those kids.

104
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 A noble goal, obviously, not when you're high on drugs.

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Obviously, if you are trying to save children, that's the most noble thing you can do.

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 But again, if he did go into hell and was fighting Satan,

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 his reflexes might be a little dampened by the 40 synthetic joints he smoked.

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 But anyways, he thinks the portal of hell is in these women's shed.

109
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So he breaks into the shed and he's moving stuff around trying to find the gateway into hell.

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And then he hears the people behind him and maybe he thought they were arch demons or something like that.

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 We don't know. Maybe he doesn't even know.

112
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 He jumps out of the shed with a hatchet and a knife and starts attacking these women.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Now, what was horrible was that these two women were so...

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 They both survived. They both survived.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 They were so badly beat up by this attack. They were held in different wards of the hospital.

116
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 They were a married couple. And each one of them thought the other one was dead.

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Because they were all slashed up. And they kept asking, "How is she? How is she?"

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 In reference to her wife. And they go, "Oh, she's fine. She's fine. You just rest. You just rest."

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 So she's thinking, "Oh, she's dead and they just don't want me to know."

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And then when they go to the other woman, that woman's also like, "How's she doing? How's she doing?"

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And she's like, "Okay." And they're like, "Oh, just rest."

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So they didn't see each other for days. They thought the other one was dead, which would be a horrible thing to go through.

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 They're fine now. They had to go through years of therapy and physical reconstruction and stuff like that.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And they were talking... They were like, if that neighbor had not jumped that fence, he would have killed both of us.

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 There's no doubt in their mind. They're like, "You're going to watch interviews with them. There's stuff in the show notes."

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 They're like, "Talk about a guardian angel."

127
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 It's so funny, because if you think about it, this guy thought he was fighting the devil, but he ended up being the devil himself.

128
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And he ends up going to prison. In 2016, he's found guilty for two counts of attempted murder, 16 years each, in 2016.

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But this is the thing that always bugs me about covering these true crime stories.

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 In 2019, he got the case overturned.

131
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 What happened? This is so insane. This is so insane how the justice system worked.

132
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So he did three years. He did three years in prison for attacking two women with a knife and a hatchet.

133
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 On the one hand, he might be totally fine outside of the synthetic marijuana use.

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Back then, we didn't know how bad it was. Any drug you can buy at a gas station, I think is about as healthy as gas station food.

135
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 But we didn't know the full extent of how bad the spice stuff was.

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 So I didn't want... It's hard to say, because you don't want the guy to go away forever because he was tripping on these drugs.

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 But at the same time, he did three years. The reason why he only did three years was because the prosecutor presented evidence that they felt biased to the jury.

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 The prosecutor presented evidence, no joke, that made the defendant look insane.

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 So the defense goes, "But he shouldn't have been able to present that evidence."

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And the judge goes, "You're right. That guy who attacked those women thinking they were a portal to hell, people shouldn't have think he was insane."

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 This was the evidence the prosecutor showed.

142
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 The prosecutor showed that this wasn't a one-time thing. He loved smoking synthetic weed.

143
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 One point, the prosecutor placed this video where the guy, Morgan, was talking and he said, "Oh yeah, no, no, no.

144
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I've tripped out on synthetic weed before this, before I attacked these people."

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 One day, I almost attacked a five-year-old kid at a birthday party because I thought he was a leprechaun.

146
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And I wanted to kill that leprechaun because I thought he was like, "I wanted to spot a gold or something like that. I wanted my wishes."

147
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 But I saw a five-year-old and I thought he was a leprechaun and I wanted to, quote, "Yoke up on him," which is, "beat him up."

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And the defense lawyer goes, "He shouldn't have played that tape."

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 The judge goes, "You're right. That made him look crazy, so he got off."

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 So because he appeared so insane to the jury that made the judge go, "He's not really that insane,"

151
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 even though he said that he wanted to beat up a five-year-old kid because he thought he was a leprechaun,

152
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 and this case was about a portal to hell. I don't know, but anyways, he's out now.

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And again, if he's clean, if he's not using any drugs and his psychosis only came from drugs, then maybe he should be out.

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Like, I definitely wouldn't want to take him to any birthday parties, right?

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 I wouldn't want to dress up in a Halloween costume around him, but I'm hoping that he's better now.

156
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I'm hoping everything's better. It's just a weird case, the fact that you could have someone snap like that and attack two women.

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 But then it turns out that he didn't snap, that he was having previous delusions involving little kids and leprechauns.

158
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Is he still a danger to society? Is he okay to be free?

159
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 I didn't find any comment from the women after he was released.

160
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 The story just kind of died down. It was big news at the time, because it's kind of everyone's fear to just be brought up into a whirlwind of violence.

161
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 It was truly a random act. How often do you hear a noise outside and you go check on it?

162
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 You think maybe it's a raccoon? You think maybe it's a burglar or something like that?

163
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 You never expect it to be a man dual-wielding blades imagining you are what's preventing him from saving children from hell.

164
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Because he thought he was on a righteous mission. Nothing was going to stop him. He couldn't use that same defense with the leprechaun.

165
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 He just wanted some gold in that case, but it's just scary all around.

166
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 It's truly random violence against someone who believes they're on the right side of divine justice.

167
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Corey, let's go ahead and hop in that carpenter copter AND let's talk about the movie The Vanished, new today on digital.

168
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Ann Haitian Thomas Jane starring the gripping psychological thriller The Vanished.

169
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Directed by Peter Faccinelli, a family vacation takes a terrifying turn when two parents discover that their young daughter has vanished without a trace.

170
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Stopping at nothing to find her, the search for the truth leads to a shocking revelation where nothing is what it seems in this intense thriller.

171
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Own or rent The Vanished on digital today and watch it at home tonight.

172
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Rated R from Paramount Pictures.

173
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 So I have four digital copies to give away. I didn't talk about that much on yesterday's, when I was talking about it yesterday.

174
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I have four digital copies to give away. If you want one of these copies, I can't hold a contest.

175
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 This is really weird, it's some YouTube rule. But if you email me, put it in the YouTube comments, Instagram, Twitter, just bring it to my attention.

176
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 You want a copy? I'll pick people at random. Technically, that's not a contest. A contest I need something from you guys, like personal information.

177
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 However, you guys contact me, just say, "Hey, I'd like a copy of that movie." And then at the end of the week, I'll just randomly pick four people.

178
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 It's an interesting film. I kind of want to talk about it, but I don't want to talk about it now.

179
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I did enjoy watching it. I have a lot of stuff to say about it. But we'll hold that contest. It's not a contest, sorry.

180
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 We will hold that random selection. Just reach out to me in some way. Because I don't want to give them to people who don't want to see the movie, right?

181
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So if you're interested in the movie, just hit me up. Any way you hit me up, I'll just pick names at random.

182
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 So, Corey, let's go ahead. We are leaving behind the promo read we just did. We are headed out to Belarus, which is somewhere in Eastern Europe, I believe.

183
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 We're specifically going to Vietbisk Belarus. It's February 1990. It's 1040 AM.

184
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 The helicopter is flying off. We see this town in the middle of Belarus. And then we're going to meet a woman named Nadza.

185
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 She's a schoolteacher. She's getting ready for the day. She's making breakfast in her kitchen.

186
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 She's cooking up some eggs, some bacon. That's pretty hot for an egg, right? Eggs don't fry. I guess some eggs are fried, but...

187
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 She's pouring some orange juice. There's pulp in that. That's why it's making that noise. She's rolling some dice.

188
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Yeah, snake eyes. There's a bunch of sound effects just going on. There's a rooster outside. There's a small orb, though, despite all that.

189
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Despite all that, this was the best sound effect. She's in her kitchen and then...

190
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 A little small orb floats into the kitchen. First instinct you're going to think is ball lightning, right?

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Which is super rare. Most people will never see it in their life, but looking back on this story, you could go, "Maybe it was ball lightning that was coming around."

192
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 This was the size of a ball and she said it was like a matte color. So, kind of like, what is that? Like a whitish clay colored?

193
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And she's just enjoying her morning. It's 10.45. Actually, it's kind of late to eat breakfast, but...

194
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 It's 10.45 in the morning, right? She's not in the middle of nowhere and this little orb is floating around her kitchen. It begins to circle her head.

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 She's just perfectly still.

196
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 She says it didn't say anything to her, but she knew what to say to it. It's kind of a weird thing. She wasn't getting any telepathic communication, but she knew what it wanted to hear.

197
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 First off, she greets it. "Thank you, orb, for coming into my house. And I'm glad you visited our beautiful city."

198
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Then she pronounces it correctly and the orb's like, "Mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum."

199
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 She goes, "I always knew there were other life forms in the universe. I always knew there was something else out there."

200
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And at this point, it's still floating around here and it starts making crackling sounds like electricity. That sounds more like fire, but you know what I mean. You can imagine it.

201
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 She says it begins to morph. It started off as a small ball, but it started to get bigger. It would become like a 19-inch ball.

202
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And then shrink back down to say like a golf ball, and then a big ball, a little ball, a big ball, a little ball. It's kind of going back and forth.

203
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And then tentacles start to come out of it.

204
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 They came out to about eight inches out of it. She said it looked like a spiked mine. It's still kind of floating around her.

205
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 She said when it would go back behind her head, she would feel a breath. She would feel wind on the back of her neck.

206
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 It's still not saying anything to her. She's simply making responses to this thing.

207
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 She goes, "I wish I could go with you, but I have small kids."

208
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Forbes like, "It's probably thinking, 'Oh, lady, you're moving way too fast. I wasn't asking you to move in with me. I just wanted to float around your head a bit, dude. Slow down.'"

209
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Then she says, "Why do you come to me in such a strange appearance?"

210
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And for the first time, it actually speaks to her. It's telepathic, but for the first time, it actually answers her.

211
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Because now she's asking it a question. It says, "We appear in this manner." I don't know why. It has a posh British accent.

212
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Good day, lady. "We appear in this manner because this is how we actually look like, and specifically visited you because we knew you would accept us as we are."

213
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 That's an exact quote from this thing.

214
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 She says she asked where it was from. This is an interesting detail.

215
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 She said, "When she asked where they were from, they said they were from a star system that started with an A."

216
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And when she's reporting the story, the reporter goes, "Well, which one?" And she goes, "I don't remember. I'm not a scientist."

217
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 They just said a name. It started with an A. I don't remember it.

218
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 That's an interesting detail because a lot of times, it would be easier for her to make up the answer.

219
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 She could go, "They come from the Adromeda star cloud. They come from the asteroid constellation. They come from asteroid M."

220
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Whatever it is. But she says it told her something and she heard it, but then she just forgot what it was.

221
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 She goes, "I know it started with an A, though."

222
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And then actually, I think at the time, she realized she was a little out of her league because she asked,

223
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 "Why don't you visit scientists? Why are you coming to visit me in my kitchen?"

224
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And it said, the quote was, "We specifically chose you because not all people are ready to meet us."

225
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 That's something we've talked about a lot on this show, whether or not people are sometimes physically can't take alien contact.

226
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 We've run into a couple stories where people have met aliens and then died of horrible diseases afterwards,

227
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 or just not spiritually evolved or mentally evolved enough to see these things.

228
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 So she's having this little conversation, though, with this alien.

229
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And then she says this. It's a very curious jump because, again, she's just kind of answering how she feels.

230
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 She says this. This is a quote, "If your spacecraft is crashed and you are in trouble, you can stay here to live with me.

231
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I have room for you."

232
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And at that point, the orb is still kind of floating around her head and it doesn't say anything.

233
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 But she feels, for the first time in this entire encounter, pure fear overtake her.

234
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 She says that she felt like something huge was descending upon her, just that weight of terror washing over her.

235
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Up until this point, everything was hunky-dory. She had no problem with this alien presence in her midst.

236
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 But now, after saying, "Hey, you can come live with me," she felt fearful.

237
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 She runs out of the kitchen.

238
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And when she comes back, I'm assuming eight weeks later, but when she comes back in, the orb is gone.

239
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 So when she asked it to come in and she felt something huge descending on her, was it simply an emotional reaction, like the fear washing over her?

240
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Or was it something actually moving into her place?

241
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 The aliens are like, "What? We got a party, Panda Boys!"

242
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun. Ship, invisible ship is landing.

243
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 For the next six months, she said she suffered really bad vision problems and was also having memory problems.

244
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 She couldn't concentrate. She was having all of these issues for about six months and then they just go away.

245
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Is it possible that when she invited these aliens to come down, they did and just hung out at her place the whole time?

246
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 They keep like every night, they're like, "Dude, you gotta try out this alien martini."

247
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Glug glug glug and she's like getting blitzed and dancing all night long and stuff like that.

248
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Then she wakes up the next morning and she's like, "What? I don't remember last night."

249
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 There's like alien mardi gras beads everywhere. They're holographic beads.

250
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 She's like, "What? What happened?"

251
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Her vision problems are because of alien strobe lights from partying all night long.

252
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 We don't know, but for six months, she was having a hard time remembering stuff.

253
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 She was having vision problems and then those go away.

254
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 After that, she becomes incredibly lucky.

255
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It doesn't hear "usually" is the word they use, but usually whatever she wanted, she got.

256
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Now, that's an interesting side effect. We can almost read it like this, that she did invite the aliens down and immediately her human instincts told her,

257
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 "Oh, whoa, you shouldn't have invited it in."

258
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 That's a very common thing with mythology or with, I don't know if the right word would be folklore.

259
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 It's the word I'm looking for. You invite the demon into you, you invite Dracula into your house or any vampire, not specifically Dracula,

260
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 but you invite these things in. She could have invited in this alien force and her raw reptilian brain, not alien reptilian,

261
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 but evolutionary reptilian brain told her to flee. Something bad was going to happen.

262
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And for six months, they did inhabit this place. But to pay their rent, to basically pay for all the trashing they did of her place,

263
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 it was in the eighth dimension, so she won't notice it. But the house in this realm is totally normal,

264
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 but if you go over two dimensions, it's just completely demolished. The aliens are like, "Oh man, this totally wrecked this place."

265
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 They pay her back by giving her good luck. That's an interesting trade-off.

266
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Would you take six months of memory and vision problems? Would you take six months of alien roommates, basically?

267
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 They're just constantly floating around your head. Like, "Dude, I'm trying to read a book."

268
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 They're like, "Uh, there's like ten of them you can't see." Maybe that was the vision problems.

269
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Maybe these orbs kept floating around in front of her. She couldn't necessarily see them.

270
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Somehow they messed up her vision. I don't know. I'm pulling that one out of my butt.

271
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 But my point is, is like, if you had ten orbs, ten alien orbs floating around you, whether or not you could see them,

272
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 they're probably going to make it a little hard to read TV guide. Right?

273
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 These orbs are floating around her head. What's creepy about this story, the fact that she had alien roommates for a couple months,

274
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 is the story ends with this. It says that the last thing the aliens told her was that they were returning for her in five years.

275
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Now, that's out of the narrative. That's an interesting thing, because the orb didn't tell her that.

276
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Remember, the orb that was floating around her didn't tell her that.

277
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 She said the last thing the aliens told her was that they'd come back for her in five years.

278
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 So, did the aliens move in with her for six months, and then before they left, they're like, "We'll be back for you in five years."

279
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And she's like, "What? I thought you guys were gone." And then she starts getting incredibly lucky.

280
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 That's how this story ends. This is one of those stories that took place in 1999.

281
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 I got it from, think about it, docs.com. So they have it sourced on there.

282
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And it was from a newspaper called Yaroslav UFO Center #6, which was published in 1993.

283
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 So three years after this event, this story was published, we don't know what happened at the five-year mark.

284
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 They said they were coming back for her. Now, we see that a lot, again, in UFO lore.

285
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 A lot of times, aliens say, "We're coming back." And we never really know, for the most part,

286
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 unless it's somebody who's famous, or a story that happens quite recently, or people who are reporting it 20 years later,

287
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 and they're like, "This said they'd be back in five years, but they never showed back up."

288
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And a story like this, five years later, she may have had her roommates for six months,

289
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 and then they told her, "Hey, we're coming back for you in five years."

290
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 She's incredibly lucky for a period of time, and then she just goes missing.

291
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Her kids come home to a house one day. "Mommy, mommy, sorry, that's super disturbing.

292
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 No, we're orphans now." Aliens are like, "Your mom's on the party barge with us now.

293
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Mom's all dancing, go go dance her in space." That's depressing.

294
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 I don't want to end it with kids crying for their lost mom. That's a sad way to end the episode.

295
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 So we don't know if she actually disappeared or not. That's one of those things.

296
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 We don't know if the alien ship came down to get her. We don't know.

297
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 We pushed Corey Dennis on the ship as well. We're like, "You're Patreon set up to autopay, right?"

298
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 He's like, "Yeah, why? Ugh." But he's also now at their party in with Nazda, and a bunch of aliens.

299
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 He's like, "No, and much other beyond Earth. Small sacrifices, my friend.

300
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 We need you up there to show how great humanity is." You know what's funny? Because I think that that's what this story really says.

301
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Not that we're pushing Patreons to be kidnapped by aliens, but humanity's superpower is our humanity.

302
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Like, we are, at the core level, humans will help out people in need.

303
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 We can have national rivalries. We can have religious rivalries. Political rivalries.

304
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Rivalries, sports rivalries. They're usually less intense, but you know what I mean?

305
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 In America, at least, Britain, it seems to be pretty nuts. People are beating each other up.

306
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 But you know what I mean? We have these rivalries. But at the end of the day, when something bad happened,

307
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 if a rival sports team had, like, a collapse of their stadium, you will run out there and remove that stuff.

308
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Just like the neighbor in the first story, right? I don't know if they got along.

309
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 It could have been best buddies. It could have just been a neighbor who heard two women being chopped up.

310
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 What do you do in that moment? Without seeing the threat, he grabbed a bat and jumped over that fence.

311
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 We help each other out, regardless of what's going on. I know it doesn't seem like it.

312
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 I know it seems like everything is more fractured now than it has ever been, but at the end of the day, we love each other.

313
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 100% believe that. And here's the thing. If we don't, if things keep getting worse and we become more tribal and more separated from each other,

314
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 it is not going to end well. I think we love each other, and I think that when the rubber hits the road, we have each other's backs.

315
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 However, you could also definitely have a future where everyone has a knife and a hatchet.

316
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And the reason why I have my knife and my hatchet, because that guy has his knife and his hatchet, and I can't put mine down because he's going to kill me.

317
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And that guy's thinking, "Well, I got to hold on to my knife and my hatchet, because if I put mine down, that guy's going to kill me."

318
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 We're looking across that divide, that artificially inflamed divide. You can have divides between cultures, between religions,

319
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 but when you let it get inflamed, you let it get infected, the divide is no longer just, "Oh, we have differences of opinion."

320
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 The divide itself becomes the overriding issue. Not the fact that we have differences of opinion. It's that gulf that just gets wider and wider.

321
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 If it does go that route where all of us are holding that knife and that hatchet, we're in for a really dark time.

322
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Not only on this planet, but if you are a peaceful, loving alien species, you're not going to want to land here, right?

323
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 You're not going to land here. We have this story of this woman who invites him into their house. Those aliens are like, "Hey, they're not so bad."

324
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 We like crashed and she invited us into their house. We only talked to her for like a couple minutes.

325
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 The next thing I know is she let us partied her house for six months.

326
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And then you have some great alien being like, "Oh, that's not what I heard about Earth."

327
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Because the last time one of our ships crashed in Roswell, two of them died on impact, the third one they dragged off to some base and dissected them.

328
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And they showed the footage on Fox. Earth is nuts. I'm not going back there.

329
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 So if we're not, if we have to be, the humanity being humane is our superpower.

330
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 It's that brotherly love we give out to each other and we should be putting out into the universe as well.

331
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Because what's going to happen is you have peaceful aliens being like, "Pfft, screw that place, dude."

332
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 You have one mechanical malfunction. They chop you up. It would be the equivalent of if you're on a plane and it crash landed in Kentucky and they're like,

333
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 "Well, the plane was supposed to go to Chicago, but we're going to dissect you because you weren't supposed to be here."

334
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Like, that would be it on a galactic scale. And the peaceful aliens are going to be like, "Dude, they're always chopping us up.

335
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 They're shooting us down." And even if they don't shoot us down, if our ship just crashes, they cut us open.

336
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Peaceful aliens aren't going to want to come here, because we're holding that hatchet in that knife.

337
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 So who will end up coming here? An alien species with a bigger hatchet and a bigger knife.

338
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 We get from the universe what we put out into it. I honestly believe that.

339
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And if we put out love and understanding, if we let it emanate from our core so not only can other humans see it, but the whole galaxy can see it,

340
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 they're going to attract that back from the universe. But if we put out fear, the universe will respond in kind.

341
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 The universe will send us an alien species that will show us what the true definition of fear really is.
