1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 A psychotic man pushes the boundaries of science.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,520
 And then we meet a young teenager whose life takes a turn for the bizarre when he begins

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,640
 dating a teenage Satan worshiper.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,400
 He really doesn't think it's a big deal.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,400
 He figures a religion's a religion.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,440
 And while that may be true on paper, when this young boy is spending a lot of time over

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,400
 at a house full of Satan worshippers, things get creepy.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:45,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,400
 I'm your host Jason Garbineiro.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,520
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,120
 Hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,360
 Hope you guys had lots of fun.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,400
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and get started right away.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,360
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our newest feature on supporters.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,960
 Everyone get on your feet and give a round of applause for Rob.

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
 Woohoo!

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,480
 Yeah, come on in Rob.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,240
 Rob, walking on into Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,120
 I wonder what came first, the name Robert or Rob or Robbery.

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,720
 I wonder which one came first, human, steely from each other or the name Robert.

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,240
 Because if you think about it, people are named after their professions.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,280
 What does the name Robert?

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,760
 I'm assuming it's French, Robert.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,960
 Were they a gang of thieves?

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,520
 Is that where that name comes from, Robert?

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
 I don't know, probably not.

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,240
 It's easy to double check.

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,400
 I'm sitting in front of the internet at all times.

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,080
 But Robert, don't steal anything while you're here.

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,240
 You are however going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

33
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,520
 You guys can't support the Patreon, it's totally fine.

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,160
 It really, really is.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,600
 This helps for the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
 That helps out so much.

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,820
 Robert, let's go ahead and toss you a steam shovel and everyone hop on board the Carpenter

38
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,820
 Caboose.

39
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:12,800
 Robert's going to chew, chew, chew us all the way out to some dude's house.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,640
 Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug,

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,960
 Carpenter Caboose is chugging down the rails.

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,440
 We're headed all the way out to this guy's house.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,960
 I found this post online, we don't have an exact location.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,480
 I have a lot of, well I would say interesting hobbies.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,840
 You know, your mileage may vary.

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,960
 But I, people, longtime listeners of the show know that I love to look into strange subcultures.

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,240
 I'm into stuff like that.

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:56,360
 I'm also into, for lack of a better term, hipster drugs maybe.

49
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,160
 Drugs that are not popular.

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,960
 You got the biggies, you got the popular ones like heroin and crank and crack and pot.

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:14,200
 So did you know that sitting outside of the cool kids drug world, there's Amodium AD.

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,240
 If you don't know what Amodium AD is, we're hanging out with it outside.

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,600
 He's like, man I wish I was cool.

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,200
 We're like, you're cool if you think you're cool buddy.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,840
 You're also incredibly deadly people who do this drug the way it's, Amodium AD is an

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
 anti-diarrhea drug.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,760
 But what has happened over the years is people have figured out, and this, let me be very

58
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,760
 clear, do not do this.

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,360
 I'm not advocating this at all.

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,800
 What people have figured out is, okay, there's a lot of smart people who do drugs.

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,600
 There's an awful lot of smart drug addicts out there.

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,080
 People who have had opioid addictions go, okay, opioids make you constipated.

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,560
 If you do a lot of opioids, even if you just do the regular doctor recommended amount of,

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,240
 say, Vicodin, you'll become constipated.

65
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,080
 Opioids make you constipated.

66
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,560
 Amodium AD is an anti-diarrhea drug.

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,840
 It is a drug that makes you constipated on purpose.

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,720
 People have said, let's look at the chemical compounds and see if there's any comparison

69
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,880
 between, say, a Vicodin and Amodium AD.

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,900
 And there is a comparison between the two.

71
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,040
 If you, and I am not saying to do this, this is not medical advice, it's super dangerous.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,120
 But people have figured out, if you just take the doctor or the box recommended amount of

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,900
 Amodium, it'll stop you.

74
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,920
 If you have diarrhea, it will block everything.

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:52,720
 But if you take, if you basically take 500 milligrams of this stuff, the recommended dosage is 2

76
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,640
 milligrams, 4 times a day.

77
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,980
 So 8 milligrams.

78
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:04,900
 But if you do 500 milligrams, there's enough Amodium AD, there's enough of this opioid-like

79
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:14,540
 compound that it will cross the blood-brain barrier and you will get a high similar to

80
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,380
 an opioid.

81
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,580
 So people who are having drug withdrawals, especially, which when you're on a drug withdrawal

82
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,720
 from an opioid, you could hover off the area, you're pooping so much, you could hover off

83
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,760
 the ground, I mean, you're pooping so much, it's like a little jet stream coming out of

84
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
 your butthole.

85
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,240
 You can defy gravity, you do nothing but poop while you're in an opioid withdrawal.

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,680
 If you take enough of this Amodium AD, it'll cross the blood-brain barrier and you will

87
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,760
 get quote unquote high.

88
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,480
 You'll have an opioid-like high.

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,160
 500 milligrams is also enough to give you a heart attack.

90
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,380
 That's the big issue, is like yes, you may feel good, you may be like whoa, dude, this

91
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,700
 is just like the first time I had that, Vicodin tablet.

92
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,860
 But your heart could easily stop.

93
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:11,140
 The reason why I'm talking about this in relation to where we're going is that I look into subcultures,

94
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,820
 I love reading stuff about crazy drugs or off-label use for real drugs like, you know,

95
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,100
 Benadryl causes some of the most potent hallucinations known to man.

96
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:27,980
 I've always wondered about this, how many times, because doctor, this isn't fairly new, it's

97
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,260
 only probably been in the past couple years that these reports have been on the internet

98
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:40,620
 that you can do a mass amount of anti-diarrheal drugs and have an opioid-like high.

99
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,580
 Even today it's super rare that doctors are aware of this, but especially a couple years

100
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:52,220
 ago, if you had a heart attack and you were taken to the emergency room, the doctors are

101
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,580
 going to try to treat a heart attack, they're going to have no idea what you're really having.

102
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,700
 I mean, the heart attack is caused by a drug overdose of a drug that most people know doctors

103
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,540
 going to be like, "Sir, let's check for his amodium AD level."

104
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,340
 You would try to treat the heart attack, you wouldn't realize he was actually having a

105
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,540
 drug overdose and he may come in, your patient may come in and doesn't have anything to do

106
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,180
 around when their body is found or when a loved one comes in the room and they're having

107
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,580
 a heart attack that would suggest that this guy was using any sort of illicit drugs.

108
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,840
 What has happened is, over the past couple years doctors have become a little more savvy

109
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,820
 to this, but I've wondered, I wonder how many people who shouldn't be having heart attacks

110
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,740
 have heart attacks and the loved one goes, "It's crazy, he was only 25 years old and

111
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,180
 he had a heart attack in his room, his toilet has also been used, that's weird as well,

112
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,380
 his bathroom is spotless, but he had this heart attack and who would have thought what

113
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,380
 happened to him?"

114
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,460
 And of course that would be the cause of death heart attack, but no one realized there's

115
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,780
 500 milligrams of amodium AD in his stomach and I wonder how often that happens, I don't

116
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,260
 think it happens all the time, but it happens sometimes.

117
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,820
 The reason why I talk about that is because that segues into our first story here, it's

118
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:18,420
 another thing when I read this I go, "I wonder how often we get a report of somebody killing

119
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,500
 themselves and we're like, 'How could they have done that?'

120
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,900
 Everything was, well I mean everything wasn't perfect, but how did they have killed themselves?

121
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,860
 I wonder how many times people accidentally killed themselves, if that makes sense.

122
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,060
 Maybe I should have told the story first, then you go, "Oh, maybe that is true."

123
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:44,060
 We're in this dude's bedroom, this guy recently posted this account online, he posted on January

124
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:52,340
 1st, 2023, pretty crazy way to start the new year, he posted this on the X board, he titled

125
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,940
 this, "I stabbed myself in the heart."

126
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,420
 This guy says he stabbed himself, he's still alive, not just stabbed himself, stabbed himself

127
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,340
 in the heart, and he's still alive and he goes, "Listen, I didn't need to go to the

128
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,340
 hospital, the wounds healed themselves."

129
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,660
 People are like, "What are you talking about?

130
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,020
 Wait a second, if you stabbed yourself in the heart you'd be dead."

131
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,340
 And he's like, "No, no, no, I'm not dead, in fact I'm better."

132
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:28,380
 Well actually, okay, he didn't say that.

133
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,260
 He said he changed.

134
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,180
 So maybe I was adding something to it, he changed.

135
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,660
 He changed, it doesn't imply that he's better, but he does say, actually he starts it off

136
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,300
 by saying, "My brain feels dead."

137
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,660
 So maybe better is not the best term to just make up and put in there.

138
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,780
 He said, "Let me read this quote to you.

139
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,100
 This is how he describes life after stabbing himself in the heart."

140
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:58,540
 Five times by the way, it wasn't just a single time he tells us later, he says, "My brain

141
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,740
 kind of feels dead and I think my bones changed."

142
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,740
 More bones, maybe.

143
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
 That's quite jubilant.

144
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,340
 I would argue that's better, right, if you had more bones than you.

145
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,740
 Who wants less bones?

146
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
 That'd be dope.

147
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,460
 You'd have like just bones sticking out at random points.

148
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,340
 You'd probably have some cool horns poking out at your head.

149
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:28,300
 I mean, if that's what it takes, right, it's like, "Hey, would you like some horns or

150
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,060
 would you like to have some cool horns sticking out?"

151
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
 Yeah, sure, okay.

152
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
 Stab yourself in the heart five times.

153
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,180
 I'd be like, "I'll just wear a hat.

154
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,700
 I'll just wear a hat with some horns on it."

155
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,700
 My brain feels kind of dead and I think my bones changed.

156
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,460
 More bones, maybe.

157
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,340
 My feces is different.

158
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,420
 My urine too.

159
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:58,100
 I bleed more easier, yet it kind of feels like a heel quicker.

160
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,820
 He also then goes on to state that he no longer has taste buds and his sperm is different

161
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,820
 as well.

162
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,940
 So this guy had a pretty busy afternoon because that's a lot of stuff to test.

163
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:17,260
 I'm not trying to make fun of this guy, but if I stabbed myself five times in the heart

164
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:24,860
 or even once or even a single time, I don't know if I would poop, pee, and masturbate.

165
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,140
 Anytime soon, I think that would kind of take a rest from all of that stuff.

166
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:36,820
 I'd be in a hospital bed with a bedpan, but his feces are different, his urine is different,

167
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,100
 and his sperm is different.

168
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,380
 What's crazy about this is that if we take this guy at face value, if he stabs himself

169
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,340
 in the heart five times, first off, he obviously needs to get professional help, and then you

170
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,540
 wonder like, "What is he seeing?"

171
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:00,660
 That's another interesting thing I like to look into is almost like the science of madness.

172
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,660
 What is he seeing?

173
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,060
 Is his feces the same as always was?

174
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,260
 And when he looks down, it's different.

175
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,380
 He's like, "That's weird.

176
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,580
 It's cube shaped now."

177
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,140
 What's going on when he's perceiving this?

178
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,780
 How does his sperm—how do you even see that now that I think about it?

179
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,500
 Wouldn't you need a microscope to see that?

180
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:27,780
 He's walking around this huge laboratory in his bedroom, his blood-soaked lab coat.

181
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,220
 You would need a microscope to see.

182
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,220
 But who knows?

183
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,380
 I mean, again, if you had had a psychotic break, maybe you could just look at your own

184
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,100
 semen and go, "Look it.

185
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,700
 They're swimming backwards."

186
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,900
 You can actually—well, he can't actually see it.

187
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,740
 It's different, but his mind is—when I'm saying what's going through his head, I'm

188
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,100
 not talking about his thought process.

189
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,220
 I'm talking about like, "What does he see differently from us?"

190
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,620
 If we were over at his place, and he's like, "Dude, come here.

191
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,700
 Look at my urine."

192
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,140
 And you looked at it, it would just—I'm assuming there's nothing different with it.

193
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,700
 I'm assuming it would just look like regular urine.

194
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,580
 But like, if he looks at it, is it like—does he look into the urine, and it's like a little

195
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,580
 picture of a guy shrugging?

196
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,260
 I mean, maybe it's just a different color.

197
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,140
 I don't know why he's taking cube-shaped poop.

198
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,220
 I don't know why I'm taking it to the extreme.

199
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,340
 I imagine if you got stabbed five times in the heart, your feces would look different.

200
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,660
 There would probably be a lot of blood in it.

201
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
 I'm guessing.

202
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,660
 I don't know.

203
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,940
 I'm not willing to do these scientific experiments.

204
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,940
 But I just find this so fascinating.

205
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:41,500
 He goes on to say—I mean, like, right there, we already have like this physiological/psychotic—the

206
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,900
 mind of someone in distress.

207
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
 We have that narrative.

208
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,260
 But then, of course, he goes into the world of the paranormal, because we do see this

209
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,740
 over, the Venn diagram is there.

210
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,700
 He also says, "Well, this isn't the first weird thing that happened to me."

211
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:01,020
 He said at one point that a spirit—well, really, not just for one point, for the past

212
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:07,060
 seven years, this spirit would keep possessing his body, and he wouldn't have any control

213
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,940
 over himself.

214
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,260
 And he says this spirit is constantly trying to morph his body, trying to make physiological

215
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,500
 changes to his body.

216
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,420
 And this spirit, this demon, is what I would call it, but this demon tells him that one

217
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:31,740
 day he—not the demon, but we'll just call this guy Chuck—Chuck will wake up and he'll

218
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,660
 be in a different person's body.

219
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,020
 He's basically going to get evicted from this body at some point and be in someone

220
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,020
 else's body.

221
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,020
 And he goes, "I don't want that to happen.

222
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,140
 I like this body."

223
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,260
 So there's a whole lot of things going on here.

224
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,260
 And it's just so fascinating to me.

225
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,380
 Obviously, I want this guy to get help.

226
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,300
 It's troubling that this happened on January 1st, and because the export's anonymous, we'll

227
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,820
 never get any—we'll never know how this story ends.

228
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,940
 It could be that he went and ended up getting help voluntarily.

229
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:17,380
 It could be that a loved one or a family member has him—forces him to receive treatment,

230
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:23,100
 or it's possible that he has had a tragic ending, and that he's dead.

231
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,620
 We don't—I know this is kind of a bummer way to start off a Monday episode, but I just

232
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,220
 find it so fascinating.

233
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:37,180
 And again, if someone stabbed themselves five times in the heart and they were found like

234
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,780
 that, I think most people would go, "Wow, he must have battled depression.

235
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,140
 He must have had these issues going on."

236
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,660
 Or maybe I'm wrong.

237
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,820
 Maybe that's not the go-to thing when someone kills themselves.

238
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,020
 They don't assume that it's because they're depressed.

239
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,380
 But I guess I always did.

240
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,220
 That was the key motivating factor.

241
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,380
 A lot of times you'll see this person battled mental illness throughout their life and

242
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,140
 then they killed themselves.

243
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,940
 But I always figured they were still a depression component.

244
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,820
 They're like, "I'm tired of dealing with all this mental illness.

245
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,460
 My life is in the end."

246
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,660
 But no, I mean, I wonder how many people killed themselves because they're just having a

247
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,540
 full-on psychotic break.

248
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,620
 And it has nothing to do with depression.

249
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,820
 It has nothing to do with them being sad or having a bleak outlook on the future.

250
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,740
 But when it's found out that they killed themselves, that's kind of what people assume.

251
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:33,060
 But I wonder how many people are like this gentleman who just stabbed themselves one

252
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,700
 night multiple times.

253
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,980
 Now, again, he claims that he did that and didn't die.

254
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,660
 And so you have to think maybe he didn't actually stab himself.

255
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,740
 He just thought he stabbed himself.

256
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,620
 But it's a crazy story.

257
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:54,420
 And then to have that happen and now he's feeling these new physical sensations and

258
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,860
 seeing these new things, it's just the whole story is just so odd.

259
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,060
 But like the EmoDIMAED thing, I think there probably are people who shouldn't have heart

260
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,740
 attacks, having heart attacks and dying and doctors going, "We don't know why this otherwise

261
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,820
 super healthy person would have a heart attack."

262
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,820
 Same thing like this.

263
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,180
 You'd be like, "I can't believe this guy killed himself.

264
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,820
 He just bought a bunch of groceries for his fridge.

265
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,820
 He just went out and did all this stuff that generally only people who plan on living for

266
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,820
 at least a couple more weeks do, like paying their electric bill.

267
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,500
 And he killed himself."

268
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,220
 So I wonder again, like how those...

269
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
 I don't know.

270
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
 It's just super fascinating.

271
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,220
 It's super fascinating.

272
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
 It's super...

273
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,220
 I actually was like, "Maybe this isn't a good topic for a Monday."

274
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:48,220
 It is pretty dark and pretty sad and we don't have an ending to it.

275
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,100
 At the end, was he doing it?

276
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,020
 Was this spirit doing it to a victim from the body?

277
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,020
 We still have that.

278
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,860
 It's just fascinating to me all around.

279
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
 Rob...

280
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,860
 Let's go ahead.

281
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
 I don't know how you did that.

282
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,860
 It was kind of depressing, but it's kind of fascinating.

283
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,300
 Rob, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carboner copter.

284
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,380
 We are leaving behind this young man's house and as we're leaving, we've seen amulets pull

285
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,500
 up and some really smiling EMTs are there.

286
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,300
 They're like, "Hey, I guess that sounds kind of creepy.

287
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,300
 They love their job that much."

288
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,980
 They're like, "Oh, we're going to grab this guy, take him to the hospital."

289
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,140
 I hope this gentleman got the help that he needed.

290
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,140
 I hope everything's okay.

291
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,020
 We make sure of that, at least in this fictional telling of it.

292
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,140
 Robert, take us up and away in the carboner copter where you're leaving behind this man's

293
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
 house.

294
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:41,220
 Fly us all the way out to Florida.

295
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,300
 The year is 2013 and we're in Florida.

296
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,060
 We're about to meet a young man.

297
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,020
 He's a 13-year-old boy.

298
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,220
 Online, he goes by the name CD Project Ivory.

299
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,700
 We're going to go in and call him Joey.

300
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,780
 Joey posted this story recently.

301
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,260
 He goes, "Listen, I'm not a big believer in the supernatural.

302
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:08,900
 I'm not even like a really religious person, but this story's always bugged me.

303
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:14,900
 I just never have been able to make sense of what has happened and I need to share it

304
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
 with someone."

305
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
 It's interesting.

306
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,900
 I was able to look through Joey's posting history and most of the stuff.

307
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,220
 Really everything else I saw was about general life things.

308
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:30,420
 We weren't constantly telling these once in a lifetime, once in a million paranormal stories.

309
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,980
 Just kind of normal stuff and then this one pops up.

310
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,260
 Joey says, "When I was 13 years old, I started hanging out with this girl."

311
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,980
 He doesn't name the girl.

312
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
 We'll call her Michelle.

313
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:46,580
 He goes, "We started hanging out and eventually it's just like my go-to thing to do."

314
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:54,940
 He gets to the point where almost every day after school, we're hanging out together.

315
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,980
 Because they're hanging out together and because they're hanging out so much, eventually he's

316
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,660
 hanging out at her house and becomes introduced to her family.

317
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,300
 Through the course of this, after a couple of meetings, he is told, Joey is told by

318
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,020
 the family, that they are Satan worshipers.

319
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,100
 They worship the Dark Prince Lucifer.

320
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,580
 In what might be one of the most real statements that I've ever come across in a paranormal

321
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:31,300
 story, Joey said, "Listen, I'm not a religious person."

322
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,260
 Then they told me they were Satan worshipers.

323
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:43,300
 I just pretended to be interested in it because I liked this girl so much, I wanted to keep

324
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,540
 spending time with her.

325
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,300
 So I'm just going, "Oh man, fascinating.

326
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,460
 Wow, that's cool."

327
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,620
 That made the girl feel good, which made Joey feel good, which allowed their friendship to

328
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,100
 continue.

329
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:05,700
 That definitely does sound like something most guys do.

330
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
 He's hanging out of the house.

331
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,740
 It's a family Satan worshipers.

332
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,140
 From what I can tell, there's a father and there's two daughters.

333
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,100
 There might be a mother and other people involved, but those are the ones that actually are popping

334
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,500
 up in the story.

335
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,260
 We have Michelle and then we have her older sister, Becky.

336
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,420
 And then the father, "Enjoy those, listen, you know, I hang out at the house a lot and

337
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,380
 don't really believe in ghosts, spirits, nothing like that, but it was odd."

338
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:43,100
 Like you'd be sitting there hanging out with Michelle and all of a sudden you'd hear a

339
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
 tapping noise.

340
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,580
 A tapping noise coming from nowhere.

341
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,340
 I mean, obviously if you heard that and then you saw a tap dancer walk by and that's no

342
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,420
 longer paranormal.

343
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:59,100
 But this was tapping that was coming from nowhere and whatever, you know, it's an old house

344
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,340
 or maybe even a new house.

345
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,420
 Pipes make noises.

346
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,420
 Whatever.

347
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:14,340
 But then one day Joey and Michelle were hanging out in her room and they started to hear the

348
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:25,540
 scratching.

349
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
 Scratching noises.

350
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:32,420
 Coming, again, would be normal if you looked over and you saw someone sharpening a knife

351
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,580
 in Michelle's bedroom.

352
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,980
 The scratching noises were coming from Michelle's closet.

353
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:46,420
 Joey goes, "You know what, it sounds like a cat and they do have cats.

354
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,420
 You do have cats.

355
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,140
 It sounds like there was a cat in the closet scratching at the closet door to get out."

356
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,740
 So I got up and I opened the closet door.

357
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,180
 There's no cat in there.

358
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,060
 Okay.

359
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,220
 Close the closet door.

360
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,420
 Go back to hanging out.

361
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,100
 Scratch.

362
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,540
 Scratch.

363
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
 It would come and go.

364
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,780
 The sound would come and go and they wouldn't check every time but sometimes they would

365
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,460
 check just to make sure.

366
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,980
 There wasn't one of the cats in the closet and never was there a cat in the closet making

367
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,980
 the noise.

368
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,940
 Oddly enough Joey said, "We'd hear the sound of a cat trying to scratch their way out of

369
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,820
 a closet.

370
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
 We'd open the closet door.

371
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
 There'd be no cat.

372
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:43,420
 However, you started to see scratch marks on the inside of the closet door and they

373
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:50,700
 were about as high as a cat could scratch a door.

374
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,100
 They were never higher than a cat could really stand up on its hind legs and scratch to get

375
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:02,580
 out.

376
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,620
 Joey begins to feel uneasy when he's hanging out of this house.

377
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,380
 This is the house of his.

378
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,540
 He never specifically says they're dating.

379
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,780
 He's always talking about them hanging out.

380
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,060
 But it could have just been young love.

381
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,580
 It could have been kind of feeling out like what is love.

382
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,700
 The question had away always fonders.

383
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,500
 He never specifically says they're dating.

384
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,300
 They do spend a lot of time in her bedroom.

385
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,860
 But they could just be, they're 13.

386
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,980
 Most likely we're just hanging out.

387
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,340
 Never talks about them kissing or anything like that.

388
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,060
 He says though as much as he liked hanging out over here.

389
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,180
 He started to feel uneasy.

390
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,540
 Not everywhere in the house.

391
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,780
 There were most parts of the house he felt fine.

392
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,620
 But he said there were certain parts of the house that he just didn't like to go into

393
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,620
 at all.

394
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,500
 And those places were the garage.

395
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 Which is fine.

396
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,700
 Kids don't need to be hanging out in the garage.

397
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,700
 The master bedroom.

398
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,100
 Again, none of your business.

399
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,300
 That's where the parents are.

400
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,660
 And then the restroom.

401
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
 Now we got a problem.

402
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:08,220
 If you're over at your girl's house, yet her bathroom makes you feel uneasy.

403
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,140
 Hopefully they have a nice pit or a big supply of a modium AD.

404
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,580
 And you don't have to worry about it.

405
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,140
 This all comes to a head on one day in particular.

406
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,020
 Scratchy noises, the uneasiness.

407
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:34,900
 It all kind of comes to a culmination this day when Joey and Michelle are home alone.

408
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,940
 Joey and Michelle, they're sitting on her bed.

409
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,460
 They're watching Third Rock from the Sun.

410
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,860
 The RVs of television.

411
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,260
 I hate that show.

412
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,500
 Joey and Michelle are watching Third Rock from the Sun.

413
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,460
 They're just sitting there in the bedroom eating some food and hanging out.

414
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,660
 You got the house to themselves.

415
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
 Being kids.

416
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,740
 Being little teenagers.

417
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,100
 Hours later they're doing this for hours and hours.

418
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,180
 Eventually they shut off the television.

419
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,180
 They probably finally realized what they were watching.

420
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,860
 They're like, "Oh my God, this is so awful."

421
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
 They shut off the television.

422
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:11,220
 Now they're just sitting in Michelle's bedroom talking when suddenly they hear Becky.

423
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,340
 Michelle's older sister.

424
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:19,380
 They hear Becky yell out, "Michelle!"

425
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,940
 And it was right outside Michelle's bedroom door.

426
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,660
 They're sitting there in this bedroom and right on the other side of the closed door

427
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,860
 they hear Becky go, "Michelle!"

428
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
 What?

429
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,420
 We didn't even hear them come home.

430
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,540
 And it kind of irked them, right?

431
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,580
 Like here you are just yelling outside the bedroom door.

432
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,580
 They knocked it in.

433
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,580
 They knocked it before the yelled.

434
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
 Why is she yelling?

435
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
 What's going on?

436
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
 I didn't even know they were home.

437
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,780
 So Michelle gets up, jumps up off the bed and she walks over.

438
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,820
 She opens the bedroom door.

439
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,540
 There's no one standing there.

440
00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:00,100
 Michelle looks down the hallways, looks around.

441
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
 Becky's nowhere to be seen.

442
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,900
 "Beccy!"

443
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,780
 Michelle yells out, "Beccy, what do you need?

444
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,460
 Why are you yelling?"

445
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
 "Beccy?"

446
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,620
 "Whatever, Becky.

447
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,620
 Whatever.

448
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,620
 We're in here.

449
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,540
 I don't know why you're yelling."

450
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,540
 "You need something.

451
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
 Just knock."

452
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,540
 No answer.

453
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,900
 Michelle comes back in the bedroom.

454
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,540
 Her and Joey are hanging out.

455
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,340
 And they started thinking, "Maybe they were mistaken.

456
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,100
 Maybe they both, maybe both of them didn't clearly hear."

457
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,420
 Becky called out Michelle's name.

458
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
 Who knows what's going on?

459
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,500
 But anyways, Michelle goes, "I'm just going to leave the bedroom door open.

460
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,140
 Just leave it open if Becky shows up."

461
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,420
 She doesn't have to yell again.

462
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,660
 So they leave the door open.

463
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,020
 Joey and Michelle, they're sitting there.

464
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,620
 They start talking again.

465
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:06,420
 And only a few moments pass when they both, once again, hear Becky shout out, "Michelle!"

466
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,100
 He goes, the voice did not call from right outside Michelle's bedroom door.

467
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:18,940
 He said it sounded as if the entire house said her name.

468
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:27,380
 The cry of Michelle reverberated throughout the entire home.

469
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:35,340
 And not only did it feel like it was coming from everywhere yet nowhere in particular,

470
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:43,820
 he said it was the exact pitch, the exact tone.

471
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:52,580
 Everything was exactly the same as the first time they heard the voice shout out, "Michelle!"

472
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,780
 As if it wasn't a person just screaming it.

473
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,060
 He goes, it was like someone had recorded the very first time and they just played it

474
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,060
 again.

475
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:07,020
 It was exactly like it was said the first time.

476
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:14,140
 It was like someone had just simply repeated audio and it was now echoing through the house.

477
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:21,980
 At this point, Michelle and Joey realize something is off.

478
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:27,820
 Not necessarily paranormal, but something is going on.

479
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,260
 What they think it is is Becky is pulling some sort of prank.

480
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:38,140
 She recorded her voice and she replayed it throughout the entire building.

481
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,540
 And they believe that Becky is in the house playing with them.

482
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,700
 So they actually get up, they begin looking for Becky.

483
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,460
 Because it's irritating at this point.

484
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,340
 They begin looking for Becky.

485
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,340
 They go through the house.

486
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,900
 They look in all the places where you would expect Becky to be.

487
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,500
 They look in her bedroom.

488
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
 They're looking down the hallways.

489
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 They're looking the living room.

490
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:02,060
 And then they begin to look for places where anyone could hide.

491
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,140
 Not a place Becky would normally be, but some place that if you were laying high to go

492
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,260
 seek you would go there.

493
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,460
 Closets, things like that.

494
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,820
 And Becky is nowhere to be found.

495
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,380
 And still, believing this to be a prank.

496
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,620
 Still believing this to have no paranormal origin.

497
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,260
 Because remember Joey doesn't believe in the paranormal anyways.

498
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,620
 All the weird things that he's sensed in the house.

499
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,860
 He's just like, it feels uneasy.

500
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,620
 I don't know where the scratching is coming from.

501
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,620
 Whatever, whatever.

502
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,980
 Michelle and Joey both go back to her bedroom.

503
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
 Just whatever.

504
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
 We're just going to ignore it.

505
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,820
 Who knows what Becky's up to.

506
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,540
 An hour or so later they hear the dad's car pull up.

507
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
 They look out.

508
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,580
 They see the dad's car pull up.

509
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,180
 And out of the back seat steps Becky.

510
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,540
 He gets out of the back seat and begins walking into the house.

511
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,340
 Joey and Michelle kind of look at each other like, what?

512
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,300
 We know she was in the house.

513
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,380
 We know she was in the house.

514
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,100
 We don't know how she was able to disappear in the thin air.

515
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,700
 But we know she was in the house.

516
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,620
 And at this point Joey and Michelle are more pissed off than curious.

517
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,660
 They go downstairs and the dad and Becky are walking into the house and they say, where

518
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,660
 were you hiding?

519
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,540
 How did you pull this off where you were yelling the name and stuff like that?

520
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,180
 And dad's like, dude, I'm just walking through the house.

521
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,780
 What in the world is going on?

522
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,700
 And they start confronting Becky and Becky's like, I've been with dad since six in the

523
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
 morning.

524
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,180
 We've been shopping all day long.

525
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,500
 And they're like, no, you were playing this prank on us.

526
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,360
 We heard you yelling out and we searched everywhere for you.

527
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:46,020
 And when they said that, Joey noticed Becky's face just went white.

528
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,060
 And they said, we were searching everywhere for you.

529
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,220
 Her face kind of went white.

530
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,100
 But the dad now jumps in and he goes, listen, I don't know what's going on, but I'll tell

531
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,100
 you this.

532
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,740
 She was with me all day long.

533
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,540
 Like whatever prank you guys are pulling on her and by extension me, because I just want

534
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,220
 to put this stuff away, she was with me all day long.

535
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,100
 I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

536
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,980
 So that was kind of the kibosh on that.

537
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,740
 Joey and Michelle were like, what's going on?

538
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,940
 But Becky says, Michelle, I need to talk to you outside.

539
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,260
 So the two girls step outside.

540
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,740
 The dad goes about his business and Joey just goes back upstairs to Michelle's bedroom.

541
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:34,420
 About 10 minutes later, Joey's still waiting in Michelle's bedroom and Michelle walks in.

542
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:39,340
 She has this concern to look on her face.

543
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,140
 Joey looks over and he goes, hey, what's the matter?

544
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,740
 What did you guys talk about?

545
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,780
 Michelle goes, listen.

546
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:56,220
 When we told Becky that we searched everywhere for her, she asked, did you guys go into my

547
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,220
 bedroom?

548
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:06,460
 And we said, yeah, it was one of the first places we looked.

549
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:12,940
 Becky says, listen, it's very, very important.

550
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:26,100
 If you ever hear me call out your name and I'm not home, do not go into my bedroom.

551
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,820
 It's kind of a weird order, right?

552
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:38,540
 If you ever hear me call out your name and I'm not home, do not go into my bedroom.

553
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,220
 But Becky was firm on this.

554
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:49,540
 Do not go into my bedroom if you hear my voice calling out your name.

555
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:57,180
 Becky explained, Michelle, you know in my bedroom there's that hatch that leads into

556
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
 the attic.

557
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:04,500
 Right, there's that little hatch that you use to get up into that crawl space on top

558
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,700
 of the house.

559
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,020
 One night I was sleeping.

560
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,020
 I woke up in the middle of the night.

561
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,420
 Just bam, right out of deep sleep, I'm wide awake and I look up.

562
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,860
 It's right above my bed.

563
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,140
 It's kind of the first thing I see.

564
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:27,420
 I look up and that hatchway was cracked open.

565
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:33,420
 That hatchway was cracked open and it was cracked open in a pretty good amount.

566
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:44,140
 I see staring back down at me, my own face, my own face looking out from the darkness

567
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,020
 of the attic.

568
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:53,620
 This story ends with Joey saying, I'm not a believer in the paranormal but this story

569
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,300
 has always stuck with me.

570
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,740
 He was a front line observer to the yelling.

571
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,820
 He does have to say, well it wasn't her.

572
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,980
 She was with the dad all day long.

573
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,460
 They did hear the voice.

574
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,340
 And then just the story from Becky saying that there's something in her room that looks

575
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
 like her.

576
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
 It's a terrifying story.

577
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,980
 He says that eventually the family, just a couple of years ago, they stayed there for

578
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,420
 a bit longer but just a couple of years ago that family moved out of that house.

579
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,900
 There's a new family in there.

580
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:28,420
 He's always thought about asking them, asking them if they know, if they know any mimics,

581
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,260
 if they know any doppelgangers walking around.

582
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,260
 But he goes, listen I don't want to be the weirdo knocking on someone's door talking

583
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,620
 about ghosts.

584
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,620
 That's not.

585
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,620
 Now, I would.

586
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,660
 That would actually be kind of cool but he doesn't want that to be his reputation.

587
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,100
 But that's the story of the demon in the attic.

588
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,700
 That was actually what it was posted as, the demon in the attic.

589
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,580
 I would assume that the creature was demonic.

590
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,300
 He doesn't, when he says that they were saint worshipers, it's interesting because I don't

591
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,580
 know if they're a church of Satan worshipers, which is like more of a humanist religion.

592
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,340
 They just talk about Satan to troll Christians.

593
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,660
 Or they actually worshiped Satan.

594
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,300
 They worship Lucifer as an actual being.

595
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,460
 They're conducting these satanic rituals.

596
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:18,500
 He doesn't, most people don't differentiate between the two but there is a pretty big difference

597
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
 between the two.

598
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:28,100
 So we don't know if they're actually worshiping Satan as a metaphysical being.

599
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,180
 But I can imagine if you were doing that you're going to live in a pretty haunted house.

600
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:38,060
 I can imagine if you actually are giving up offerings to satanic creatures, demons and

601
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,060
 such.

602
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,300
 Yeah, you're going to have to expect, it's going to be haunted.

603
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:48,900
 But would you expect that there would be something hiding in the little loft above your daughter's

604
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,500
 bedroom that's slowly taking her form?

605
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,020
 And Joey has a good point, like is it still there?

606
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,700
 Was this thing trying to assume Becky's form?

607
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,500
 And you have to ask a whole bunch of questions.

608
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,700
 What would have happened if it had perfectly mimicked her?

609
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,180
 Could it have been able to replace her?

610
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,780
 Could this creature have been able to replace Becky and no one be able to tell the difference?

611
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:16,140
 Is the real Becky dead somewhere?

612
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,580
 And now you have this doppelganger running around as soon as you see.

613
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,580
 Here's the thing, if you're going to be a mimic, probably don't be mimic like a high

614
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,660
 school student because then you have a bunch of homework to do.

615
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,140
 But imagine, let's put on her conspiracy caps actually, that makes me think of something.

616
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,900
 Let's put on her conspiracy caps and wrap this up.

617
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,860
 Never mind, I was about to say something super insensitive.

618
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,860
 Take your conspiracy caps back off.

619
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,940
 No, never mind, put them back on.

620
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,060
 So imagine if Becky was murdered.

621
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,460
 Imagine if this guy's daughter was murdered and replaced.

622
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,980
 Maybe it was devoured because if you murdered her they'd find blood all over the bedroom

623
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,140
 and you'd be like, "That's weird, Becky, yesterday you went to bed.

624
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,940
 You seemed totally fine and now your bedroom is covered in blood and there's torn clothing

625
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,940
 everywhere."

626
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,060
 The mimic, the demon and the attic eats Becky.

627
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,620
 And then I'm just making stuff up.

628
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,100
 I might as well just make her fly around the room.

629
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,700
 This demon eats Becky and assumes Becky's form and now it could perfectly mimic Becky

630
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,340
 and no longer says things like it was an audio recording.

631
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,500
 If you were an old friend of Becky you're like, "Hey, Becky, that was a cool game last

632
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
 night."

633
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,700
 And the mimic would go, "Yeah, I agree.

634
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,220
 It was totally awesome."

635
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,580
 And it would know exactly what they were talking about.

636
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,100
 And now you have this Becky demon.

637
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:40,300
 It looks exactly like Becky, acts exactly like Becky in high school and it's like walking

638
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,380
 around and being like, "Yeah, good game, guys.

639
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,460
 Good game giving high-fives to people."

640
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,500
 But then it's like, "Hey guys, why don't you come over to my house later and we'll do crack

641
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
 cocaine."

642
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
 And people are like, "What?

643
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,900
 Becky, that's so land-like-y."

644
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,420
 She's like, "No.

645
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,700
 Crack cocaine is totally cool."

646
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,860
 And so the kids were like, "Okay, that's a good argument, right?"

647
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,380
 And no one ever said crack cocaine was cool before.

648
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,460
 I will try it.

649
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:13,660
 And then you have mimic Becky like getting kids addicted to crack.

650
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,060
 And then people are like, "Man, that really was a cool weekend.

651
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,620
 Barney, do you have any more crack on you?"

652
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,780
 And she goes, "I have something better.

653
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,780
 Let's rob a bank."

654
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,780
 I heard that's cool too.

655
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,860
 They're like, "Okay, if it's cool, what I'm getting at?

656
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,820
 What I'm getting at in this totally gone sideways.

657
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,820
 What I'm getting at?"

658
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,700
 The thing about all the times there have been good kids.

659
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,140
 They've had good lives.

660
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,140
 You go to school with them.

661
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,020
 Maybe you dated one of them.

662
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,180
 Everything seemed totally normal.

663
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,460
 And then one day they started doing drugs and robbing banks and talking about how cool

664
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,460
 crack cocaine was.

665
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,100
 You're like, "You changed.

666
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,740
 You changed."

667
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,180
 What about all those stories where people were living their pretty decent lives and then

668
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,140
 all of a sudden they hit the skids?

669
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,580
 What if those people were actually demons?

670
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,500
 What if those people actually all curled out of the attic?

671
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,140
 Because otherwise what's the point?

672
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:13,340
 What's the point of slowly shape shifting into a teenage girl if you're not going to destroy

673
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,340
 people?

674
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:20,740
 Like, what would be the point of some creature in the darkness to slowly become Becky and

675
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,220
 learn how to say her voice and all that stuff?

676
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,140
 And all it wants to do is poke its head out of a wall and go, "Peek-a-boo."

677
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,140
 No.

678
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,740
 If you think about the amount of time and energy it would take to shape shift.

679
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,900
 Forget the shape shifting.

680
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,660
 How long would it take you to learn how to impersonate somebody's voice?

681
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,140
 Plus, live in an attic.

682
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,060
 Live in a place Jason can't pronounce.

683
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,740
 Well, that's easy.

684
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,500
 But then learn how to totally perfectly talk like someone else.

685
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,140
 What would be the point if all you're going to do is stick your head out of a wall?

686
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,140
 No.

687
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,740
 You would want to do demonic things.

688
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,540
 You would want to do monstrous things.

689
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,460
 You would want to go out and rob banks and do crack.

690
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,340
 More likely, get other people to do those things.

691
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,940
 I don't know.

692
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
 I don't know.

693
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
 I don't know.

694
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,660
 That's what I would do if I was a demon.

695
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,860
 I would be constantly trying to drag people down in the shape of somebody else.

696
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,340
 Because if like a demon was walking around, he's like, "Hey kids, crack cocaine is cool.

697
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,260
 Actually, that'd be pretty awesome too.

698
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,260
 He's all flying around.

699
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,820
 He could just magically make crack cocaine appear in people's soft drinks.

700
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,700
 They're like, "Oh, I'm accidentally high and it feels great."

701
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,420
 I guess a demon probably would be more effective if it was like a monster walking down the

702
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,420
 street.

703
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,660
 Definitely be good at robbing banks.

704
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,020
 Because you know, it's a demon.

705
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,020
 He'd just make money up here.

706
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,500
 You wouldn't have to rob a bank.

707
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,140
 Cut out the middleman.

708
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,460
 But anyways, the point is, I guess my point is what's the point of a mimic?

709
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,260
 Because they're really entertaining.

710
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
 I like reading these stories.

711
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,900
 We've covered a couple of them on the show.

712
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,180
 They're becoming very, very common nowadays.

713
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,860
 But yeah, I just don't understand what the end goal would be.

714
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,180
 Is it just to be scary?

715
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,620
 Is it to devour people?

716
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,860
 Is it to ruin the souls of the innocent?

717
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,540
 I imagine the last one.

718
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,980
 But I could be wrong.

719
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,020
 Maybe they just want to be spooky.

720
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,020
 That's the case.

721
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,780
 I mean, they should have accomplished right there.

722
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,140
 Absolutely terrifying to come across.

723
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:29,020
 But I hope my fictional version isn't real.

724
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,300
 But again, who knows?

725
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,020
 That's how this episode ends.

726
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,580
 It just ends with me going, who knows?

727
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,060
 But it's a fascinating story.

728
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,900
 A creepy story nonetheless.

729
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,780
 Probably shouldn't have laughed the last 10 minutes.

730
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,460
 Probably made it a little less creepy.

731
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,660
 But that's just the way things fall out sometimes.
