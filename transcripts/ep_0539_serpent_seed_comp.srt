1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Does Donald Trump have COVID or is he actually on a boat?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,720
 Preparing for red October?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,420
 And then while we're on the topic, it will just squeeze two stories in for one, is it

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:18,440
 possible that a famous fortune teller, Boba Van Ga, actually predicted him getting COVID-19?

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,200
 And then we move away from that, we move away from that story, we move to something timeless.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,600
 Because we're going back to the Garden of Eden.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,400
 Is it possible that the snake's temptation wasn't with an apple?

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,540
 No, no, no, no.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:39,400
 What actually happened is the snake wanted to have sex with Eve, today on Dead Rabbit

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
 Radio.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:50,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
 It's my birthday.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,320
 I turned 44 today, so let's give me a round of applause and blow out some candles on multiple

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
 cakes.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,800
 Everyone has made me a cake, I hope, and you have it.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
 You guys can eat it.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,680
 I won't be able to swing by, but I'll enjoy some delicious cake that you made.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,040
 And let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Corbin's Channel.

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,560
 Corbin's Channel, you get a round of applause as well.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,160
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,240
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,840
 Whatever vehicle we take, you're in charge of.

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,160
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,120
 Really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,480
 And Corbin is giving me a little frosted cupcake.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 It's all beautifully designed.

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,080
 It's in the shape of my head.

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,360
 I don't want to eat it, so I put it in my pocket.

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,560
 And I'm going to give Corbin the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,160
 We're going to need our battleship for this story.

34
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,160
 So get in there, get your little skipper uniform on with the little shorts.

35
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:57,240
 Like Donald Duck, and we are going, setting sail, trying to catch up to Navy One.

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,000
 Somewhere in the mid-Atlantic.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,240
 Those are all the whales swimming alongside Navy trained whales.

38
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,080
 And there's like Navy snipers on the boat as well.

39
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,040
 They see us coming, but they know, they know that they are no match.

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,920
 The United States Navy is no match for our battleship, the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
 The reason why we're chasing down Navy One, legally we're not chasing it down.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,320
 So your service, we are simply within a wide enough area.

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
 So you guys know about Air Force One.

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
 There's one for each division.

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,520
 So you have Marine One, which is the helicopter.

46
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,080
 And then you would have Navy One, which would be his ship.

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,320
 Anything he's on becomes that one.

48
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,320
 So if he gets on, if he's like, move out of the way, fighter pilot, he gets in a plane,

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,600
 that becomes Air Force One.

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,320
 I believe, I could be wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,160
 I wonder if they'll have a spaceship one someday, dude.

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,120
 Wouldn't it be dope?

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,720
 Starship One and the President floating out in space.

54
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,200
 But anyways, hopefully with the space suit, and he's enclosed in a spaceship.

55
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,360
 But anyways, so he's on a boat, and I know every time I say that, you guys are going

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
 to get that song stuck in your head.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,040
 It's been stuck in my head since I read this original story.

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,200
 He's on a boat.

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
 This is a conspiracy.

60
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,680
 I guess I should back up a bit.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,320
 I got ahead of myself with the whale noises.

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,880
 We all know, I think most of the people are aware at this point, someone's eating their

63
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
 cereal right now.

64
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,160
 They're about to spit it out.

65
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,800
 That Trump has come down with the coronavirus.

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,120
 He has COVID-19.

67
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,640
 We'll take a break for that one guy to spit out a cereal who did not know that information

68
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
 yet.

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,680
 Now, almost immediately, I would say really, not even almost immediately.

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
 Immediately.

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,120
 Like the split second that news became available, the conspiracy theories started.

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,160
 One of them was that when he was walking to Marine One to the helicopter, and he's wearing

73
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
 his mask.

74
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,440
 He had on his little face mask.

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,680
 People were doing these close-up enhancements of the photos, and it was showing like you

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,400
 could see like a little line behind his ear, and people were like, "Oh, he's wearing, he's

77
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,880
 like a scuba diver."

78
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,920
 He has this super secret oxygen tank in his back, and he's walking around, and this tube

79
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,840
 that's completely invisible from the collar of the shirt to the top of his ear.

80
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,360
 It's 100% invisible, but at the top of the ear, there's a little white line that is that

81
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
 technology.

82
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,800
 It's stealth oxygen tanks.

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
 Only the military has them.

84
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,560
 It's reverse engineer from Gray Alien Technology, and they're completely invisible until they

85
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
 reach the top of the ear.

86
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,760
 And then they're invisible again going into the mouth.

87
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
 It's amazing technology.

88
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,720
 They just, they go have to work on that quarter inch there.

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,120
 We now know that he actually was on supplemental oxygen at the White House, but I don't think

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,880
 he was walking to Marine One in an invisible scuba suit.

91
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,400
 But that was the first conspiracy theory to pop up, and that was obviously a conspiracy

92
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,320
 theory showing this is how weak Trump is.

93
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,080
 Because it's interesting because we have now, for the first time ever that I've seen, and

94
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,400
 I've been studying this stuff for three decades, we have both sides of an issue dishing out

95
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
 conspiracy theories.

96
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,440
 Normally, it's only one side.

97
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,760
 Normally it's one group of people saying, "We need to do X because of Y," and then an opposing

98
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,960
 group going, "They're reptiles, or they're the NWO, or they're the Illuminati."

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
 Now we're seeing it happen on both sides.

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,520
 It's really bizarre.

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,040
 Because obviously that conspiracy theory would be based on the fact that you wanted Trump

102
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,480
 to be sicker than he may actually be.

103
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,000
 Because right now they're talking about he may be released Monday.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,560
 He may be out of hospital on Monday.

105
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
 But there's all these photos going around being like, "Look at how weak this guy is.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 He's dead.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 He's going to die any moment now."

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And to compliment that, every time he's released a video, people are like, "Oh, that's edited.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,420
 You can tell where it's edited.

110
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,080
 You can tell they're editing out."

111
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,080
 Him going, "Oh, give me some of that gray alien tech."

112
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
 And then so they edit all that stuff out.

113
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,440
 They have a copy of Adobe Premiere that they reverse engineered from gray alien technologies.

114
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
 They can perfectly edit it.

115
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,240
 So he's like, "Hey guys, I'm doing fine.

116
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,320
 Yeah, I mean, they say the next couple hours, the next couple days are going to be really

117
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,240
 important, but I'm doing fine."

118
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,800
 In reality, he was actually dying during that video.

119
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,400
 So you have conspiracy theories coming out from the people who want him to suffer.

120
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,240
 We want him to already be dead.

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,120
 Then you have the group of conspiracy theories that are the complete opposite.

122
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,840
 That's why we're trailing Navy One.

123
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
 Because this is the newest conspiracy theory to go out.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,520
 I talked about these videos.

125
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,520
 He's kind of sitting there and he's done two of them so far.

126
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,400
 And he's like, "Yeah, everything's going fine.

127
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,120
 You know, I'm sick and it sucks.

128
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,400
 But if you only knew the type of access to gray alien technology that I have, you want

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
 to be worried.

130
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,640
 Everything's going to be A-okay."

131
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,440
 And those videos were released.

132
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,600
 And then the bombshell dropped.

133
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,960
 It's go time, guys.

134
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,760
 So we're following this Navy One and all of a sudden we see helicopters flying off of

135
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,080
 in every direction.

136
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,600
 We see fighter jets shooting overhead.

137
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,560
 I was like, "Oh man, we should have taken the Jason jet.

138
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
 Why are we in this slow boat?"

139
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,680
 By the time we get back to America, we see Democratic leaders being let out of their

140
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
 houses.

141
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
 The jets are transformers.

142
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,960
 They transform into robots.

143
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
 They're punching the house open.

144
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,000
 Obama's like, "No, no, he's getting picked up by Starscream.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Hillary Clinton's running through the woods.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,680
 I wish I had some of that gray alien breathing technology right now.

147
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
 She's running.

148
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
 Guards with dogs.

149
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,760
 They're chasing her down.

150
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
 They grab her.

151
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
 They're like, "You're under arrest."

152
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
 She's like, "For what?"

153
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
 And they're like, "We'll figure that out later.

154
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,880
 Because right now this is Red October."

155
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
 More jets flying overhead dramatically.

156
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,800
 Red October is something that has basically been predicted since November 2016.

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,640
 It's the roundup of all of the people who tried to overthrow Trump.

158
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,760
 It was tied deeply in the Mola report.

159
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,200
 QAnon was a big proponent of it in the beginning.

160
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,800
 I don't really follow QAnon much anymore, so I don't know if it's still a thing that's

161
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,320
 being talked about in those circles.

162
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,080
 The idea that these people were trying to overthrow Trump, and this allows him, this

163
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,560
 COVID-19 thing allows him, so the theory is he's not really sick.

164
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,520
 That they needed to get him out of the White House and onto a boat so they could arrest

165
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,360
 all of these leaders, all of these people.

166
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,760
 And also part of, a weird part of the conspiracy theory is that someone was saying that Obama

167
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,560
 and the Clintons and Rachel Maddow and a bunch of other people all used the same phrase in

168
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,080
 their Twitter saying, "We hope you a safe and speedy recovery."

169
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
 They used that same phrase and people said that's some sort of code and I go, "No, this

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 is just you and me and lazy and copying and pasting stuff."

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,280
 But anyways, so that's how deep, quote unquote, deep this goes.

172
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,800
 Donald Trump's actually on a boat right now.

173
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,400
 And so what's the proof of this?

174
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,960
 That he's not in the hospital right now getting treatment, that he's actually on a boat is,

175
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,800
 one, those videos that were previously thought to have been edited because he was dying and

176
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,000
 they had to edit out all of his deep breaths.

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,040
 They're actually, if you look very closely, if you look very closely at the video, one

178
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,080
 of them, there's flags behind him, right?

179
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,160
 He's indoors, they're not waving super dramatically.

180
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,680
 He should have turned on a fan though, that would have been cool.

181
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,360
 There's just flags sitting there and he's sitting at a desk talking to people.

182
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,360
 And if you look very, very closely, you see him move, right?

183
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
 You see him move.

184
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,960
 In a closed room.

185
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,640
 So the theory is, is that there's only one time a flag will move in a closed room.

186
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,600
 It's not if someone opens the door, right?

187
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,560
 It's not that there's a window open because he has a disease that's a respiratory disease

188
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,280
 and they tend to get some fresh air.

189
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,520
 No, it has to be on a boat.

190
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,440
 The boat is moving, it's rocking super slowly and the flag's waving.

191
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,040
 It's not even waving, it's just slightly moving, right?

192
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,520
 There could be a bunch of flies back there, I don't know.

193
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,280
 And then he did another video where he's sitting in a different room.

194
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,640
 Oh, that's suspicious.

195
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,200
 Have you ever seen a human sit in two different rooms?

196
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
 What?

197
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,280
 Oh, Art Bell on this one!

198
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,840
 There's another video where he's sitting in a different room and there's like these

199
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,800
 doors behind them, these panels and they have these knobs.

200
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,960
 I know guys, whoa, calm down.

201
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
 A door with knobs?

202
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,000
 What type of technology is this?

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,720
 This is already getting weird.

204
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,160
 Really, those knobs are only found in one place and one place only.

205
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
 Crew ships.

206
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,000
 So now my question is this.

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,720
 My question is, I thought he was on a Navy battleship preparing for Red October.

208
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,160
 Now he's on Carnival Cruise Lines, which is the one place you don't want to be during

209
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,880
 the COVID-19 pandemic.

210
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,440
 These guys like, "Hey, Trump, we're about to arrest all these people."

211
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,680
 So we're going to fake that you had COVID-19.

212
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,720
 He's like, "Great idea.

213
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
 Great, great idea.

214
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,880
 It's going to be huge."

215
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,360
 And the Secretary of State's like, "It will.

216
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,520
 It will be huge, sir."

217
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,440
 But then we're going to fake that you have COVID-19 and then we are going to hide you

218
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,720
 out on a place that's known for spreading COVID-19.

219
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,080
 And he goes, "That plan sounds good.

220
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,240
 It sounds huge."

221
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,400
 And the Secretary of State's like, "Yeah, that's the only Trump impression I can do,

222
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
 thankfully."

223
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,960
 If you happen to be on a Carnival Cruise Line right now, my condolences for you and

224
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,080
 your family, I'm so sorry.

225
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,440
 And if you happen to see the Konga Line, a man enjoying himself COVID-19 free for now

226
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,640
 because again, he's on a cruise ship.

227
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
 He's dancing.

228
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
 He's dancing there.

229
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,800
 And he goes, "That guy looks awfully familiar."

230
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,320
 And then you realize that there's 20 Secret Service agents dancing next to him doing

231
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,640
 the little Konga.

232
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,080
 You might be on the front lines of Red October.

233
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,680
 That might actually be what's going on.

234
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,320
 It's not, by the way.

235
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,640
 It's totally not.

236
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,560
 And then, yeah, we'll be back to whatever bizarre conspiracy theory is next.

237
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,760
 And actually, that is a great transition.

238
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,920
 Corbyn, let's go ahead and leave behind the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

239
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,880
 I don't want to be super Trump heavy, but we're going to, I'm just going to knock this

240
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,440
 one out of the park because I know a lot of people are going to request this.

241
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
 Let's hop in that Jason jet.

242
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,360
 We're actually going to take the Jason jet from C. It's a jump jet, so it takes off

243
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,600
 right off the deck of the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

244
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,480
 We are headed out to the Balkans.

245
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,920
 I've done a bit of information on this woman before.

246
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
 Boba Wagner.

247
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
 Wagner?

248
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,560
 Probably not Wagner.

249
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,760
 Boba Wagner.

250
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,720
 I talked about her before in the episode.

251
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,360
 I'm not going to, basically, all you need to know is she's known as the Nostradamus

252
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
 of the Balkans.

253
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,920
 She's made a ton of predictions, and people say she has an 85% accuracy rate.

254
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,280
 Which if you get one wrong, then you're wrong.

255
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,040
 Like a prophet, someone who makes predictions should never be wrong, right?

256
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,240
 It should be like, "Oh yeah, I thought the bangles were going to win.

257
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,400
 It was actually the bobcats.

258
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,720
 There's a bunch of cats are attacking you.

259
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,160
 You're like, "I don't care which one wins eating me.

260
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
 Who's going to win again?"

261
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
 She actually made a prediction of a FIFA game.

262
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,080
 She said, "Both teams will start with a letter B."

263
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
 Only one of them did.

264
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,320
 I'm thinking, "If you're able to tell the future, why are you even wasting your time

265
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
 on that stuff?"

266
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
 "FIFA game."

267
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
 Sorry, FIFA fans.

268
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,200
 A bunch of soccer who begins attacking me now.

269
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
 Anyways, there's a big story going around right now.

270
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,760
 It's all over the news, all quote unquote news where Boba Wagner has actually predicted

271
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,400
 that Trump was going to get the coronavirus.

272
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,920
 Here's the headline from the sun.

273
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,400
 "Saw it coming."

274
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
 "Blind mystic."

275
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
 "Boba..."

276
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,840
 See, like that pun, like they're making fun of that "Fact of that woman's blind."

277
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,560
 Nice pun there, the sun.

278
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,920
 "Saw it coming."

279
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
 "Blind mystic."

280
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,920
 "Boba Wagner predicted Donald Trump's coronavirus battle after saying president will get sick

281
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,420
 in 2020."

282
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
 That's the headline there.

283
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,520
 I wonder if she predicted how many times I would mispronounce her name.

284
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
 I read the article.

285
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,880
 I was like, "Okay, I'll give it a shot."

286
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,160
 I think that she's not accurate.

287
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,320
 I think that you can punch a bunch of holes in her stories, but whatever.

288
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,040
 I'll take a look at it, right?

289
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,720
 And it says in the sun of all places that she was able to predict that Donald Trump would

290
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
 get sick.

291
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,720
 And I'll read the actual, let me read you this quote here.

292
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,680
 "Boba Wagner, also known as the Nostradamus of the Balkans, is claimed by fans..."

293
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,160
 She has fans, people are holding little penance, that's a future on it.

294
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,480
 "Is claimed by fans to have foretold that the U.S. president would suffer from..."

295
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,760
 Quote, "a mysterious illness."

296
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
 Unquote.

297
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,960
 "In 2020, which will leave him deaf and with a brain tumor."

298
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,080
 You know?

299
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,680
 Pretty, pretty accurate, right?

300
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,360
 That you're predicting this guy's gonna get sick in 2020?

301
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
 Here's a tip.

302
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
 Here's a tip.

303
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,440
 I've actually talked about this on the past, on the show.

304
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,280
 Ooh, that's fortuitous, mentioning the past during the future.

305
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,800
 I recommend people to go out, if you're a fan, if you believe anything Nostradamus ever

306
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:50,200
 has to say, go buy a book about Nostradamus from like the 70s or the 80s.

307
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,560
 And it will all be like in the year 1997, the world's gonna end, and the enter guys

308
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,960
 are gonna show up and da-da-da-da.

309
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,280
 Go buy a book from the 1970s, 1980s.

310
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
 The world was supposed to be over by now.

311
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,040
 The way Nostradamus predicted it.

312
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,840
 You can squirrel around these things any way you want.

313
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,920
 So this is what you can do if you don't want to go to the bookstore.

314
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,400
 Just use Google search engine and you can set the search parameters.

315
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:20,320
 So I looked up Babavanga, and I looked up Trump, but I looked them up before this year.

316
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,000
 Before anyone knew anything about coronavirus.

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,940
 So going back, there were actually articles about this.

318
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,120
 Let's take a journey here.

319
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,960
 First off, she said that Obama was gonna be the last president and the nation would be

320
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,360
 divided between the north and the south, setting the stage for another civil war.

321
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,240
 Absolutely not even close to happening.

322
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,880
 Civil war, people are getting riled up, but it's not north and south.

323
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,880
 It's pretty much coastal areas and the center of the United States.

324
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,520
 So right there, just totally wrong.

325
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,240
 And Obama wasn't the last president, but whatever.

326
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,600
 There's already two wrong.

327
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,660
 Where's her 85% accuracy now?

328
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
 That's two wrong.

329
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,340
 Obama wasn't the last president.

330
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,820
 North and south wasn't divided up.

331
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,060
 Actually I should say this too.

332
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,780
 She's dead.

333
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,620
 She died in 1995.

334
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,180
 She died in 1996.

335
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,460
 She's not saying anything.

336
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,980
 People are taking her words and they're becoming viral hits and they're getting these articles

337
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,220
 running about them.

338
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,940
 So according to whoever is translating it on any given day, Obama is supposed to be the

339
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,940
 last president.

340
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
 No.

341
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,960
 The last one, the other one, his name is Trump.

342
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,520
 And then if you look at this illness, in 2019 it says that Trump was going to get a brain

343
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,880
 tumor and go deaf or die.

344
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,960
 Which is a huge difference between the two, right?

345
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,360
 I know the word deaf and dead only has a difference of one letter, but there's actually a huge

346
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
 difference between those two words, right?

347
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,840
 There's a lot of people who are deaf, who are quite doing quite well being alive.

348
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
 So you have that.

349
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,920
 It's not true.

350
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
 It's not true.

351
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,540
 You can go back and look and see that the original one was, and the original one was

352
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,980
 it had not mentioned an illness at all.

353
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,460
 If you look at an article before 2019, they say Donald Trump will get a brain tumor and

354
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,820
 either go deaf or die.

355
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,020
 And now we're in October 2020.

356
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,460
 And so the thing is, is going forward, this is how she keeps her 85% accuracy rate.

357
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,860
 Going forward, you'll start seeing it pop up on conspiracy sites.

358
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:25,080
 If you haven't already, Boba Wagner predicted Donald Trump is going to get a coronavirus,

359
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
 it's not true.

360
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,120
 It's what he, she did not predict he was going to get an illness at all.

361
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,040
 Someone added that word and I actually don't even think she predicted that Donald Trump

362
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,960
 is going to get a brain tumor because if Obama was the last president, then who the hell

363
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
 is Donald Trump?

364
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,440
 Like, she's like, I can see the host of a game show called The Apprentice.

365
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,680
 He has a brain tumor, like what?

366
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,340
 That'd be like, I can see Drew Carey, he's going to lose a lot of weight, he's actually

367
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,740
 going to look really good for his age.

368
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,740
 People are like, what?

369
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,100
 Why are you even predicting just these random people?

370
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,060
 If he wasn't the president, then how did she predict it anyways?

371
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,260
 But you say, Jason, but I saw that she predicted the rise of the coronavirus to begin with.

372
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,460
 Well apparently one of the quotes we actually have from her was when she was still alive

373
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,660
 and people weren't so much reading into it.

374
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,140
 I mean, they were, but it wasn't, it was her actually saying this.

375
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,720
 Apparently she actually said, the corona will be all over us.

376
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,180
 So let's take a look at another one of her predictions here actually.

377
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,040
 One of her most famous predictions nowadays is her predicting 9/11.

378
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,280
 This is again an actual quote from her.

379
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
 Horror!

380
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,440
 This is actual quote, I'm not just saying that, I'm not like a news boy standing on

381
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
 the street corner.

382
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
 Horror!

383
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
 Horror!

384
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,080
 The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds.

385
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,660
 The wolves will be howling in a bush and innocent blood will be gushing.

386
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,460
 Unquote.

387
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,500
 So people go, see that was her predicting 9/11.

388
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,740
 Which I would agree that that's awfully close had she been born if she was a contemporary

389
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
 of Nostronomus.

390
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:06,940
 Have you ever met anyone who died in the year 1996 who refers to planes as steel birds?

391
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,020
 Like she'd be like a couple planes are going to smash into the, and even if she was envisioning

392
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,000
 this as birds crashing in, she's blind but she's not dumb.

393
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,160
 She goes, oh some steel birds are going to start blowing stuff up or whatever.

394
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
 I actually even forgot what it was.

395
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
 They're being attacked by steel birds.

396
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,040
 Couldn't someone at the time said, do you mean airplanes that have been in existence

397
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,480
 since 1910?

398
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
 Remember?

399
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,120
 And she's like, oh yeah, that's what I meant, that's what I meant airplane.

400
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,680
 So that's so vague but anyways, this is what I love about being able to dice all this stuff

401
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
 up.

402
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,300
 She does something so vague like that.

403
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,500
 She can call airplane, multiple airplanes, steel birds.

404
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,300
 Not say President Bush, because obviously she knows American politics if she's talking

405
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
 about Obama.

406
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,980
 I guess she predicted Obama was going to be black.

407
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,140
 I'm like, what?

408
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
 Okay but anyway, fine.

409
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,340
 I don't know, I didn't look into that one.

410
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,580
 Maybe she got that one right.

411
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:10,980
 But steel birds will do this and then the wolves will be howling in a bush.

412
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,300
 She doesn't make any connection to President Bush, who his father was around back then.

413
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,440
 His father had already been president when she died, so she wouldn't.

414
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,680
 She's not an idiot.

415
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,760
 She's not an idiot.

416
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,280
 She's super vague on the steel birds in the bush but she straight up names the virus,

417
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,120
 the corona.

418
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,160
 You can't have it both ways.

419
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,280
 Because if you go, oh no, she's being vague about the steel birds because that's how she

420
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
 envisioned it.

421
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,120
 But then she turns around at you in a lab coat and she's like, watch out for corona.

422
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,520
 She's pointing at the camera.

423
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
 You can't have it both ways.

424
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,060
 Either she's incredibly specific and names the class of virus or she talks about it

425
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,740
 in very flowery terms like wolves out of a bush.

426
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,820
 Corona actually means crown.

427
00:20:52,820 --> 00:21:00,020
 So at the time, up until December 2019, people thought that to mean that the Russian Tsar

428
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,820
 was going to be reinstated and attack the Balkans, take the area over.

429
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,380
 The corona will be all over us or that the British Empire would start to take over.

430
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,560
 She has a lot of mismatched conspiracies too.

431
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,160
 So you can just go down deep rabbit holes with that type of stuff.

432
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,520
 Corbin's channel, we're going to say goodbye to Boba V-

433
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,280
 The last time I have to pronounce her name is the hardest time.

434
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,880
 We're going to say goodbye to Boba V. Go ahead and call in that carboner copter.

435
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,240
 She's like, what is that?

436
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,560
 Is that a dual XML hemi with triple shock absorbers?

437
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
 That must be a carboner copter.

438
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,480
 And we're like, I thought you only knew these things as steel birds.

439
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
 I was like, hehehehehe.

440
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,660
 They just, I just say vague stuff and they pay me lots and lots of rubles.

441
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,660
 But she's dead.

442
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,900
 So they're passing through her ghost hands.

443
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,500
 But she is now taking them to a ghost casino.

444
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,580
 She's possessed all the rubles, taking them off to a ghost casino.

445
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580
 I guess that happens.

446
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,380
 I have no other way to end that story.

447
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,980
 Carboner copters landed.

448
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,220
 Corbin's channel putting on his helicopter outfit.

449
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,380
 He's really dressed up for this episode.

450
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,460
 Brought his own clothes.

451
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,140
 He's wearing his little helicopter's outfit.

452
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,180
 He's dressed as a helicopter, flying a helicopter.

453
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,320
 We are headed out to the Garden of Eden.

454
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,040
 Choo cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho cho

455
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,540
 We're going to land.

456
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,600
 I probably shouldn't write this as like a holy spot on the planet.

457
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,840
 We're landing in the middle of Garden of Eden.

458
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,000
 There's species that are trying to outrun us for landing on them.

459
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,280
 Corbin's going out of his way to kill the Gleep Glorps.

460
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,680
 They're the most beautiful species on the planet.

461
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,600
 But they don't exist anymore because Corbin landed the carboner copter right on top of

462
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
 them on purpose.

463
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,540
 We get out and we're walking around and there's like a bunch of animals and stuff, right?

464
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,500
 And they're not eating us because that was something that I always wondered when I was

465
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,780
 a little kid.

466
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,420
 Why don't the animals eat each other or more specifically why don't they eat Adam in the

467
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
 Garden of Eden?

468
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,140
 And I remember, I can't really say that my dad told me this because you know my dad

469
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
 is a minister.

470
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,540
 I don't remember if he told me this or if I learned this from a cartoon or if I just

471
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
 made it up.

472
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,020
 But apparently the animals weren't eating each other because they didn't have to.

473
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,080
 I don't want to say my dad said that because I don't know if theologically that's true,

474
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,960
 but the animals didn't have to, right?

475
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,240
 I guess there was like replicators there and they would just line walk up and hit a button

476
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,680
 and go like "One fried rabbit please!"

477
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,920
 And the rabbit next to him was like "Ugh!"

478
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,920
 And then the lion would eat the rabbit and the rabbit would be like "One fried piece

479
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
 of barley!"

480
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,480
 And then like the barley next to him would be like "Ugh!"

481
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,860
 The barley was just like "Some cow poop please!"

482
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,900
 And the cow's like has a big smile on his face.

483
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,820
 Anyways, they weren't eating each other.

484
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,060
 They didn't eat each other on the ark either.

485
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,860
 But I guess maybe, you know, I guess if God can create the entire universe, He can make

486
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
 animals behave.

487
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,820
 But he was walking around or like hanging out with lions and stuff like that.

488
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,020
 While we're going through that whole thing, there's this hot chick on the other side of

489
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,700
 Eden named Eve.

490
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
 She's walking around.

491
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,500
 She's been around for a couple hundred years by now.

492
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,900
 She looks really good.

493
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,560
 They don't wear leaves at this point.

494
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,040
 They're really shocked at the fact that we're wearing all this clothing.

495
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
 But you know, whatever.

496
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,600
 They haven't had original sin yet.

497
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
 See we have.

498
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
 We're ashamed of being naked.

499
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,480
 And we're watching this hot chick walk around and stuff like that.

500
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
 And we see a snake.

501
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,120
 That was a very long-winded way to get us to what this story's about.

502
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,880
 And I think most of you guys know the story of the Garden of Eden.

503
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,680
 I probably should have told that instead of going off on that long-winded rant.

504
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,160
 But it's my birthday episode.

505
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,820
 So if you don't know the story of the Garden of Eden, I'm going to go over real quickly.

506
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,820
 God creates all the animals on the planet and creates this little special place on the

507
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
 planet called Eden.

508
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,500
 It is what it sounds like.

509
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,820
 It's what the word Eden means.

510
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,860
 It's a paradise.

511
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,540
 And he goes, "Adam, you can chill here and it's your job to name all the animals.

512
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,740
 And it's your job to take care of all the animals too.

513
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,620
 You can do whatever you want, but do not eat from the tree of knowledge."

514
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,060
 And Adam's like, "Yeah, that sounds totally dope, dude.

515
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,240
 I'm just walking around hanging out with the Gleep Gorps.

516
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
 These animals are going to be amazing someday."

517
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
 And God's like, "I know.

518
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,200
 Bring a little tear to God's eye."

519
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,240
 He's like, "Protect those one most of all."

520
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,680
 And Adam's like, "Of course."

521
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,640
 Eventually Adam's like, "Yeah, this is kind of cool, man, but lonely."

522
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
 And you know what I mean?

523
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
 He's like nudging God.

524
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
 He's like, "You know how lonely?

525
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
 Huh-huh."

526
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
 And God's like, "Stop it.

527
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
 Stop nudging me.

528
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
 Yeah, I get how you're lonely.

529
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,080
 You want a woman."

530
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,320
 So he takes one of Adam's ribs out and he makes a woman.

531
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,540
 And then that's pretty convenient, right?

532
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,660
 You're like, "Oh, I need a girlfriend."

533
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,720
 You're like getting in horrible car accidents.

534
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,420
 Your ribs are shooting out everywhere.

535
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,340
 All of a sudden you have a harem of 10 women.

536
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,740
 Eve is created from his rib.

537
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,200
 He was created from clay and earth.

538
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,700
 She was created from a rib.

539
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,200
 Eve, I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Adam.

540
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,020
 Don't eat from the tree of knowledge.

541
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,820
 And Eve's eyes are shifting from side to side.

542
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,100
 That's not a defect.

543
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,660
 He did make her eyes correctly.

544
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,260
 She's like, "Hmm."

545
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,080
 So eventually, I think in the beginning she probably was like, "Yeah, you're right, God.

546
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
 I won't do that."

547
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,080
 But then this serpent shows up.

548
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,680
 He's hanging out in the tree.

549
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,920
 Now this has always been another thing that's puzzled me because the serpent's talking

550
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
 to Eve.

551
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,800
 And this is in the Bible.

552
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,600
 The serpent's like, "Hey, Eve, why don't you come here and eat this apple?"

553
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,080
 God doesn't want you to eat this apple because this apple will make you on par with God.

554
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,460
 The fact that Eve wasn't completely freaked out that the snake was talking to her makes

555
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,460
 me think that all the animals talked back then.

556
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,980
 All the animals were talking, apparently, because if none of the animals talked, the

557
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,620
 only one that talked was trying to get you to eat an apple.

558
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,740
 One, you want to listen to it.

559
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,900
 And two, you'd run off and tell your best friend, "Hey, there's a talking snake over

560
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
 there."

561
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,260
 But if everything talked, you wouldn't even think anything of it.

562
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,920
 When she eats the apple, she immediately knows sin.

563
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,420
 That's what the knowledge was of.

564
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,320
 It was like of sin, of right and wrong.

565
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,160
 You're basically automatons in a way.

566
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,560
 And that's a big theological debate.

567
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,800
 I'm making this episode even longer and longer, but that's a big theological debate.

568
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,040
 Did Adam have free will?

569
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,480
 Did Adam and Eve have free will before they ate the apple?

570
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,280
 But she eats the apple and then she convinces Adam to eat the apple and God shows up and

571
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,900
 he's like, "Oh, come on, man, I gave you guys one rule."

572
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
 Adam's like, "Dude, it wasn't me.

573
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,900
 It was her."

574
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
 And he's like, "I don't care.

575
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
 You ate it."

576
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,700
 Like, yeah, she ate it first, but you did take a bite.

577
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,900
 So he kicked him out of Eden and this is what gets left out a lot.

578
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,880
 This is another interesting little side note to this story.

579
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,260
 He kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden and says, "You'll never be let back

580
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,260
 in."

581
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,060
 In the Bible, it says where the Garden of Eden is, but you can't find it on a map.

582
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,320
 That's where these four rivers are supposed to intersect like the Euphrates and so like

583
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,040
 they're on earth, but they don't intersect.

584
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,160
 Mandela effect, maybe the very first Mandela effect.

585
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,800
 This dude, his name's Adam.

586
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,080
 Adam and Eve are now outside of the Garden of Eden.

587
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,360
 So everyone knows that part of the story, but this is 100% in the Bible.

588
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,280
 This isn't like apocryphal or anything like that.

589
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
 That's not the end of it.

590
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,680
 God says, "Not only am I kicking both of you out of Eden," he basically locked them

591
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,960
 out of Eden.

592
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,020
 He goes, "Eve, because you're the one who started this.

593
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,420
 Childbirth is going to be extremely dangerous and painful.

594
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,860
 It wasn't going to be that way at first.

595
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,060
 I was going to let you have as many babies as you wanted.

596
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:25,380
 They're going to pop out of you like gumballs out of a machine, but now you are going to

597
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,820
 have to give birth to painful babies, not painful babies.

598
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,700
 They are covered in spikes.

599
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,500
 Childbirth is going to be very painful for you.

600
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,920
 For Adam, and basically for Eve, this punishment fit both of them, work was going to become

601
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,840
 incredibly hard and you would spend the rest of your life doing backbreaking labor.

602
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,160
 It was no longer going to be sitting in there with a replicator going, "Fruit box," and

603
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
 a fruit box appears.

604
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,880
 It was going to be really hard work.

605
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,840
 And I think one of the most curious things about it is that he says, "Snake, because

606
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,680
 you are involved in this whole thing," and the snake's like, "What, me?"

607
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
 That wasn't me.

608
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,960
 That was like the devil disguises me.

609
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,740
 And God goes, "No, I don't believe you, because you are involved in this whole thing.

610
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,660
 The snake gets punished as well."

611
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,300
 And not like that snake, God doesn't turn him into a bow tie or anything like that,

612
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,580
 turn him into a nice pair of shoes.

613
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,220
 He tells all snakes, "You're going to lose your legs.

614
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,780
 You will slither on the ground and you will eat dust."

615
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,500
 So at that point, that's why snakes have no legs.

616
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,780
 I think this is really, really interesting because it turns out that that story may not

617
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,760
 be the whole thing.

618
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,720
 There was a big philosopher back in time, not as far back as the guy who was right

619
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,040
 outside the Garden of Eden.

620
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,680
 He's like, "Have I got a story for you?"

621
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,800
 This guy was big in America.

622
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,840
 He mostly grew to power in World War II.

623
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,520
 He was like a traveling minister.

624
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,000
 His name was William Branham.

625
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,840
 So he was like a man, I think I said he was a philosopher at first, but I misspoke.

626
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,260
 He was a minister and he ended up becoming super popular during World War II.

627
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,980
 He was giving these huge rallies.

628
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,700
 I know there's a lot of, I know you're like, "Who are you talking about?

629
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
 You talking about William guy?

630
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,700
 You talking about all these other dudes you were giving huge rallies?

631
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
 You talking about Mussolini?

632
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
 You talking about Hitler?

633
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,420
 No, I'm talking about the other guy who was doing huge rallies during World War II whipping

634
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,780
 people up into a frenzy against this class of humans that weren't like them.

635
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,700
 William Branham had a theory.

636
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,960
 We walk into one of his big tent revivals.

637
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,360
 People are just sitting there.

638
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,000
 They're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

639
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,680
 It's like a white snake concert.

640
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,480
 But this time it's not a white snake.

641
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,240
 It's the snake, the great snake.

642
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,040
 It's Satan.

643
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,920
 And actually that made it sound like Satan was up on the podium, but no, it's William

644
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
 Branham.

645
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,840
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, you all you guys, yeah, you're right.

646
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
 Everything I'm saying is right."

647
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
 Woohoohoohoo.

648
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,960
 And he's like whipping them up.

649
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,360
 He wasn't the most eloquent speaker.

650
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,340
 This take on the Garden of Eden story was this, and it's not even his original take.

651
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,100
 There was a lot of people who believed this.

652
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
 Even before him.

653
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,900
 He just made it super popularized.

654
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:09,380
 He believed that that whole story was the snake seducing Eve to have sex and ended up

655
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,060
 giving her the serpent seed.

656
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,780
 So there's this, I've looked briefly into the science.

657
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,100
 I don't really know how true it is.

658
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,340
 I've read a couple articles on it, but there's this thing, and it could be true, that a woman

659
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,200
 retains the DNA of all the men she's had sex with.

660
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,320
 I don't know again if that's scientifically true.

661
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,520
 So don't come at me if it's not.

662
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,720
 I'm stating now, I don't know if it's true or not.

663
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,800
 But in this theory that every time a woman has sex with a man, she retains some of his

664
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
 DNA.

665
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,000
 I'm sure there would be, at the very least, some sort of shelf life, right?

666
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,720
 The dude you were banging when you were 21, they're not still hanging out.

667
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,520
 They're like, "You're a 69-year-old woman.

668
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,400
 You're like, 'Oh, I really want to go to country music dance,' because there's a bunch of little

669
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,740
 hoedown DNAs in here.

670
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,220
 I don't know if that's how it works."

671
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,140
 I don't think that's how DNA works to begin with, but anyways, that a woman retains the

672
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,900
 DNA of all of her past lovers.

673
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
 May or may not be true.

674
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,900
 I don't know.

675
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:08,220
 But that's kind of where this theory comes from, is that she had sex with the serpent,

676
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,260
 and she got the serpent DNA in her, the serpent seed.

677
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,580
 And so what happens is, is that when she starts having sex with Adam, because the story is

678
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:24,760
 they were the original humans, that some of her descendants, most namely Cain, the first

679
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,240
 murderer, according to the Bible, was a serpent.

680
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,560
 Was a serpent, half-serpent, I guess would be the way to put it.

681
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
 He wasn't full-serpent.

682
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,060
 A little snake didn't slither out.

683
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,400
 I mean, Abel wouldn't be like, "Oh, I should hang out with my brother."

684
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,440
 He's always on the up and up, as he's just a snake eating dust.

685
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,520
 That he was half-human, half-snake.

686
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,760
 He was the beginning of the serpent race.

687
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,380
 Or as we may call them today, the reptilians.

688
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,820
 Now, this actually popped up in the Gnostic Gospel of Philip.

689
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,020
 I had never heard of this conspiracy theory before, but it's been around for thousands

690
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,020
 of years.

691
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:05,020
 This was actually in one of the Gnostic Gospel books.

692
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,140
 The Gnostic Gospel of Philip is actually where Dan Brown got a lot of his Mary Magdalene

693
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,640
 and Jesus had a baby.

694
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,180
 I don't know if they had a baby, but they were having sex.

695
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,580
 I might have just had it that part.

696
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,580
 But he might have.

697
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,360
 I think they did, because that was the descendants of the royal blood of Britain or the Knights

698
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
 Temple or something like that.

699
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,120
 But anyways, Jesus and Mary Magdalene were a couple.

700
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,360
 That Jesus may or may not have died.

701
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,160
 He may have faked his death and moved to Europe and set his bags down and go, "Ah, now nothing,

702
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,640
 but peace and relaxation in the next 2,000 years."

703
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,320
 Then all of a sudden, all these wars break out every three minutes in his name.

704
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:49,060
 But William Brannham, he made this a national philosophy that you had a group of people

705
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,660
 who weren't even human.

706
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,940
 Everyone's like, "Yeah, yeah, woohoo!"

707
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,620
 So Brannham would speak this stuff.

708
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,000
 He'd basically say, "These people are not like us.

709
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,180
 These people are reptilians."

710
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,700
 And he can name them out.

711
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,740
 He can name them out.

712
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,980
 Educated people.

713
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,260
 If you were an educated person, you might be a reptilian.

714
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,260
 You're like, "Well, that's good.

715
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,260
 I'm a dummy.

716
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,260
 Yay!"

717
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,280
 And it's funny because you imagine this is the way these type of things work out is

718
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,480
 that they attract all groups.

719
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,760
 Imagine there's someone in the group being like, "Oh, I do like reading books on Sunday."

720
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,680
 And he's kind of like, "Oh, no, am I a reptile?"

721
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,680
 He's like checking his skin.

722
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,840
 He's like, "Well, I didn't lay an egg today."

723
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,200
 So that's a really good sign.

724
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
 A scientist?

725
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,680
 If you're a scientist, you might be a reptilian.

726
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,600
 That's probably one of the ways they're able to hide it so long because you'll be like,

727
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
 "Sir, sir."

728
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,840
 That's what we call scientists.

729
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
 That's what we call them, sir.

730
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,900
 Look at, I found this huge human size.

731
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,620
 It's not as big as a human, but I found this reptilian scale that looks like it would fit

732
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,500
 on a human or something like that.

733
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,380
 The scientist is like, "What are you talking about, you lunatic?"

734
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,620
 Here, I'll take a look at it.

735
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,660
 And then the scientist takes it back into his lab and he goes, "Yeah, yeah, I'll run

736
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,260
 a bunch of tests on it right now."

737
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,980
 And he's putting it back on his arm.

738
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,540
 He's like, "That's where you went, scale."

739
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,380
 And then he would tell them, "Oh, no.

740
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,320
 I just turned out to be like a wombat's iris or something like that."

741
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,880
 And the guys are like, "Well, I guess that makes sense.

742
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,320
 I always trust scientists."

743
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
 He walks away.

744
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,360
 He's tripping over tiny eggs in the scientist's front yard.

745
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,100
 He also said that a majority of criminals, not all of them, which are very curious, majority

746
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,000
 of criminals were actually reptilians as well.

747
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,440
 So I don't know why just the majority of them.

748
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,800
 I mean, I can understand him being like, "Heroine affects the lizard brain more than a normal

749
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
 human brain.

750
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,740
 Let me snort all this heroin."

751
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,740
 See I'm just fine.

752
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,940
 Now does anyone else want to do that test?

753
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,060
 Does anyone else want me to test that again?

754
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,180
 Come here, serve with your ovium.

755
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,060
 I guess there were some crimes he would say weren't reptilian based, like maybe jaywalking,

756
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:59,620
 but I guess if you're like getting arrested for stealing eggs or laying naked on rocks

757
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,380
 on cold days, that's probably a sign of you being a reptilian criminal.

758
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,960
 He also, I mean I could just keep saying what he also said, but he believed that they talk

759
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,000
 about the missing link between chimpanzee and man, and it was actually the serpent.

760
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,240
 Now at this point you're going, "Jason, you've talked a lot about weird science stuff over

761
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,120
 the course of 539 episodes.

762
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:28,480
 If you ask me to believe that the missing link between a chimpanzee and a man is a snake,

763
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,980
 but I'm out."

764
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
 But here's the thing.

765
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,700
 This is where it gets even weirder, because this is where it turns out he doesn't even

766
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,620
 believe it's a snake.

767
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:44,340
 He believes that the snake was actually a giant man who banged Eve.

768
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,620
 Talk about a plot twist, right?

769
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,620
 Talk about a plot twist.

770
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,760
 This whole time you were imagining a bunch of reptilians running around, and this woman

771
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
 banging a snake.

772
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,460
 You imagine that one a little too long, guys.

773
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,660
 He believed the snake, the serpent, was actually a giant man, a humanoid.

774
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,100
 And that did have sex with Eve.

775
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:09,460
 And then when God said, "I'm going to take away your legs and make you eat dust," that's

776
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,660
 when he became a reptilian snake.

777
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:18,380
 You obviously have to do a bunch of mental acrobats to fall for this, but a lot of people

778
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,380
 did.

779
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,180
 This was a really, really popular theory in the '40s.

780
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,500
 And it wasn't like just an overnight thing, like it built up.

781
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,700
 And I think it's really easy to whip people up against the other.

782
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:35,100
 And if you can go, those people aren't like us, and there happen to be half reptile or

783
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,620
 people are like, "Wait, I thought it was a giant."

784
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,620
 He's like, "No, no, no, no, no, whatever.

785
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,860
 Don't even make me explain it again."

786
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,100
 Those people aren't like us, okay?

787
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,740
 Those people aren't like us, and they're not like us, not in the sense that someday they'll

788
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,620
 come around and start believing what we believe?

789
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,620
 No.

790
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,500
 Because if that's the case, then we could come around and start believing what they

791
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
 believe.

792
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
 No, no, no, no.

793
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,860
 We don't want to talk about conversations.

794
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,580
 We want to talk about the fact that they are genetically different from us, so much so

795
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,500
 that they're not even human.

796
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,900
 They're only half human.

797
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,420
 It's an interesting conspiracy theory.

798
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,620
 We know why it works, because the other is always so scary.

799
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,460
 And you can create the other in so many ways.

800
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:20,220
 And when you combine the conspiracy theory with the religious text, it's like giving

801
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,940
 it 10 times the power, 100 times the power.

802
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,380
 Basically, his theory is that every woman potentially carries the seed of the devil.

803
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,380
 All of them.

804
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,540
 It cuts across race, it cuts across culture, it cuts across religion.

805
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,940
 You can't say it's the Jews.

806
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,300
 You can't say it's the whites.

807
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,700
 You can't say it's the Irish, the black, the Hispanics.

808
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:48,860
 Anyone, and it's not more in any one group, anyone can be one of these serpent seeds.

809
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,660
 Every woman has the potential of spitting out one of these babies at any given time,

810
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,620
 and it cuts across party lines, religious lines, cultural lines.

811
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,860
 But that's actually a good segue.

812
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,740
 I think we're going to do tomorrow's episode.

813
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,460
 Because I still have a lot more to talk about.

814
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,780
 We're going to split this episode in two, even though this one is long.

815
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,620
 Tomorrow we're going to go over a list, the little list I found, of 25 ways to know whether

816
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,620
 or not you-- we're not going to go through all 25.

817
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,980
 Not at all, because some of them are just ridiculous.

818
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,660
 All of them are ridiculous in context.

819
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,740
 We're going to go over a list so you can find out whether or not you are a reptilian.

820
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:30,820
 You're going to have to wait a full 24 hours to find out, based on this list I found on

821
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,820
 the internet, whether or not a reptilian is currently residing in you.

822
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,460
 I guess you'll just have to sit patiently.

823
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,460
 I don't know.

824
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,460
 It took me so long to come up with that.

825
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,980
 I was like, what can I say to the s sound?

826
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,100
 I guess you'll-- oh, there you go.

827
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,540

828
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
 That's my tail.

00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,580
 That's a-- I have a rattled tail.

 The joke was I was a snake.

 Come back tomorrow and you can find out if you're a snake too.

 It was long.

839
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,300
 I had a lot of fun doing it.

840
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,100
 I'm going to go lay on a rock and regulate my body temperature.
