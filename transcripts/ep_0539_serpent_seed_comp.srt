1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Does Donald Trump have COVID or is he actually on a boat?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,720
 Preparing for red October?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,420
 And then while we're on the topic, it will just squeeze two stories in for one, is it

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:18,460
 possible that a famous fortune teller, Boba Van Ga, actually predicted him getting COVID-19?

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,200
 And then we move away from that, we move away from that story, we move to something timeless.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,600
 Because we're going back to the Garden of Eden.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,400
 Is it possible that the snake's temptation wasn't with an apple?

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,540
 No, no, no, no.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:39,800
 What actually happened is the snake wanted to have sex with Eve, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,560
 [Music]

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
 It's my birthday.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,360
 I turned 44 today.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,880
 So let's give me a round of applause and blow out some candles on multiple cakes.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,240
 Everyone has made me a cake, I hope.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
 And you have it.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
 You guys can eat it.

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,680
 I won't be able to swing by, but I'll enjoy some delicious cake that you made.

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,560
 And let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Corbin's Channel.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,560
 Corbin's Channel, you get a round of applause as well.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,160
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,360
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,840
 Whatever vehicle we take, you're in charge of.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,160
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,960
 Just help get the word out about the show.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,120
 Really, really helps out a lot.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,480
 And Corbin is giving me a little frosted cupcake.

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 It's all beautifully designed.

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,080
 It's in the shape of my head.

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,360
 I don't want to eat it, so I put it in my pocket.

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,560
 And I'm going to give Corbin the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,160
 We're going to need our battleship for this story.

36
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,160
 So get in there, get your little skipper uniform on with a little shorts.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,480
 Look like Donald Duck.

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,160
 And we are going, setting sail, trying to catch up to Navy One.

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,160
 Somewhere in the mid-Atlantic.

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:09,200
 Those are all the whales swimming alongside Navy trained whales.

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,040
 And there's like Navy snipers on the boat as well.

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,160
 They see us coming, but they know, they know that they are no match.

43
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,920
 The United States Navy is no match for our battleship, the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,960
 The reason why we're chasing down Navy One, legally we're not chasing it down to your

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
 choice.

46
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,320
 We are simply within a wide enough area.

47
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
 So you guys know about Air Force One.

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
 There's one for each division.

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,520
 So you have Marine One, which is the helicopter.

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,080
 And then you would have Navy One, which would be his ship.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,320
 Anything he's on becomes that one.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,320
 So if he gets on, if he's like, move out of the way, fighter pilot, he gets in a plane,

53
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,600
 that becomes Air Force One.

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
 I believe.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
 I could be wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

56
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,160
 I wonder if they'll have a spaceship one someday, dude.

57
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,640
 Wouldn't it be dope?

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,760
 Starship One and the president floating out in space.

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,240
 But anyways, hopefully with the spacesuit and he's enclosed in a spaceship.

60
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,120
 But anyway, so he's on a boat.

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,400
 And I know every time I say that, you guys are going to get that song stuck in your head.

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,040
 It's been stuck in my head since I read this original story.

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,200
 He's on a boat.

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
 This is a conspiracy.

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,680
 I guess I should back up a bit.

66
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,320
 I got ahead of myself with the whale noises.

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,880
 We all know, I think most of the people are aware at this point, someone's eating their

68
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,160
 cereal right now, they're about to spit it out.

69
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,840
 That Trump has come down with the coronavirus.

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
 He has COVID-19.

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,600
 We'll take a break for that one guy to spit out a cereal who did not know that information

72
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
 yet.

73
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,680
 Now, almost immediately, I would say really, not even almost immediately, immediately.

74
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,160
 Like the split second that news became available, the conspiracy theories started.

75
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,200
 One of them was that when he was walking to Marine One to the helicopter and he's wearing

76
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
 his mask.

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,680
 He had like on his little face mask.

78
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,680
 People are doing these close up enhancements of the photos and it was showing like you

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,400
 could see like a little line behind his ear and people are like, oh, he's wearing, he's

80
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,880
 like a scuba diver.

81
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,920
 He has this super secret oxygen tank in his back and he's walking around and this tube

82
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,840
 that's completely invisible from the collar of the shirt to the top of his ear.

83
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,320
 It's 100% invisible, but at the top of the ear, there's a little white line that is that

84
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
 technology.

85
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,840
 It's stealth oxygen tanks.

86
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
 Only the military has them.

87
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,560
 It's reverse engineer from Gray Alien Technology and they're completely invisible until they

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,760
 reach the top of the ear and then they're invisible again going into the mouth.

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
 It's amazing technology.

90
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,720
 They just, they go have to work on that quarter inch there.

91
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,120
 We now know that he actually was on supplemental oxygen at the White House, but I don't think

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,880
 he was walking to Marine One in an invisible scuba suit.

93
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,400
 But that was the first conspiracy theory to pop up and that was obviously a conspiracy

94
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,920
 theory showing this is how weak Trump is because it's interesting because we have now for the

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,280
 first time ever that I've seen, I've been studying this stuff for three decades, we

96
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,680
 have both sides of an issue dishing out conspiracy theories.

97
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,480
 Normally it's only one side.

98
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,760
 Normally it's one group of people saying we need to do X because of Y and then an opposing

99
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,960
 group going, they're reptiles or they're the NW or they're the Illuminati.

100
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,920
 Now we're saying it happened on both sides.

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,520
 It's really bizarre because obviously that conspiracy theory would be based on the fact

102
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,880
 that you wanted Trump to be sicker than he may actually be because right now they're

103
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,000
 talking about he may be released Monday.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,560
 He may be out of hospital on Monday.

105
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,960
 But there's all these photos going around being like, look how weak this guy is.

106
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
 He's dead.

107
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,000
 He's going to die any moment now.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And to compliment that, every time he's released a video, people are like, oh, that's edited.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,400
 You can tell where it's edited.

110
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,000
 You can tell like they're editing out him going, oh, give me some of that alien gray

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,040
 alien tech.

112
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,160
 And then so they edit all that stuff out.

113
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,680
 They have a copy of Adobe Premiere that they reverse engineered from gray alien technology

114
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
 as well.

115
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
 They can perfectly edit it.

116
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,160
 So he's like, hey guys, I'm doing fine.

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,320
 Yeah, I mean, they say the next couple hours, the next couple days are going to be really

118
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,240
 important, but I'm doing fine.

119
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,800
 In reality, he was actually dying during that video.

120
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,400
 So you have conspiracy theories coming out from the people who want him to suffer.

121
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,240
 We want him to already be dead.

122
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,120
 Then you have the group of conspiracy theories that are the complete opposite.

123
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,840
 That's why we're trailing Navy One.

124
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
 Because this is the newest conspiracy theory to go out.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,520
 I talked about these videos.

126
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,800
 He's kind of sitting there and he's done two of them so far and he's like, yeah, everything's

127
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
 going fine.

128
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,120
 You know, I'm sick and it sucks.

129
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,440
 But if you only knew the type of access to gray alien technology that I have, you wouldn't

130
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
 be worried.

131
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,640
 Everything's going to be A-okay.

132
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,440
 And those videos were released.

133
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,600
 And then the bombshell dropped.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,960
 It's go time, guys.

135
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,760
 So we're following this Navy One and all of a sudden we see helicopters flying off of

136
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,080
 in every direction.

137
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,600
 We see fighter jets shooting overhead.

138
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,560
 I was like, oh man, we should have taken the Jason jet.

139
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
 Why are we in this slow boat?

140
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,680
 By the time we get back to America, we see Democratic leaders being let out of their

141
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
 houses.

142
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
 The jets are transformers.

143
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,960
 They transform into robots.

144
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
 They're punching the house open.

145
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,960
 Obama's like, no, no, he's getting picked up by Starscream.

146
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,760
 Hillary Clinton's running through the woods.

147
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,680
 I wish I had some of that gray alien breathing technology right now.

148
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,520
 She's running guards with dogs.

149
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,760
 They're chasing her down.

150
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
 They grab her.

151
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
 They're like, you're under arrest.

152
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
 She's like, for what?

153
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,960
 And they're like, we'll figure that out later.

154
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,880
 Because right now this is Red October.

155
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
 More jets flying overhead dramatically.

156
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,800
 Red October is something that has basically been predicted since November 2016.

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,680
 It's the roundup of all of the people who tried to overthrow Trump.

158
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,760
 It was tied deeply in the Mola report.

159
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,200
 QAnon was a big proponent of it in the beginning.

160
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,080
 I don't really follow QAnon much anymore.

161
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,240
 So I don't know if it's still a thing that's being talked about in those circles.

162
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,080
 But the idea that these people were trying to overthrow Trump, and this allows him, this

163
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,320
 COVID-19 thing allows him.

164
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,560
 So the theory is he's not really sick.

165
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,520
 That they needed to get him out of the White House and onto a boat so they could arrest

166
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,360
 all of these leaders, all of these people.

167
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,760
 And also part of, a weird part of the conspiracy theory is that someone was saying that Obama

168
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,560
 and the Clintons and Rachel Maddow and a bunch of other people all use the same phrase in

169
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,080
 their Twitter saying, "We hope you a safe and speedy recovery."

170
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
 They use that same phrase and people said that's some sort of code and I go, "No, this

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 is just you and me and lazy and copying and pasting stuff."

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,280
 But anyways, so that's how deep, quote unquote, deep this goes.

173
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,800
 Donald Trump's actually on a boat right now.

174
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,160
 And so what's the proof of this?

175
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,440
 What's the proof of this?

176
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,880
 That he's not in the hospital right now getting treatment, that he's actually on a boat is

177
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,760
 one of those videos that were previously thought to have been edited because he was dying and

178
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,840
 they had to edit out all of his deep breaths.

179
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,000
 They're actually, if you look very closely, if you look very closely at the video, one

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 of them, there's flags behind him, right?

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 He's indoors.

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,120
 They're not waving super dramatically.

183
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,440
 He should have turned on a fan though.

184
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
 That would have been cool.

185
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,320
 But there's just flags sitting there and he's sitting at a desk talking to people.

186
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,320
 And if you look very, very closely, you see him move, right?

187
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
 You see him move.

188
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,960
 In a closed room.

189
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,600
 So the theory is, is that there's only one time a flag will move in a closed room.

190
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,560
 It's not if someone opens the door, right?

191
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,520
 It's not that there's a window open because he has a disease that's a respiratory disease

192
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,240
 and they tend to get some fresh air.

193
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
 No.

194
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
 Has to be on a boat.

195
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,000
 The boat is moving.

196
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,400
 It's rocking super slowly and the flag's waving.

197
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,640
 It's not even waving.

198
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,120
 It's just slightly moving, right?

199
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,920
 There could be a bunch of flies back there.

200
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,480
 I don't know.

201
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,360
 And then he did another video where he's sitting in a different room.

202
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,600
 Oh, that's suspicious.

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,320
 Have you ever seen a human sit in two different rooms?

204
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
 What?

205
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
 Oh, Art Bell on this one.

206
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,800
 There's another video where he's sitting in a different room and there's like these

207
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,760
 doors behind them, these panels and they have these knobs.

208
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
 I know guys.

209
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,920
 Whoa, calm down.

210
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,400
 A door with knobs.

211
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,960
 What type of technology is this?

212
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,680
 This is already getting weird.

213
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,160
 Really, those knobs are only found in one place and one place only.

214
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
 Crew ships.

215
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,080
 So now my question is this.

216
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,720
 My question is I thought he was on a Navy battleship preparing for Red October.

217
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,200
 Now he's on Carnival Cruise Lines, which is the one place you don't want to be during

218
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,880
 the COVID-19 pandemic.

219
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,440
 These guys like, "Hey, Trump, we're about to arrest all these people."

220
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,680
 So we're going to fake that you had COVID-19.

221
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,720
 He's like, "Great idea.

222
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
 Great, great idea."

223
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,880
 It's going to be huge.

224
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,360
 And the Secretary of State's like, "It will.

225
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,520
 It will be huge, sir."

226
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,440
 But then we're going to fake that you have COVID-19 and then we are going to hide you

227
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,720
 out on a place that's known for spreading COVID-19.

228
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,080
 And he goes, "That plan sounds good.

229
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,240
 It sounds huge."

230
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,400
 And the Secretary of State's like, "Yeah, that's the only Trump impression I can do,

231
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
 thankfully."

232
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,960
 If you happen to be on a Carnival Cruise Line right now, my condolences for you and

233
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,080
 your family, I'm so sorry.

234
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,440
 And if you happen to see the Konga Line, a man enjoying himself COVID-19 free for now

235
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,640
 because again, he's on a cruise ship.

236
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
 He's dancing.

237
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
 He's dancing there.

238
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,800
 And he goes, "That guy looks awfully familiar."

239
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,320
 And then you realize that there's 20 Secret Service agents dancing next to him doing

240
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,620
 the little Konga.

241
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,080
 You might be on the front lines of Red October.

242
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,640
 That might actually be what's going on.

243
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,280
 It's not, by the way.

244
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,600
 It's totally not.

245
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,520
 And then, yeah, we'll be back to whatever bizarre conspiracy theory is next.

246
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,800
 And actually that is a great transition.

247
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,920
 Corbyn, let's go ahead and leave behind the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

248
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,840
 I don't want to be super Trump heavy, but we're going to, I'm just going to knock this

249
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,400
 one out of the park because I know a lot of people are going to request this.

250
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
 Let's hop in that Jason jet.

251
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,320
 We're actually going to take the Jason jet from C. It's a jump jet, so it takes off

252
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,560
 right off the deck of the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

253
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,440
 We are headed out to the Balkans.

254
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,920
 I've done a bit of information on this woman before.

255
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
 Boba Wagner.

256
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
 Wagner.

257
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,560
 Probably not Wagner.

258
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,720
 Boba Wagner.

259
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,680
 I talked about her before in the episode.

260
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,480
 I'm not going to, basically all you need to know is she's known as the Nostradamus of

261
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
 the Balkans.

262
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,880
 She's made a ton of predictions and people say she has an 85% accuracy rate.

263
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,240
 Which if you get one wrong, then you're wrong.

264
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,040
 Like a prophet, someone who makes predictions should never be wrong, right?

265
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,200
 It should be like, oh yeah, I thought the bangles were going to win.

266
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 It was actually the bobcats.

267
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
 There's a bunch of cats are attacking you.

268
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,120
 You're like, I don't care which one wins eating me.

269
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
 Who's going to win again?

270
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,720
 She actually made like a prediction of like a FIFA game.

271
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,080
 She said both teams will start with a letter B. Only one of them did.

272
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,680
 I'm thinking if you're able to tell the future, why are you even wasting your time on that

273
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
 stuff?

274
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
 FIFA game, sorry FIFA fans.

275
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,960
 A bunch of soccer who begins attacking me now.

276
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,160
 Anyways, there's a big story going around right now.

277
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,760
 It's all over the news, all quote unquote news where Boba Wagner has actually predicted

278
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,400
 that Trump was going to get the coronavirus.

279
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,000
 Here's the headline from the sun.

280
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
 Saw it coming.

281
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
 Blind mystic.

282
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,160
 Boba, see like that pun like they're making fun of that.

283
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,640
 Back to that woman's blind.

284
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,280
 Nice pun there, the sun.

285
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,440
 Predict Donald Trump's coronavirus battle after saying president will get sick in 2020.

286
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
 That's the headline there.

287
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,520
 I wonder if she predicted how many times I would mispronounce her name.

288
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
 I read the article.

289
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,880
 I was like, okay, I'll give it a shot.

290
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,160
 I think that she's not accurate.

291
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,360
 I think that you can punch a bunch of holes in her stories, but whatever.

292
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,040
 I'll take a look at it, right?

293
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,600
 And it says in the sun of all places that she was able to predict that Donald Trump

294
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 would get sick.

295
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,640
 This was the actual, let me read you this quote here, quote, "Boba Wagner, also known

296
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,960
 as the Nostradamus of the Balkans, is claimed by fans," she has fans, people are holding

297
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,160
 little penance, that's a future on it.

298
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,040
 "is claimed by fans to have foretold that the US president would suffer from, quote,

299
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,280
 a mysterious illness," unquote, "in 2020, which will leave him deaf and with a brain

300
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
 tumor."

301
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,560
 Well, you know, pretty, pretty accurate, right?

302
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,360
 That you're predicting this guy's going to get sick in 2020.

303
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
 Here's a tip.

304
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
 Here's a tip.

305
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,600
 I've actually talked about this on the past, on the show.

306
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,280
 Ooh, that's fortuitous, mentioning the past during the future.

307
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,640
 I recommend people to go out, if you're a fan, if you believe anything Nostradamus

308
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:50,200
 ever has to say, go buy a book about Nostradamus from like the 70s or the 80s.

309
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,560
 And it will all be like, in the year 1997, the world's going to end, and the enter guys

310
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,960
 are going to show up and da-da-da-da-da.

311
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,280
 Go buy a book from the 1970s, 1980s.

312
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
 The world was supposed to be over by now.

313
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,040
 The way Nostradamus predicted it.

314
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,840
 You can scroll around these things any way you want.

315
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,920
 So this is what you can do if you don't want to go to the bookstore.

316
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,400
 You just use Google search engine and you can set the search parameters.

317
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:20,320
 So I looked up BobaVanga and I looked up Trump, but I looked them up before this year, before

318
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,000
 anyone knew anything about coronavirus.

319
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,960
 So going back, there were actually articles about this.

320
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,160
 Let's take a journey here.

321
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,840
 First off, she said that Obama was going to be the last president and the nation would

322
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,360
 be divided between the North and the South, setting the stage for another civil war.

323
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,800
 Absolutely not even close to happening.

324
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,880
 Civil war, people are getting riled up, but it's not North and South.

325
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,840
 It's pretty much coastal areas and the center of the United States.

326
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,520
 So right there, just totally wrong.

327
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,120
 And Obama wasn't the last president.

328
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
 But whatever.

329
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,640
 There's already two wrong.

330
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
 Where's her 85% accuracy now?

331
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
 That's two wrong.

332
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,320
 Obama wasn't the last president.

333
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,160
 North and South wasn't divided up.

334
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,040
 Actually, I should say this too.

335
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,760
 She's dead.

336
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,640
 She died in 1995.

337
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,200
 She died in 1996.

338
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,480
 She's not saying anything.

339
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,000
 People are taking her words and they're becoming viral hits and they're getting these articles

340
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,240
 written about them.

341
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,920
 So according to whoever is translating it on any given day, Obama was supposed to be

342
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
 the last president.

343
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
 No.

344
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
 Because then we got another one.

345
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,960
 His name is Trump.

346
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,520
 And then if you look at this illness, in 2019 it says that Trump was going to get a brain

347
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,880
 tumor and go deaf or die.

348
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,960
 Which is a huge difference between the two, right?

349
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,360
 I know the word deaf and dead only has a difference of one letter, but there's actually a huge

350
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
 difference between those two words, right?

351
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,840
 There's a lot of people who are deaf who are quite doing quite well being alive.

352
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
 So you have that.

353
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
 It's not true.

354
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
 It's not true.

355
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,160
 And you can go back and look and see that the original one was, oh, and the original

356
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,960
 one was it had not mentioned illness at all.

357
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,480
 If you look at an article before 2019, they say Donald Trump will get a brain tumor and

358
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,800
 either go deaf or die.

359
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,960
 And now we're in October 2020.

360
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,480
 And so the thing is, is going forward, this is how she keeps her 85% accuracy rate.

361
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,840
 Going forward, you'll start seeing it pop up on conspiracy sites.

362
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,080
 If you haven't already, Baba Vagna predicted Donald Trump is going to get coronavirus.

363
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
 It's not true.

364
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,080
 It's what he, she did not predict he was going to get an illness at all.

365
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
 Everyone added that word.

366
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,640
 And I actually don't even think she predicted that Donald Trump is going to get a brain

367
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,400
 tumor because if Obama was the last president, then who the hell is Donald Trump?

368
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,120
 Like she's like, I can see the host of a game show called The Apprentice.

369
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,640
 He has a brain tumor like what?

370
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,840
 That'd be like, I can see Drew Carey.

371
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
 He's going to lose a lot of weight.

372
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,760
 He's actually going to look really good for his age.

373
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
 People are like, what?

374
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,080
 Why are you even predicting just these random people?

375
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,040
 If he wasn't the president, then how did she predict it anyways?

376
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,240
 What you say, Jason, but I saw that she predicted the rise of the coronavirus to begin with.

377
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,440
 Well apparently one of the quotes we actually have from her was when she was still alive

378
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,640
 and people weren't so much reading into it.

379
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,120
 I mean, they were, but it wasn't, it was her actually saying this.

380
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,720
 Apparently she actually said the corona will be all over us.

381
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,160
 So let's take a look at another one of her predictions here actually.

382
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,040
 One of her most famous predictions nowadays is her predicting 9/11.

383
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,280
 This is again an actual quote from her.

384
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,000
 Horror, this actual quote.

385
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I'm not just saying that.

386
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
 I'm not like a news boy standing on the street corner.

387
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,040
 Horror, horror.

388
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,080
 The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds.

389
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,600
 The wolves will be howling in a bush and innocent blood will be gushing.

390
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,440
 Unquote.

391
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,480
 So people go, see that was her predicting 9/11.

392
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,720
 Which I would agree that that's awfully close had she been born if she was a contemporary

393
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
 of No Trenamis?

394
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:06,920
 Have you ever met anyone who died in the year 1996 who refers to planes as steel birds?

395
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,360
 Like she'd be like a couple planes are going to smash into them.

396
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:17,000
 And even if she was envisioning this as birds crashing in, she's blind, but she's not dumb.

397
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,200
 She goes, oh some steel birds are going to start blowing stuff up or whatever.

398
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,240
 I actually even forgot what it was.

399
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,560
 They're being attacked by steel birds.

400
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,680
 Couldn't someone at the time said, do you mean airplanes that have been in existence?

401
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,600
 Since 1910?

402
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 Remember?

403
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,120
 And she's like, oh yeah, that's what I meant airplane.

404
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,680
 So that's so vague.

405
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,120
 But anyways, this is what I love about being able to dice all this stuff up.

406
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,280
 She can give something so vague like that.

407
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,440
 She can call airplane, multiple airplanes, steel birds.

408
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,280
 Not say President Bush, because obviously she knows American politics if she's talking

409
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
 about Obama.

410
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,960
 I guess she predicted Obama was going to be black.

411
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,800
 I'm like, what?

412
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,120
 Okay, but anyway, fine.

413
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
 I don't know.

414
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,360
 I didn't look into that one.

415
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,600
 Maybe she got that one right.

416
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,000
 But steel birds will do this and then the wolves will be howling in a bush.

417
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,280
 She doesn't make any connection to President Bush, who his father was around back then.

418
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,520
 His father had already been president when she died.

419
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,680
 So she wouldn't, she's not an idiot.

420
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,760
 She's not an idiot.

421
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,280
 She's super vague on the steel birds in the bush, but she straight up names the virus,

422
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,120
 the corona.

423
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
 You can't have it both ways.

424
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,280
 Because if you go, oh no, she's being vague about the steel birds because that's how she

425
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
 envisioned it.

426
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,120
 But then she turns around at you in a lab coat and she's like, watch out for corona.

427
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,520
 She's pointing at the camera.

428
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
 You can't have it both ways.

429
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,080
 Either she's incredibly specific and names the class of virus, or she talks about it

430
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,720
 in very flowery terms, like wolves out of a bush.

431
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,800
 Corona actually means crown.

432
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:00,000
 So at the time, up until December 2019, people thought that to mean that the Russian Tsar

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,800
 was going to be reinstated and attack the Balkans, take the area over.

434
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,360
 The corona will be all over us or that the British Empire would start to take over.

435
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,520
 She has a lot of mismatched conspiracies too.

436
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,240
 So you can just go down deep rabbit holes with that type of stuff.

437
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,440
 Corbin's channel, we're going to say goodbye to Boba V- in fact, the last time I have to

438
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,240
 pronounce her name is the hardest time.

439
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,840
 We're going to say goodbye to Boba V. Go ahead and call in that carboner copter.

440
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,200
 She's like, what is that?

441
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,520
 Is that a dual XML hemi with triple shock absorbers?

442
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
 That must be a carboner copter.

443
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,440
 And we're like, I thought you only knew these things as steel birds.

444
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
 She's like, hehehehehe.

445
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,960
 They just, I just say vague stuff and they pay me lots and lots of rubles, but she's

446
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
 dead.

447
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,480
 So they're passing through her ghost hands, but she is now taking them to a ghost casino.

448
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,560
 She's possessed all the rubles, taking them off to a ghost casino.

449
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
 I guess that happens.

450
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,360
 I have no other way to end that story.

451
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,960
 Carboner copters landed.

452
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,200
 Corbin's channel putting on his helicopter outfit.

453
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,360
 He's real dressed up for this episode.

454
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,480
 Brought his own clothes.

455
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,120
 He's wearing his little helicopter's outfit.

456
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,160
 He's dressed as a helicopter, flying a helicopter.

457
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,360
 We are headed out to the Garden of Eden.

458
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,440
 We're going to land.

459
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,560
 I probably shouldn't write this as like a holy spot on the planet.

460
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
 We're landing in the middle of Garden of Eden.

461
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,080
 There's species that are trying to outrun us for landing on him.

462
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,200
 Corbin's going out of his way to kill the Gleep Glorps.

463
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,320
 They're the most beautiful species on the planet, but they don't exist anymore because

464
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,240
 Corbin landed the carboner copter right on top of them on purpose.

465
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,520
 We get out and we're walking around and there's like a bunch of animals and stuff, right?

466
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,480
 And they're not eating us because that was something that I always wondered when I was

467
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,760
 a little kid.

468
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,400
 Why don't the animals eat each other or more specifically why don't they eat Adam in the

469
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
 Garden of Eden?

470
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,120
 And I remember, I can't really say that my dad told me this because you know my dad

471
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
 is a minister.

472
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,520
 I don't remember if he told me this or if I learned this from a cartoon or if I just

473
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,960
 made it up, but apparently the animals weren't eating each other because they didn't have

474
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
 to.

475
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,080
 I don't want to say my dad said that because I don't know if theologically that's true,

476
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,960
 but the animals didn't have to, right?

477
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,240
 I guess there was like replicators there and they would just line walk up and hit a button

478
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,640
 and go like "One fried rabbit please!"

479
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,920
 And the rabbit next to him was like "Ugh!"

480
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,920
 And then the lion would eat the rabbit and the rabbit would be like "One fried piece

481
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,920
 of barley!"

482
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,480
 And then like the barley next to him would be like "Ugh!"

483
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,480
 And the barley was just like "Some cow poop please!"

484
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,080
 And the cow's like has a big smile on his face.

485
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,800
 Anyways, they weren't eating each other.

486
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,640
 They didn't eat each other on the ark either, but I guess maybe you know I guess if God

487
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,760
 can create the entire universe he can make animals behave.

488
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,800
 But he was walking around or like hanging out with lions and stuff like that.

489
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,000
 While we're going through that whole thing there's this hot chick on the other side of

490
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,720
 Eden named Eve.

491
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,480
 She's walking around, she's been around for a couple hundred years by now.

492
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,880
 She looks really good.

493
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,520
 They don't wear leaves at this point.

494
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,000
 They're really shocked at the fact that we're wearing all this clothing.

495
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,600
 But you know whatever, they haven't had original sin yet.

496
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,960
 See we have, we're ashamed of being naked.

497
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,480
 And we're watching this hot chick walk around and stuff like that.

498
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
 And we see a snake.

499
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,080
 That was a very long winded way to get us to what this story's about.

500
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,880
 And I think most of you guys know the story of the Garden of Eden.

501
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,080
 I probably should have told that instead of going off on that long winded rant, but it's

502
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
 my birthday episode.

503
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,800
 If you don't know the story of the Garden of Eden, I'm going to go over real quickly.

504
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,840
 God creates all the animals on the planet and creates this little special place on the

505
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,160
 planet called Eden.

506
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,560
 It is what it sounds like.

507
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,800
 It's what the word Eden means.

508
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,840
 It's a paradise.

509
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,560
 And he goes, "Adam, you can chill here and it's your job to name all the animals.

510
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,720
 And it's your job to take care of all the animals too.

511
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,640
 You can do whatever you want, but do not eat from the tree of knowledge."

512
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,040
 And Adam's like, "Yeah, that sounds totally dope dude.

513
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,240
 I'm just walking around hanging out with the Gleep Gorps.

514
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,200
 These animals are going to be amazing someday."

515
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
 And God's like, "I know.

516
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
 Bring a little tear to God's eye."

517
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
 He's like, "Protect those one most of all."

518
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,680
 And Adam's like, "Of course."

519
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,640
 Eventually Adam's like, "Yeah, this is kind of cool man, but lonely."

520
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
 And you know what I mean?

521
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
 He's like nudging God.

522
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,120
 He's like, "You know how lonely, huh, huh?"

523
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
 And God's like, "Stop it.

524
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
 Stop nudging me.

525
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,560
 Yeah, I get how you're lonely.

526
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,080
 You want a woman."

527
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,360
 So he takes one of Adam's ribs out and he makes a woman.

528
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,600
 And then that's pretty convenient, right?

529
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,720
 You're like, "Oh, I need a girlfriend."

530
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
 You're like getting in horrible car accidents.

531
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,440
 Your ribs are shooting out everywhere.

532
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,360
 All of a sudden you have a harem of 10 women.

533
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,760
 Eve is created from his rib.

534
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,200
 He was created from clay and earth.

535
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,600
 She was created from a rib.

536
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,200
 Eve, I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Adam.

537
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,040
 Don't eat from the tree of knowledge.

538
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,840
 And Eve's eyes are shifting from side to side.

539
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,100
 That's not a defect.

540
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,680
 He did make her eyes correctly.

541
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,280
 She's like, "Hmm."

542
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,080
 So eventually, I think in the beginning she probably was like, "Yeah, you're right, God.

543
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
 I won't do that."

544
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,080
 But then this serpent shows up.

545
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,680
 He's hanging out in the tree.

546
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,120
 Now this has always been another thing that's puzzled me because the serpent's talking to

547
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,800
 Eve and this is in the Bible.

548
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,640
 The serpent's like, "Hey, Eve, why don't you come here and eat this apple?"

549
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,080
 God doesn't want you to eat this apple because this apple will make you on par with God.

550
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,440
 The fact that Eve wasn't completely freaked out that the snake was talking to her makes

551
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,480
 me think that all the animals talked back then.

552
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,960
 All the animals were talking, apparently, because if none of the animals talked, the

553
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,800
 only one that talked was trying to get you to eat an apple.

554
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,760
 One, you want to listen to it.

555
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:41,000
 And two, you'd run off and tell your best friend, "Hey, there's a talking snake over

556
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 there."

557
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,240
 But if everything talked, you wouldn't even think anything of it.

558
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,920
 When she eats the apple, she immediately knows sin.

559
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,400
 That's what the knowledge was of.

560
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,360
 It was like of sin, of right and wrong.

561
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,200
 You're basically automatons in a way.

562
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,560
 And that's a big theological debate.

563
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,800
 I'm making this episode even longer and longer, but that's a big theological debate.

564
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,040
 Did Adam have free will?

565
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,480
 Did Adam and Eve have free will before they ate the apple?

566
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,280
 But she eats the apple and then she convinces Adam to eat the apple and God shows up and

567
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,920
 he's like, "Oh, come on, man, I gave you guys one rule."

568
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,040
 Adam's like, "Dude, it wasn't me.

569
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
 It was her."

570
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
 And he's like, "I don't care.

571
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
 You ate it."

572
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,720
 Like, yeah, she ate it first, but you did take a bite.

573
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,880
 So he kicked him out of Eden and this is what gets left out a lot.

574
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,880
 This is another interesting little side note to this story.

575
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,280
 He kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden and says, "You'll never be let back

576
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
 in."

577
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,040
 In the Bible, it says where the Garden of Eden is, but you can't find it on a map.

578
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,280
 It's where these four rivers are supposed to intersect like the Euphrates and so like

579
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,000
 they're on earth, but they don't intersect.

580
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,120
 Mandela effect, maybe the very first Mandela effect.

581
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,040
 This dude, his name's Adam.

582
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
 Adam and Eve are now outside of the Garden of Eden.

583
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,320
 So everyone knows that part of the story, but this is 100% in the Bible.

584
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,240
 This isn't like apocryphal or anything like that.

585
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
 That's not the end of it.

586
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,640
 God says, "Not only am I kicking both of you out of Eden," he basically locked them

587
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,920
 out of Eden.

588
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:10,000
 He goes, "Eve, because you're the one who started this.

589
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,360
 Childbirth is going to be extremely dangerous and painful.

590
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,760
 It wasn't going to be that way at first.

591
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,000
 I was going to let you have as many babies as you wanted.

592
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,360
 They're going to pop out of you like gumballs out of a machine, but now you are going to

593
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,840
 have to give birth to painful babies, not painful babies.

594
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,640
 They are covered in spikes.

595
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,440
 Childbirth is going to be very painful for you."

596
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,920
 For Adam, and basically for Eve, this punishment fit both of them, work was going to become

597
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,880
 incredibly hard and you would spend the rest of your life doing backbreaking labor.

598
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,120
 It was no longer going to be sitting in there with a replicator going, "Fruit box," and

599
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
 a fruit box appears.

600
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,880
 It was going to be really hard work.

601
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,160
 I think one of the most curious things about it is that he says, "Snake, because you were

602
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,640
 involved in this whole thing," and the snake's like, "What, me?"

603
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
 That wasn't me.

604
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,920
 That was like the devil disguises me.

605
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,760
 God goes, "No, I don't believe you, because you were involved in this whole thing.

606
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,720
 The snake gets punished as well."

607
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,480
 Not like that snake, God doesn't turn him into a bow tie or anything like that, turn

608
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,600
 him into a nice pair of shoes.

609
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,240
 He tells all snakes, "You're going to lose your legs.

610
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,840
 You will slither on the ground and you will eat dust."

611
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,480
 At that point, that's why snakes have no legs.

612
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,760
 I think this is really, really interesting because it turns out that that story may not

613
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,720
 be the whole thing.

614
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,720
 There was a big philosopher back in time, not as far back as the guy who was right

615
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,000
 outside the Garden of Eden.

616
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,640
 He's like, "Have I got a story for you?"

617
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,760
 This guy was big in America.

618
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,800
 He mostly grew to power in World War II.

619
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,480
 He was like a traveling minister.

620
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,920
 His name was William Branham.

621
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,760
 I think I said he was a philosopher at first, but I misspoke.

622
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,240
 He was a minister and he ended up becoming super popular during World War II.

623
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
 He was giving these huge rallies.

624
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,760
 I know there's a lot of, I know you're like, "Who are you talking about?

625
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
 You're talking about William Guy?

626
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
 You're talking about all these other dudes you were giving huge rallies.

627
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
 You're talking about Mussolini?

628
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
 You're talking about Hitler?

629
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,400
 No, I'm talking about the other guy who was doing huge rallies during World War II whipping

630
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,760
 people up into a frenzy against this class of humans that weren't like them.

631
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,720
 William Branham had a theory.

632
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,400
 You walk into one of his big tent revivals, people are just sitting there.

633
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,000
 They're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

634
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,680
 It's like a white snake concert.

635
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,480
 But this time it's not a white snake.

636
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,240
 It's the snake, the great snake.

637
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,040
 It's Satan.

638
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,920
 And actually that made it sound like Satan was up on the podium, but no, it's William

639
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
 Branham.

640
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,840
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, you all, you guys, yeah, you're right.

641
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
 Everything I'm saying is right."

642
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
 Woohoohoohoohoo.

643
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,960
 And he's like whipping them up.

644
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,380
 He wasn't the most eloquent speaker.

645
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,340
 This take on the Garden of Eden story was this, and it's not even his original take.

646
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,120
 There was a lot of people who believed this.

647
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
 Even before him.

648
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,920
 He just made it super popularized.

649
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:09,400
 He believed that that whole story was the snake seducing Eve to have sex and ended up

650
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,080
 giving her the serpent seed.

651
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,800
 So there's this, I've looked briefly into the science.

652
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,080
 I don't really know how true it is.

653
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,360
 I've read a couple articles on it, but there's this thing, and it could be true, that a woman

654
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,220
 retains the DNA of all the men she's had sex with.

655
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,300
 I don't know again if that's scientifically true, so don't come at me if it's not.

656
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,460
 I'm stating now, I don't know if it's true or not, but in this theory that every time

657
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,460
 a woman has sex with a man, she retains some of his DNA.

658
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,020
 I'm sure there would be, at the very least, some sort of shelf life, right?

659
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,700
 The dude you were banging when you were 21, they're not still hanging out.

660
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,540
 They're like, "You're a 69-year-old woman.

661
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,420
 You're like, "Oh, I really want to go to country music dance," because there's a bunch of little

662
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,760
 hoedown DNAs in here.

663
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,240
 I don't know if that's how it works.

664
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,120
 I don't think that's how DNA works to begin with, but anyways, that a woman retains the

665
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,920
 DNA of all of her past lovers.

666
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
 May or may not be true.

667
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
 I don't know.

668
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,220
 But that's kind of where this theory comes from, is that she had sex with the serpent,

669
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,240
 and she got the serpent DNA in her, the serpent seed.

670
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,600
 And so what happens is, is that when she starts having sex with Adam, because the story is

671
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,780
 they were the original humans, that some of her descendants, most namely Cain, the first

672
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:30,900
 murderer, according to the Bible, was a serpent, was a serpent, half-serpent, I guess would

673
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,900
 be the way to put it.

674
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,900
 He wasn't full-serpent.

675
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
 A little snake didn't slither out.

676
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,420
 I mean, Abel wouldn't be like, "Oh, I should hang out with my brother."

677
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,420
 He's always on the up and up, as he's just a snake eating dust.

678
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,520
 That he was half-human, half-snake.

679
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,780
 He was the beginning of the serpent race.

680
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,400
 Or as we may call them today, the reptilians.

681
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,840
 Now, this actually popped up in the Gnostic Gospel of Philip.

682
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,640
 I had never heard this conspiracy theory before, but it's been around for thousands of years.

683
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,040
 This was actually in one of the Gnostic Gospel books.

684
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,160
 The Gnostic Gospel of Philip is actually where Dan Brown got a lot of his Mary Magdalene

685
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,660
 and Jesus had a baby.

686
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,200
 I don't know if they had a baby, but they were having sex.

687
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,600
 I might have just had it that part.

688
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
 He might have.

689
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,380
 I think they did, because that was the descendants of the royal blood of Britain or the Knights

690
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,380
 Temple or something like that.

691
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,140
 But anyways, Jesus and Mary Magdalene were a couple.

692
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,380
 Jesus may or may not have died.

693
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:33,180
 He may have faked his death and moved to Europe and set his bags down and go, "Ah, now nothing,

694
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,620
 but peace and relaxation in the next 2,000 years."

695
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,340
 Then all of a sudden, all these wars break out every three minutes in his name.

696
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:49,040
 Now William Brannham, he made this a national philosophy that you had a group of people

697
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,560
 who weren't even human.

698
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,960
 Everyone's like, "Yeah, yeah, woohoo!"

699
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,600
 So Brannham would speak this stuff.

700
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,000
 He'd basically say, "These people are not like us.

701
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,200
 These people are reptilians."

702
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,700
 And he can name them out.

703
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,760
 He can name them out.

704
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,000
 Educated people.

705
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,240
 If you were an educated person, you might be a reptilian.

706
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
 You're like, "Well, that's good.

707
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
 I'm a dummy.

708
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
 Yay!"

709
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,300
 And it's funny because you imagine this is the way these type of things work out is

710
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,500
 that they attract all groups.

711
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,780
 Imagine there's someone in the group being like, "Oh, I do like reading books on Sunday."

712
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,660
 And he's kind of like, "Oh, no, am I a reptile?"

713
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,660
 He's like checking his skin.

714
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,880
 He's like, "Well, I didn't lay an egg today."

715
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,220
 So that's a really good sign.

716
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,220
 A scientist.

717
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,720
 If you're a scientist, you might be a reptilian.

718
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,660
 That's probably one of the ways they're able to hide it so long because you'll be like,

719
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
 "Sir, sir.

720
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
 I'm what we call scientists.

721
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,660
 We call them, sir.

722
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
 Look at it.

723
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,160
 I found this huge human size.

724
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,600
 It's not as big as a human, but I found this reptilian scale that looks like it would fit

725
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,160
 on a human or something like that."

726
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,400
 The scientist is like, "What are you talking about, you lunatic?

727
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,640
 Here, I'll take a look at it."

728
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,640
 And then the scientist takes it back into his lab and he goes, "Yeah, yeah, I'll run

729
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,240
 a bunch of tests on it right now."

730
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,000
 And he's putting it back on his arm.

731
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 He's like, "That's where you went.

732
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,560
 Scales."

733
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,380
 And then he would tell them, "Oh, no, it just turned out to be like a wombat's iris

734
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,380
 or something like that."

735
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,860
 And the guys are like, "Well, I guess that makes sense.

736
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,340
 I always trust scientists."

737
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
 He walks away.

738
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,380
 He's tripping over giant eggs in the scientist's front yard.

739
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,120
 He also said that a majority of criminals, not all of them, which is very curious, majority

740
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,020
 of criminals were actually reptilians as well.

741
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,460
 So I don't know why just the majority of them.

742
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,300
 I mean, I can understand him being like, "Heroine affects the lizard brain more than

743
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,440
 a normal human brain.

744
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,720
 Watch, let me snort all this heroin."

745
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
 See I'm just fine.

746
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,000
 Now does anyone else want to do that test?

747
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,080
 Does anyone else want me to test that again?

748
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,160
 Come here, serve with your opium."

749
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,040
 I guess there were some crimes he would say weren't reptilian based, like maybe jaywalking,

750
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,600
 but I guess if you're like getting arrested for stealing eggs or laying naked on rocks

751
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,360
 on cold days, that's probably a sign of you being a reptilian criminal.

752
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,980
 He also, I mean I could just keep saying what he also said, but he believed that they talk

753
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,020
 about the missing link between chimpanzee and man, and it was actually the serpent.

754
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:20,260
 Now at this point you're going, "Jason, you've talked a lot about weird science stuff over

755
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,100
 the course of 539 episodes.

756
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:28,500
 If you ask me to believe that the missing link between a chimpanzee and a man is a snake,

757
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,980
 but I'm out."

758
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
 But here's the thing.

759
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,700
 This is where it gets even weirder, because this is where it turns out he doesn't even

760
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,640
 believe it's a snake.

761
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:44,360
 He believes that the snake was actually a giant man who banged Eve.

762
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,620
 Talk about a plot twist, right?

763
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,620
 Talk about a plot twist.

764
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:51,760
 This whole time you were imagining a bunch of reptilians running around, and this woman

765
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
 banging a snake.

766
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,480
 You imagine that one a little too long, guys.

767
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,960
 He believed the snake, the serpent, was actually a giant man, a humanoid.

768
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,100
 And that did have sex with Eve.

769
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:09,420
 And then when God said, "I'm going to take away your legs and make you eat dust," that's

770
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,620
 when he became a reptilian snake.

771
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:18,300
 You obviously have to do a bunch of mental acrobats to fall for this, but a lot of people

772
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
 did.

773
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,140
 This was a really, really popular theory in the '40s.

774
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,420
 And it wasn't like just an overnight thing, like it built up.

775
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,660
 And I think it's really easy to whip people up against the other.

776
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,920
 And if you can go, those people aren't like us.

777
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,520
 And there happen to be half reptile or people are like, "Wait, I thought it was a giant."

778
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,280
 He's like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, whatever.

779
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,840
 Don't even make me explain it again."

780
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,080
 Those people aren't like us, okay?

781
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,280
 Those people aren't like us.

782
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,760
 And they're not like us, not in the sense that someday they'll come around and start

783
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,720
 believing what we believe?

784
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
 No.

785
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,480
 Because if that's the case, then we could come around and start believing what they

786
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
 believe.

787
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
 No, no, no, no.

788
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,840
 We don't want to talk about conversations.

789
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,580
 We want to talk about the fact that they are genetically different from us, so much so

790
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,500
 that they're not even human.

791
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,900
 They're only half human.

792
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,420
 It's an interesting conspiracy theory.

793
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,660
 We know why it works, because the other is always so scary.

794
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,460
 And you can create the other in so many ways.

795
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:20,220
 And when you combine the conspiracy theory with the religious text, it's like giving

796
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,140
 it 10 times the power, 100 times the power.

797
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,400
 Basically, his theory is that every woman potentially carries the seed of the devil.

798
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
 All of them.

799
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,520
 It cuts across race, it cuts across culture, it cuts across religion.

800
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,920
 You can't say it's the Jews.

801
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,280
 You can't say it's the whites.

802
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,680
 You can't say it's the Irish, the black, the Hispanics.

803
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:48,840
 Anyone, and it's not more in any one group, anyone can be one of these serpent seeds.

804
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,640
 Every woman has the potential of spitting out one of these babies at any given time.

805
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,620
 And it cuts across party lines, religious lines, cultural lines.

806
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,860
 But that's actually a good segue.

807
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,700
 I think we're going to do tomorrow's episode.

808
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,460
 Because I still have a lot more to talk about.

809
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,780
 We're going to split this episode in two, even though this one is long.

810
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,620
 Tomorrow we're going to go over a list, the little list I found, of 25 ways to know whether

811
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,620
 or not you-- we're not going to go through all 25.

812
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,980
 Not at all, because some of them are just ridiculous.

813
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,660
 All of them are ridiculous in context.

814
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,760
 We're going to go over a list so you can find out whether or not you are a reptilian.

815
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,840
 You're going to have to wait a full 24 hours to find out, based on this list I found on

816
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,840
 the internet, whether or not a reptilian is currently residing in you.

817
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,480
 I guess you'll just have to sit patiently.

818
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
 I don't know.

819
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
 It took me so long to come up with that.

820
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
 I was like, what can I say to the s sound?

821
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,120
 I guess you'll-- oh, there you go.

822
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,540
 I guess you'll just have to wait.

823
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
 That's my tail.

824
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,580
 That's a-- I have a rattled tail.

825
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,020
 Click a lick a lick a lick a lick a lick a lick.

826
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,500
 I guess you'll just have to click a lick a lick a lick a lick a lick a lick a lick.

827
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,860
 Wait for the next episode.

828
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,940
 Okay, it's getting dumb.

829
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,860
 The joke was I was a snake.

830
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,620
 Come back tomorrow and you can find out if you're a snake too.

831
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,620
 Thank you for everyone.

832
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,620
 This was my birthday episode.

833
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,620
 It was long.

834
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,300
 I had a lot of fun doing it.

835
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,080
 I'm going to go lay on a rock and regulate my body temperature.

836
