1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
 Is the nephew of a serial killer putting billboards up across America?

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,160
 Sounds fairly mundane, but trust me it gets weird. And then

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,160
 Alien week continues.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,660
 But this time no sexy cryptids

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,640
 No presidential talk on UFOs. No

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,720
 Today we have a horrifying story of the abduction of one boy and

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,000
 What he witnessed inside of an alien spacecraft today on Dead Rabbit Radio

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:46,560
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Kerviner. I'm having a great day

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too. You know I wanted to start off today's episode with this quick little tidbit

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:58,360
 Couple episodes back I did an episode on Johnny Sands. He was a country musician singer who was had that

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,120
 I keep want to say he was abducted by aliens

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,720
 He had a nice chat with them nothing bad happened and after he met the aliens the men in black

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,120
 This is his story. I'm not saying any of this is factual

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,640
 But the men in black asked him to write a song about it and then when I and he did he wrote a song about it

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,000
 And then when I went to go look for the song

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,560
 He said it was on myspace.com/johnnystands music. There's no music listed there at all

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,440
 So and I just kind of said maybe the song is in some sort of government warehouse. I couldn't find it

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,680
 But marker 646 did marker 646 on YouTube said hey, man

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,120
 It's this is this song that you thought that no human outside

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,400
 He didn't actually say all that stuff

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,320
 But the implication was that this song was locked up in some government warehouse and he's like a dude

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,240
 I found it on YouTube man

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,200
 Found it on YouTube 46 views when he sent it to me. Thank you marker for sending that over

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,720
 So yeah, go and check the song out. I'll tell you this man. It's really good

25
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,400
 It actually thumps like you could play it in your pickup truck is your muddin

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,960
 You can play it in your Honda is you're just driving on the street

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,560
 It's from the album Trump that and it's it just came out in 2017

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,860
 So the songs only he wrote it back when this happened when the men in black told him to write this song

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,920
 But it's a really good song even if you're not in the country music. You really like just thumps. It's a good song

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,680
 So check it out. I'll have the YouTube link below. Thanks marker for pulling that up

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,120
 And let's get this guy some views. Let's get Johnny Sanson views because it really is a pretty cool song. How many

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,640
 Songs have been written about alien encounters and men in black and stuff like well

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,700
 I guess the song minimum the men in black theme songs, but for the most part, they're fairly rare

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,480
 They're fairly rare. So check it out. Okay, but let's go ahead and get started with the episode now

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:45,360
 Yesterday's episode was our hitchhiker one was our haunted hitchhiker episode and in it while we were talking about driving down

36
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,800
 Highway 101 I mentioned Bob's boards now when I was doing research to verify because I have to triple check everything

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,320
 Backpacker verse says when I was doing research to verify all that stuff

38
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,360
 It typed in like highway 101 haunted and this thing popped up this thing popped up

39
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,880
 So let's all hop in the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna drive them down highway 1-0

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,080
 I guess we could have just walked there because basically we ended up that last episode there

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,840
 But we're there however we get there. We are at highway 101

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,520
 We're standing in front of a giant billboard on the side of the road the billboard says are you scared?

43
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,920
 You should be

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,480
 Technically is it the height they should be the billboard reads right?

45
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,040
 But anyways it reads are you scared?

46
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:39,060
 You should be dot dot dot and then on the right hand side of the billboard our right hand

47
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,480
 It's left hand this is getting way too complicated. But anyways, there's a picture of like a creepy-looking dude

48
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,820
 Like it looks like a photograph turned into clip art type of thing of a creepy-looking dude on the other side

49
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,600
 There's a pair of eyes poking out bottom. It says bobs boards calm now this billboard went up in

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,680
 2018 and people are complaining about it because it's really creepy and you just drive by it and it's a picture of this creepy guy

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,140
 And it says are you scared you should be and so people have been complaining about this billboard the billboard companies like listen man

52
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,780
 We take money we put up billboards as long as it's not I do

53
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,020
 He's the most I just imagine the guy around the company is the most like cigar chomping business suit wearing

54
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,300
 Dude ever cuz he's like your kids crying tough look lady

55
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,300
 You got more money to pay for a better billboard. I'll take it down

56
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,340
 But other than that because people are complaining their kids are crying. This is a creepy-looking billboard

57
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:40,440
 So what is Bob's boards and and ever there's been a couple articles on this billboard and they all go to

58
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,280
 Bob's boards calm and they interview the great nephew, so

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,600
 Bob's boards calm is a kind of a enigma. I I'll tell you what I think it is in a second

60
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,680
 But anyways, this is the way that it's set up. It's an average time

61
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,520
 It's a website that sells spirit boards we gee boards we gee board is a trademark name

62
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,240
 I believe so they have to use the name spirit board, but it's a spirit board that is supposedly

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,900
 Made by a serial killer. This is the legend behind this thing. There was this guy who stalked lover lanes across the country

64
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,880
 So he was killing couples. That was his that was his MO

65
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,720
 that's what he enjoyed doing and

66
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,300
 He killed a bunch of them and he never got caught

67
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:26,240
 But as he got older he wanted to find forgiveness in his actions. He wanted to I guess I don't have to explain that anymore

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,400
 He just wanted to be forgiven

69
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,740
 So he built he created his own spirit board and use that to contact the victims of people he killed

70
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:39,040
 Now that in and of itself is quite chilling if you can imagine a serial killer

71
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,740
 Killing people and then believing he has the ability to contact them from beyond the dead and maybe even torment them even longer like

72
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,540
 Be like hey look at this cool video game

73
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,920
 You're missing breath of the wild two is coming out and you don't get to see it because I killed you ha ha

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,440
 Ghosts is like no

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,440
 But anyways, I guess he would probably also be my friends and family and miss him so much

76
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:07,220
 Anyway, so the serial killer this guy's unnamed serial killer created this spirit board not to talk people with upcoming video game releases

77
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,080
 but to ask for their forgiveness and he did contact his victims and they

78
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,500
 Like the myth I'm not saying any of this is true, but apparently according in this website

79
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,300
 They drove him to the brink of insanity or most likely over the brink into insanity and he's just kind of diss I believe the great

80
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,300
 Uncle is dead now

81
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,000
 Because a lot of his murders apparently took place a long time ago. So what this story is is that his great nephew?

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,960
 This serial killer's great nephew found the spirit board found this specially designed spirit board and he is selling it

83
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
 for the low low price of

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,120
 $9.95 plus 950 shipping and handling although there is a if you buy more than one board

85
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,240
 You only have to pay the one shipping and handling so that's kind of cool

86
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,760
 Now the board itself looks like a serial killer designed

87
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,880
 It's the standard wheezy board layout, but all of the letters are like the cut out magazine letters on there

88
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,160
 You know like that little design each letter looks different a different color and all that stuff and the creepy

89
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520
 Face is in the middle of it

90
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,000
 So the last thing I want a wishy-bore to be is even more creepy than it already is

91
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,400
 For regardless of whether or not the backstory is true the design of it is quite disturbing and the great nephew said

92
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,200
 So this is what I think this is first I thought it was a marketing gimmick

93
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,200
 But now I'm starting to think it might be an ARG very expensive ARG

94
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:35,240
 Because there's a challenge according to this board and there's not a lot of information on the website itself

95
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,320
 I think it's maybe like four or five pages, but this is the challenge that's listed on the website

96
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,020
 We will put in this. Hey, one of you guys might be able to do this. You can smart cookies

97
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,060
 We will pay

98
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:52,760
 $50,000 to anyone who decipher the elaborate series of codes ciphers and arcane images that populate Bob's board

99
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:59,560
 Spirit board Bob's great nephew believes that the symbols and codes are clues to where Bob

100
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,960
 perpetrated his crimes and if deciphered may solve the decades-long mystery of Bob's board

101
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,240
 Was Bob a serial killer as he himself alleged or was he simply insane?

102
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,600
 So there may be other stuff on the board that I can't see because I'm just looking at a photograph of it

103
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,240
 So there may be like little symbols in there

104
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,300
 So you can send in your fan theories and they'll post videos on his website and this one woman who's connecting

105
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:33,760
 Bob to the Texarkana murders the very theme famous string of murders in Texas where a guy was walking around and shooting people at Lovers Lanes

106
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,040
 But I'm thinking okay

107
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,280
 It's an ARG and this guy's trying to sell these boards and but I don't know how many ARGs you can win like

108
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,160
 $50,000 cash the kid the nephew himself

109
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,600
 I didn't see his name, but I could have just not I could have just glanced over that

110
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,480
 I tried looking for who's actually behind this there is a company that runs that is actually producing the boards and they have a

111
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,220
 Disclaimer and they say listen we don't agree with the board. We don't think you guys should use these boards

112
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,280
 Spirit boards can be evil and our lawyers are telling us to say that

113
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,200
 None of this stuff is real and all people that it's connected to you know fictional or otherwise

114
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,360
 You know the typical disclaimer when you have a fictional movie they're like if this matches up anyone living or dead

115
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
 We're not responsible. It's all coincidence stuff like that

116
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
 So they're saying that we have to put this disclaimer on here

117
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,600
 Which could again be part of the because it is all made up. We don't know we don't know if this is a hundred percent made up

118
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,680
 We don't know if there's a little bit of fact. We don't know if it's true

119
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,200
 But since the board company can't verify that it's true. They have to put that disclaimer in there. Who knows?

120
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,120
 This is a relatively new conspiracy the billboard went up in 2018

121
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:53,080
 The trademark for the name Bob's boards was granted in 2017 and you think okay ARG

122
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,800
 So it's just goofing around what's odd is the board itself has two copyrights

123
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
 one for 2017 and

124
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,760
 one for 1982

125
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,200
 So if it's an ARG either they fake that first copyright, which is possible

126
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,400
 They just you know wrote that down and said copyright 1982

127
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,040
 But I would think if they were making it up

128
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,360
 They probably would have made it earlier in the timeline because 80s isn't as creepy as the 70s and apparently this guy

129
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,680
 That's just a known thing 80s is nowhere near as creepy as the 70s

130
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,520
 But it could be that it actually was copyrighted by somebody this board design was copyrighted by someone in

131
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,560
 1982 and then it sat in someone's shelf all this time and then someone said I'll come up with a cool marketing gimmick

132
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
 Who knows who knows but

133
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,080
 $50,000 is a lot of money. I mean you do have to pay $30. They do say no

134
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,480
 Purchase necessary so I guess if one of you guys bought the board

135
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,160
 You guys can post photos of it online and then everyone could help decipher it as well. I don't know

136
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
 I'm not endorsing this this

137
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,320
 Possible

138
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,960
 Marketing scheme. I just think it's an interesting story the idea of a serial killer designing his own spirit board to contact his dead is

139
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,760
 Something that you could see in a book or a movie or something like that

140
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:15,120
 So if there's even a whiff of it being true, which probably isn't but if there's even a whiff of it being true in the real world

141
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,800
 It's always something intriguing to look at but again, you know me. I don't mess with spirit boards

142
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,040
 I don't mess with none of that stuff. So go nuts guys. Just do not let me put my legal disclaimer on here

143
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,880
 If you get possessed, it's not my fault. It's totally your fault. Okay there. That's from your buddy Jason

144
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,720
 Don't get possessed. But if you do don't blame me

145
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,480
 Okay, let's go ahead and get moving on to our next story now alien week continues

146
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,760
 We've left Bob's boards behind the billboard still stands little kids are still crying

147
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,360
 But we are on our way to the caucus cock cock

148
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,960
 Cockass mountains, you know, they're in

149
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,600
 Soviet Union or when I was a kid it was a Soviet Union

150
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,040
 Apparently this I don't know what it is. I don't know where they're at now. I think they're in Russia. Maybe use Becca State

151
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,160
 Anyways, it doesn't matter mountain range the caucus mountains. I'm probably not pronounced that right either

152
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,920
 now we've started getting a lot of

153
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,320
 UFO stories coming out of Russia over the past couple years a ton of them all

154
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,540
 with varying I don't know how many of them are true is what I'm trying to say

155
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,880
 because

156
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,880
 They're very poorly sourced first off people didn't want to really want to talk about that stuff because then the the

157
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,520
 KGB would give you a phone call be like hey you saw an experimental vehicle flying around

158
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,140
 Why don't you come come to our headquarters? Let's talk about it. You're like no

159
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,520
 I don't know so a lot of people weren't talking about UFOs over there

160
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,440
 Because you do get disappeared if there's too many clouds in the sky. It was not a fun the Soviet Union

161
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,560
 I don't understand how people still look back on that place with rose colored glasses

162
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,240
 But it was not a fun place to be

163
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,200
 Different in you don't want to be different in the Soviet Union

164
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:08,120
 So if you were a lowly farmer and you saw like a cigar-shaped vehicle land and a bunch of aliens get out and start taking

165
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,480
 Readings and eating potatoes like you're like no, there's my potatoes

166
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,200
 That's where my vodka comes from and then they get on the ship and fly away. You're not gonna tell anybody

167
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,080
 You just you're be like I had nothing happened

168
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:26,540
 There's like radiation scorch marks everywhere and the farmer has like horrible radiation burns on his face from the exhausts of the spaceship

169
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:32,560
 People are like how'd you get that? He's like I walked in with doorknob, you know radioactive doorknob. Don't ask questions

170
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
 It's soviet union so

171
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,040
 There's one of the stories that came out this story is quite interesting. I really really like it

172
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,800
 It actually has one of the things that I enjoy about alien abduction stories, which is quite chilling the year is

173
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:53,000
 1948 apparently this was written as a letter to a Russian you and UFO investigator in

174
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,360
 2001 there's a young boy whose name is only listed as VZ. We're gonna call him Victor

175
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,520
 We're gonna call him Victor because it's easier. So there's this young boy

176
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,200
 That's he doesn't really give us an age either. So again a lot of suspicious details, but I really like this story

177
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,240
 So we're gonna roll with it in let's say he's 12. I think that works

178
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,440
 He's a young boy and him his sister and her friend

179
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,440
 go out for a picnic in the caucus mountains and

180
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,000
 They decide to go sunbathing oddly enough that's in quotes in the article

181
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,360
 I'm thinking is that they insinuating something else? So I don't know but Victor whatever leaves the two girls to do what they're gonna do and

182
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,400
 Decides to go on to the other side of this hill where there's some shade and just chill pick a little piece of wheat

183
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
 Put it in his mouth like Tom Sawyer

184
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,400
 Eat it cuz he's so hungry cuz he lives in the Soviet Union and they have no food

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,440
 But after getting a full stomach after that one little stalk of wheat he takes a nap

186
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,260
 He just kind of passes it's like oh, I haven't eaten that much in days

187
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,520
 Fall asleep the next thing he knows he hears up

188
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,280
 When it's not a bunch of M&Ms coming at him it's not some monks

189
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,840
 It's he looks up and he's

190
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,840
 Don't know why thought M&Ms would make that noise because all the m's right

191
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,200
 He looks up and he sees what he describes as an upside-down plate

192
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:19,920
 Floating in the sky now that's funny because that's the most basic observation if you would never seen a UFO before

193
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,960
 Ever and you never saw a movie of one and you saw UFO you would describe it as an upside-down plate

194
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,720
 That's the classic version. I mean flying saucers. That's where they get the name from they look like plates flying around

195
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,840
 But you didn't know that that's where that term comes from. I didn't know that well

196
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,480
 I knew that you know 20 years ago, but when I found that out. I was like really that's where they come

197
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,480
 Anyways, so flying saucers because they look like saucer dishes upside down

198
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,720
 So it makes sense this kid it goes I looked up and I saw what appeared to be an upside-down flying plate and it lands a little

199
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,200
 Little landing pads come out door comes down and three aliens come out

200
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,480
 It's interesting because he goes into a lot of descriptors here, but the one thing he's mostly

201
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:12,960
 Vagon is what the aliens look like which is usually the opposite a lot of times people give very detailed idea of what the aliens look like

202
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,920
 But they don't really tell us anything that happens in the ship

203
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,560
 They just pass out when they go in the ship and that's one of the reasons why I like this story

204
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,280
 It's we hear a lot about in the ship. There's quite the adventure coming up. He sees these three aliens

205
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:33,420
 He describes them as tall humanoids three humanoids get off the ship and one of them takes him by the hand and he said

206
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,200
 I didn't really even

207
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,280
 Understand what was going on. I just knew like I should follow them like I wasn't super scared at this point

208
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,360
 They just grab my hand to the next thing and he was walking on the ship and I wasn't even question was going on

209
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,840
 he gets on to this UFO he gets on to this alien spacecraft they're taking him down a hallway and

210
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,120
 He see he enters over this is when you know things are gonna go south for you

211
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,160
 You're already a little iffy, but you're not super scared of these spaceship landed and these people walked up to you

212
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,200
 And just put their hand out and you grabbed it, but then they lead you in a room full of cages

213
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,860
 You know when I read that I was like that's a little low-tech for a UFO

214
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:17,120
 Like you have a UFO that can defy gravity while airplanes can fly gravity and they have cages in them

215
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,920
 But I mean, you know, I mean like it's a spacecraft from traveling from wherever other dimensions or across the stars or whatever

216
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,560
 And they just have metal barred cages that seemed a little weird

217
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,040
 But maybe it's the most efficient for keeping earthlings this little victor is led into this spaceship now

218
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:39,060
 I want you to imagine you have to pick one of these cages to go into it's almost like there's three cages in a mystery box and

219
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:46,280
 You may put yourself in the mind of a kid who's walking on to this spaceship and these are the cages. He sees in order

220
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,040
 first cage he sees

221
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,000
 contains a

222
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,480
 Quote angry bear so not just any bear a bear that is out of its mind

223
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:05,160
 Trying to get at somebody or something it just wants it which I found super intriguing the fact that aliens are abducting bears that part

224
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,240
 I was like this story already has a bunch of stuff that I love

225
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,120
 Aliens are abducting other animals and then they just put them in a cage in their UFO

226
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,960
 Full of other abductees so imagine

227
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,600
 Okay, you I keep saying imagine this stuff because the whole scenario is weird

228
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:28,120
 He walks into this room at the first cage he sees contains an angry bear not sleepy not eating honey

229
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:36,720
 Angry big angry bear from Russia the angriest of all bears come from Russia the next cage over has three men

230
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,440
 Praying just praying the whole time and then you're like well Jason

231
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,320
 I'd much rather be with the praying men than grizzly bear, but

232
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,200
 You probably just try to convert you like I listen man

233
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,000
 I'm Christian, but I don't want to be trapped in a cell with three other Christians

234
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,360
 Especially when there's a bear next to me because they're just gonna be praying the whole time like let's figure out a way to escape

235
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,260
 Quit praying they're praying for the gate to be open. It's not gonna work anyway

236
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,120
 So you have the angry bear you have the three praying men

237
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,480
 Next to them you have a woman what what Jason you have a why didn't you go to that one first if you said I had a choice

238
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,080
 I want to be in the cage with a woman except you didn't let me finish

239
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,400
 Victor describes this woman as screaming hysterically

240
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,720
 The whole the rest of this time throughout this adventure. She is screaming at the top of her lungs

241
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,520
 She is gone mad by her being trapped in this situation. She's completely lost it

242
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,600
 So you walk in you see the angry bear trying to like push open the door

243
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,280
 You see the three praying men who aren't really trying to escape at all

244
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,040
 You see a woman just screaming at the top of her lungs

245
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,880
 louder than the bear and

246
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,840
 Then the last cage has a man in it

247
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
 You're like, oh

248
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,080
 Man, let's talk on a mystery box because that guy he's calm

249
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,040
 That's the scary thing and in spite of all of this that's going on

250
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,720
 There's a bear trying to take a swipe at the three praying people and the three praying people aren't praying to be released

251
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,280
 They're praying that the woman would just shut up and then the woman's just would blow your drums out

252
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,200
 You have this man who's calm throughout all of it when the aliens take Victor and they put him in the cage with the man and

253
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,640
 the man says be quiet and stay calm and

254
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,040
 Victor's basically frozen at this point. He doesn't know what to do. He's locked in this cage

255
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,920
 He feels the UFO lift off and he's like I my sis. I'll never see my sister again. I'll never see my family again

256
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,480
 I have no idea what's going on and after a short while the UFOs flying around the aliens are kind of talking to each other and

257
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,080
 Then they press a button and a table comes out of a wall like slides out like

258
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:57,240
 And they walk over to the cage with the three praying men and they get one now

259
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:03,380
 It doesn't say if he resists or not and I'm wondering if they have some sort of ability to like make you comply

260
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,000
 but

261
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,360
 It's probably a combination of both they probably just actually just through being their captors

262
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,840
 They have you know and created a sense that they can do whatever they want and the guy didn't seem to resist

263
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,000
 There was no note that he resisted they take one of the praying guys

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,480
 They take him over to the table

265
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,200
 They strap him down and Victor's just standing there watching and the aliens pull out their instruments and

266
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,040
 They cut him open and while he's still alive

267
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,560
 They begin removing his organs and putting them in little like pots. They're weighing them

268
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,240
 They're doing tests on them while he's alive. They're just cutting them open

269
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,280
 piece by piece and then eventually he passes away and

270
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,480
 Everyone watch this even the bears like oh no. Oh no. What's gonna happen to me?

271
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,160
 the woman is

272
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,800
 10 decibels louder at this point and

273
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,120
 They then basically all of the man scraps. They just kind of throw them away

274
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,660
 They just basically like are then cleaning the table off

275
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,840
 Packing up what's the organs that they didn't want to study and they just basically dispose of this human

276
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,520
 They cut him up in front of everybody and he was awake for the whole thing. It wasn't like they gave him an anesthetic

277
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,520
 He was watching himself getting cut open by these aliens couldn't do anything about it

278
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,160
 Eventually bled out or they just removed his heart and

279
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,120
 They just throw him in the garbage

280
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,520
 Put him in a hefty bag and they're like throw it out of the ship as they're flying over like someone's neighborhood

281
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
 And someone's like what happened to my garden?

282
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:43,120
 But anyways they dispose of the human at that point the aliens leave the room and that is when the man is like

283
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,200
 Okay, good. He didn't pick one of us. Hi. My name is Alexander and Victor's like what he's like listen

284
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,240
 I don't know what's going on here, but I am so glad

285
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,200
 You're here because we got to get out of here. That's gonna happen to us. It's totally gonna happen to us kids like yeah

286
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,640
 Yeah, no duh we got to get out here and he's like okay, but see I'm glad you're in my cage

287
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,320
 Because see those bars at the top of this really old cage that somehow these aliens use and Victor's like yeah

288
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,160
 You go you can squeeze through those but you're not tall enough to get through those

289
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,560
 So I'm gonna lift you up and I'm gonna push you through that cage and Victor's like then when

290
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,560
 Go to that door. I've seen him press that button to open the cages

291
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,040
 You just saw him press that button open the cages remember when they pulled the other guy and he's like oh, yeah

292
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,800
 Totally I was in shock from seeing a man murdered. He's like yeah happens

293
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,200
 So I'm gonna put you up through the bars of the cage. You're tiny enough and I'm tall enough

294
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,680
 You drop you'll go over there you hit a button and he goes what about the others

295
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,880
 Shouldn't we help the others and Alexander kind of face palm as it goes listen dude

296
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,920
 We can release them at some point, but this is our escape plan you want to run through an alien

297
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
 Run and hide from aliens with a screaming woman

298
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,840
 two guys praying and a bear on her ass and and of course Victor's like oh, yeah, sorry forgot about the bear

299
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,000
 So he's like just go hit our button

300
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,440
 I'm gonna lift you up you go and hit the button that will only release my cage. Okay. Be very very careful about that

301
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,120
 so he does Alexander picks up Victor and he pushes them through the top of the bars and

302
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,600
 Victor gets out of the cage

303
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,840
 And then Victor walks over to the side of the UFO where the button is and he goes press it Alexander's like no no no

304
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,160
 That one that's the bear one don't hit that one

305
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,360
 So Alex Victor's like okay, okay, and he can't reach the button because he's too tiny

306
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,640
 And Alexander's looking at it and he goes okay. I want this is all important. I'm not just basically doing

307
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,480
 Tom Sawyer esk escape this all pays off in the end

308
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,920
 the

309
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,280
 Um Alexander goes okay. I want you to take your clothes off

310
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,280
 Victor's like what he's like listen, dude. You want to get out of here?

311
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,240
 Just take your clothes off. Don't worry. It doesn't get weird

312
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,480
 Put them underneath your feet and that'll give you an extra like a couple inches a foot to stand on

313
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,280
 Now keep your underwear on dude. Just get up there and then you can hit the button. It'll open the door

314
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,120
 We can make our escape. So Victor does that he takes off his shirt

315
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,160
 Takes off his pants stands on top of him is now able to reach the button hits it door opens up and Alexander comes out

316
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,440
 And he's like okay first off get your clothes back on as quickly as you can

317
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,600
 And let's go and they start kind of rummaging through the shit. They don't know where they're at obviously

318
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,360
 They're on a vessel that was never designed by a human. They don't know where they're at and again

319
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,280
 This is taking place in 1948

320
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,360
 So I don't even know if they're truly aware of they could be in the sky

321
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,040
 Or they could be in an outer space like again UFO culture was not super well known

322
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,360
 In the rural areas of the soviet union, which is where the story takes place

323
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,400
 Alexander said that he was a minor from the url region. So he was just a

324
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,840
 Digging out rocks one day and these aliens got him

325
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,680
 So they they weren't sitting there watching the day the earth stood still they don't

326
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:03,760
 They just know and actually that movie wasn't even out yet. This was like what two years after roswell around that

327
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,080
 They just know that they're not on the ground

328
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,120
 But as far as they know they're in the middle of deep space or underwater. They have no idea

329
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,280
 But what do you do when you're trapped by a bunch of people in a vehicle?

330
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,040
 You don't know where it's at you try to do as much damage as possible

331
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,480
 They end up they're running around the ship and they find

332
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,160
 What appears to be an engine room? They're not idiots. They know what engines look like and

333
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:37,040
 Alexander's like, oh, we gotta figure out a way. Maybe we can commandeer this boat this blimp whatever it is and take it somewhere

334
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,440
 And victor goes. Oh, I know something and he picks a box up off the ground. It says a metal box

335
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
 I don't know if he like tore it off the ground

336
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,360
 Like the hulk or if it was just laying there because the aliens were dirty

337
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,240
 He picks it up and he throws it against an instrument panel

338
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,880
 And sparks start shooting out

339
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,640
 Which is one way to to end your captivity is to destroy whatever you're in

340
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,440
 at that point

341
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,760
 The aliens who had been sleeping who'd been sleeping through this adventure

342
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
 Jump up out of their respective beds

343
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,840
 And run into the control room

344
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,680
 Oh, yeah, I forgot to I forgot to say that when they were sneaking through the ship

345
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,760
 They saw the three aliens sleeping which would have been if you want to take

346
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,040
 Well, I guess maybe they don't want to murder these people in their sleep

347
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,840
 I guess there's a difference between escaping and like cold-blooded murder

348
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,600
 But anyways, they did see the alien sleeping and then they went to the control room

349
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,200
 And so when they started bashing the place up bashing up real good

350
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,120
 The aliens woke up ran in and when they ran in they

351
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,480
 They got alexander. He basically put up no fight

352
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,520
 And then they took a shock stick and plugged victor in the back of the head and knocked him out

353
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,200
 So victor was just one of those guys be like fine. You got me but stands up

354
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,400
 Victor's one resisting arrest and they have to pull out their space billy clubs and beat him down

355
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,680
 Victor wakes back up in the cell with alexander and now they have two guards the aliens are like

356
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,160
 So now they can only sleep one at a time two of them has to stand outside of their cell to make sure they don't escape again

357
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,280
 But everything changed after this and the aliens actually now had more respect for alexander

358
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,120
 Not so much victor, which is interesting because they go. Well, how did you get out?

359
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,480
 Like just tell us how you got out because you're trapped and alexander goes

360
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,000
 Well, you know actually I lifted him up through the top of the bars and he fell over

361
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,280
 And then he stood on his clothes and he hit the button and then we went we saw you guys sleeping

362
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,600
 It's kind of creepy. We could have done anything, but we didn't and the aliens are like did you see what else we were doing?

363
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,760
 alexander's like

364
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,600
 I won't say but yes, I did but then we went to the control room started mucking stuff up and

365
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,240
 The aliens go, you know

366
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,120
 Let's I'm gonna be honest with you. We're scientists earth has scientists. We're scientists. We're here simply doing

367
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,160
 Investigations and stuff that you would do to other animals on your planet

368
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,000
 So there's nothing personal between us and our medical research at that point the praying guys are like you killed our friend

369
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,080
 But we don't we we're not here to actually cause any harm

370
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,400
 But we're fascinated by the fact that she figured out a way out of this trap

371
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,880
 Like no one should have been able to do that. They said see that woman over there. She's totally nuts

372
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,920
 Like we don't even know what we're going to do with her. She's like completely gone

373
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,360
 And those guys who were praying they're actually they actually were called quote

374
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
 Lower level humans unquote

375
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,840
 So whether or not that means they were like

376
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,480
 From some sort of like undiscovered tribe or even the article says maybe they were from another time period

377
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,440
 Like lower level as in they were abducted from another period of time. Who knows but the aliens just said they're basically a bunch of dummies

378
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
 We don't know what we're going to do with them. We're just going to cut them up

379
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,200
 The woman probably cut her up. Maybe have some hybrids. We don't know the bear was an accident

380
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,400
 The bear we were trying to pick up a hunter. He ducked

381
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,360
 Bear got sucked up. We're stuck with this bear and

382
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,440
 Alexander goes, why are you guys here? Why are you we get the extra scientists?

383
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,920
 You want to cut up a bunch of people and a bear but what's what's going on and they said listen

384
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,120
 We didn't know anything really about your planet. Like we knew there was life on it

385
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,760
 But once you guys started detonating nuclear bombs

386
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:21,280
 We're like what is possibly going on in this planet. They said radioactive material like nuclear material is quite rare

387
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,240
 And it is the main propulsion drive for star ships

388
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,920
 And the fact that you guys are throwing it into bombs and dropping it on each other is ludicrous to us

389
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,480
 It's it's something that we need to make our ships fly around. That's why we're here now. That's an interesting theory

390
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,320
 I've never ever heard that theory before. I've heard that aliens were brought here because the nuclear bombs

391
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,520
 That they saw them dropping and they were like we must stop them from destroying themselves

392
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,080
 I've never heard the theory before that they're like it would be like if you were poor or you just were kind of getting by

393
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,200
 And you saw someone just like melting gold and spraying it with spraying it on people the super soaker

394
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,960
 And you'd be like you're wasting all that money and you're like, yeah, but I can like that's how they viewed us dropping nuclear bombs

395
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,800
 They're like this is so precious and you guys are blowing each other up with it

396
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,400
 But they said Alexander we would like to make you do

397
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,400
 We would like to offer you a trip onto our mothership because we think you're probably the smartest human we've run across

398
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,280
 We will take you on our mothership with us and you can come to our home planet and tell us all about earth

399
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,360
 You'll basically be a representative

400
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,320
 And Alexander says I will go on your mothership, but you have to let everyone else go and the aliens actually didn't want to do that

401
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,560
 They're like, I'm assuming it takes a lot of effort to actually abduct people

402
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,720
 Because the aliens are like, uh fine and they thought about it

403
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,040
 So they go, yes, you're a better prize than all these other dudes

404
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,880
 So we'll let victor go we'll let the woman go we'll let the two praying guys go

405
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,680
 They don't say what happens to the bear. I'm assuming that goes to space with them

406
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,880
 But they say, you know, Alexander needs to get this little shot

407
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,600
 In him because he got a high dose of radiation when he went into the control room

408
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,400
 We're going to give him the shot. He'll be fine. We'll drop him off on earth

409
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,920
 We'll give you a shot later because we don't want you dying either, but let's go

410
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,240
 Victor gets the shot in his neck and then he passes out and the next thing he knows

411
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,360
 He wakes up and his mother and a bunch of other people are standing around him. Apparently he had been

412
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:26,480
 Passed out and missing or missing and passed out. This is where the story gets weird again because we don't

413
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,960
 It doesn't say where he was found or when he was found or who found him or anything like that

414
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,240
 We're missing a lot of details. But anyways when victor came back like Dorothy from Oz he says

415
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,880
 Oh my god, you guys won't believe what happened. There was this bear and this screaming woman and this dude got chopped up

416
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,400
 But I took all my clothes off and I hit a button and I let this guy out of a cage and they're like, whoa

417
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,760
 Hold on victor and he was telling this story

418
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,960
 All over the village and his mom eventually pulled him aside and said listen victor

419
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,920
 You can't keep telling that story and he's like it's true though mom mom goes it may be true

420
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,400
 but if you keep

421
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,800
 telling this story you will be visited by

422
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,400
 Somebody that you don't want to be visited by and at that point victor stopped telling that story and when he became a young man

423
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:17,280
 He was in his 20s. He was working in the farm a bunch of troops showed up with a plane with a guy dressed up and just plain clothes

424
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,760
 Which are main secret police they always just show up in

425
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,600
 Slacks and a button-up t-shirt, but they're flanked by guards

426
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,280
 So you know there's someone important and the guy started asking victor about this story because it had got it taken a couple years

427
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,360
 But it had gotten to people who investigated this stuff and then they tracked him down

428
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,640
 They asked him about the story and he totally denied it said it never happened

429
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,360
 Doesn't know what what they're talking about and that went on for quite a while and eventually the the secret police in the military left

430
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,680
 And he kept the story under wraps until the year 2001 where he wrote this letter to this russian UFO investigator

431
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,320
 alien abduction stories

432
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,080
 tend to be I was abducted I have a few brief glimmers of

433
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:06,400
 Memory and then i'm back on her most alien abduction stories seem to be quite vague the victims seem to not

434
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:12,240
 Really been able to grasp or remember what happened and if the story of victor is true

435
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,680
 And if it's the norm it's actually a good thing that they don't

436
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,960
 How many people have gone through the same story?

437
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,680
 How many people have been abducted?

438
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,560
 caged

439
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
 tested and disposed of

440
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,400
 Not returned with a hazy memory

441
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,520
 Not dropped back on earth after a deal

442
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,840
 but simply

443
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
 disappear

444
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,400
 Families and loved ones missed them putting flyers up on telephone poles

445
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,960
 along lonely streets at night

446
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,600
 Never knowing that the person that they lost

447
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,200
 Is simply a footnote

448
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
 in an alien's medical journal

449
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:06,800
