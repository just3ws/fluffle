1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 A groundbreaking and controversial new steady shows that depression is not caused by low

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,440
 serotonin levels.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,160
 It's actually caused by having a bunch of bad stuff happen to you at the same time.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,080
 And yet psychiatrists disagree.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,160
 Very interesting story.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,040
 Now we travel to Australia to take a look at a terrifying cryptid waiting for us in the

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,440
 woods.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,680
 And if you think you can run and hide from this beast, first ask yourself, is your life

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,760
 worth the safety of your family and friends?

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,760
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:49,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
 I'm having a good day.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
 I hope you guys are having a good day.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,400
 I hope you guys are having awesome fun doing whatever you're doing.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,440
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,400
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,000
 Everyone get on your feet and give a salute to Sniper.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Woohoo!

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Yeah, come on in Sniper.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Hope you have that rifle ready.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 We're going to do some cryptid hunting in the next story and maybe you have depression

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,120
 from doing all that sniping.

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,920
 We'll talk about that in the first story.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,240
 Sniper, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,520
 If you guys can't support your Patreon, I totally understand.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,040
 I really do.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
 Just help spread the word about the show.

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,960
 It helps out so much.

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,080
 Please do that for Dead Rabbit Radio.

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,880
 Sniper, let's go ahead and tashie the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,600
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,880
 We're going to burn rubber and head on out to a psychiatrist's office.

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,480
 I don't really know if the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy Street Legal but we're taking it there

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
 anyways.

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,680
 It's going to be a fun little ride hanging out as the temperature is not so hot.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,520
 It's hanging out in this Dune Buggy driving on the way to the psychiatrist's office.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,440
 We're interrupting all their appointments.

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,800
 Just revving up the engine right outside their window.

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,920
 This was an interesting story.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,600
 This story I came across during my vacation and it might have actually been right before

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,320
 I went on vacation.

43
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,440
 I was like, "Wow, this is huge.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,880
 This is a really big story."

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,760
 I wanted to wait to see what the pushback would be on it because I knew there would be

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,000
 pushback.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,160
 The pushback, it's interesting because on the one hand people are seriously pushing back

48
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,280
 against this steady we're going to talk about but on the other hand everyone's doing it

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,000
 very quietly.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Because even the pushback, even by pushing back against this thing, you have that thing

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,400
 on the internet called the Streisand Effect.

52
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,680
 The more you fight against something, the more popular or the more well-known the thing

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,600
 you're fighting against becomes.

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:52,360
 This is an explosive study that is ready to rock the world of psychiatry.

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
 Depression.

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,280
 Let's talk about depression real quick.

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,400
 I've obviously gone through bouts of depression.

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,040
 A long time ago I remember I was in depression when I first moved up here and I was prescribed

59
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,720
 what was described as a low dose of Prozac.

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,960
 It was basically just a low dose.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,120
 They said, "I've talked about this before on the show."

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,840
 They go, "You're going to start taking this stuff.

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,600
 You're going to have some weird dreams, dude."

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,240
 They did not prepare me for how weird my dreams were.

65
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,200
 I remember vividly, I don't even like bringing this up because I'm afraid that it's true.

66
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:37,080
 I remember vividly dreaming that my mom and my stepdad murdered my sister.

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,340
 Murdered my sister and they had buried her and I didn't have anything to do with the

68
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,200
 murder but I knew about it.

69
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,320
 I remember she was buried underneath a swimming pool.

70
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,240
 At a YMCA, it was like a gymnasium swimming pool.

71
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,240
 She was buried underneath it.

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,840
 My sister's not dead.

73
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,400
 She definitely wasn't murdered.

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,800
 I remember waking up and I was terrified that I had unlocked some lost memory.

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,920
 I didn't even want to tell anyone because what if it was true?

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,560
 What if I had forgotten that my sister had gone missing?

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,600
 I have a very strong sense of self.

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,400
 I spent a lot of time alone.

79
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,080
 Before I did the podcast, when I had a job where I had three days off and a row, it was

80
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 awesome.

81
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,800
 Of course, I started doing the podcast.

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,040
 For those three days, I wouldn't utter a single word.

83
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
 I lived alone.

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
 I wasn't out and about.

85
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,480
 And basically, from the time I got home on what would be my Friday to the time I showed

86
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,440
 up to work on my Monday, I'd have three days where I wouldn't say a word.

87
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,320
 So I was constantly in my thoughts.

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,400
 I didn't even notice I was going through that until I realized it.

89
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
 I'd done that for months and months.

90
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,720
 I was like, "Wow, I go three days without saying anything.

91
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,280
 I've always been a fairly introspective person.

92
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,840
 I recharge by being alone.

93
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,440
 I'm constantly surrounded by people.

94
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,680
 I can't relax.

95
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,200
 I have to have moments, long moments where I'm by myself.

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,880
 So I have a very strong sense of self.

97
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,120
 I know how my brain works.

98
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,960
 I know how my thought patterns work.

99
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:17,080
 So when I started taking medication that was in effect changing things in my brain, I could

100
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
 tell.

101
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,800
 Going back, I was taking the Prozac and I could ... I remember when I was taking it, it tapers

102
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,960
 off eventually, this feeling.

103
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:33,080
 But I thought, I understand why a lot of SSRI drugs, why a lot of antidepressants have

104
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,800
 black box warnings saying this can cause you to kill yourself or to hurt other people and

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 stuff like that.

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,120
 Because if you didn't have a strong sense of self, of all of a sudden you started taking

107
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,760
 a medication and you began having intrusive thoughts and you had never had intrusive thoughts

108
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,640
 before or you started having these dreams that make you question reality.

109
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
 I understand.

110
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,920
 I go, "I get why teenagers shouldn't be taking this stuff."

111
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
 Right?

112
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,360
 It's very controversial for teenagers to be taking this stuff.

113
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,320
 And I'd argue anyone without a strong sense of self.

114
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,960
 And I remember I stopped taking it because I started working out more.

115
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,520
 I was exercising all the time and I was like, "I feel great.

116
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,840
 I don't need this medication anymore."

117
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,840
 So I just stopped.

118
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
 This is not medical advice podcast.

119
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,960
 I remember I ran into my doctor at Safeway and I was like, "Hey, what's up man?"

120
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,400
 We were talking a bit and I said, "Hey, I stopped taking that Prozac."

121
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,960
 And he was kind of like, "Uh-oh, okay."

122
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,240
 And I said, "Well, I've been working out a lot.

123
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,600
 I've been working out a lot and I just feel good."

124
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,080
 And I remember this very important to me.

125
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
 He goes, "That's fine."

126
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
 He goes, "You don't have to take it."

127
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,640
 He goes, "It's such a low dose anyways."

128
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,080
 He goes, "But you have to treat your workouts like medicine.

129
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,320
 You got to do them every day."

130
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,560
 Some form of exercise every single day.

131
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,200
 You have to treat it like it's treatment.

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,560
 That's a very good piece of advice.

133
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,960
 But then, you know, obviously stuff happens.

134
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,560
 And I remember I was kind of going, I wasn't really super.

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,760
 Every so often, just not like a normal person, you have good moments and bad moments and

136
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,880
 sometimes you're a little more depressed than others.

137
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,240
 I remember at this point, I was talking, I had the same doctor.

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,120
 A couple of years had passed and I was talking about, you know, feeling anxious, feeling down

139
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
 and stuff like that.

140
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,080
 And I was there to get treated for something else.

141
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,240
 And he goes, "Well, for the depression, we can put you back on the low dose of Prozac."

142
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,040
 And I said, "Pills aren't going to pay my bills."

143
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,520
 And kind of chuckled.

144
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
 He kind of chuckled.

145
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,760
 And he goes, "Yeah, that's true."

146
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
 Because here's the thing.

147
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,480
 This is the way that, I don't know if it's because I'm a boomer.

148
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,600
 This is the way that I was always, this is how I view depression.

149
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,160
 There's two types, obviously.

150
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
 There are people with chemical imbalances in their brains.

151
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
 Right?

152
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,960
 But for most people, depression is a series of events that are happening in a fairly

153
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,840
 rapid order or maybe just one or two really heavy events that makes you depressed.

154
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,120
 There are people out there who have bipolar disorder.

155
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,960
 That is a brain chemical thing, right?

156
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,560
 And then there are people who just like, "Wow, I can't believe the string of bad luck I've

157
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,120
 had."

158
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
 And it makes you depressed.

159
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,080
 You go, "What's the point of even going on?"

160
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,800
 You may not even be that depressed when you're thinking about ending it, but you're just

161
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,680
 like, "Am I ever going to get out of this hole?

162
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,920
 Are things ever going to change?"

163
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,280
 Now what I figured was that people just knew that.

164
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,840
 People just understood that there were different types of depression.

165
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,640
 But recently I read this article, and this has been super controversial.

166
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,280
 There was an article written in The Guardian by Andrew Gregory.

167
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,400
 This was published back on July 20, 2022.

168
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,080
 So I was on vacation when this popped out.

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,280
 What it is, is that the way that depression, whether or not it is, we're going to remove

170
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
 the bipolar thing, clinical depression, out of this.

171
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,320
 We're going to talk about the depression where people go to the doctor and say, "Hey man,

172
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
 things aren't working out for me.

173
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,480
 I'm really depressed."

174
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,320
 You got something for that.

175
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,520
 The doctors go, "We do.

176
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,120
 It's called an SSRI drug."

177
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,520
 They're used by boosting serotonin levels.

178
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,840
 So if you have low serotonin, you're more likely to be depressed.

179
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,280
 So if we can boost the serotonin, at least you won't be depressed.

180
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,760
 You still have to go through the motions in life, but this won't make you depressed.

181
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,280
 And what happened was this serotonin theory came out in the 1960s, and by the 1980s the

182
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,040
 pharmaceutical companies go, "Well, if depression is caused by low serotonin, we'll just make

183
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,880
 a drug that ups the levels of serotonin."

184
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,240
 And that has been the treatment for day-to-day depression for decades, right, for just standard

185
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
 depression.

186
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,200
 People go to the doctor and say, "I'm depressed.

187
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,760
 We all know these pills exist.

188
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,400
 We all know the doctors will prescribe them.

189
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
 So we'll go here."

190
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,520
 Recently, the University of College in London did a huge study led by Joanna Moncrief.

191
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,320
 She's a professor of psychiatry there.

192
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,960
 This is basically what the study says.

193
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:55,760
 There is, quote, "No convincing evidence that depression is caused by serotonin abnormalities,

194
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,600
 particularly by lower levels or reduced activity of serotonin."

195
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,520
 This says that, "There is nothing to back up that theory at all.

196
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,640
 That theory at this point is what, 60 years old, and there is no proof for it."

197
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,920
 And what they did was they went over all of these existing case studies, and they said,

198
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,000
 "Depression is not likely caused by a reduction of serotonin."

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,040
 Some of these studies, they would artificially reduce people's serotonin levels, and they

200
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,960
 did not suffer from depression.

201
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,880
 So if the low serotonin level made you depressed, how come we can't replicate that?

202
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,280
 They said, in some of these studies, we looked at the use of SSRI drugs, lowered the serotonin

203
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
 level.

204
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,320
 We didn't actually do what it was supposed to do in that particular person.

205
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,640
 And what I thought was, this was when I read this, I remember reading this in the morning,

206
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,880
 I wake up every morning, I read the news, I remember I chuckled to myself and I go,

207
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,960
 "Dah, this was one of the quotes from this article in The Guardian."

208
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,200
 It said, "Other studies," that they were researching, "other studies looked at the

209
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,520
 effects of stressful life events and found that the more stressful life events a person

210
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,720
 had experienced, the more likely they were to be depressed, showing the importance of

211
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,240
 external events."

212
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,600
 And I was like, is that not common knowledge?

213
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,800
 And apparently, let's say you've had a bad run of things, right?

214
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,440
 You go to the doctor, you say, "Hey man, things aren't working out for me, I'm really depressed."

215
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,280
 They can prescribe you SSRI drugs to boost your serotonin level, but that's not necessarily

216
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,960
 what causes the depression is the low serotonin level.

217
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,400
 And what's interesting is in the article in The Guardian and Joanne Moncrief, they've

218
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,520
 all said, "Listen, this is not saying stop taking your meds, this is 100% saying throw

219
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,000
 them all in the garbage."

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,720
 Because the problem is, there are bad side effects to just quit taking these.

221
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,400
 The question that people are saying who are in support of this survey is, this is interesting.

222
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,800
 They go, "There has been a debate behind the scenes whether or not serotonin levels cause

223
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,320
 depression, but that debate is not known to the general public."

224
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,680
 To the point that if you ask the random person on the street what causes depression, they

225
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,280
 generally will say serotonin levels.

226
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,680
 It is a common misconception that that is settled science.

227
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,600
 Low serotonin levels equal depression, so high serotonin levels equals no depression,

228
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,760
 so give me something to boost my serotonin.

229
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,240
 That is not settled science.

230
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,440
 And that debate has been going on behind the scenes, but it hasn't reached the general

231
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,000
 public and now it has, almost in this whisper war.

232
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,920
 And the other side of the psychiatry debate, they go, "Listen, we don't know how this stuff

233
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
 works."

234
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,880
 That was a common thing, they go, "You're right, we don't know how SSRI drugs make you

235
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,680
 not depressed, but they do."

236
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,240
 Same way that they don't know how science, apparently I just found this out, they don't

237
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,360
 know how Tylenol reduces a headache, they haven't figured that out, but it does.

238
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,000
 That was a comparison that was constantly being used.

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,360
 We don't know why Tylenol makes the pain go away in your head, but it does.

240
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,520
 They said, "We don't know why SSRI drugs work, but they do."

241
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,520
 And then, I mean, at that point you have to open up the whole placebo thing, right?

242
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,680
 If a doctor, if a medical professional gives you something and says, "This is going to make

243
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,280
 you less depressed," is how much of that is the placebo factor?

244
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,640
 They've even gone after the other side of the psychiatry argument who are saying, "No,

245
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,400
 you have to keep taking these.

246
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,120
 Let us debate behind the scenes that keep taking these."

247
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,520
 They've criticized Montcrey for being a "radical" against the pharmaceutical industry, saying,

248
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,280
 "Listen, she has a bone to pick with these people."

249
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,440
 Absolutely, for lack of a better word, insane, right?

250
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,160
 It really is.

251
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,960
 It really is because these drugs are prescribed so readily.

252
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,400
 Now, I was lucky I had, you know, I've always had really good luck with doctors, right?

253
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,920
 My doctor could have been like, "No, you got to get back on those, buddy.

254
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
 It'll help you out."

255
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,520
 I've always had really good rapport with my doctors and they kind of know my journey

256
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,920
 and where I want to end up, where I want to go.

257
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,720
 So, he's like, "Yeah, dude, you don't need that stuff.

258
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,680
 Anyways, just work out all the time."

259
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,720
 But I mean, these drugs, I mean, listen, I'm not telling you to stop taking them at all.

260
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
 At all.

261
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,880
 I'm not telling you to stop taking them.

262
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,920
 And there are people who need them, right?

263
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,160
 People who do feel better on them.

264
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,280
 But I think for the general public, I think the problem is the debate is not...

265
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,760
 I didn't know that at all.

266
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,800
 I mean, obviously, I chuckled because I always figured there was a good chunk of people who...

267
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,440
 It was external life stressors that made them depressed.

268
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,240
 Apparently, other people have to get a study on this, right?

269
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,480
 They have to have a study done to show that depression is caused by external life events

270
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,560
 that seems like such a no-brainer, really.

271
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,720
 But they're just reading the studies and they're being told stuff and they're like, "Here

272
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
 you go."

273
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,480
 And then you take this and it really does.

274
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,000
 Those first couple days, maybe a week, it really messes with your head.

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,520
 I can understand why it's super dangerous.

276
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,480
 I had a strong sense of self so I could realize those thoughts weren't...

277
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,320
 Not thoughts, even, it was just like the dreams.

278
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,840
 The dreams were so bizarre.

279
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,280
 But when I woke up, I was terrified.

280
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:22,320
 I honestly thought I had unearthed the memory of my parents killing my sister and I was like...

281
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,240
 In that moment, when I woke up, that was one of the times I can remember feeling the loneliest

282
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,400
 I ever did.

283
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,320
 And I liked being alone.

284
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,480
 That was like, soul lost in the darkness loneliness.

285
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,480
 I felt like my parents had murdered my sister and I was the only person on earth who knew

286
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,600
 that and I didn't know what to do next.

287
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,760
 And I was going to have this guilt, this just guilt over my shoulders for the rest of my

288
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
 life.

289
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,120
 I mean, it was super weird.

290
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
 Like I've...

291
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,320
 It's one of the loneliest times I ever felt in my life and it was all in my head.

292
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
 It was all made up.

293
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
 And if you didn't...

294
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,440
 So yeah, take them if you need to.

295
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,840
 But I think that we should know this stuff.

296
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,040
 We should know that it doesn't work.

297
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,280
 If a doctor goes, "We don't know how it works, but it works."

298
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,400
 That's better than just saying, "Yeah, it works."

299
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,720
 Crazy, crazy science and conspiracy theory story.

300
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,420
 I'm surprised this isn't bigger in the world of conspiracy theory as well.

301
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,120
 Because I know they get tied into school shootings and stuff like that.

302
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,160
 A lot of these school shooters, these young men, they get prescribed these type of drugs.

303
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
 I'm surprised.

304
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,280
 But again, like I said, it's kind of hard to find the articles on it.

305
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:44,560
 And if you don't know what you're looking for and yeah, the debate is raging, however.

306
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,360
 And the two sides are, they don't work or we don't know how they work.

307
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,840
 Those are the two sides, right?

308
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,720
 But either way, don't make any rash decisions.

309
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,440
 I'm not saying to quit them or anything like that.

310
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,000
 Don't take medical advice from a man in a haunted closet.

311
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,520
 Sniper, let's go ahead and leave behind the psychiatrist's office.

312
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,240
 I'm going to touch the keys to the world-famous carbonicopter.

313
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,640
 We're headed all the way out to Australia.

314
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,840
 I want to give a shout out.

315
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:20,600
 I found most of this information on a website called abookofcreatures.com.

316
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,680
 Really cool resource about cryptids, famous ones and obscure ones.

317
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,360
 Kind of sucks that there's a note, like the most recent update saying we're on an indefinite

318
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,240
 hiatus and that has been since July 2021.

319
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
 So that sucks.

320
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,280
 Whenever we lose a compatriot, whenever we lose a soldier in the war of the weird, someone

321
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,280
 out there cataloging this stuff, writing articles, doing podcasts, it sucks.

322
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,680
 But you see it a lot actually.

323
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,000
 I think there is kind of a high burnout rate.

324
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,320
 We have this resource for now.

325
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,040
 If you're into that, I recommend checking it out because who knows how long it's going

326
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,880
 to be up, right?

327
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,680
 Abookofcreatures.com gave me a bunch of this information.

328
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,600
 We're headed to Australia.

329
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:10,840
 In Australia, there is a cryptid, a creature, a monster that is almost unparalleled to anything

330
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,360
 we've covered before on this podcast.

331
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,120
 Because the question is, how much do you value your own life?

332
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,800
 Very rarely do cryptids make you think of these questions.

333
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:30,680
 In Australia, in the forested regions along the coast sits up high in a tree the Yara

334
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,200
 Ma Yahoo.

335
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,640
 The Yara Ma Yahoo.

336
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
 Let's take a look at this guy.

337
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,960
 Up in the trees in Australia, preferably in the fig trees is where this little dude likes

338
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
 to hang out.

339
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
 Yara Ma Yahoo.

340
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,520
 He's actually quite huge.

341
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,760
 I don't even know how he gets up there.

342
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,760
 I guess when you're a cryptid, you're just allowed to do things.

343
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,320
 He's about four feet tall.

344
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,440
 He's a quadruped, right?

345
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,560
 He's a creature that runs on its hands and its legs.

346
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,320
 He's about four feet tall and has this huge toothless mouth.

347
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,160
 Almost imagine like a giant red furry frog.

348
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,000
 He's all bristly and stuff like that.

349
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,840
 Like a frog, he does have suction cups on his fingers and his feet.

350
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,000
 He loves to hang out in trees waiting for his prey because the thing with this thing

351
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,400
 is although it's a carnivore, it can't run.

352
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,600
 It can't run fast at all.

353
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,760
 If you see one and you're able to get away from it, it will just kind of waddle after

354
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,840
 you.

355
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,400
 So that's why its main form of hunting is just sitting there.

356
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,600
 Sitting there waiting for someone to walk by.

357
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,840
 It'll sit up in the tree for a couple of days waiting for someone to wander through its

358
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,520
 forest.

359
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,000
 And what happens is, imagine this, you're walking through a forest, you're having a

360
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,920
 good time, and then all of a sudden a four foot tall creature fell on top of you.

361
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,600
 That alone is going to throw you off your game.

362
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,360
 You're just not going to expect it.

363
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,040
 If someone threw a blanket on you in the forest, that would be scary enough.

364
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,680
 But imagine this creature seems fairly heavy.

365
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,000
 I'm imagining he's like a hundred pounds, a hundred, two hundred pounds.

366
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,040
 That falling on you out of the middle of nowhere would freak you out.

367
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,200
 That's not all he does.

368
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,640
 What happens is those suction cups on his hands and his feet, they're not just for climbing,

369
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,560
 they're for sucking blood.

370
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,360
 So what he does is he puts his hands on you.

371
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,280
 I'm assuming he takes your shirt off first.

372
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,400
 He's like, ooh nice abs, you've been working out.

373
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,240
 It starts sucking the blood out through his fingers and his toes.

374
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
 You're like, ah.

375
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,080
 And as you're laying there in the dirt, this creature you didn't even know existed feeding

376
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,560
 off of your vital fluid, you're probably thinking, oh man, this can't get worse.

377
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,240
 This is what they're talking about external factors relating to depression.

378
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,520
 These creatures drink in me.

379
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,840
 But he doesn't, he's not a full on vampire, right?

380
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,680
 He doesn't drink enough of you to kill you.

381
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,120
 He just drinks enough blood from you to make you pass out.

382
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,720
 After you've passed out, something insidious happens.

383
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,440
 This little dude opens his mouth and starts to swallow you whole.

384
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:10,280
 You're like, Jason, Jason, this is another one of your creepy, your creepy vor stories.

385
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,160
 He starts, after I described you as taking your shirt off, I was like, oh, and then you

386
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,400
 get oiled up.

387
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
 You get oil, your skin's all oily and the sun.

388
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,320
 The Yara Mayahu begins to swallow you whole.

389
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,240
 It doesn't have any teeth, so it's pretty easy.

390
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,680
 Plus it can dislodge its jaw and its stomach distends.

391
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,480
 So it can swallow a full grown man.

392
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,440
 And as he's swallowing you, he gets stuck.

393
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,600
 And so this is adorable.

394
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,120
 This is the cutest thing encrypted's ever done.

395
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:48,160
 What happens is the Yara Mayahu then has to do a little dance to make you wiggle into

396
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,240
 your old boogie down in his stomach.

397
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,920
 Because you're, let's say you're 5'11", he's only four feet long, so he has to roll

398
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,600
 you up in a ball and by him doing that dance and shaking his little groove thing, you're

399
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
 sliding more into his stomach.

400
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,960
 But because his stomach distends eventually, he's still only four feet, well, I guess he

401
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
 wouldn't be four feet tall.

402
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,440
 He'd be four feet tall with a rolled up man in his stomach.

403
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,440
 So now you're being digested in his stomach.

404
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,680
 You're back to consciousness and you find yourself kind of pushing against, oh, let me

405
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,480
 out of here, let me out of here.

406
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
 You're getting sl-

407
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,640
 You're slightly aroused and you're like, give me a-

408
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,240
 You're fighting that arge, you're like, oh, please, let me go.

409
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,760
 After he's swallowed you completely, he takes a drink of water and takes a nap.

410
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,600
 So you're like chilling out in his belly and stuff like that and he's sleeping.

411
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,480
 But eventually he wakes up and then he vomits you out.

412
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:59,040
 And you just slide out of his stomach through his flush lips.

413
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,960
 I don't really have a vorfetish.

414
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,120
 It's just so funny because I get so many emails when I cover stories like this.

415
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,220
 You slide out, you're like waving goodbye, you're like bye, yara, my yahoo.

416
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,920
 You're sliding out, you're covered in puke and you're laying there on the ground in

417
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,520
 the middle of this Australian forest.

418
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,120
 And this is what makes this creature so fascinating.

419
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:24,320
 This is what makes this story so interesting is because now you have to ask yourself a

420
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
 question.

421
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,440
 This creature is feared in these areas of Australia.

422
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,960
 So the legend is well known of what happens when you run into one of these yara, my yahoo.

423
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,880
 You've just been-

424
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,640
 You had some of your blood sucked out.

425
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,960
 You've been swallowed, digested a little bit and then vomited back out.

426
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,840
 And you're fully conscious at this point.

427
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,480
 You have a choice.

428
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,880
 You can get up and just run away.

429
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,960
 The yara, my yahoo cannot chase you.

430
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
 It is so slow.

431
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,080
 It doesn't have any sort of teleportation powers.

432
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,600
 It doesn't move quicker through the trees or anything like that.

433
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,680
 It's like a trapped door spider.

434
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,880
 It waits for the prey to come to you.

435
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,120
 You can take off running.

436
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,600
 But if you get up and start running away, the yara, my yahoo will start yelling at you.

437
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,200
 As you're running away, it will yell out, "Where have you gone, my victim?"

438
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
 You just keep running.

439
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,120
 You run, run, run.

440
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,120
 And if you turn around, you'll see him waddling after you.

441
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,400
 Now if you- you can easily outrun this guy, right?

442
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,560
 If you run away, you don't get what's coming next.

443
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,680
 Because that's not all he does.

444
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,440
 Trust me, it gets worse.

445
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,760
 After he throws you up, you have the ability to run away, get up and run away.

446
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:49,120
 If you run away, what the yara, my yahoo does, he becomes enraged that his food got away.

447
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:58,160
 So he then goes all over the region and drinks up every drop of water.

448
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:09,400
 Every lake, every pond, every well built in your local community will run dry.

449
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,760
 So you've basically doomed everybody near you.

450
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
 You've destroyed them.

451
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,400
 You've destroyed the local community.

452
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,280
 If you get away from it, it will punish everybody.

453
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,960
 So knowing that, knowing that you're laying on the ground in the middle of this forest,

454
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,160
 this creature has just sucked out some of your blood and swallowed you and then did a

455
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,880
 little dance and took a nap.

456
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,280
 And now it's vomited you up knowing that would you run.

457
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,880
 Because you could be like, yeah dude, I'm just a tourist.

458
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,040
 I'm just going to hop on a plane and go back to where I'm from.

459
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
 But it would.

460
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,900
 It would drink up all the water in the area.

461
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:54,160
 So what you do if you are a team player, you just take one for the team.

462
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,720
 And the yara, my yahoo, as you're laying there, right, you're basically pretending to be unconscious.

463
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,920
 You're fully awake at this point.

464
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,640
 The yara, my yahoo will check to see if you're unconscious or even dead at this point, right?

465
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,500
 He's already digested a little bit of you.

466
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:18,160
 So he will walk up and he'll poke you with a stick and then he waddles away.

467
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,560
 And then he comes back and he tickles you.

468
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,400
 You can't do, you're half digested, the lips are all, you're smiling.

469
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,080
 He tickles you and you don't react to that.

470
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,720
 So then he walks even farther away.

471
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,660
 He walks away about 50 yards.

472
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,320
 He comes back, he tickles you more.

473
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,760
 And then once he realizes that yes, you are still unconscious and/or dead, he takes another

474
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,440
 nap.

475
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,120
 Now you figure, well, Jason, that would kind of, you're basically asking someone to run

476
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,920
 away and you're like, "Koochie, koochie, koo, you're already half digested.

477
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,520
 I mean, it's not tickling as much as it would hurt."

478
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
 Why would he do that?

479
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,360
 Why he's basically asking them to run away?

480
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,800
 Apparently, this is so bonkers.

481
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,640
 Like, in America, we have Bigfoot.

482
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,440
 This is what Australia's thing is.

483
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,140
 There's a whole ecosystem.

484
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:11,460
 If the Yaramah Yahu does not do this, so the Yaramah Yahu does not do this ritual, there

485
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:19,940
 is a spirit living in the fig trees in Australia that drives the Yaramah Yahu insane.

486
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:26,620
 It starts whispering in his ears and that whisper becomes louder and louder and louder and louder

487
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,100
 and then silence.

488
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
 Real silence.

489
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,960
 Like, all of reality has gone mute.

490
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,960
 And at that point, the Yaramah Yahu's soul leaves its body and the body just kind of

491
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,760
 falls there and turns into a patch of glowing mushrooms.

492
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,680
 So, why are you ever in Australia?

493
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,920
 Bring me home some glowing mushrooms because that's pretty dope, right?

494
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
 That's really dope.

495
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,360
 I'd have a little bit of a Yaramah Yahu in my house.

496
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,580
 I don't even know if the glowing mushrooms are real.

497
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,740
 That is now the life cycle.

498
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,180
 That is the food chain of the cryptids.

499
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,180
 Absolutely bizarre.

500
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,940
 But anyways, the Yaramah Yahu, he tickles you, pokes you with a stick, you don't react,

501
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,460
 it thinks you're unconscious.

502
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,860
 Now, the most terrifying thing of all happens.

503
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,940
 You had your choice to run away and to save yourself, but knowing that you would doom

504
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,900
 your community.

505
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,140
 So you stayed there.

506
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,200
 And then it starts to swallow you again.

507
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,920
 Awww, swallowing you.

508
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,720
 You're like, head first this time.

509
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 Woohoo!

510
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,160
 I can enjoy it even longer and I'm fully conscious.

511
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,720
 He starts to swallowing you and he's doing his little dance to kind of shuffle you into

512
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,080
 his distended belly and you're kind of just sitting in there for a bit.

513
00:28:43,080 --> 00:29:13,080
 And then he goes, "Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

514
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:32,420
 Really kind of figure out what's going on.

515
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:55,400
 You're

516
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:13,060
 in

517
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:31,100
.

518
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:37,760
 He will totally transmogrify you into this creature, living in the forest, looking for

519
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,600
 its next meal.

520
00:30:41,600 --> 00:31:03,660
 The

521
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:29,440
 one

522
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:55,900
 of

523
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:21,040
 the

524
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:47,000
 one

525
00:32:47,000 --> 00:33:12,960
 of

526
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:38,920
 the

527
00:33:38,920 --> 00:34:04,880
 one

528
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:30,840
 of the

529
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:56,800
 two

530
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:22,760
 of the

531
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:52,720
 two

532
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:18,680
 of the

533
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:44,640
 three

534
00:36:44,640 --> 00:37:10,600
 of the

535
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:32,560
 two

536
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:44,520
 of the

537
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
 three

538
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
 of the

539
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
 three

540
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
 of the

541
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
 three

542
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
 of the

543
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
 three

544
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
 of the

545
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
 three

546
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
 of the

547
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
 three
