1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
 Did a homeless man get help from a Good Samaritan or is he a singular victim of the Mandela

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
 Effect?

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,640
 And then we travel to a recording studio where a young man feverishly writes out lyrics to

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,600
 his newest album.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,760
 But these lyrics aren't coming from a creative mind.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,640
 They're coming from the Book of the Dead, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:39,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,860
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,760
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,760
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone give it up for one of

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,880
 our Christmas livestream contributors, Kamau Kokai Taylor.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,160
 Woohoo, yeah, come on in, come on in.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,760
 Kamau, Kamau, I don't even know if these people still listen to this show, right?

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,200
 They donated money back in December.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,920
 But Kamau, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,120
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or the livestream, I totally understand.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,080
 Just help spread the word about this show that helps out so much.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,720
 Kamau, let's go ahead and toss you the bunny bicycle.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,280
 We'll hop on the handlebars as you pedal us all the way out too.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
 Colorado Springs, Colorado.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,480
 I gotta come up with a better special effect than that.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
 People are like, what?

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,040
 Is my dog panting near my leg?

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,440
 Kamau's pedaling us all the way out to Colorado Springs, Colorado.

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,580
 This is a really recent paranormal conspiracy story.

28
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,040
 This all started back in June of 2022.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,840
 This guy posted this story online.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,480
 He went by the name Revolutionary25485.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,920
 I don't have his actual real name.

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,400
 We're gonna call him Cody.

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,520
 That'll be his name for this story.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,720
 And Cody is currently a homeless dude living in his car.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,840
 And he's like, you know, it kind of sucks not having a house and all that stuff.

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
 But luckily the weather's warm enough.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,200
 I can just sit in my car, kick back.

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
 I don't know if he has a job.

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,360
 Well, okay, let's put it this way.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,160
 I did go through his posting history.

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,960
 He's up to something, but we don't know what this guy's situation is.

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,760
 All we know is that he's homeless and he lives in his car.

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,160
 And he says this, he cannot explain what happened.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,640
 And I can't either.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,160
 This is absolutely fascinating.

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:35,200
 He said that his car has heavy oxidation on the car headlights.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,840
 And the passenger quarter panel, which is that piece of like fiberglass or metal or whatever

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,880
 it's made out of that goes from the headlight all the way to the passenger door.

49
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 It's like this big pan.

50
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
 I had a look at it up.

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,880
 If you guys were like Jason, we know what a quarter panel is.

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
 I was like, huh?

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,160
 I don't look it up.

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,480
 That big piece of plastic or fiberglass, whatever it's made out of steel that goes from the

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,720
 passenger side door to the headlight on the passenger side was covered in a good layer

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,640
 of dirt, dirty car, dirty headlights.

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,480
 I don't know what the state of the rest of the car was.

58
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,360
 I don't know just that part was muddy.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,480
 I don't know what the state of the rest of the car was, but that these are the parts

60
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,680
 that are important to the story.

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
 And he's aware of this, right?

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,000
 We're all pretty familiar with the bumps and scrapes and scratches of our cars.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,280
 Well one day he's walking to his car because even though he's homeless and living in his

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,480
 car, I'm sure he's like getting out to get food.

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,160
 I don't think he's cooking rotisserie chicken on the back seat.

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:46,760
 At one point back in June, he's walking around his car and he notices that the passenger side

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,920
 quarter panel is cleaned off completely.

68
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,440
 And not only is it cleaned off completely, it's brand new.

69
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,800
 Just the quarter panel.

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,600
 And then he looks and he looks at his headlight and his driver side headlight, heavy oxidation

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,160
 on it, passenger side headlight, brand new headlight.

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,800
 That whole area was replaced.

73
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,400
 And he has no idea what's happened to this.

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,000
 So what's interesting is when you look at the comments of people trying to help him,

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,600
 it makes it very clear very quickly that nobody knows what could have caused this.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,000
 Some people said, "Well, maybe you were cooking a rotisserie chicken in your car."

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,400
 They actually said, "Maybe you were breathing in too much carbon monoxide because you left

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,000
 your car on all the time."

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,360
 Because nobody knows where this guy's at.

80
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,560
 I had to figure out that he was in Colorado Springs.

81
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,240
 But he just said, "No, the place I'm at is really warm right now, so no, and gas is $5

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,240
 a gallon, so no, I'm not running my car all the time."

83
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,280
 So because people are all thinking, "Maybe it's carbon monoxide because the Post-it notes

84
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,040
 guy, that's a story about a guy who was slowly having carbon monoxide poisoning.

85
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,440
 He was leaving weird Post-it notes around his own house and he thought his house was

86
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,760
 haunted because he'd find stuff out of place, but it was really him."

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
 Bear with me with a story.

88
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,760
 It's something that people talk about all the time on ghost forums now.

89
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
 And it was weird.

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,760
 My daughter began levitating around the room and vomiting.

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,800
 And people were like, "Well, check out this theory about carbon monoxide.

92
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,480
 Yeah, yeah, I don't think all ghost accounts could be for carbon monoxide."

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,920
 And then the idea of that in relation to this means this guy was up in fumes for so long.

94
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,360
 He went to the pet boys, bought a new quarter panel, bought a new headlight, didn't remember

95
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,300
 doing either, installed them, didn't remember doing either, and then discovered them one

96
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
 day.

97
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,520
 So, I mean, I guess you can hallucinate that much.

98
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
 You're at pet boys, you're all meh, thrown up everywhere.

99
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,400
 They're like, "Ohh, sir, we'll help you.

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
 Just please stop hovering around."

101
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,480
 You have that theory, right?

102
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,680
 Which, okay, fine, that's probably the best rational theory you can come up with.

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,960
 And a bunch of people said this was just insane.

104
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,680
 They said, "Well, dude, maybe someone hit you with their car and felt really bad about

105
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,840
 it, but figured they don't want to get the insurance agents."

106
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,680
 This is a couple people who actually said this.

107
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
 This is so stupid.

108
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,880
 They said, "Maybe when you weren't in your car," because he's not in it 24/7, "Maybe

109
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,000
 when you weren't in the car," there was a car accident.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,320
 So, he crashed into your car.

111
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,880
 And instead of leaving a note saying, "Sorry, I crashed into your car, here's my insurance

112
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,400
 information," instead of getting the insurance companies involved, instead of just doing

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,360
 a hit and run, which I think is what most people did, they replaced your front quarter

114
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,640
 panel and your head of light.

115
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,680
 They did it when you weren't there.

116
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,120
 Straight up, they hit a car and they're like, "Oh, no, listen, I get the insurance involved.

117
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,360
 Luckily, I have this guy's exact car parts in the backseat of my car."

118
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,240
 And he's like, "I don't think it's been very more polite than I would have been."

119
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,280
 I was like, "You guys are all idiots."

120
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,880
 He goes, "I don't really think so.

121
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,120
 I don't know when they would have been able to replace everything.

122
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,520
 I do live in my car.

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,160
 Even though I'm not in the car all the time, you think I would have just walked by when

124
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,000
 I saw two or three guys reinstalling parts of my car."

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,720
 So he has no idea what could have caused this.

126
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,560
 And he does mention the Mandela effect as far as being part of this.

127
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,040
 Now, obviously, when we talk about these stories, it could be totally made up.

128
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:33,120
 They could, God, I would hate it if it's the start of some ARG that I got tricked into.

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,640
 But yeah, that's the story we have.

130
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,800
 What could have caused this?

131
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,520
 It definitely seems...

132
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,600
 It's one of those paranormal stories that is so mundane.

133
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,100
 I love it.

134
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,440
 It's so mundane.

135
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
 It's not like...

136
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,720
 And then he saw the three pet boys there, ghosts are floating around.

137
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,520
 They're like, "We're sorry, you're homeless.

138
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
 Homeless.

139
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
 Homeless."

140
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
 They fade away.

141
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,040
 It's like, I mean, like, actually, we would have been pretty brazen out of thinking about

142
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
 it.

143
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,920
 I do like extreme ghost stories as well.

144
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,640
 But it has to be one of the two.

145
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,920
 It has to be so insane that you can't believe it.

146
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,960
 Or so mundane, you think, "Why would someone lie about this?"

147
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,440
 This is just one of those little mysteries.

148
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,280
 Like, who replaced his front quarter panel and his headlights?

149
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,800
 Brand new headlight, right?

150
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
 Brand new front quarter panel.

151
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
 So who knows?

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,640
 He brings up the Mandela effect.

153
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,600
 I mean, at a certain point, what would your options be?

154
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,880
 Mandela effect, quantum death, right?

155
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,600
 He died in one reality and shifted into another reality.

156
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,480
 That's exactly the same.

157
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,160
 He's still homeless, but this time he has a new quarter panel and a new headlight.

158
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,640
 I mean, what could it be?

159
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,680
 I mean, I'm like, when we look at the lore, I can't think of anything else outside of

160
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,560
 those two, right?

161
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,880
 Cern firing up.

162
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,400
 We all went to the headlight universe this time instead of some big change.

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,600
 It's a little change like that.

164
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,400
 So I wanted to find out more about this guy.

165
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,200
 I always like to do this when I'm able to.

166
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,960
 I was looking through his posting history.

167
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,720
 He's only posted about two things, technically three, but two or three things.

168
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,160
 The first one being his car.

169
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,400
 He posted about this a couple of times.

170
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,800
 And then you can look at all this in the show notes.

171
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:22,000
 And then he posted on two other subreddits where he was trying to get laid.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,040
 So I mean, I guess he has priorities in order, right?

173
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
 He's living on the streets.

174
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
 He's living in his car.

175
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,840
 The universe may be slowly repairing his vehicle.

176
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,040
 And then he's trying to have oral sex with some girl who goes by the name unlucky hedgehog.

177
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,880
 Dude, don't roll the dice on that one.

178
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,760
 Do not roll the dice on that one.

179
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,120
 That's how I found out he was in Colorado Springs because he was commenting on subreddits

180
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,960
 for Colorado Springs, like sexy springers or something like that, or ColoradoSpringsHookups.com,

181
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,120
 wherever it was.

182
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,360
 That is where our intrepid Mandela adventure is also spending his time.

183
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,640
 So be safe, young traveler.

184
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,240
 And then with the car part, who knows what that could possibly be?

185
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,640
 Like what, how could you explain that?

186
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,160
 If I had to guess a theory, I would say quantum death, right?

187
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,200
 Where you shift into another, you die and then you shift into another universe that's

188
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,120
 almost unrecognizable from the one that you're in.

189
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,080
 But I don't even know if I'm a huge believer in that.

190
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,020
 I'm intrigued by the theory, but I don't know if I'm a huge believer in that.

191
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,040
 So who knows?

192
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,200
 It's truly a mystery what happened to this dude's car.

193
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
 And will it happen again?

194
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,320
 I'll keep looking at his posts and they're watching.

195
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,120
 They just all be swinging your posts from here on.

196
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,720
 I'm like, oh man, I'm still checking.

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 Come out.

198
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,360
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

199
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,760
 We're leaving behind Colorado Springs, Colorado.

200
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,920
 We're going to head all the way out to a recording studio.

201
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,920
 I found this story the other day on the X board.

202
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,880
 There was a post about a band called the Mars Volta and a cursed album they were working

203
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,240
 on.

204
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,160
 And I actually have all the notes for that story as well.

205
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,040
 I had to make a choice though.

206
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,920
 I had to make a choice between doing a full segment on the Mars Volta cursed album.

207
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
 What was it called again?

208
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,560
 Like walking towards Goliath or Trouble in Goliath?

209
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,960
 Bedlam in Goliath was the name of that album.

210
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:36,120
 I read a bunch of articles about it and listened to a couple of their songs and wrote up a

211
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,680
 detailed thing about their cursed album, Bedlam in Goliath.

212
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,360
 But I've decided to tell this story instead.

213
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,120
 This story was posted in relation to that X board post.

214
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,680
 Someone goes, you know what?

215
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
 Something like this happened to me and they wrote this down.

216
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,880
 I had to choose between the two and I figured the Mars Volta story and who knows, maybe

217
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
 we'll cover it in the future.

218
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,640
 They're just so similar.

219
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,440
 They're almost beat for beat and I would rather cover the one that's more obscure.

220
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
 The Mars Volta one.

221
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,960
 If you're a fan of the Mars Volta then you're probably familiar with this story.

222
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,880
 If you're not, I'll put some links in the show notes of this episode so you can research

223
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
 it.

224
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,400
 But the story I'm about to tell you has been told basically twice ever on the internet.

225
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,880
 The guy said I talked about this a couple of months ago and I didn't, nobody really

226
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,720
 cared, nobody really cared, right?

227
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
 Nobody really cared.

228
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
 Who's this dude?

229
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,560
 And then he told the story again on this Mars Volta thread.

230
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,960
 So I wanted to cover this one because this one will just disappear into the ether.

231
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,320
 The Mars Volta one is pretty well documented.

232
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,920
 Some people say it was just a publicity stunt.

233
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,040
 Who knows?

234
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,440
 This one I like because it's not a publicity stunt because we don't know any of the people,

235
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,840
 we don't know the name of the album, we don't even know where the story took place.

236
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,560
 But let's go ahead and get this story started.

237
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,040
 Maybe someday I'll do the Mars Volta but again it's almost beat for beat the same story because

238
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,800
 I would imagine if both stories are true they would follow the same pattern.

239
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,400
 Or coming into contact with any sort of cursed media would probably follow along the same

240
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
 path.

241
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,160
 Let's get this story started here.

242
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,440
 Back in 1977 there was a book published called The Necromonon.

243
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,840
 It was originally a fiction, just a brief overview here.

244
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,200
 A lot of you guys may be familiar with this but originally HP Lovecraft as a narrative

245
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:33,480
 device in his stories and his shared universe, the HPU, he created this book called The Necromonon

246
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,380
 that could be used to contact the Elder Gods and had all these dark rituals that the followers

247
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:44,080
 of Cthulhu and Blacky Cactoon and Yen Slaku Gun, all those dudes, right?

248
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,360
 Probably just summoned one or two.

249
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,560
 This is how you got ahold of them.

250
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,600
 This is basically their cell phone, The Necromonon.

251
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,920
 And he totally made it up.

252
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
 He's very very clear, yeah, I made it up.

253
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,800
 There's nothing to it.

254
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,080
 There's no real Necromonon and HP Lovecraft for years would be contacted by people asking

255
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,240
 where he got it or where they can get a copy and he'd be like, it's fake, what are you

256
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
 talking about?

257
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
 So of course eventually someone's going to publish a book called The Necromonon.

258
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,200
 In 1977 there was a book called The Necromonon and generally it's referred to as Simon Necromonon

259
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,240
 because it was written by a, well, I suppose it would be a brief overview, but again I

260
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,880
 want to let you guys know how this book was crafted here.

261
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,840
 So there was a guy who supposedly was named Simon who gathered up all of these spells

262
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,800
 and these rituals and found the Journal of the Mad Arab and put all this stuff together

263
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,680
 and published it as the Necromonon, but people were like, the Necromonon doesn't exist.

264
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,800
 But this supposedly was the real Necromonon.

265
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,480
 You can buy it at like a Barnes and Noble or an Amazon.

266
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,000
 I got my copy at like a bookstore in the mall.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,920
 Like what were the, I don't even remember, Walden Books is where you could buy them anywhere

268
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,040
 but it was supposed to be this dark book of the dead.

269
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,600
 These spells could actually summon.

270
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,280
 The dark ones, I don't think Walden Books had anything legit like that, right?

271
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,440
 Well what's interesting about this is it has been called a hoax because people can, we

272
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,080
 know the Necromonon doesn't exist.

273
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,240
 This book doesn't exist.

274
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,760
 HP Lovecraft made up the character of the Mad Arab, but you're saying you found a Journal

275
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,240
 of a Fictional Character that would be like finding the Journal of R2D2, right?

276
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,400
 It doesn't exist and they believe that Simon was a fictional character.

277
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,600
 It was written by a guy named Peter LeVenda who was an occult history author and that

278
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,960
 he created Simon, he created this whole thing.

279
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,680
 Now that's the, when I read it I knew going, and I didn't read it, it was super boring,

280
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,360
 but when I bought it and read the first couple pages, I knew that it was fictional.

281
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,240
 A lot of people who get it, I'd say most people who buy it know that it's fictional, but nowadays

282
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,760
 people go, here's the thing, with a lot of grim walls, these books of collections of

283
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:06,280
 spells, basically they are just collections of spells, right?

284
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,080
 And some might be real and some might be fake and this is the tradition that there's always

285
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
 been.

286
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,760
 And so there are some sources that say yes, the Mad Arab is fake and Simon is fake and

287
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,600
 a lot of the Necromonon, the book that you buy at the bookstore is fake, however some

288
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,840
 of the rituals are real because that is the ancient way of collecting these things.

289
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,160
 Do you think Peter actually sat down and made up ritual after ritual after ritual or did

290
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,640
 he just include some?

291
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,000
 There's been accounts of plagiarism and all sorts of stuff.

292
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,480
 But in general the book is considered a work of fiction.

293
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,120
 So I wanted to be very clear on that because this fictional book is going to have some

294
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,360
 real life consequences and what's really interesting is the people in this story also believe the

295
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,840
 book's fictional for a while.

296
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,640
 Let's take a look at the story, this guy's name, we don't know it, right?

297
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,960
 He posted this anonymously on the X-board, we're going to call him Philip.

298
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,960
 And he's at work and his co-worker's reading a copy of the Necromonon, I don't know where

299
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,440
 they're working where you can just be in the break room, you're feet up on a table and

300
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,920
 you're like oh you need to sacrifice 11 men for the dagger of Tiamet.

301
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,280
 Oh that's why they didn't work, I only sacrificed 10.

302
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,320
 He's reading the book, the co-worker's reading the book Necromonon and Philip showed a little

303
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,440
 bit of an intro, hello what are you reading over there man?

304
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,600
 And they started talking about it, co-worker goes you want it?

305
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,880
 Which probably might, probably what I would say too because it was super boring, here

306
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
 you want it?

307
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,760
 And I was like yeah sure you know, I'll take it and he starts reading over the next couple

308
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,320
 of days, couple of weeks.

309
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,640
 And he goes you know he's just reading it casually, it's fictional, he knows it's fictional,

310
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,720
 doesn't really take it seriously but it's a fun read, it kind of takes you into this

311
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,640
 world where these things may exist.

312
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,840
 And he said one day I was out reading it, there was a man, he walked by with his family,

313
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,800
 he goes this guy was a total wasp man, not like a big old bug when he's like oh no I

314
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,760
 have some of the dark ones.

315
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,080
 Wasp is an old term, just by him using the term wasp, I bet you this guy's as old as

316
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,320
 I am, it's white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, it was an old slang term for basically leave

317
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,920
 it to beaver type dudes right?

318
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,920
 Very clean cut, looks like they go to church twice a week, wasps, I don't think they use

319
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,160
 that term anymore, I could be wrong.

320
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,240
 But anyways he goes this real waspy looking guy walked by.

321
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,160
 The man turns, looks at Philip and asks, Philip's reading this book, the man goes so what are

322
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
 you reading?

323
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
 And there's something about the book called his eye right?

324
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,760
 And Philip goes oh the necromanon.

325
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,200
 And that's when the man, he turned to his wife and his kid and says hey why don't you

326
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,080
 guys keep on walking, why don't you guys just go somewhere, go somewhere else, go check

327
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,680
 on the millions of eggs you laid honey.

328
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:59,400
 And so they walk away and he turns back to Phil and goes hey that book, that's a very

329
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,920
 powerful book that you have.

330
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,320
 I want you to be aware of that.

331
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:12,880
 If you open yourself up to that book, bad things are going to happen so just be careful.

332
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,000
 And the man walks away.

333
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,960
 And that actually energized Phil, that made him want to read the book any more serious

334
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,200
 fashion because again it would be like if someone walked up to you while you were reading

335
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,680
 the Hobbit and they go hey you're not going a long journey anytime soon, a town might burn

336
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
 down.

337
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
 And then they walk away.

338
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,280
 It would be weird.

339
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,800
 You know that it's fictional but here this guy is stopping and sending his family away

340
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,560
 so he can have this conversation with you, very short conversation.

341
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,360
 So Phil decides to actually start taking the book more seriously.

342
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,160
 He decides to pretend that it's real.

343
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,280
 He begins practicing some of the rituals.

344
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:59,680
 He begins to what his friends could only describe as become obsessed with the necromanon.

345
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,960
 And even he would use that term.

346
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,680
 I was obsessed with it.

347
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:12,200
 He finished the book and then he re-read it and then he re-read it again and he's pretending

348
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
 that it's real.

349
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,600
 Like what would happen if I actually believed any of this was real?

350
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,480
 He got lost in the words of the necromanon.

351
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,760
 Now there's a time jump in this story.

352
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,240
 He says there's a good period of time where he's kind of moved away from he's no longer

353
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,960
 wearing the cloak to work.

354
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,000
 He's no longer burning candles in the break room.

355
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,880
 He's kind of past the stage where he was obsessed with the necromanon.

356
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,000
 And one of his friends casually brings up one day they go "Hey, dude, remember when you

357
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,960
 used to read that book all the time?"

358
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,880
 Phil's eyes turn red.

359
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
 The book.

360
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,560
 You call it simply a book.

361
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,320
 Phil goes "Oh yeah dude, the necromanon.

362
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,800
 Yeah, I used to read that all the time."

363
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
 And the friend goes "Yeah, you were acting really weird back then."

364
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,880
 I remember once he said you could talk to the stars.

365
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,240
 He goes "It was weird because when he said a good enough period of time passed because

366
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,880
 he goes when my friend said that to me it sounded super cringe."

367
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,720
 He goes "I had totally forgotten about that.

368
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,160
 That sounds like some cringy stuff that I would have said back then but like when he

369
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,320
 said that I was like "Oh that's super like edge lord."

370
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:23,760
 But at the same time he had forgotten that he said stuff like that but once his friend

371
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,800
 said that he goes "Oh dude, I do not only remember telling you that, I remember believing

372
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,000
 it.

373
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,160
 Like I was really into the necromanon wasn't I?"

374
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,480
 His friend's like "Yeah dude, the chow glad that you can now be aware of that.

375
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,400
 It's kind of spooky."

376
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,200
 And around that same time so this dude, he's a musician.

377
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,800
 He's like plays guitar, he plays bass, plays piano and he's a vocalist.

378
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,400
 He's kind of like all in one type of dude.

379
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,760
 And it sounded like he was either a musician before this and he had a lot of musician friends.

380
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,000
 I don't know if he was in a touring band or anything like that or he just played on the

381
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,440
 weekends but he goes "Around the same time that my friend brought up this story about

382
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,600
 me saying I could talk to the stars, he goes "An album, an idea for an album popped in

383
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
 my head.

384
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,640
 I called up a buddy of mine who owns a studio and says "Hey man, do you mind if I get some

385
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
 studio time?

386
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,140
 I got a really cool idea for an album."

387
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,760
 And it's like "Yeah, sure, no problem right?"

388
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,040
 And he says he has a process when he is writing songs but when he started writing these songs

389
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,200
 the lyrics are just coming out of nowhere.

390
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,840
 He said he was writing songs quicker than he ever did and when he would look back at

391
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,120
 the lyrics he goes "These lyrics don't even make sense."

392
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,560
 It's like gibberish.

393
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,080
 He described the lyrics as both whimsical and bizarre.

394
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,480
 And he doesn't, even though he's writing them down, he doesn't really understand what they

395
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,960
 mean.

396
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,080
 And then when he's going into the studio all of the songs have been written now.

397
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,400
 He goes in the studio, he goes "The arrangements completely fell into place."

398
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,760
 He goes "I've recorded albums before, I know how long these processes normally take and

399
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,920
 this went incredibly fast."

400
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,720
 Like far quicker than he could have ever imagined.

401
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,720
 Everything was falling into place.

402
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,480
 And then, this is another detail that he didn't really remember at the time that his friend

403
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,680
 had to, his friend who owned the studio had to tell him like "Dude, what in the world was

404
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,320
 going on back then?"

405
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,960
 He said apparently that he kept insisting on having these small little details, these

406
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,520
 small little notes and noises inserted into the music.

407
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,600
 And the studio friend's like "Uh, okay."

408
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,000
 And like he, they would do a take and they'd put that little noise in.

409
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,040
 And the friend's like "You couldn't even hear it."

410
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,640
 Like you couldn't hear what was being added in.

411
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,080
 But Phil kept demanding to put in all these little strange, not like demonic growls or

412
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,760
 anything like that, but just like odd notes and noises laid into the track.

413
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
 And again Phil didn't remember doing this stuff.

414
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,000
 This is something the friend mentioned after the album is completed.

415
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,840
 He goes "You were super insistent on having these little noises put in."

416
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,320
 And whenever I asked about him, whenever the friend of the studio owner asked about, so

417
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,000
 wait, wait, wait, why are we putting in that noise?

418
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,120
 And then Phil would get incredibly angry.

419
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,280
 Okay, sorry, I just was wondering, okay.

420
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,240
 The friend goes "You couldn't even hear that the noises and notes were in there."

421
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,760
 And I couldn't even ask about him.

422
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,040
 You'd flip out.

423
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,320
 Now at this point, the album's near completion.

424
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,880
 They have these songs that feels like "Dude, these songs are amazing."

425
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,120
 Let's start practicing to do a live show, right?

426
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
 We'll do a live show, we'll drop the album, it'll just be this big thing.

427
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,240
 Now again, I don't think this was like a major label release.

428
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,120
 I don't even know if this was supposed to be a commercial release.

429
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,640
 This could have been an artistic release.

430
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,680
 They were only going to press like a hundred albums.

431
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,480
 We're not for sure on the details like that.

432
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,200
 Like was he a full-time musician?

433
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,920
 Was he a gig musician?

434
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,960
 Was this the album of the lifetime or just one of 50 albums he's done?

435
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,320
 We don't know all of those details, right?

436
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,400
 But we do know that he, Phil, is now getting together some of his friends.

437
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,320
 They're going to perform the album live.

438
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,560
 The night of the very first practice, Phil has his guitar on, the rest of the band's

439
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,880
 assembled.

440
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:28,520
 As they're practicing these songs, Phil screams out loud in pain.

441
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,760
 Everyone's totally freaking out.

442
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,840
 He screams out loud in pain and he drops his guitar and his guitar breaks when it hits

443
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,520
 the ground.

444
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,240
 And everyone's like, "What in the world happened?"

445
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,480
 And he turns around, he goes, "Something just scratched me.

446
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,120
 Something just scratched the hell out of my back."

447
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,100
 And he turned around and he pulled his shirt up.

448
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:55,960
 And sure enough, he has these huge scratches all over his back.

449
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,880
 Now obviously, we're doing a live show yet, this wasn't a fan running up on stage scratching

450
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
 him.

451
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,280
 Totally freaked everyone out.

452
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,680
 Most of all, Phil, right?

453
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,400
 There's no one in there who could possibly scratch his back.

454
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,640
 They get weirded out by it.

455
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,160
 He gets weirded out by it.

456
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,920
 And they call quits the rehearsal.

457
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,560
 And also, he broke his guitar.

458
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
 He goes, "I did not have the money for a new guitar."

459
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,440
 That makes me think he's more of like a gig musician, right?

460
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,880
 Because I know a lot of gig musicians and that happens.

461
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
 They got to wait a while.

462
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,680
 He goes, "I couldn't get a new guitar and I also got scratched by some paranormal force."

463
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,680
 So we're not going to be doing a live show anytime soon.

464
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:42,560
 And the very next day, Phil gets a phone call from his friend at the studio.

465
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,880
 And in a very embarrassed tone, because the friend is a professional, right?

466
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:56,080
 The friend goes, "Hey, I don't know how to put this, but the album's gone."

467
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,800
 Phil's like, "What are you talking about?"

468
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,960
 He goes, "They're gone.

469
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,480
 I'm looking at the hard drives.

470
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,840
 The files are gone.

471
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,400
 Everything we recorded is completely gone."

472
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,360
 And Phil feels a wave of depression kind of hit him, right?

473
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,440
 This is something he'd been working.

474
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,600
 He was like his...again, he wasn't claiming this to be his masterpiece, so that was going

475
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
 to be the album that defined him.

476
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,960
 But he was still something he worked on for a long period of time, right?

477
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,640
 And although he was having fun hanging out with his friends, stuff like that, it's hard

478
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,120
 work.

479
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
 And he felt really deflated.

480
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,800
 And at that point, he goes, "You know what?

481
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,960
 I don't have the energy in it to rerecord all that stuff."

482
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
 Whatever.

483
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,960
 And the friend's like, "You sure?"

484
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah.

485
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
 We're just going to drop it.

486
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,040
 We're not going to finish that album."

487
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,960
 He goes, "Around the same time, you know, I gave up on the album."

488
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,240
 He goes, "At the same time, I moved."

489
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,000
 And he said, "When we moved, my copy of the Necromonon went missing as well."

490
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,560
 And he goes, "At that point, I'd really lost interest in it."

491
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,720
 Like, there was a time where I wasn't rereading it over and over again.

492
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,960
 But I just dealt with it, right?

493
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,400
 I just dealt with it.

494
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,160
 And I think in the way that he has it set up, you know, he obviously doesn't think anything

495
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,000
 of the Necromonon, or he's casually interested in it, but it's a work of fiction that got

496
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,440
 the guy inspired him, which was not what the dude wanted to do.

497
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,960
 He wanted to be careful.

498
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,680
 The guy inspired him to take it seriously.

499
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,080
 He begins to take it incredibly seriously, reading it, reading it, reading it, reading

500
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,120
 it, and starts saying cringey things and starts having weird beliefs that people around them

501
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,560
 are getting a little worried.

502
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,400
 And then it does seem like he's not so obsessed with it for a while, but the mere mention

503
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,120
 of the book again inspires him to write this album, which I think the idea is it is still

504
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,880
 influenced by the Necromonon.

505
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,720
 The album, all of the ability to write these whimsical lyrics, but they are super bizarre.

506
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
 They didn't make sense.

507
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,280
 The album coming together so quickly.

508
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,440
 The insertion of these little sounds and signs.

509
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,000
 I think the push to the story is that that is also the Necromonon working through the

510
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 album.

511
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,520
 He never really says, well, you know, I wrote the lyrics about the Necromonon.

512
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,960
 I was taking rituals from the Necromonon and turning them into lyrics.

513
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,440
 But that is kind of implied, right?

514
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,560
 And from his point of view, it seems to be that that's how he sees it, right?

515
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,400
 The mere mention of his phase.

516
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,080
 What's interesting in his narrative, he doesn't say I was rereading the Necromonon over and

517
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,600
 over and over and over again up until the time I was recording it.

518
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,900
 And I'm in the recording studio.

519
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,920
 But I think the idea is that the recording process was influenced by the Necromonon.

520
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,960
 He pushed himself too far, too fast in a fictional book, but turned it real.

521
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,280
 And the story's not over yet.

522
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,840
 I'm just doing a little analysis right now, right?

523
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,560
 We still got a little choice dending.

524
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,960
 But the Necromonon influenced this album, and that's why it fit together so well.

525
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,000
 And he was doing stuff he didn't remember, right?

526
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,260
 This is very creepy.

527
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,360
 That's almost like a possession.

528
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,360
 But so he moves on with his life, though.

529
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,520
 He's like, whatever, the Necromonon inspired me to write this album where the very least

530
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,320
 was an underlying influence.

531
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,840
 But I lost it and I lost interest in the album and I'm gone.

532
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,280
 He finishes his story like this, though.

533
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:22,680
 This takes place a time afterwards after he moved away and after the album disappeared.

534
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:31,040
 He says, quote, "That friend with the studio actually died in a pretty brutal way."

535
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,920
 And it happened several years later when we got together again and decided to attempt

536
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,960
 the entire album again.

537
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:47,600
 Not just a coincidence, but it left me feeling pretty messed up.

538
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,200
 It's a fascinating story, obviously, about cursed media, lost media, what was going on

539
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,240
 with this album.

540
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,960
 Was it truly inspired by a fictional book that elements of it may be true?

541
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,800
 Or is it the case of this young man who actually believed it was so true that he's connected

542
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,320
 a bunch of coincidences together?

543
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,920
 Things happen with technology, files disappear, people die.

544
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,800
 These are all things that happen and is it possible that a narrative has been completed

545
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,600
 because it borders so close on the paranormal he's putting together paranormal events?

546
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,680
 Or was it a real-life cursed album?

547
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,800
 Was this album actually influenced by demons?

548
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:39,240
 One thing I find really interesting is let's step back for a second and get kind of meta

549
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,880
 with this whole thing of spooky albums of cursed media.

550
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,520
 I've been thinking about this story a lot.

551
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,560
 If you haven't noticed the audio has changed, I've been thinking about it.

552
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,920
 This is a couple days later I'm recording this part.

553
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,560
 Let's play this out for a second because this is kind of the way that these stories go.

554
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
 Demon?

555
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,760
 Boy meets girl.

556
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
 Demon meets the demon.

557
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:08,320
 Demon or demonically influenced music, media, haunted recording, haunted movie is created.

558
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:17,320
 And yet this media is almost always lost or destroyed.

559
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,760
 Demon meets a willing victim, right?

560
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,360
 A demon influences an artist to create the art.

561
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,080
 The artist created and then the art becomes lost.

562
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,280
 That's how this story always plays out.

563
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:37,320
 Which again makes you think that not necessarily this guy's story is made up but every other

564
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,000
 story involving the same things are made up, right?

565
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,280
 Well the album created by the Mars Volta that got released and is actually critically acclaimed.

566
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,160
 But for the most part, right, and there are people who think the Mars Volta thing that

567
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,120
 was just a marketing thing that they came up with.

568
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,320
 But for the most part when we talk about movies like Babylon Rising or whatever it was that

569
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,200
 was supposedly haunted, it came out and nobody watched it.

570
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,920
 We hear these other albums that come out like this guy's, it doesn't get released.

571
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,800
 When we look at the history of these demonically created works of art, they seem to fall to

572
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,160
 the wayside.

573
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,320
 So my question is this, my question is this, why?

574
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,480
 Why?

575
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,640
 Because if you were a demon and your goal was to create a piece of art, a haunted art,

576
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,200
 right, cursed art, anyone involved in the process of this they're going to go mad or

577
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,480
 die, right?

578
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,680
 The idea is that if this piece of art got out, you know, it was deleted from the computer,

579
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,400
 it could never be recovered and then when they talked about doing it again, the guy died,

580
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,480
 the studio dude died.

581
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,480
 So why?

582
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,760
 Why would a demon put so much work into an album and then curse it so much that it never

583
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,920
 gets created?

584
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,720
 So that's my question.

585
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
 That's my question.

586
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
 Why?

587
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,280
 You think that now that they've had this willing victim craft this piece, wouldn't it have

588
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:10,360
 been in the demon's benefit to, I don't know, not kill the studio engineer or delete the

589
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
 files?

590
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,880
 Like wouldn't it have been in that demon's benefit to have that album released?

591
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,880
 Never had it had 50 listeners or 50,000 listeners.

592
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,040
 It's still extra souls for the demon to corrupt.

593
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,960
 These weird sounds that are being laid underneath the audio track.

594
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,480
 People hearing those over and over and over again that demonic influence is now coming

595
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,320
 to them with a snappy tune laid over it.

596
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,720
 Why isn't the stuff being widely distributed?

597
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,080
 It's, we talk, did I don't know, I've lost it or I've lost the order of episodes.

598
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,000
 I'm going to do an upcoming episode about the Illuminati's influence in the music business,

599
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 right?

600
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And those get released, right?

601
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,480
 Your Yana's new album comes out.

602
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,080
 Charlie XCX's new album comes out, has all this satanic Illuminati-esque imagery, and

603
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
 those get released.

604
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:03,080
 But wouldn't it have been in the demon's best interest to get this album released?

605
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,600
 And if so, why did they kill the engineer if that's the story, you know, if that's the

606
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
 connection?

607
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
 Why did they kill the engineer?

608
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,840
 Why did they erase the files?

609
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,000
 That's what I don't understand about this story.

610
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,720
 Because the Mars Volta story, it's the same thing.

611
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,360
 They're influenced by this dark person known as Goliath.

612
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,200
 It's like three different personalities formed into one named Goliath, and he's dictating

613
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
 the album.

614
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,040
 Or this album is about what Goliath is saying through the use of the spirit board, but they

615
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,480
 keep running into problems too.

616
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,640
 The studio gets flooded, the files disappear off the computer.

617
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,000
 It's all of this stuff.

618
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,600
 The engineer at one point takes all of his notes and says, "You guys are going to unleash

619
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,680
 something dark upon the world, and I don't want to have anything to do with it."

620
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,640
 So they had to start the process over from scratch.

621
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,120
 Why would the demons sabotage their own album?

622
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,400
 And I don't really have an answer for that.

623
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,840
 Like I said, I've been thinking about it for the past probably week.

624
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,000
 I'm adding this on way late in the game, and I just can't come up with an answer.

625
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,640
 Why would the demons create an album and then sabotage it?

626
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,440
 Or is the sabotage coming from a higher power?

627
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,920
 Is it not the demons are deleting it from the computer?

628
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
 Is it God?

629
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,480
 Because he's like, "I don't want that getting out there."

630
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,160
 But then it opens the question, then what about all the...

631
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,160
 This one have like little hidden audio tracks underneath a layer of music.

632
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,440
 You have music videos with straight up satanic imagery.

633
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,040
 Those get released.

634
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,800
 I also don't know why God would brutally kill the studio engineer, right?

635
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,360
 He could have just, I don't know, give him a flat tire on the way to the studio.

636
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,120
 And he goes, "I don't want to record anymore."

637
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
 Anything, right?

638
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,720
 There's a lot of stuff in between getting them to not do the album again and brutally

639
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,900
 murdering somebody.

640
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,900
 So why?

641
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,560
 It doesn't seem like it's the most...

642
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,320
 The original ending was like dark and spooky.

643
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,560
 Like I normally do.

644
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,120
 It kind of was like, "So the next time you're recording a cursed album, watch out!"

645
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,120
 One of those endings, but I thought more about it and I just don't understand the why of

646
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
 this story.

647
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:06,560
 I believe, I'll accept the belief that demons were a part of this recording process, that

648
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,920
 this guy went so deep into the world of darkness.

649
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,120
 That he started to believe that these spells were real and maybe some of them are.

650
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,480
 And he was putting them into the lyrics.

651
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,040
 I'll accept all that.

652
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,760
 And I accept that the files were getting deleted and you had this string of bad luck.

653
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,320
 I just don't understand why the demons would put so much work into an album.

654
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,400
 And then sabotage it.

655
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,680
 And if they didn't, who did?

656
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,400
 But a fascinating story nonetheless.

657
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,960
 A story that ends not on a spooky ending, but on an open question.

658
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,600
 Why would this happen?

659
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:48,720
 What would the demons have to gain by creating an album and then deleting it?

660
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,920
 I guess the only way to know is to craft a demonic album or so.

661
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
 Don't do that.

662
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,680
 I probably shouldn't even joke about that.

663
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,920
 I do not understand it.

664
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,400
 But the world of the paranormal is not for me to understand all the time, right?

665
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
 That's why it's paranormal.

666
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,880
 Why doesn't it follow along the line of normal questions?

667
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,560
 Fascinating story nonetheless.

668
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,240
