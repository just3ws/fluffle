1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 Is there a magical elixir that can elevate us to a new consciousness?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,440
 And you know that famous Bigfoot video, the famous Bigfoot video of the Bigfoot walking away,

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,960
 turns to the camera and looks? Is it possible that that Bigfoot was walking away from the scene

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,920
 of a Bigfoot massacre today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,040
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. We have a lot of stuff to

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,040
 cover today. I'm just gonna jump right into this. Our next story, what we're gonna do, is we are

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,960
 going to talk about Ormus. Now Ormus is something that you've never heard of, most likely. It can't

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:58,400
 be tested scientifically. It's all around us. And some people call it mana from heaven. Some people

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:06,640
 call it Cleopatra's milk, I think. I think someone called to that. It is this elixir that you take

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,040
 into your body and it enlightens you spiritually. It aligns, I don't, if it doesn't align your chakras,

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,560
 it aligns a hell of a lot more than that. It can actually like bring you to a point.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,640
 It can bring you to a point where you can astrally project while you sleep, not just dream,

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:35,360
 but project, float around. All you need to do is make it yourself. Or you can conveniently buy it

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,120
 at retailers all over the internet, the most trusted source to buy things, to put into your body.

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:51,760
 Yes, a website, most likely created by Squarespace, that is selling you something that you ingest

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:59,920
 into your body that they claim science has no idea what it is. Yes, we are climbing down the

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:10,080
 Ormus hole. So what actually is Ormus? The explanation is, not even they really know. The people who

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:18,560
 sell Ormus seem to be very, very unclear on what this stuff is. The scientific claim that they make

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:28,240
 is it is monoatomic. So it's any element, most like it's usually gold, but it's any element

21
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,560
 broken down to a single atom. Okay, so it makes it so small that it's invisible to science. And I

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,800
 thought atoms were visible to science, but apparently not. And then you break an element down to one

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,160
 atom. And then step two, I don't know. And then step three, you eat it and you gain spiritual

24
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,080
 enlightenment. It helps align both sides of your brain, because brains aren't built to do that anyways.

25
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,120
 It gives you energy, gives you a calm and focused mind, stuff that wouldn't occur any other way

26
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,640
 unless you took this element apparently. So you go, Jason, I don't have gold and I don't have the

27
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,520
 way to break it down to a single element. And like I said, hey man, just buy it online. That's

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:20,480
 what a lot of people are doing. But there's another way you can do it. You can make this Ormus,

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:29,680
 this miracle mineral yourself. You can make it yourself. I can't believe this. Let's listen

30
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,240
 to this quick clip from this YouTube video explaining to us how to make what they know as

31
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:45,600
 the philosopher's stone, this pure magic, this pure height of alchemy. Okay, listen. First off,

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,640
 I can barely hear what the YouTube video is saying and that's, I get that. That's fine. It's on YouTube.

33
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,400
 The quality is not always perfect. But you're giving me a recipe that involves lie, drinking

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,440
 lie and it is one of the most vague recipes possible. Get some salt, boil some water,

35
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,520
 put some lye in it, maybe some vinegar. Let's sit around for a while and then drink it. No.

36
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:21,600
 Don't do that guys. Don't ever, first off, don't get a recipe off of YouTube that involves a lie.

37
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,760
 That's step one. Step two, don't drink this stuff. And you go, okay Jason, I don't want to use this

38
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,680
 YouTube recipe. There has to be another way for me to get Ormus. There is. You can make it out of

39
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,960
 your own urine. See what happens is we piss out all of these minerals that are so useful to us.

40
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,320
 And using proper chemicals, lie included, you can get the minerals, those precious minerals you

41
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,720
 just peed out and drink it again. And this website has photos, photos of a man holding various stages

42
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:05,040
 of his urine as it's becoming more and more cloudy and white. He's like, I'm not going to buy your

43
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:13,120
 store bought Ormus. Ormus coming from my bladder is far more potent and you should get it from

44
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,280
 your bladder too. Here, here's a couple photos of watching my urine get old.

45
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,840
 Listen, I get it. I take multivitamins. I take my little rose droplets to give me energy.

46
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,880
 I get it. We want to have that quick fix that little, you know, maybe for some people to caffeine,

47
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,840
 some people it is vitamin C or emergency or whatever. I take my vitamins every single day.

48
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,080
 I feel like it keeps me healthy and gives me energy. Guys, if what you are, if you are buying

49
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,160
 something to put in your body and they are telling you that science does not know what it is,

50
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,080
 don't do it. If people are telling you you can make your own with lie, don't do it. And please,

51
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,200
 don't drink your urine. I looked up Ormus. I found out about Ormus because someone said,

52
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,400
 you know, you can get healthy from drinking your own urine. Like it's actually beneficial to drink

53
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,840
 your own urine because you're pissing out all of these minerals. And I was like, what? And then

54
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,040
 that let me down the rabbit hole that yes, there are a lot of people, a lot of people to, enough

55
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,760
 that there are competing competitors selling all these Ormus products. It's not just one thing.

56
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,840
 There's even, even if you believed in this stuff, that if you can break something down to a single

57
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,280
 atom and then step, step, step, you drink it, I think there's, it's so vague. Generally, it's like,

58
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,120
 you can break something down with single atom here, we sell these pills. What? How did you get

59
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,920
 the pills from the single atom? Because then it's just a bunch of atoms again. You're, I'm swallowing

60
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:52,880
 a piece of gold. They say you can get it from salt. And it's like phosphate and stuff like that.

61
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,200
 But you have to use the lie. And you can drink your own urine. Even if you believed all that stuff,

62
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,680
 even if you believed you were able to break down something to a, you can, but if you,

63
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
 somehow, okay, yeah, I'm not going to quibble. Let's say that even you believed that and it was

64
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:15,280
 some sort of magical property. There is a website that is selling a digital version of this, a digital

65
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:26,880
 mono atomic Ormus thing. So you can buy this stuff. What they do, these are their steps. It's,

66
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,920
 scams drive me nuts. And you can go Jason, you're getting scammed because you're buying calcium

67
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,000
 pills. No, I'm buying calcium pills because my diet is garbage. I eat hot dogs and hamburgers

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,080
 all the time. That's all I eat and pickles. So I need to take calcium supplements and magnesium

69
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,440
 supplements and biotin and I take my daily vitamin. I take all this stuff because, and I feel great

70
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,440
 because I don't get that stuff when I eat. I eat hot dogs and hamburgers when I, because I'm on

71
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
 keto diet and I know people like there's more to keto than that, but I'm just a picky eater.

72
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,640
 So I have to take my vitamins. There is no digital vitamin A. I can't instead pull out my iPod

73
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,320
 and put in my headphones and get digital vitamin A. This stuff is so made up. You can do that with

74
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:25,520
 Ormus. Let's see how they make a digital Ormus. One, we use a first they extract, we use a proprietary

75
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,520
 computer software and innovative energetic encoding techniques to capture the energy,

76
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,360
 i.e. informational data field of these various substances in digital format. That makes no

77
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,480
 sense. Step two, we amplify it. We then amplify that extracted digital signals many times in a

78
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,400
 balanced way. You're just making it up. Three, encode. The final step is to encode the amplified

79
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,920
 signature and you know I'm done reading their nonsense. Ormus has no health benefits whatsoever.

80
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,840
 It is a made up substance that people are selling you to put into your body and it is 100% the

81
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:12,880
 placebo effect and I know this for a fact because the websites that sell Ormus can't even agree

82
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,800
 what Ormus is. They some are saying it is these five elements. Some people are saying it comes from

83
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,360
 salt. Some people are saying it comes from plants you grow in the soil. What plants don't grow in the

84
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:35,600
 soil? I'm just gonna eat corn then and not drink lye. It's invisible to science you can't test it

85
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:44,160
 so therefore it works. Scams drive me nuts. They drive me nuts. I gotta wrap this up real quick

86
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,920
 but we have someone who posted onto a Ormus forum. This isn't all results but this is quite telling.

87
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,480
 Okay I've been on the stuff for about three months even taking a three day Ormus retreat

88
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,480
 whatever that is but then we'll go on. I have a variety of strange symptoms. Anyone else got

89
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,400
 anything to add? Currently I'm having Cundi pains whatever that is. Cundi is some sort of like

90
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,560
 it's like the spiritual energy. I don't know why it would be hurting but anyways sometimes very

91
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 painful but also very temporary. Sharp pains all over my body at random times so if it's some sort

92
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,440
 of like spiritual pain whatever it's all in your head anyways the Ormus is fake so it's not really

93
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:33,840
 affecting you. Then it says mouthful of blisters and canker sores that's not in your head. I mean

94
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:40,960
 literally it's in your head but you're something's wrong. Heart palpitations in the morning actually

95
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:48,800
 waking me up from taking Ormus for three months but then they go on to add that Ormus is causing

96
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,920
 them to have awesome dreams and meditation so you know I guess the heart palpitations balances out

97
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,000
 with the awesome dreams and the mouthful of blisters and canker sores. I can tell you what's

98
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,720
 causing the blisters and canker sores. You're eating lie. I hate scams. Let's go ahead and move

99
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,160
 on to the next story. Now this story is something that intrigued me when I saw it on the iceberg

100
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,400
 a couple months ago. Didn't think I would ever find anything on it and I looked I couldn't find

101
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,640
 anything despite all of my amazing research efforts. I mean guys we have to admit at this point I am

102
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,960
 a top notch researcher. I nothing gets past me and I looked probably every two weeks I tried

103
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,080
 looking for this topic again and despite my track record tracking down these great stories I could

104
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:46,240
 not find this one and then I realized I was spelling it completely wrong. So yeah it's

105
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:56,560
 the Patterson Gimlin tape and I was calling it the Patterson Gimling or possibly Patterson Gimling

106
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:05,200
 from Lord of the Rings. So I that honestly happened multiple times and I go damn there's no

107
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,800
 I can't find this story that I want to cover and then I was on another thing reading about

108
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,840
 Bigfoot and I was like that's how you spell his name and I spelled it incorrectly and a ton of

109
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,880
 resources popped up so today we are going to talk about the Patterson Gimlin Massacre. So quick

110
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:30,000
 overview here Patterson Gimlin Bigfoot tape is the tape we've all seen. It's the 20 seconds of

111
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,040
 film footage of Bigfoot like strolling through the woods with that unique walk and it turns and it

112
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,160
 looks at the camera and then keeps walking and all of really like the Bigfoot stickers it's such an

113
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,480
 iconic pose where it has its arms stretched out as it's walking that you'll see that pose on stuff

114
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,520
 everywhere. Hood River we have a ton of Bigfoot paraphernalia and it's funny because I don't think

115
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,240
 Bigfoot's been seen here but it's very popular. You'll see him like carrying a pizza you'll see

116
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,560
 him like dribbling a basketball and I'm saying he it's actually supposedly a woman named Patty

117
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,520
 a Patty the Bigfoot named Patty but anyway so the Patterson Gimlin tape has always been

118
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:13,120
 considered the most authentic Bigfoot video out there but so the Patterson Gimlin that's his name

119
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,640
 right I keep wanting to say Gimli Patterson Gimlin tape is that famous 30 40 second clip now

120
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,400
 we all see that and we go oh look at Bigfoot's actually possible like there is a person that's

121
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,840
 walking not like a person and looking like a big old monkey but maybe there's more to the story

122
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:40,160
 maybe there is more to the story so that Patterson Gimlin tape it's called Patterson Gimlin because

123
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,360
 Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin are the ones who made the tape it was shot in Bluff Creek,

124
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:54,720
 California on October 20th 1967 in 2008 there was a Bigfoot enthusiast named MK Davis and what MK

125
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:03,280
 Davis he made his name in the Bigfoot community because he took the original footage of the Patterson

126
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,800
 Gimlin tape and stabilized it and got at like a better picture so it wasn't so shaky and so they

127
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,600
 were like oh this guy like has really helped make the footage easier to view and brought up the

128
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 quality and things like that in 2008 he starts looking at the footage and he goes that's a blood

129
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,960
 puddle like right off camera and there's like a flash also off camera like the flash is on camera

130
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,880
 but there's like a flash to the left side of the screen as Patty's walking away and then he has this

131
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,680
 additional footage that he says shows it wasn't Patterson and Gimlin at Bluff Creek shooting

132
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,960
 us there were 10 people there total and there was a Bigfoot massacre a bunch of big feet a big thigh

133
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,880
 if you listen to the parapod a bunch of big five were there three of them actually and what we're

134
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:02,240
 seeing is Patty running away from the slaughter of her two friends and apparently there is a close-up

135
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,400
 of Patty they did an enhance like CSI you can see a single teardrop coming from Patty's face

136
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,680
 now you can look at these they have photos of the additional footage you see some guys

137
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,160
 standing there and some red puddles and you see like a dog and these guys kind of look like other

138
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,520
 Bigfoot researchers they've said look at this guy this guy is skinny and here's this Bigfoot

139
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,320
 known Bigfoot researcher who's also quite skinny they're both white they might be the same I haven't

140
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,280
 seen the actual footage I've seen stills of the so-called off-screen footage apparently there

141
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,360
 were multiple cameras there but I've seen the stills and you do see them stand on there and

142
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,240
 there's some like red puddles and then MK Davis goes look at there were similar red puddles in the

143
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,680
 Patterson Gimlin tape it appears that there was a massacre Bigfoot enthusiasts are like what are you

144
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,840
 talking about there's so much controversy over this because this tape has been a mainstay I mean

145
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,400
 it just people were outraged by that they're like no you you adjusted the color this was just a dark

146
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,240
 patch of water and you made it red and so on and so forth and and there was all of this pushback

147
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,760
 on it Dave David Pallades the guy from missing 411 he got involved in it and he was like oh no

148
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,760
 not publicly but apparently in private circles with the Bigfoot community he's like oh no there

149
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,280
 was a massacre there so you're like where I think since we haven't seen the original footage

150
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,400
 and MK Davis who's to this day contends that there was a massacre there the two other Bigfoot were

151
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,800
 shot what what other where did the story come from did MK Davis just sit there one day and like

152
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,520
 discover this extra reel of footage was he just editing it and then he slowed like hit a button

153
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,400
 in the camera slowly moved to the left and he saw this going on people were putting their

154
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,920
 reputations on the line David Pallades if I'm not saying that right but him most of all a lot of

155
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,560
 people see him as like this big researcher into the paranormal and now he's making this claim

156
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,160
 that a bunch of Bigfoot were killed without footage all we have on the Patterson Gimlin tape

157
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,240
 that shows anything like that is a Bigfoot supposedly running away in a red puddle so where

158
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:23,440
 did this story come from why would people put their careers quote unquote careers on the line

159
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,640
 to expose this story with so little proof it must have been a great source right the original story

160
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,920
 of the Patterson Gimlin massacre was came from a creepypasta the here was the basic gist of the

161
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,840
 creepypasta a couple guys start a band they make it big in Hollywood they meet with a producer

162
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,840
 in Hollywood and the producer is like yeah guys what's up yeah let's rock this party yeah yeah

163
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,600
 by the way I have a secret footage of two Bigfoot being murdered and the band's like what

164
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:03,680
 and so they see the video and then they tell their friends back home and they're like dude we saw

165
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 like two big feet getting shot we saw two big fire getting shot and apparently what the other

166
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:18,320
 addition is you see three Bigfoot Bigfi sitting at a fire or a fire pit and there's just a

167
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:30,080
 hail of bullets reload I don't know if Bigfoot go oh but this one did and then Patty gets up and

168
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,560
 runs away and then they just happen to have another camera 10 feet away and they just recorded Patty

169
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,000
 running away the hunters were like immediately like oh no we killed two big fi what are we gonna do

170
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,680
 we could take this as evidence that the world's most mysterious creature exists but what if we're

171
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:56,880
 found guilty for murder we better skin them right here and take out all their meat and take their

172
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,520
 bones and destroy everything so no one suspects us of murdering a creature that no one knew existed

173
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,480
 for sure until we shot two of them so that's why they just like the bodies disappeared

174
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,840
 and then they didn't say anything they're like oh my god if anyone finds this footage of us killing

175
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:23,920
 these two animals so let's destroy all the evidence that these creatures even existed even

176
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:29,760
 though we're out here specifically to prove they existed and that's the creepypasta it's literally

177
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:37,760
 something you would see like on reddit or creepypasta.com or whatever it is just a story about a guy

178
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,000
 telling a story that his buddy went through oh i got a call from my friend he's in a band and he

179
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,880
 told me this crazy story if that happened if a bunch of people descended upon a camp of bigfoot

180
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,520
 yeah you would have people that are were upset but you would have even more people be like oh that

181
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,000
 sucks as you shot him but finally we have proof that these things exist because you know and they're

182
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,480
 like oh yeah no they just dispose of all the evidence but they believe totally in bigfoot

183
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:13,600
 they're there purposely to find bigfoot it doesn't wash it doesn't wash and it's weird to me that

184
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:22,080
 mk davis and david polides i can't david polatus whatever that they would be willing to

185
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,520
 put this theory forth based on creepypasta and a couple of photos of just random people standing

186
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,080
 around a campsite with a red puddle which again can easily be photoshopped in it could be blood it

187
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,280
 would be a lot of blood and it's just like all in like where a creek would be so it would be very

188
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,000
 easy to just change the color saturation on that photo but Patterson Gimlin massacre i think

189
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:57,040
 it didn't happen i think that it's 100 of creepypasta that got out of hand and once they once these

190
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,080
 people i think david polades has kind of backed away from it but again he never really dressed it

191
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,400
 publicly like to us in the bigfoot circles from what i could see he was talking about it but mk

192
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:16,000
 davis continues to put this story forth and he's wedded to it now he can't say oh no i was wrong

193
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,160
 you're right it was creepypasta i was looking at the footage wrong oh and that gunshot blast that

194
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,520
 apparently comes from the Patterson Gimlin tape which is like the official tape people said that

195
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,560
 wasn't in the original version that was added i can almost imagine this little cartoon like bang

196
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,880
 coming off the side insane stuff and again creepypasta i i think somebody read this who had never

197
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,400
 read any creepypasta and thought that it was a true story and then began to prove it existed

198
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:50,800
 i would hate to see what would happen if this guy ever read like jeff the killer i mean he would

199
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,640
 go on he would go to the town he would go to every town where a new kid just moved in and ran into

200
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,160
 some bullies and try to figure out the truth behind jeff the killer it's fake stuff and you've

201
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,760
 ruined your reputation over it mk there was no massacre there there's a big question over whether

202
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,480
 bigfoot was actually there but there definitely was no massacre there but again once i learned how to

203
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,400
 correctly spell gimlin it was an interesting little mystery to explore so that's it that's our episode

204
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,160
 we kind of buzzed through that i i don't know if i can keep up that pace but i actually kind of like

205
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,160
 that i had a little timer this time that went off every nine minutes so i was able to kind of keep

206
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:37,680
 i was kind of able to punch in three good stories and uh we'll see how that works out we'll see how

207
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,640
 that works out dead rabbit radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy true crime podcast you

208
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,200
 don't have to listen to it every day but i'm glad you listen to it today have a great one guys
