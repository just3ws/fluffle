1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
 What would you do if you had finally gotten your dream job?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:14,280
 But one day when you were leaving work, you were attacked by a monster.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,220
 And then, I'm sorry if that noise is too scary for you, and then we find out what would happen

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,160
 if the police are investigating a murder, but the suspects are out of this world.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:32,160
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,240
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,640
 I really do mean that, even though I say it over and over and over again.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,920
 I truly mean that.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,600
 To start this story off, let's go ahead and welcome in one of our Thanksgiving live stream

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,640
 contributors walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
 Give it up for 120.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
 Wooo!

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
 Give them a big round of applause.

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
 Give them a high five or 20.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,240
 120, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,040
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or the show financially, I totally get it.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,320
 Just help spread the word about the show.

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,440
 That really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
 Talk about it online.

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,880
 Talk about it with your friends, your family.

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,600
 All of those things help this show grow.

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,200
 And if you were a contributor during our Christmas live stream, don't worry.

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,480
 You guys are coming up.

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,600
 We're almost through all of our Thanksgiving live stream contributors.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,240
 And then we'll move on to Christmas.

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
 But for right now, 120, wearing a little Christmas hat reminding us of the holidays.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,800
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,440
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,800
 We are driving all the way out to Houston, Texas.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,120
 Nice leisurely drive my hands out the window.

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,560
 It's making those wave things.

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
 Wee!

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,440
 Going up and down with the airflow.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
 The year is 1986.

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,600
 And we're at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
 And there's a dude.

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,200
 His name is Frank Shaw.

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,280
 Now I said in the beginning of the intro that this was his dream job.

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
 I don't know.

43
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,600
 It, it, there wasn't, wasn't specified in his story.

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,840
 I just kind of added that detail in because I thought it sounded neat, but for full disclosure,

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
 I didn't make that up.

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,360
 Frank Shaw is working at NASA as an archivist.

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
 He's an archivist.

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,680
 So basically he doesn't get to ride on the space shuttle.

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
 He doesn't get to try on the suits.

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,560
 He's not one of the fashion models in the suits.

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,560
 He doesn't even get to look at the computers and go, they did it.

52
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,160
 They did it, everybody.

53
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
 And then like clap.

54
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,200
 He gets to read, he gets to read the books, the accounts of everyone else he gets to do

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
 that stuff.

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
 He's like reading their diary.

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,720
 It's like, dear diary, today I fell in love with Neil Armstrong.

58
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,320
 So he goes and he's like looking through notes and stuff like that.

59
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
 He's an archivist.

60
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
 So he's like in the basement.

61
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
 He's in the basement of NASA.

62
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,640
 He doesn't even get to see the space shuttles taking off.

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
 He's like, oh man.

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,400
 They're like, you don't even get to look in the moon at night, sir.

65
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
 Be in the basement.

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
 So he's down in the basement.

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,080
 He's looking through these archives and he's making the archives.

68
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,880
 It's not like he's just going through dusty books.

69
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,280
 He's like, he's like clipping out pictures of the newspaper.

70
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,240
 He's like clipping out articles and has a glue stick and he's like putting them on paper.

71
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,160
 Ah, another archive done for today.

72
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,600
 My name's Frank Shaw and apparently this is my dream job.

73
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
 Dream job, dream job.

74
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,600
 As his voice echoes through this giant basement.

75
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,640
 Frank Shaw, who's most likely going to sue me if he ever hears this episode.

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
 He's like, damn it.

77
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
 My job wasn't that.

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
 I have a computer, sir.

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,360
 I've had a very, very high tech workspace for the year 1986 and it wasn't my dream job.

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,480
 I always wanted to be a ballerina.

81
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,680
 As Frank Shaw is leaving this facility one day, the sunlight is in his eyes.

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,960
 He's like, ah, what's that?

83
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,760
 What's that burning orb in the sky?

84
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,560
 As he's leaving work, his pale skin glistening.

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,440
 He's walking out to his car, slithering out like some sort of golem-esque creature.

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,960
 And he happens to be walking to his car and at this point he kind of looked up for whatever

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
 reason.

88
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,040
 Something caught his eyes.

89
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,160
 And on top of one of the buildings at the Johnson Space Center, there's a gargoyle.

90
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,560
 And he's like, hmm, hmm.

91
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,640
 Well I do know that this is a very nice building.

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
 I've heard legends about it.

93
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,800
 I saw pictures of it in the archive.

94
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,160
 But I don't remember us having a gargoyle statue on the building.

95
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,960
 And then he realizes this was no statue.

96
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,240
 It was this jet black creature that he could only describe as a gargoyle.

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,520
 It just had the twisted face of a monster and these huge black wings.

98
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,440
 And Frank, as he's staring at this thing, he's frozen in place.

99
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,440
 He can't move.

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,520
 He's so terrified as this thing unfurls its giant black leathery wings.

101
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:55,320
 And with a loud crackling sound, jumps off the building and flies into the night sky.

102
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
 Now Frank is terrified.

103
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,160
 He just saw a flying monster at a place based on science, right?

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,960
 If you were in a spooky cemetery and saw a flying monster, you'd be terrified there as

105
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
 well.

106
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,680
 But I'm trying to say if I saw a flying monster, I'd be like, ah, but it wouldn't break my

107
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,320
 reality because I believe in flying monsters.

108
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,800
 But if you're a scientist, if you're like, oh dude, numbers are the best and you just

109
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,000
 had a letterman's jacket that had a beaker on the back of it and you had a little pinnit

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,120
 that said science on it, that was your thing.

111
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,120
 If you saw a flying monster, that would destroy your reality.

112
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,400
 People who believe in this stuff, they would be like, yay, I saw a monster.

113
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,920
 You would still be your pants, right?

114
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,440
 I'm not saying you wouldn't be scared, but it wouldn't change the way you think about

115
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
 the world.

116
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,200
 But if you're a scientist or an archivist of scientists, it would be soul-shattering.

117
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,400
 He's eventually able to regain his consciousness and he gets in his car and he drives home

118
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,320
 and his family can tell something's off.

119
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,520
 First off, the giant wet stain on his slacks.

120
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,800
 They're like, uh, Frank, are you okay?

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,480
 And he's just like, uh, yeah, I'm fine.

122
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,480
 He's looking up, he's looking up at the house, he's looking at the roof of the house.

123
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,720
 As he's walking in, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

124
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,960
 Let's just go inside and he's like walking around checking all the shadows in the house.

125
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,160
 They're like, are you okay, dude?

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,200
 And he goes, listen, I was getting off work and I looked up and there was a monster on

127
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,800
 the edge of the building and it flew away.

128
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,120
 And then I wet my pants and now I'm there.

129
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,560
 And the family, listen, they're a rational group of people.

130
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,040
 They go, whoa, well, first off, don't sit down, don't sit down on the couch, change your pants.

131
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:45,040
 But secondly, I, I, we, you probably saw something, but it obviously wasn't a flying monster because

132
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,880
 flying monsters don't exist.

133
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,560
 And he's like, yeah, I guess, I guess you're right.

134
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 I guess you're right.

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,800
 I must have been mistaken.

136
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,920
 And the family's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, because those don't exist.

137
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,000
 So he kept it to himself for a while, but he knew what he saw.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,480
 He knew what he saw.

139
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,640
 He saw Gargoyle.

140
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
 He saw a monster.

141
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,680
 It laughed at him with this crackling laugh and then flew away.

142
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,840
 And he goes, the way it looked at me, it, it seemed to enjoy the panic it was inflicting

143
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
 on me.

144
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
 There's like, this was a malevolent creature.

145
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,080
 So it wasn't a trick of the light.

146
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,760
 Generally, generally optical illusions don't get joy in human pain.

147
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,780
 This one, it felt satisfied that I was so scared of it.

148
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:38,160
 So finally, he talked to one of his friends at work, who happened to be his supervisor.

149
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,120
 This is really, really, really, you got to be really careful with this type of stuff,

150
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,200
 right?

151
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,560
 Because your supervisor wants you to be, wants you to be mentally sane.

152
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,200
 Those supervisors, I would say all supervisors, want their employees to not be nuts.

153
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,940
 So by going to your supervisor and telling them you saw a monster, you're really putting

154
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,560
 your job on the line.

155
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,640
 Again, if your job, your job was a monster hunter, Van Helsing is your boss.

156
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,360
 He's like, yeah, I hope you saw a monster.

157
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
 That's your job.

158
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,840
 But it's a science-based place.

159
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,680
 You don't want to hear anything about monsters.

160
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,080
 So he goes, but this is his friend at work.

161
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,120
 This is his friend at work.

162
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,240
 So he goes to his friend and says, dude, you're not going to believe this.

163
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
 Like you're literally not going to believe this.

164
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
 My family doesn't believe it.

165
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,000
 I have a hard time believing it myself.

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,680
 But a while back when I was leaving work, I saw a gargoyle on the top of our building

167
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,080
 and it seemed to enjoy how scared I was of it because I was terrified and it flew away.

168
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,560
 And I know that sounds insane, but I just had to tell someone else, even though my entire

169
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,960
 family doesn't believe me, do you have any idea, like you're around the building a lot,

170
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,800
 do you know what could have possibly caused this optical illusion?

171
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
 What do I do?

172
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:02,160
 And the supervisor looks at Frank and says, you're not the first person to report that.

173
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:12,960
 We have actively been covering up sightings of pretty much what you described.

174
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,200
 There's a file that is in a secure location.

175
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,920
 It's not, you're not going to be able to read it because we don't want this information

176
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,160
 to get out.

177
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:31,840
 But there have been multiple reports of people seeing a gargoyle like creature on the property

178
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,720
 here.

179
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:43,120
 And remember those two German Shepherd guard dogs that went missing a while back?

180
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,000
 Frank's like, no, why would I even remember that?

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,840
 I didn't know we had German Shepherd guard dogs.

182
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
 Well, we do.

183
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,360
 Well, we did.

184
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,240
 Because one day two of these dogs were gutted.

185
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,400
 Two German Shepherds killed on our property.

186
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,000
 These are highly trained guard dogs.

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,560
 Found dead.

188
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,000
 And we believe, as in the supervisors who are in charge of keeping this conspiracy under

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,360
 wraps, we believe that whatever this creature is killed the guard dogs.

190
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,920
 So it's not an optical illusion.

191
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,240
 We don't know what it is.

192
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,600
 But it's real.

193
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,440
 And it's dangerous.

194
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,520
 Apparently after this meeting that Frank had with his friend, at one point he was conscious

195
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,800
 of a group of investigators.

196
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,880
 Not like independent ghost hunters or something like that.

197
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,800
 Investigators apparently from the government that was trying to follow up on some stuff

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,360
 and they came to him and they got some more details from him.

199
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,080
 And he told them the story of what he saw.

200
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,960
 And then the investigators said, do not tell anyone about this.

201
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,480
 This is an ongoing investigation.

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,240
 Do not reveal this information that you saw a monster at your workplace.

203
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,640
 And he didn't.

204
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,800
 He did not repeat the story.

205
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,040
 Apparently so this is the way it's laid out.

206
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:11,440
 We know about this story because his daughter, Desiree, contacted Nick Redfern, who is a

207
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,280
 he writes for mysterious universe.

208
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,040
 He's a well-known author and researcher of the paranormal.

209
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,280
 And then he did a write up on this.

210
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,880
 I got all of my information from an article written on a non-alien, which is a great paranormal

211
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
 website.

212
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,440
 I go to it every single day.

213
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
 But yeah, so that's the story.

214
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,720
 I don't know if Frank Shaw is still alive.

215
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,680
 I think it's kind of implied that he has passed on if his daughter is telling the story.

216
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,640
 Because if basically if a guy's like, oh no the government said never tell the story

217
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,440
 and then your daughter in the next day starts calling up Nick Redfern or calling up mysterious

218
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,040
 universe or whatever, the dad's gonna be mad.

219
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,400
 He's like, that's 10 spakings for you young lady.

220
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,680
 She's like 38 at this time.

221
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,440
 I think the story is implied that he's passed on at this point.

222
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,920
 If you were 40 years old in 1986, you'd only be in your 60s right now.

223
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
 That's not too old.

224
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
 And who knows how old he is.

225
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,080
 The point is, is that, that's where the story ends.

226
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,480
 He didn't tell the story directly.

227
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,760
 We're hearing that story from his daughter, Desiree.

228
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,960
 It's an interesting story.

229
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,520
 Originally I had it packaged in with my shadow man in the nuclear facility episode we did

230
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
 last week.

231
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,840
 But I ran out of time and I really wanted to spend a chunk of time talking about this.

232
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,560
 Because what we have here is the whole thing.

233
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,800
 You have the world of science being brushed up against by the world of the paranormal.

234
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 And why?

235
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,300
 Really.

236
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,800
 We talked about shadow people possibly walking around nuclear facilities or maybe it was

237
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,000
 even camouflage, soldiers, spies, things like that.

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,400
 But in this one, I don't know of any camouflage technology that allows some spy from another

239
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,480
 country to flap their wings and cackle as they go up into the night sky.

240
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,160
 It would make, here's my takeaway from this.

241
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,520
 If I was an evil monster from beyond, sure it'd be fun terrorizing kids out walking across

242
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,200
 the crybaby bridge late at night or hanging out in an abandoned graveyard just hoping

243
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,080
 someone walks by so you could spook them.

244
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,120
 But if you were really a malevolent creature, who would you want to terrify the most?

245
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,880
 Would you want to terrify ghost hunters and kids who believe in all of this stuff?

246
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,880
 Or would you rather scare people who don't believe in you?

247
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,760
 People who you knew based their entire life on logic and facts and had gotten rid of the

248
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,000
 supernatural beliefs and the superstitions and everything like that.

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,960
 That's who I would scare.

250
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,720
 And while this creature didn't seem to be breaking in, it wasn't going through files

251
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,640
 or trying to fly away with a space shuttle or anything like that, it seemed to have just

252
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,840
 made its home here and took a sadistic delight in terrifying these people and killing their

253
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,000
 dogs, right?

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,600
 What an interesting story this creature hanging out at a scientific laboratory and there's

255
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,560
 really no implications that it's like a creature of science because it's not like NASA's facility

256
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,800
 has a bunch of beakers and they're like mixing stuff together and then it accidentally pours

257
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,200
 on a guy and he's like "Oh no, why'd you mix up the gar formula and the goyle formula

258
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 and put them together?"

259
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,680
 And then he turns into a gargoyle.

260
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,680
 No, there's no, that didn't happen, right?

261
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
 I don't think it happened.

262
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,360
 I mean all these stories are so bizarre, who knows.

263
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,480
 But I think the idea that it is a supernatural creature, it's not a misfit of science and

264
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,880
 it just delights in destroying the brains of scientists.

265
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
 Interesting interesting story.

266
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,680
 I think that file still exists if you could go to the archives, right?

267
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,920
 Imagine that, imagine that you saw this horrible thing and they're like "Here, before you retire,

268
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,360
 before you retire from your shop, we got one more thing for you to file."

269
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,080
 They hand him this thick manila folder and it says "goyle comma gar" on it and he's

270
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,800
 like "Uhhh" and they're like "You gotta file, you gotta file this one in the spookiest

271
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,320
 corner of the archive room."

272
00:14:43,320 --> 00:15:13,320
 The lights all zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

273
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,400
 He seemed to love eating dogs, he thought that was always weird whenever he invited

274
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,000
 his supervisor over for a barbecue, he'd be eyeing the little terrier.

275
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,600
 "Hmm, when are you cooking that?"

276
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,100
 Just kidding.

277
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,600
 As his eyes shifted from side to side and turned everything to stone that he looked at.

278
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,680
 120, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

279
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,880
 We're leaving behind Houston, Texas.

280
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,760
 We are flying all the way out to Nebraska.

281
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:48,600
 As we're headed out there, I want to do a really quick Dead Rat but Recommends.

282
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,400
 This is actually, it's not for a movie, it's for a YouTube documentary, I guess you could

283
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
 put it that way.

284
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,120
 It's about an hour long if I remember correctly.

285
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,640
 There's a YouTube channel I watch all the time, it's called Comic Tropes, it's from

286
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,400
 this dude, I don't remember his name, Mr. Trope, who talks about Comic Tropes.

287
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,720
 He talks about like "Here's Frank Miller's run on Daredevil, here's all the tropes that

288
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,400
 Frank Miller has in most of his comics.

289
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,840
 We're going to see how many tropes we can find in one particular issue of this comic

290
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
 book."

291
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,280
 It's really interesting if you're into comic books.

292
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,840
 If you're not and your eyes glazed over at all that, you still may want to check out

293
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
 this Dead Rat but Recommends.

294
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,520
 I'll put it in the show notes.

295
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,800
 It turned, this is so fascinating.

296
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,560
 Recently he goes "You know what, I didn't have any ideas for an episode this week but

297
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,280
 I knew I had to put something out so I'm just going to tell you guys, I used to be a real

298
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,200
 life superhero.

299
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,680
 He worked with Phoenix Jones, the real life superhero out of Seattle and dude, this show,

300
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,080
 I mean this is such a, it's like he goes behind the scenes of why he became, he had the full

301
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,200
 costume and everything, he went by the name Omega, he appeared in one of the many documentaries,

302
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,120
 I remember watching a bunch of documentaries about real life superheroes, he was in one

303
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,200
 of them and he goes "Man, they really took, they really gave the camera angles that made

304
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,040
 me look like really out of shape."

305
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,040
 He goes "They really went out of their way to kind of make us look bad but he exposed,

306
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,360
 he's talking about like all these other real life superheroes that he goes they were kind

307
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,280
 of psychotic, he talks a lot about Phoenix Jones.

308
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,840
 We did a whole episode on Phoenix Jones a while back, he worked with him from the early

309
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,200
 days, it's really interesting if you're interested in the real life superheroes phenomenon and

310
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
 really who isn't.

311
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,920
 And I find that whole subculture just fascinating and he talks about the rise and fall of Omega.

312
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,080
 His like he was patrolling the streets fighting crime and stuff like that and why he stopped,

313
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,320
 really really interesting story, such a fascinating person all around, I wish I could remember

314
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,680
 his name but his channel comic tropes I watch all the time.

315
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,000
 I'll put that in the show notes, it's just a really interesting hour long behind the

316
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,040
 scenes, it starts off by him saying "Hey I'm not really gonna gossip a bunch, it's not

317
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,240
 about throwing dirt on me, it's the next hour."

318
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,680
 It just means like "Now that guy was a psychopath."

319
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,880
 He just starts off talking casually but it's hard to talk casually about all of these insane

320
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,040
 antics that's going on.

321
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,600
 So Dead Rabbit recommends comic tropes episode "I was a real life superhero" I'll put it

322
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
 in the show notes.

323
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,540
 It's just a great behind the scenes look at that entire subculture from the point of view

324
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,920
 of a retired real life superhero, really really interesting and it's a good channel all around

325
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
 too.

326
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:41,760
 120, we are in Nebraska, we don't have a specific location so let's just stop here.

327
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,080
 We're at a house with a nice little garden, doesn't say it's in the middle of nowhere

328
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,880
 but again this is Nebraska so we can assume that there's not many neighbors around, it's

329
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,260
 summertime 1980.

330
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,860
 Warm summer breeze blowing through the reeds, it's an afternoon and a family is sitting

331
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,860
 at home.

332
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,980
 You have a mom and a dad and a couple kids, how many kids right but you got a mom and

333
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,260
 a dad and probably a couple little baby people running around.

334
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,900
 They're just sitting at home and they're enjoying the year 1980, perpetual fear of a nuclear

335
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,840
 holocaust, gas prices through the roof, you know not much different than we have today.

336
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,680
 And they're sitting at home and then all of a sudden one of the family members notices

337
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,160
 movement in the garden outside the house.

338
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,720
 "Hey dad, dad look."

339
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:44,360
 The dad looks out the window and he sees several children walking around the garden.

340
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:51,460
 But no, not children, childlike figures walking around the garden.

341
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,980
 There's something about them that the family knew that these weren't just a bunch of local

342
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,260
 neighborhood kids stomping on their petunias.

343
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:09,460
 They were childlike but not children and walking with them were two very tall, very thin men.

344
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,080
 Now if you were sitting in your house on a warm summer day in 1980 and you saw a bunch

345
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,940
 of weirdos walking around your garden, you may have a couple different reactions.

346
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,540
 "Hey get out of my garden."

347
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,540
 Would be mine, right?

348
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,740
 I'd yell at them.

349
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,460
 You might just ignore them and go, "We all wanted to plant a new garden anyways, those

350
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
 flowers sucked."

351
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,140
 And you let them trample through the garden.

352
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,460
 But in this story, one of the family members, there's not a lot of specifics here so we'll

353
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,080
 say it's the father.

354
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,100
 The father has a very Nebraska way to deal with this.

355
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,360
 He grabs a shotgun and says, "I'm gonna go outside."

356
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,960
 And they go, "No, no, no, no, no, don't go outside with these little kids in the garden.

357
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
 I mean they look weird, right?

358
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
 What are you gonna do?"

359
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,880
 And he goes, "I'm just gonna investigate.

360
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,280
 I'm gonna investigate with the double-barreled shotgun that's loaded."

361
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,480
 So I'm just gonna quote-unquote investigate and he leaves the house and everyone's like,

362
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
 "Ugh."

363
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,800
 And when he has left the house, about five minutes pass, bam.

364
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,700
 They heard a loud bang, much louder than the sound I made because I know people fall asleep

365
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,260
 listening to this podcast.

366
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,340
 Bang!

367
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,220
 But way louder.

368
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,660
 They actually said it didn't sound like a gun blast, it didn't sound like a shotgun had

369
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,420
 gone off.

370
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,980
 It sounded more like a short burst of thunder, that kind of sound that echoes through the

371
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,740
 atmosphere.

372
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:39,680
 The family runs outside and there, by a fish pond that they have on their property, the

373
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:48,480
 father is laying there on his back, his eyes wide open, every muscle in his body tight and

374
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
 taut.

375
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,620
 He's dead.

376
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:58,160
 While the authorities are on their way, the family's examining the body and they realize

377
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,440
 there's no wound to this dude.

378
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,980
 Is it not bleeding from anywhere?

379
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,800
 It doesn't have a hole anywhere.

380
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,300
 So he wasn't accidentally killed with his own shotgun.

381
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,520
 It didn't seem to be a gunshot of any kind.

382
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,800
 They did hear that loud noise but there's nothing.

383
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,020
 His body is completely rigid.

384
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,100
 Every muscle is tensed up.

385
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,260
 But there's no blood.

386
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,700
 There's no hole in him.

387
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,800
 There's just what they can see.

388
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 A small cylinder of silver, well they can't identify that it's silver yet, but a small

389
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,420
 cylinder of some sort of metal is embedded just underneath his skin.

390
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,260
 Police department gets there, the ambulance gets there, they take him away and when they

391
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:50,160
 do the autopsy, they do realize that this small cylinder is made of silver.

392
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,880
 But they don't know how it got there.

393
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,620
 It doesn't look like he was shot either accidentally or on purpose.

394
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,980
 The police though ruled this as an accidental death.

395
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,940
 I couldn't really explain what it was.

396
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,060
 But there's really only four causes of death.

397
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,500
 There's natural, homicide, suicide, and accidental.

398
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,100
 When you're, well legally those are like the four types of death that will appear on a death

399
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,020
 certificate.

400
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,580
 Natural, homicide, suicide, or accidental.

401
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,520
 So they wouldn't know how it wasn't suicide, it wasn't homicide, it wasn't natural.

402
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,920
 There's definitely nothing natural in this whole thing.

403
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,400
 So the only other way they could mark it as accidental, and people go, there must have

404
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,520
 been some sort of cover up.

405
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,720
 How could you accidentally get a piece of silver embedded under your skin when a bunch

406
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,720
 of little kid like beans are running around?

407
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,560
 That's really the only thing left you could put on there.

408
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,720
 Not necessarily police cover up, but this does make it a bit of a cover up.

409
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,200
 The police kept that piece of metal, that little silver cylinder.

410
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,500
 They want to give it back to the family.

411
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,960
 So apparently the police department of this unnamed Nebraska town still has what's possibly

412
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,120
 a murder weapon.

413
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,620
 Because really the implication is that he was killed by the aliens, or whatever these

414
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
 beans were.

415
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,020
 The reason why we focus on them being aliens is because this actually came, this story

416
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,140
 was related to Whitley Stryber.

417
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,440
 Whitley Stryber, who's most famous for writing the book Communion, which really put the idea

418
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,860
 of the gray alien into the consciousness of America, really of the world.

419
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,460
 This story was told in a follow up book of his called The Communion Letters, which is

420
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:32,800
 a book about other people encountering these aliens and focusing on implants, alien abduction,

421
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,360
 things like that.

422
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,840
 It's interesting, if you look at the Amazon reviews for the book The Communion Letters,

423
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,420
 one, this is so fascinating to me, the book is $70 now, because it's out of print, but

424
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,580
 you can get a Kindle version for $3.99.

425
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,460
 I'm a huge fan of what the Kindle, of what electronic books are doing for all of these

426
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,540
 old UFO books that otherwise would be completely out of print, we wouldn't be able to get it.

427
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,820
 What's interesting though is if you look at the Amazon reviews, one of the top reviews

428
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,820
 is from someone whose letter is in the book.

429
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,060
 They said, "Listen, I know there are people who don't believe the stories are true, but

430
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:14,560
 my letter is in that book, and there's another letter in that book that is very closely connected

431
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
 to my story."

432
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,960
 He goes, "It wasn't easy for me to agree to have my letter published, but I'm glad that

433
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
 I did."

434
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,600
 That's a cool review.

435
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,740
 Someone who was like, "Obviously you're going to buy the book if you're in it."

436
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,880
 There are people though who think that the stories are made up.

437
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,840
 That's really going to be the case with any of this UFO paranormal stuff, is that people

438
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,560
 are going to think that it's made up, which is fine, right?

439
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,060
 People don't have to believe in everything that I believe in.

440
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,500
 It's not my job to convert them.

441
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,300
 If you don't believe in UFOs, if you don't believe the same stuff that I do, I hope you're

442
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,100
 at least entertained by the stories.

443
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,100
 Right?

444
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,100
 A lot of people do.

445
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,220
 A lot of people go, "I don't believe it, but I sure like hearing about it, reading about

446
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
 it."

447
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,380
 There's nothing wrong with that.

448
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:58,740
 But I think the story is super interesting because my question is how often does this

449
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,180
 type of thing happen?

450
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:09,880
 The reason why we have this story connected at all to aliens is because there's a whole

451
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,400
 set of witnesses there.

452
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,840
 And there's a mysterious death.

453
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,040
 When you have someone who walks outside with a shotgun, is walking around the house, and

454
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,800
 then you hear a loud clap of thunder and he's dead, that's unusual.

455
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,120
 Most people don't die like that.

456
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,640
 But what if this guy lived alone?

457
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,860
 And he walked around in his front yard and everything else is the same.

458
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,300
 He grabs his shotgun, he goes outside, he's laying there.

459
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,980
 The clap of thunder, no one's around to hear it.

460
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,460
 He's laying there out in his yard.

461
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,260
 And no one notices he's missing until a couple days pass and his boss is trying to find him.

462
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,420
 He has to take over as a NASA archivist, but he doesn't show up to work.

463
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,900
 And then they go out there and they find the body.

464
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,900
 It's already starting to decay.

465
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,100
 And they go, "Oh, I wonder what killed him.

466
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
 Heart attack?

467
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
 Aneurysm?

468
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,320
 Never really could probably find a cause for it."

469
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,400
 When listed as accidental.

470
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,240
 Wouldn't be looking for really a cause.

471
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,080
 The body's decayed for a couple days.

472
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,720
 They wouldn't be looking for an implant.

473
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,720
 If anyone found the implant, might have just got tossed to site because the death wouldn't

474
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,720
 be mysterious.

475
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,400
 But you'd go, "Maybe it would still be mysterious.

476
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,440
 Someone in their 30s, early 40s, just dropping dead.

477
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,080
 We know what it usually is.

478
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,440
 Heart attack, widowmaker, that kind of thing.

479
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,840
 Aneurysm, we know where to look.

480
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,540
 What if this guy was 83 and he wakes up late at night and he's walking through his house?

481
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:43,900
 And when he gets to the kitchen, he turns and he sees two gray aliens rifling through

482
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,900
 his silverware.

483
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
 They need more money.

484
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,900
 They need something.

485
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,060
 They're going to pawn them off to buy a new spaceship.

486
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,580
 And he drops dead in the middle of the night.

487
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,580
 No one's around.

488
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,580
 They even going to autopsy that guy, right?

489
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,280
 He's 30 years old, dead in his house.

490
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,000
 No one even knows to call on him, right?

491
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,560
 His kid's never checking on him.

492
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
 It's not good.

493
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,720
 You should always check in on your parents.

494
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,960
 But how long is he there for?

495
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,840
 A month?

496
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,800
 After the cats are done eating him?

497
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,760
 They swallowed the implant.

498
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,160
 The little cat's walking around with a little piece of silver in his belly.

499
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,680
 You know what I mean?

500
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,040
 This would be such a bizarre way to go.

501
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,580
 No one would really know to look for it unless there are witnesses that experienced it and

502
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,380
 said we had all this other stuff.

503
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:38,220
 If you lived by yourself and you just dropped dead, I know this is a super cheery episode,

504
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
 right?

505
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,220
 It's a great, great way to think about it.

506
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,620
 But you know what I mean?

507
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,700
 Would anyone investigate your death?

508
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
 Would it look like a natural death?

509
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,620
 A lot of that has to depend on your age and your general health.

510
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:57,440
 My father used to be a mortician and when elderly people die, you don't autopsy them,

511
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
 right?

512
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,880
 If someone's 92 years old, it's not like the autopsy guy's putting on his gloves.

513
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,640
 He's like, "I gotta figure out what happened to this 92-year-old woman who was smoking

514
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,720
 for 30 years and had type 1 and somehow type 2 diabetes."

515
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,480
 And I think they almost had type 3 diabetes.

516
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,640
 "Well, let's figure out what killed this person."

517
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,880
 No.

518
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,980
 So at that point, anything could happen to them.

519
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,700
 So I wonder how many, even if it was a fraction, right?

520
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,900
 I'm not saying that every time someone just drops dead, they were shot by an alien.

521
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,700
 But maybe this happens three or four times a year.

522
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,420
 We know this story because there were so many moving elements.

523
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,660
 The aliens were walking around in the yard.

524
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
 Everyone saw them.

525
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,780
 Guy grabs a shotgun, prepares himself for a violent confrontation for what he thought

526
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:52,120
 were tiny kids and tall people, and then drops dead.

527
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
 You wonder how many.

528
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,600
 I'm not saying every person who dies is shot by an alien, but some of them might be.

529
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:06,200
 Some of them may have spent their final moments on Earth turning on a kitchen light and seeing

530
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:15,760
 an alien being standing there in the darkness or hearing a weird noise in the garage outside.

531
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:24,260
 Throwing on their bathrobe, grabbing a flashlight going to investigate.

532
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,460
 Never coming out of the garage.

533
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,860
 They're just found there and people go, "Oh, you know, he's such a nice guy.

534
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,940
 He's older, probably wasn't that healthy, but he must have had a heart attack and just

535
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,900
 died in his garage."

536
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,660
 If we look at alien lore as a total thing, if we believe in all of the alien lore, they

537
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,680
 abduct an awful lot of people a year.

538
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:54,520
 I would probably put the number in the low thousands, maybe in the upper hundreds range,

539
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,680
 and we're including new abductees.

540
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,240
 Usually they'll re-abduct people, but I would probably put the number around that.

541
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,520
 I'd probably put the number in the maybe 2,900 something around there, and that's just the

542
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
 guess.

543
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,960
 The number could be wildly higher.

544
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,960
 I'm just talking about that's not re-people being re-abducted.

545
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,420
 Those are new abductions.

546
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,500
 That seems high actually, but when you think about the entire population of the earth,

547
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
 that's quite low.

548
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:26,540
 I wonder how many of those end in death for the abductee?

549
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,540
 We don't know, right?

550
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,060
 We don't have the setup to investigate these things.

551
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,020
 We don't have the will to investigate these things either.

552
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,420
 Most people just don't believe they exist.

553
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:42,400
 Most people don't believe these things are happening at all.

554
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,760
 So when someone does drop dead because they surprised an alien or confronted an alien,

555
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,600
 or just happened to wander past one while it's on its mission and it turns and looks

556
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:02,880
 at you and ends your life, it just looks like an accident, or a natural death.

557
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,100
 It's creepy to think that this is our planet, but we're not the masters of it.

558
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,780
 That's really what all these stories come down to.

559
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,860
 That's what makes them scary.

560
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,140
 This is our planet.

561
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
 We're in charge.

562
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,340
 We're the top dog on this planet, but then something can just come down in their vehicle

563
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:27,180
 and kill us, mutilate our cattle, kidnap our children, and there's nothing we can do about

564
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,780
 it.

565
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:35,080
 The people out there who are supposed to protect us, the government, the police, the army,

566
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,400
 they're either oblivious to it, or they've heard about it and don't believe it, or they're

567
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,480
 in on it.

568
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,680
 The scariest thing that all of these stories share, whether it's a vampire, whether it's

569
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,800
 an alien, whether it's a monster on your building at work, is that we are not kings of our planet.

570
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,200
 We're just here, like everything else is here.

571
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:05,660
 And we're being visited by things stronger and faster and more cunning than we are.

572
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,620
 That's what makes these stories scary.

573
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,420
 It puts us in our place.

574
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,780
 Not only do they put us in our place, they return us to a childlike mentality where we

575
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,460
 become afraid of the dark.

576
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,500
 We become afraid of what we can't see.

577
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,580
 We become afraid of what we can only sense is outside of our vision.

578
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,800
 These ghosts and these ghouls and these aliens standing at the foot of our bed, or hiding

579
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:39,840
 underneath our car, or squeezed into the gap behind your bedroom dresser.

580
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,240
 We like to rationalize and think, "No, we are the kings of our world, and there are scientific

581
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,200
 laws that dictate things.

582
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,880
 And this story is not true, and the gargoyle story never happened, and our reality is dictated

583
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,860
 by laws that have been explained through science."

584
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,600
 But is that true?

585
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:09,820
 Or is that just like a man gripping a life preserver in the middle of the ocean, trying

586
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:22,700
 to rational that he is safe, he is okay, and he will be rescued soon as a swarm of sharks?

587
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:45,640
 He's already headed his way.

588
00:34:45,640 --> 00:35:06,300
 He's already headed his way.

589
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,040
 He's already headed his way.

590
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:19,040
