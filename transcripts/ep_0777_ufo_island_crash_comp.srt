1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
 One man goes all out for the ultimate cosplay and

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:12,360
 Then we join a group of stranded sailors on a rocky island in the middle of nowhere

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,580
 They thought they were gonna starve to death on this deserted island and that would have happened

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,340
 If it hadn't been for a crashed UFO today on Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:31,060
 *Music*

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:37,420
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carbner and I'm gonna cut to the chase here guys

7
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,540
 Let me give you a little bit of advice

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,460
 Life is too short

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,100
 To work a job

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,100
 You don't like

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,500
 I'm gonna say that again because a lot of people need to hear this. Life is too short to work a job

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,340
 You don't like if you're not being fulfilled by your job if it's not your calling if you don't have a passion for it

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,580
 Why are you doing it?

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,740
 I know this young woman her name's Tiana. She's 16 years old. I've known her since she was 10

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,740
 She hates her job

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,140
 And I realized when I was talking to this young woman, there's a fallacy in life

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,380
 That you're supposed to work jobs you hate. It's okay to work jobs you hate as long as you're making money

18
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,100
 Putting food on the table. It's okay, and I say no to that. I

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,140
 Say you need to work a job you enjoy at the very least a job you enjoy

20
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:45,260
 So many of us work jobs that we don't like have you ever been going to work and think I hope I get in a car accident today

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,260
 Because then I won't have to go to work

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,660
 That's a sign you need to change your job and it is this lie

23
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,820
 That society tells us and that we tell ourselves that we need to work crummy jobs now

24
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,660
 There is a caveat to that one of my favorite movies transformers dark of the moon transformers 3

25
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,180
 There's a scene in it where John Malkovich tells Shia LaBeouf and this is this is an important caveat

26
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,620
 Shia LaBeouf is about to get a job in a mail room John Malkovich has this company

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,540
 John Malkovich says I know this isn't the job you want you want the job after this

28
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,340
 But you need to do this job first

29
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,940
 If you're on your way up the ladder

30
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,900
 And you need to work this job to progress

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,540
 Fine do the crummy job, but guys really I want to reach out to you

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,860
 And if you take nothing else from this podcast from this show anything

33
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,900
 Just to know that you are better than a bad job

34
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,060
 so

35
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,060
 Start dusting off that resume

36
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,580
 Start looking for something that will excite you. I know it's scary

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,980
 To change make these big changes make a list of the things you need in a new job

38
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,140
 Make a list of the things you want in the new job

39
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,300
 You don't have to do this overnight

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,660
 But if you are miserable in your job life is too short to work in misery

41
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,140
 You're on your way to your job and you're frustrated and you're gonna hate it

42
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,900
 And you hate your co-workers and you hate your job, but you make good money

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,300
 You got good benefits and as you're going to this job that you hate

44
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,660
 You have all this negative energy swirling up inside of you

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,460
 You have a heart attack and you die. You're killed in a car accident

46
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:31,780
 Rogue rogue elephant crushes you as you're pulling into the parking lot. How will you feel then?

47
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,700
 Your last thing on earth you are going to a place that gives you nothing but negative energy

48
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,020
 Find the positive job. It doesn't even have to be a great job. I love retail

49
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,280
 I love stocking shelves. I love working with customers

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,340
 So doesn't have to be a flashy job. Just look for the job that you love life is too short

51
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,460
 To work in misery

52
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,220
 We take nothing else from this podcast nothing else from 777 episodes

53
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,980
 Remember that there is only one of you you have one life

54
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,980
 Make sure you're working a job that you want to work

55
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,420
 Don't just work for the paycheck. Don't just work for the benefits

56
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,460
 You find yourself in that situation when as you're traveling to work you wish that someone rear-end you

57
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,140
 So you'd get the day off. It's time to dust off that resume. It's time

58
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,980
 To find the right job for you

59
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,940
 Let's go ahead and welcome in today's legacy patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command give it up

60
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,180
 It's Matt Sprinkle everyone give a round of applause to Matt give him a high five while you're doing a round of applause

61
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,780
 It's all totally confusing you accidentally punch him in the eye

62
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,460
 But you can't sue me Matt because you've already given me patreon money

63
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,740
 So you're gonna lose that's in the law. Did you not know that Supreme Court ruled on that if you give me money

64
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,380
 You cannot sue me Matt

65
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,860
 You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode you guys can't support the patreon

66
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,980
 I totally understand just help spread the word about the show really

67
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,100
 Really helps out a lot now Matt. I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy

68
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,420
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are driving all the way down to

69
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,220
 Brazil

70
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,780
 Matt is perfectly driving us down there. He's been in the vehicle. I think once or twice

71
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,860
 He's been a supporter for a long time Matt knows the way. He's totally like oh Brazil

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,540
 I totally know where that's at. Do do do do do we all go down there?

73
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,220
 You guys longtime listeners of the show know I'm a huge fan of urban legends. I think that is really

74
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:42,540
 Powered like my childhood belief in ghost of front. I'm like, oh no, there's a man with a hook is gonna come after me

75
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,980
 I'm not making out with anyone in a car

76
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,860
 I actually don't think I've ever gone old lovers lane now that I think about it make out in a parking lot, right?

77
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,500
 It's a little as romantic if you're in the parking lot of like a movie theater

78
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,580
 But you know the whole story lovers lane and the hook for the hand I love urban legends

79
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,340
 Those are the first scary stories that I think kids really hear and they sound believable

80
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,780
 I remember there was a story that I used to be told that in

81
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,340
 Orangevale which Orangevale, California is one of the flattest places on earth

82
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,540
 You can literally stand there and you're like hello state capital

83
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,860
 You can pretty much just see for miles and miles, but I remember my brother told me a story

84
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,500
 There are these two Native American people. I

85
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,440
 Did not use that terminology didn't use that terminology, but there are these two Native American

86
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,980
 People and they were madly in love

87
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,480
 They're madly in love with the chiefs of the different

88
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,420
 Oh, they're from different tribes to do that would make sense if they're just like hey

89
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,940
 We're in the same time. Let me back up here because this will make it more dramatic and accurate

90
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,420
 There's two rival tribes of Native Americans and you have a dude from this tribe

91
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,460
 And then you have a girl from this tribe and they were in love with each other

92
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,620
 But the chiefs of either tribe goes no you cannot be together. How dare you marry that?

93
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,980
 Oh, they were also they were also the kids of the chiefs. I guess I'm a little off track here

94
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,380
 You're like Jason at least like edit that stuff out. No, don't tell me how to do my show a long long time ago

95
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,300
 There were two Indian chiefs right one of them had a son

96
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,100
 Well name him Johnny and the other chief of a rival tribe had a daughter named Daphne and

97
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,940
 Johnny and Daphne were in love with each other, but the rival chief

98
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,180
 I know the water room. Me. Oh, Julia. Just get to the stupid urban legend part. So anyways

99
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,140
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

100
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,740
 Maybe you do know how to run a podcast better than I do the point is is that because they couldn't be together

101
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,740
 They went to a cliff a cliff in Orangevale, which doesn't exist the much you'll get is maybe a goalie

102
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,340
 But anyways, they went to this cliff in Orangevale and they jump both jumped off to their deaths

103
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,060
 I

104
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,860
 Guess I have to have the sound effect that made it quite brutal

105
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,580
 But so you're like that's not an urban legend Jason

106
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,180
 That's just like Romeo and Juliet

107
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,580
 But this didn't happen in the end of Romeo and Juliet if it did it would be awesome

108
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,900
 My brother told me and to this day if you go to this cliff in Orangevale that cliff that doesn't exist

109
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,300
 I was so scared as little kid. I'm like, I don't want to go no towards any cliffs ever

110
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:20,100
 I don't even want to see Clifford the big red dog the go to this cliff to where the two natives jumped off and made that sound

111
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,520
 If you stood on the edge of that cliff their faces like their faces got cut off some

112
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,760
 I don't know. I was a kid. I didn't understand a legic

113
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,600
 But apparently their faces got sliced off on the rocks when they fell

114
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,740
 so if you go to this cliff their

115
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,700
 Skinned faces would float up and they're just be like it would be like if you cut off leather face cut off their face

116
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,500
 And so they had no eyes. They had no mouth. It was just these two bloody

117
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,300
 skin pieces of skin floating around going

118
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:58,580
 That's terrifying right absolutely terrifying it would have been one thing if just their ghost showed up and they're like walking through the woods

119
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,380
 It's their skin got faces floating after you. I remember a I remember

120
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,520
 Being told that story on an overcast Orangevale morning back in like 1982. It's one of like my earliest memories

121
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,360
 Urban legends. I love them. They terrified me and

122
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,760
 Still don't go towards cliffs because you never know you never know what cliff it was

123
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,200
 So I love urban legends and when I can't the only thing better than an urban legend

124
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,960
 Is an urban legend like the one we're about to discuss and I got to give a shout out to

125
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:34,720
 Nelsilius because Nelsilius brought this to my attention. I never heard of this one before let's take a look at this

126
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,040
 Have you guys ever heard of a show? I'm sure some of you have called. I think it's Naruto and

127
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,280
 I don't really know much about it. It's about like some cat ninja

128
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,120
 Right, isn't that guy like half cat because he has like whiskers or something

129
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,320
 But I see a lot of people dressed up as him when I'm walking around just town everyone's like hi

130
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,940
 I'm Naruto running like him that that's really what I know

131
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,760
 He has a headband and then I think he has whiskers and he runs with his arms behind his back

132
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,560
 That's all I know about Naruto, but now I know something else about Naruto. There's a dude named Kan Kuro on the show

133
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,600
 and he's a shinobi ninja and

134
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,560
 I guess he's a puppet master ninja

135
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,540
 So he I don't know my research ended was like Naruto headband shinobi ninja

136
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,560
 I didn't watch any episodes of this but apparently he's able to control

137
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:30,240
 People or he can create constructs like puppets and he like marionettes them has him dance around on I'm assuming

138
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,420
 They do niggas so I'm assuming he's not putting on a puppet show for the bad guys

139
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,140
 I think he like makes the the puppeteering kick people in the nuts or something like that

140
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,300
 I'm not for sure. So that's the background of that character. He let that deep dive research

141
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
 I does something with puppets

142
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,820
 The reason why we're in Brazil is in 2005

143
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:56,620
 There is an anime convention called anime friends 2005 and this dude shows up dressed up as Kan Kuro

144
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,920
 It's his favorite Naruto character

145
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,060
 his name is Tarsisco Felix and he shows up as this dude and

146
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,580
 He brings this puppet with him like he has like this giant casket thing

147
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,900
 And he's like all the the marionette puppets in here

148
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,980
 And I guess on the show the guy has something strapped to his back or he does carry around this thing that the

149
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,980
 marionette dude is in

150
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:30,100
 So I lost all my Naruto viewers are there already furiously type in some on YouTube

151
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,640
 You're like Jason you literally could not have gotten any details more wrong than he did

152
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,920
 But the point isn't that I'm gonna get flooded by anime comments

153
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,360
 The point is this he shows up in this costume with this casket and people are like dude

154
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,520
 That is one of the best Kan Kuro costumes I've ever seen and there's a guy's in a next-time dress that was like

155
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,280
 Oh, I was Kan Kuro too. They're like you just look like some dollar store ninja

156
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,080
 He actually is going around the convention people like you're really this is real cool

157
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,120
 Gonna get a picture with you and people are like well that was weird right something smelled bad

158
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,680
 An anime convention, so I'm sure the B. O meter was off the chart

159
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,720
 But every so often someone when they'd walk by to Risco they would go hmm. I don't smell too good

160
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,420
 They eventually have this

161
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:22,840
 Like lineup on stage. He actually for the entire convention. He's one of the finalists for best

162
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,080
 Cosplay

163
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,000
 So he shows up and he's lined up on stage with all these other people and this is the first time he's standing still

164
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,760
 I'm sure maybe he's still to go to the bathroom or when he's in line to buy a hot dog

165
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,960
 But usually he's walking around the floor, but now he's on stage with all these other people you got these bright lights

166
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,720
 You got the guy on the microphone announcing everyone and people are like dude that really stinks

167
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,960
 Like whatever whatever your costume is really really stinks and they start to think maybe in his

168
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,360
 casket his backpack is whatever it is

169
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,960
 There's a dead animal because it smells like it's dead

170
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,380
 the

171
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,760
 Judges actually get alerted to this and people are like okay. We need to actually see you could you bring like spoiled food and

172
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,100
 Tarsizos like it depends on your definition of food, right?

173
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,400
 So they make him open up this casket. That's part of his costume

174
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,240
 They find a dead body

175
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,760
 So the urban legend goes like this

176
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,920
 There was a man who brought a dead body as part of his costume

177
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,600
 To an anime convention in the year 2005 in Brazil and when they force him to open up

178
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,840
 They find this dead man and it turns out that Tarsizo was actually a medical student

179
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,320
 and this dead body was a

180
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,760
 Homeless person who had been dropped off at his college

181
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,320
 That you're supposed to be working on so I go know my finals do tomorrow. Where's my homeless dude? No

182
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,080
 So Tarsizo had it if he failed Brazilian medical school in this year

183
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,720
 It's probably cuz Tarsizo stole your buddy

184
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,760
 He takes his body puts it in this coffin for his costume

185
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,800
 And I'm wondering if anyone said hey man, can you make your puppeteering thing?

186
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,120
 And I wonder if it crossed his mind and he thought yeah, I'll pull it out and he starts like making this

187
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,080
 But because anyone would have automatically realized this was a real dead person

188
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,840
 I don't know why he put it in the casket if he wasn't showing it off

189
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,160
 but

190
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,840
 The entire event was canceled

191
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:37,120
 Anime friends 2005 everyone was sent home because this one jerk ruined it by bringing in a human corpse

192
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,520
 On the face of it, that's a great urban legend right it goes right

193
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,520
 I mean it totally it fit here. This is what's interesting about it

194
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,200
 It fits what we know about people who go to conventions. They're weirdos and I'm speaking of one

195
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,300
 I go to conventions as well when I can it's been a long time since I've been able to go one but

196
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,480
 Generally if you're going to anime convention. I comic I used to go to comic book conventions all the time

197
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,560
 Back when I was younger it does attract a certain segment of society

198
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,840
 The weirdos the ones that would think it might be okay to bring in a human

199
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,720
 Okay, they're not saying all anime fans thinks it's okay to bring in a human body

200
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,680
 But you know what I mean? It does attract a certain segment of society. I'm not putting them down

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,720
 But they're weirdos and I'm a weirdo too because I go to these conventions as well

202
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,740
 But so the stereotype already fits the socially inept

203
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,480
 Scientists doctor who thinks it's okay to smuggle a human body out into an anime convention like it doesn't

204
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,520
 Defy logic right you could see this happening with so many goes others nothing wrong with this dude dress up as a comic book

205
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,360
 They're dressed up like Thanos. I'm gonna carry around this World War two veterans body and say that I killed Captain America

206
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,920
 And I read this and I go what's fascinating urban legend of course

207
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,280
 There's no way we can actually prove it anime friends 2005. It was what 16 years ago

208
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,120
 Anything is going to be in a foreign language

209
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,800
 And so I read this urban legend and it actually was posted on the urban legends forum

210
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,120
 And I thought whoa dude. It's really cool and then and

211
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,320
 then

212
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,560
 As a follow-up post Nelsilius

213
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,640
 showed proof

214
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,200
 He took a screenshot of a magazine

215
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,760
 That tells this story

216
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,320
 There's a photo of this magazine the photo was taken back in 2007 and

217
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,760
 My Spanish is non-existent, but I know a

218
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,520
 Submission of Latin and I can kind of make out what's going on

219
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,720
 It appears that this article is saying hey yeah back in 2005 some nudge

220
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,480
 I brought a human body into anime friends a Brazilian convention. It's written in Spanish

221
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,600
 The best type of urban legends are the ones that are true

222
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,160
 Now just the story alone is just a fun story right because you can see it happen

223
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,080
 But this apparently actually happened and I will say this the only

224
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,880
 question I have is

225
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,400
 What did that magazine come from like where?

226
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:20,520
 Was it a magazine of Brazil's best urban legends or was it a magazine about weirdos and in

227
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,960
 Convention culture wasn't just a magazine about conventions in general and this was a highlight story

228
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,400
 But it appears that this story is actually real that a man

229
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,800
 student did actually

230
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 Smuggle in a human body into an anime convention and not show it. That's the weirdest thing. He didn't show it to anybody

231
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,820
 It's like he just wanted the realism of having 180 pounds strapped to your back. It is dead homeless man

232
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,840
 Fascinating story the best urban legends are the ones that turn out to be true and this one's super obscure

233
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,800
 I hadn't heard it before but yes a man apparently did

234
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,840
 Bring a dead body into into an anime convention and they shut it down and who knows what happened to the guy right?

235
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
 I'm assuming

236
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,200
 The very least he got kicked out of school. I don't know maybe they just gave him a demerit. They're like Teresa

237
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,280
 Teresa you keep still in human bodies. We're gonna mispronounce your name every time we say it

238
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 But yeah, I really love urban legends and you can't get any better than one

239
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,120
 That's true and pretty disgusting right you love the disgusting urban legends

240
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,880
 Matt I'm gonna go ahead and touch you the keys of the carpenter copter. We're leaving behind anime friends 2005

241
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,840
 We're saying goodbye to all the weirdos in Brazil. We are headed on out to a

242
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,440
 deserted island in the Indian Ocean

243
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
 to

244
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,840
 Now hold on tight guys huge storm in coming

245
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:55,360
 Winds blowing rain rain we have the window sets and we don't worry about the rain

246
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,840
 I guess the helicopters a little wobbly because of the wind, but we're actually pretty comfy in there

247
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,240
 We're drinking hot cocoa, but to anyone else alive in this area. It's a miserable day. It's September

248
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,000
 22 and we're in the Indian Ocean and we're watching this huge storm just royal the ocean

249
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,600
 Now in the middle of this Godforsaken area

250
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,200
 There's the boat Christine

251
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,960
 It's a Danish ship and the people on board are trying to do whatever settlers do to avoid dying in the water

252
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,600
 They're like, I just don't drown. That's rule number one

253
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,640
 So guys like oh, I didn't forgot that rule is he's flown away

254
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,440
 Christine a Danish boat is out in the middle of this ocean and the wind and the water and the waves are tossing every each way

255
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,680
 People throw ropes throw ropes somewhere. It's not really good captain. Where do we throw them? I don't know do something

256
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,400
 Sailory splash people are getting just washed over

257
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:58,160
 People were singing a jaunty tune they're not singing it anymore. They're just like lashing themselves to stuff

258
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,720
 And it doesn't help it doesn't help the boat is out of control and they see this rocky outcropping this island in the middle of nowhere

259
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,000
 Look out. Don't go over there the captain

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,280
 You gotta give us better better instructions, dude

261
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,600
 This boat

262
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,040
 crashes on this deserted island and it's just I mean

263
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:29,720
 Falling in an island is probably I mean the basic definition of an island. It's land in the middle of the ocean

264
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,120
 But what it is it's just jagged rocks. There's no coconuts

265
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,240
 There's no like far-sight-esque characters already trapped there

266
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,320
 it's

267
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,520
 It's death

268
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,960
 It's a bunch of jagged rocks in the middle of the ocean the boat is

269
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,000
 absolutely destroyed and everyone starts jumping off of the boat and

270
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:57,080
 Basically like I can either be in this boat when it sinks or I can climb on these rocks and slowly starve to death

271
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,600
 And so the people decide to climb on the rocks

272
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,560
 Now these rocks they're not just like you can walk around there's like cliff sides and things like that

273
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,880
 It's just inhospitable to human life

274
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:16,440
 And so they actually have a good amount of water because it's raining and it's collecting in the gullies of the rocks

275
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,920
 So they got that but they have no food at this point everyone's eyeballing each other custom of the seas brother

276
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:30,280
 Who's gonna draw lots first? They're like, dude, we've only been here for 10 minutes. We don't want to start have to cannibalizing right now

277
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:37,080
 But no food the boat sinking they're probably getting some rations off of there, but not enough not enough

278
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,520
 And the men are sitting there

279
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,240
 kind of just

280
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,520
 They know they're gonna die. It's just one of those situations. You know, you're gonna die. Nobody knows you're there. It's 1862

281
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:57,320
 The chances of another boat finding you is probably as high as that boat then getting stranded on the rocks themselves

282
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,720
 more man meat to eat

283
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,440
 But you know, you're not gonna get rescued right your best hope is that more and more boats

284
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,680
 Crash there and you can just keep eating the survivors of those wrecks. So the men are sitting there and they're thinking we're dead

285
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,120
 And what's worse is that we have all this water to drink

286
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,160
 So we're just going to be able to prolong our lives until we all slowly start to death or start eating each other

287
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,480
 And that is when they see

288
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,840
 Something in the sky

289
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:35,480
 A massive UFO

290
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,320
 Is plunging through the clouds

291
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:47,800
 And the storm is so violent they're actually watching the ship wobble now

292
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,360
 This is 1862 they have no concept of a UFO even today

293
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,280
 This would be the most spectacular sight you could ever hope to see in your life a UFO a UFO

294
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,040
 That is estimated to be as big as a modern battleship

295
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,040
 This isn't some tiny three gray aliens piloting this thing

296
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:13,320
 This is a huge craft and it's coming down and even that the storm is so violent. It's battering the ship

297
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,080
 The men realize this thing whatever it is

298
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,120
 Is headed straight towards them

299
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,840
 What do you think is gonna get any worse?

300
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,960
 A giant vehicle from the sky

301
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,960
 Is headed right towards you they start to scatter trying to look for shelter on these rocks

302
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
 *Metal noise*

303
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:45,560
 The UFO smashes into the side of the cliff and then there is no sound but the storm

304
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:56,040
 The men start to approach this vessel and it's mangled there's massive holes torn in the side of it

305
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
 It's sitting there now on the beach

306
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,280
 But it's not in the best shape it hit this thing going god knows how fast

307
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,480
 And this ship has created a new hazard outside of the twisted metal

308
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,240
 Scattering the landscape the water around this craft is boiling

309
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,360
 This ship's hole is so hot

310
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,080
 The water is boiling

311
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,800
 The men enter the craft

312
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:42,360
 I love this story I just came across this one the other day. I really really enjoy it

313
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:50,840
 As they're walking inside they see machinery of unknown origin

314
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,600
 They don't know what it is. They can't make heads or tails of it. This is 1862

315
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,760
 This is pre-industrial revolution the most technological thing they probably saw was like a loom or an astrolabe

316
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,240
 But it wouldn't matter it smashed to bits

317
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:13,800
 They're looking at all this stuff. Oh no my space loom doesn't matter smashed to bits in the impact

318
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,680
 They see these metal boxes though

319
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:24,040
 That have a strange type of writing on them these glyphs

320
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,920
 And they're large but they can open them

321
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:36,680
 So they see these large crates and they pry it open and inside these crates

322
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,640
 Food

323
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,680
 So the men I know they're all sneaking up behind each other with a fork and a knife and then all of a sudden

324
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,480
 They just start devouring this food because again now they've only been trapped on this island

325
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
 We're like I have our this point, but

326
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,120
 Maybe they were super hungry on the way to get there

327
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,880
 Who's going to turn down some good old mysterious food in a metal box that you can't read the labels?

328
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,000
 These people are eating this food

329
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,360
 Have all this food now they know that their problems have been solved. They have food

330
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,960
 They have the water that they can collect from the rain and the rocks

331
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:23,160
 They don't still have no idea what this is, but you would think at this point it must be god's mercy

332
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,880
 some sort of angelic

333
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,720
 gift and then there's one atheist sailor is like, I don't know maybe uh

334
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:36,440
 Maybe none of that stuff exists and this just came from another planet people are like boo you we're gonna you work when this food runs out

335
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
 We're eating you first

336
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,480
 But they continue to explore the ship

337
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,720
 And they walk into this room

338
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,880
 And the sailors find them

339
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:01,080
 They find more than a dozen bodies

340
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,280
 strewn about

341
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
 More than a dozen bodies

342
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:11,160
 These men had dark bronze skin

343
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,840
 With long hair

344
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,720
 Long beards

345
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,400
 But the most spectacular thing about these bodies

346
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,640
 They were all 12 feet tall

347
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,080
 The sight of giants

348
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:37,320
 Giants from the sky in this great machine that smashed against our planet killed all of them

349
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:45,800
 None of these posed any threat. They were all dead, but the sight of these 12 inhuman beings

350
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 Sent the sailors running

351
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,520
 Some of them it drove them mad

352
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:03,800
 One of them was so insane from this site. You can't comprehend it

353
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,160
 You're seeing a non-human entity for the first time. You're seeing a bunch of them

354
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,920
 When he ran out of the ship

355
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,880
 He jumped into the boiling water

356
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
 Cooked himself to death

357
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,480
 Now I know the cannibals the cannibal contingent of the sailors were like, oh, right. We're gonna get that guy later, but

358
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,120
 They didn't they didn't need to I know cannibals. They really want to eat this guy. They didn't need to

359
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,680
 Because they had enough food

360
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,120
 Fra I know I know they're super disappointed. Oh man. The thing is

361
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,000
 Is they left the food in the ship

362
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,880
 But they refused to go back in there they refused to go back into the ship

363
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,840
 Because who knows what these things were this was not a place for man

364
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,720
 A place for gods a place for devils

365
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,840
 But not man

366
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:05,000
 But they were starving they're on this deserted island in the middle of nowhere

367
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:15,560
 This delicious smell of that cooked human keeps filling their nostrils eventually they do go a while without food and they say guys

368
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
 We need to go back in there and get those containers

369
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,160
 We need to go back in there and get that food

370
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:32,600
 So after starving for a bit and realizing the only way to stay alive was to visit this

371
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,640
 This cemetery

372
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,960
 They go back into the ship

373
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,920
 They began eating the food

374
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,360
 They decide to drag the bodies out of the ship

375
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,400
 They throw them into the ocean

376
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,240
 Now they have food

377
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,800
 Now they have water

378
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,360
 Now they have time and strength

379
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,400
 to escape

380
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,160
 Because you can't just go out on the high seas you could build a raft day one

381
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,240
 But you're not going to survive that journey

382
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,160
 But now that they have this food they can build this raft and they know we're going to be on the ocean for god knows how long

383
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,880
 But we have a chance now

384
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
 So they eat they regain their strength

385
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:25,960
 They build the raft they take provisions for them and the survivors get on this raft and leave this deserted island

386
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,320
 Eventually

387
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
 They reach civilization

388
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:37,480
 There's a really cool book and a couple of you guys sent this to me a long time ago

389
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,920
 There's a really cool book called albert rozales

390
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,560
 Or albert roe sails one of the two humanoid sighting reports

391
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,400
 And it's a lot like that website think about it docs.com where it's just brief

392
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,080
 Overviews of these amazing stories

393
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:59,800
 And they got this story from gerome clark who wrote it for fate magazine back in september 1990 now

394
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,800
 And so the question is is

395
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,240
 It's a fascinating story. I love this story, right? It's really cool

396
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,080
 But the question that I always go back to is how true was it or is it true?

397
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,280
 And I actually found out on wikipedia. They have a list of

398
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
 shipwrecks by year

399
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:23,240
 In september 1862 there was no boat that matched this description that crashed in the indian ocean

400
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,200
 Although I figured maybe the dates wrong. I looked at october

401
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,320
 1862 I did find a boat called the christine. That was a danish ship

402
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,680
 And it does say it says that the brig was wrecked at jedaren

403
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,440
 Which I wasn't able to I don't know what that means to try to look that up on a map

404
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,600
 I brought out all my nautical maps at jedaren. Her crew was rescued

405
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:53,480
 It says she was on a voyage from asgard to montrose forfenshire united kingdom. So I don't know

406
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,240
 Why they would be going from the netherlands

407
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,360
 To britain and end up in the middle of the indian ocean

408
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,040
 But I was able to find at least a little bit of details. Does that mean the story is true?

409
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:10,680
 We don't know right whether or not it's true. We can't determine that but this story is so

410
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,200
 Awesome. I really love this story and the idea

411
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,600
 We think of when sailors crash on these deserted islands

412
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,120
 And that hopelessness, you know, you might be able to scrabble some stuff together to get off there

413
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,680
 You may slowly eat each other away

414
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,280
 See you I take a bite out of you you take a bite out of me

415
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
 We'll just keep doing this until the first person dies

416
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,600
 But you could have a 10 people die on an island and they're constantly hoping to get rescued and then they

417
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,120
 Turn on each other and then you know eight are left and then a couple die of disease and then all of them end up dying

418
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,160
 Their bleached bones are never found their family and their employers and everyone

419
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,640
 Never is able to figure out what happened to these 10 sailors and that's so part of human nautical history

420
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:01,880
 When we look at what humans have done crossing the oceans that is what we're doing when we look at the stars

421
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,840
 It's the almost the same level of technology to build those galleons back in the day and to cross

422
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,680
 The ocean was such a monumental task and if you messed up you died

423
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,440
 Water is just as hostile as space

424
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,560
 Right if you're

425
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,320
 Mucking about in space and you float out of the space station you're gone

426
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,440
 You're just going to keep floating and floating and floating away until you get sucked into the orbit of something

427
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,200
 Or burn up in the sun and the same thing if you fall out of a boat

428
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,920
 I'm almost gone bro. If you fall off of a cruise liner

429
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,520
 You're done

430
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,800
 It's so inhospitable nowadays. We're like, hey, let's hop on a cruise line

431
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,160
 Let's hop on a disney cruise and drive around and baby Yoda will come out and help feed us oysters at the buffet

432
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,920
 Maybe some and I believe someday space travel will be like that

433
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,840
 We'll look back at the this era of space travel the same way that we look back

434
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,200
 400 years ago in nautical travel you're like well, we'll get in a boat and maybe we'll make it

435
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,040
 Maybe the crew will mutiny. Maybe they'll never know what happened to that boat

436
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,640
 Maybe that entire galleon could sink and have all this treasure in it. We don't even know what happened to it

437
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:21,400
 And that's the same idea of an alien ship crashing on earth

438
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:28,280
 It's some backwater in the middle of nowhere if you have this galactic civilization, right

439
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,000
 past Alpha Centauri

440
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,080
 And you have this craft that you build with the top technology of the time

441
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,560
 You say goodbye to your alien wife and to your alien children

442
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,440
 And you hop on board your ship

443
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,760
 And you fly across the galaxy

444
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:51,000
 You're leaving behind that civilization. You see the last lights of the colonies

445
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,120
 Disappear on your view screen

446
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,200
 You go farther

447
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,040
 Than the farthest outpost and now you're in the middle of a galactic nowhere

448
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,720
 And your ship crashes on a mud ball

449
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,000
 On the edge of the milky way

450
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,840
 It's the same thing I find that so fascinating

451
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:19,000
 The idea of an alien crashing here would be the same thing if we crashed on a rocky shoreline

452
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,200
 You go well, there's people here. That's not good for them. What would you rather do?

453
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,640
 Crash on a deserted island or crash on an island full of hostile people

454
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,200
 Like you're probably gonna die anyways. Maybe you'll make friends

455
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,840
 with the people there

456
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,080
 Or maybe they'll just kill you because you're some weirdo outsider walking around

457
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,080
 You look like a devil to the humans

458
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,440
 You shouldn't be there. You're a trespasser

459
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,720
 Fascinating story and I've always loved the connection between the nautical

460
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,480
 and

461
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
 the galactic

462
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,880
 We are all just explorers

463
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:08,040
 Trying to find our way through the universe trying to discover new things about reality about ourselves

464
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,880
 But those type of adventures

465
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,920
 They take blood

466
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,000
 They take bodies

467
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,800
 You got to lose a lot of ships

468
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,520
 You got to lose a lot of ships

469
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
 To explore the world

470
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,040
 You got to lose a lot of ships to explore the galaxy

471
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,000
 But it is through that loss it's through that struggle

472
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,520
 That you gain knowledge

473
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,840
 That is a little

474
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,520
 soulless to the men and to the aliens

475
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,840
 Who die

476
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,560
 And no one knows where they are

477
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,360
 Little soulless to them

478
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,440
 But for civilization as a whole

479
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,160
 We wouldn't be where we are today if it wasn't for the explorers

480
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,800
 Who risked their lives

481
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,280
 To get us here

482
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,480
 Exploring as part of human nature

483
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,840
 And from all the stories we've covered

484
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:20,120
 All of the visitations all of the events all of the crash landings

485
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,800
 I think exploration is part of alien nature as well

486
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,640
 And hopefully that common theme unites us

487
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,000
 And that our comrades deaths will not be in vain

488
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,520
 And we will all someday explore the stars together

489
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:52,520
