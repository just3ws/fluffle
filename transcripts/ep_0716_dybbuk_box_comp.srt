1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 What would you do if you were out on a picnic with your toddler?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And he looks into the distance and goes, "There's a dead woman over there."

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 What would you do in that super specific instance?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And I want to know about anything else.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And then we take a look at the ever-evolving saga of the Dibbock box.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 An item so cursed that even going near it can cause unspeakably bad luck.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Well now there is a terrifying new chapter to the legend of the Dibbock box.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 What some consider to be the most cursed item on the planet.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 [Music]

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 We got a ton of stuff to cover today.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And I just drank a coke.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I got a ton of caffeine and I normally don't drink caffeine.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So I'm doing finger guns.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 And I'm doing finger guns at one of our legacy Patreons.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 We got Corey Dennis. Come here.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Shootin' at him. He's like, "Great. Why not me on the episode with Hyper Jason?"

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 This is going to be awesome. You bet it is.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Corey, you're going to be our captain, our pilot, in this episode.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Just help spread the word about the show.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Really, really appreciate it when I see people talking about the show online.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Corey, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed on out to the Madera County Mountains in California.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 [imitates gunshots]

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Corey driving us in this old timey Jalopy.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Up over the mountains, it totally breaks down.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 We have to push it half the way, but it's okay.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Eventually, we're going to get to Shut Eye Peak in the Madera County Mountains.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 It's July 21st, 2021. Super recent story. This happened.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 There's a man. His name is Jake Gorba.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 He's there with his wife, Victoria, and they have three kids, the Gorba Clan, the Gorba Group.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 They're having, they have three kids. They're up there. They're eating lunch.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Um, nom, nom, nom, nom. And their three-year-old son, Caden, he's eating his food.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And then he starts talking to someone, and the family's like, "That's weird. We totally isolate him."

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 He's on restriction. He can't talk to anyone. Why is he talking?

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 He's talking to someone. He's not talking to anyone in the family.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And he keeps going, "There's a lady over there. There's a lady over there."

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 See? And he's pointing out this spot in the meadow.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And he's like pointing. And he goes, "There's a lady over there."

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Apparently, he turned into Woody Allen. Somehow, there's a lady over there.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And he describes this woman, what she looks like, because they don't see anything.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 This is one thing I don't get. Like, people are always telling me their kids are seeing spooky stuff.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And I'm not like a huge fan of like kids and kids in general.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But if your kids are like pointing off into the void, your kids are pointing off into nothingness and being,

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 there's a woman over there. Your child sounds like Woody Allen all of a sudden.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 There's a woman over there, and she has blue hair.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And she's wearing a black shirt, and she has blue jeans on.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Look, but she's dead. The kid gets all creepy.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I don't think the kid was saying it in the most menacing way.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 I think it was probably just like, "Yay, I'm a three-year-old." However, three-year-old sound.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Apparently, they all sound like Woody Allen.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 He describes her. I don't even know what I'm doing in the voice.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 This is what Caden sees. He sees a woman lying face down in the meadow.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And it's, the woman is talking to Caden.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 But really, what he's seeing is she's lying face down in the meadow.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 She has blue hair, a black shirt, and blue jeans. And he says that her legs are bent up.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Like, she's laying face down, but her legs are sticking straight up in the air.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Like, I'm assuming it like the knee. Which is just weird, right?

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Which normally, when I walk away from a dead corpse after I've done my job,

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 it's totally prone. No, she's like, laying face down, but her legs are sticking straight up in the air.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And he's telling them she needs her help. She needs her help, but she's dead.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 She's over there, but she's dead. I can see her. Can't you guys see her?

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And Jacob and Victoria, they don't see anything over there.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And Caden is insistent. There's a dead woman over there.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I don't know how many times I have to say this, there's a dead woman over there.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 She needs her help. Well, what are you gonna do, right?

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 You practice delicious picnic. You're gonna finish eating your food.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Eat your egg salad sandwich, Caden.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Ignore the decaying woman. Ignore her haunting spirit in the meadow.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 You have to finish eating. Anyway, so they... I don't know.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Actually, I don't know. I don't know they finished their picnic.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Because again, like, if you're hanging out with kids, kids are always seeing weird stuff.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 You're gonna be like, "Oh, no, ghost."

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Because then every time you went to McDonald's, they'll be like, "Oh, no, there's a giant purple..."

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 "Is Grimmis still leaving around in McDonald's?"

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Okay, totally getting off the point.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Cory Dennis is already getting the Jason Jalopy he's driving away.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Okay, I gotta focus. The point is, is that...

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 I don't... The point is, I don't know if they finished their picnic.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 But they did eventually come down from the mountain.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And they're thinking about it. Jake and Victoria thinking about it, and they're like,

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 "Dude, that was so weird that our son is such a weirdo."

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 But maybe he saw something.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 So they find out... They post this on Facebook.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 They find out that a woman matching that description, blue hair included,

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 went missing in that area.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Now, in that area is a bit of a stretch.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 She went missing in the mountains.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 I couldn't find any proof that she actually went missing on Shud-Eye Peak.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 But they were able to find...

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 There was a woman named Sandra Hughes, who had gone missing in June 2020, almost over a year before this.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And Sandra Hughes, she... When she went missing, she was up camping in the mountains.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 She went missing. Her family goes, "Listen, she is a trained outdoor survivalist."

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 She's not the person who'd be like, "Oh, no, the weather's slightly turned gray.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 I'm just gonna crawl into this ravine and die."

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 This isn't a place she would have lasted a while up here, even on her own with no surprise.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But the police have been looking for her. She's been a missing person for over a year.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And Jake and Victoria put this on Facebook and actually got the attention of the Madera County Sheriff's Office.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And the Madera County Sheriff Corporal Chris Williams contacted the family and wanted more information about this sighting.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And actually sent two deputies up with Jake and Kayden to see what they could see in the meadow.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And you know those cops... You know those cops are kind of like, "Oh, you know, on the one hand, this might be a break in a cave."

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 "On the one hand, we might be hanging out with the sixth sense kid."

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And this is going to be a break in the case and the kid will be like, "Look, there's a ghost."

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And then like the ghost like goes, "This is where I'm buried."

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And also, "This is who killed me and all this stuff."

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Or, "It's just a nice fun drive up into the mountains."

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Like, I don't know if the cops on duty actually thought anything would come of this, but nothing did come of this.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 They drove up there and they looked around and they didn't see anything.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 They saw a cross. They saw a little cross with a dog collar around it.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 That's a callback to yesterday's episode.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Point is, they smell yogurt coming out of the ground.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 The point is, is that a little kid saw a ghost.

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So that's spooky, right? That's paranormal.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 They didn't find anything. They didn't find anything, unfortunately.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So the case of Sandra Hughes continues. No one knows what happened to her.

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 There were other sightings of her, apparently.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 At one time, like, she went missing in June 2020 on August 9th of 2020.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Two hunters were going through the mountains.

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 They saw a woman leaning against a tree. She was thin.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 This thin woman kind of leaning against a tree and the two hunters passed her.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I'm assuming they're in a truck or something like that.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 They said she didn't flag us down. She obviously saw us.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 She didn't flag us down. She didn't seem to stress.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 She was just standing there and when they drove into town, they saw a missing persons flyer for her.

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 They said she was much skinnier when they saw her than just a month ago when the picture was taken.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 So was that Sandra Hughes?

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Was that an early viewing of her ghost?

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Like, who knows?

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It's just such a weird mystery. Now it's going to become a paranormal legend.

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 People are always going to talk about this meadow and the ghost sighting and things like that.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 But did a little boy actually see her?

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 This is a story that I think...

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 I mean, this is probably the wrong episode to talk about this, but this story sounds legit to me.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 The kid may have actually seen something and you know what I mean?

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And then the story played out how it was and the police say, "Well, we don't have any other leads, so let's go investigate it."

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It sounds fairly legit, but you never know.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 In the world of the paranormal, let that be a reminder.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 You never know if somebody is telling the truth.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 No matter how noble it may be or how innocuous this story may seem, you just don't know.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I just stand there, we're standing there in the meadow and I'm just staring at you silently and you're like, "That's weird, Jason.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Is this going somewhere? Like, why are you just staring at me after you're saying we don't know if we can trust people?"

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Corey Dennis, let's go ahead and hop in that carbonar copter.

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 We trust you to fly us out from shut-eye peak.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 We are headed to Portland, Oregon.

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 [imitates gunfire]

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 We covered the Dibbock box back on episode 67.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Do you believe that? That's almost 700 episodes ago.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 650 episodes ago.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 We covered the St. John's in Sauston when I said that.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 No, I love doing this show.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Episode 67, we talked about the Dibbock box, but the Dibbock box had been a story that I've carried with myself for years.

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I remember the first time I heard about the Dibbock box.

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It was a rainy day in Sacramento.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I was listening to the podcast Mysterious Universe way back in the day.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 It had to be like 2003, 2004, something like that.

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 The rain was pitter-pattering out the window, and it was just so well done.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 The Mysterious Universe can really weave these stories.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 You're telling the story, and at the end of the story, they go, "You know, just by hearing about the Dibbock box, you're part of the curse."

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And I remember it really scared me.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 It really was a very interesting story, terrified me, and I thought, "Wow, the Dibbock box, what a cool addition to the paranormal lexicon."

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 We have this whole new story about this Dibbock box.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 I covered it on an episode, and it's super well known.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 There's been movies made about it. There's been lots of articles written about it.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 So I didn't really cover it when I was doing the show, even though I love the story of the Dibbock box.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It was fairly well known, and I covered more obscure stuff.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I covered it on episode 67 because it became a current event.

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Rapper musician Post Malone.

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Is he really even considered a rapper?

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Musician Post Malone, he had a string of bad luck.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 You guys remember this? His airplane tire blew out, and he got in a car accident.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And then his former house got home invaded or something like that.

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And the idea was that he was visiting with his friend, Zach Baggins, one of the most famous ghost hunters in the world, and host of the Ghost Adventurers show.

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 He was saying that was Zach Baggins.

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Zach Baggins was mucking about with the Dibbock box, which is in his possession now.

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 He has like this ghost museum.

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And Post Malone simply touched Zach Baggins shoulder as Zach Baggins was touching the Dibbock box, and all this horrible battle that came across Post Malone.

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And I haven't listened to episode 67 in a long time.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I believe I was fairly skeptical about the idea of the battle that being attacked.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Maybe it wasn't, but it was like, ooh, spooky, spooky, Dibbock.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 I don't remember exactly what path they took on that episode, but I do remember loving the story of the Dibbock box.

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I still love the story of the Dibbock box, and now we have new information about how this legend is growing, but I'm going to do a quick overview for you.

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Not everyone knows what the Dibbock box is, but let's talk about it very, very briefly.

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It's a cursed box, and this is the story.

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 It was originally owned by a Holocaust survivor, and a Dibbock is, in Jewish tradition, it's a restless spirit.

191
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And a Dibbock box is a prison for that spirit.

192
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 So this guy, his name was Kevin Manis.

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 He said back in 2001 he bought this Dibbock box in Portland, Oregon, and he was told this was from a Holocaust survivor.

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Do not open it. Do not open it. It has some bad juju in it, and just don't open it.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 We'll sell it to you. We'll be irresponsible and sell you this, really.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 But don't open it, and Kevin Manis opens it.

197
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And that kind of started this whole worldwide phenomenon of this Dibbock box legend.

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 It got so bad that people -- and this is where we're coming at here -- just by hearing about the Dibbock box, people say that they have bad luck.

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 People say by even viewing photos of the Dibbock box, as one guy said, his computer caught on fire.

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Just by viewing photos of the Dibbock box.

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 2001, Kevin Manis purchases this Dibbock box, and is hit with wave after wave of bad luck.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Him and his friends, people who are around the Dibbock box, keep having nightmares of this old woman with sunken eyeballs stalking them through their dreams.

203
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 His sister complained of cabinet doors in her house opening and closing. It's causing poltergeist activity.

204
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 It was linked to two different suicides, and then he gives it to his mom --

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Listen, man, you may have problems with your mom, but if this is -- this causes two suicides, if it's even caused one suicide --

206
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 I don't know why you do this, he gave it to his mom as a gift.

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Shortly afterwards, she had a stroke, and she did an interview with this show called Paranormal Witness, and she says that, you know,

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 "I knew when I opened the Dibbock box, like, 'Oh, this caused two suicides! Thank you, sonny!' This is my favorite gift ever."

209
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 She goes, "When I got the Dibbock box and I opened it up, I felt like this icy evil presence come out of the box.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Like, I knew I shouldn't have had this. I knew that my son must be trying to kill me, and I had a stroke."

211
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So Kevin Mannis sells it on eBay, and he writes this long description detailing all this stuff --

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 the bad luck, the story of what he found in it. I think there was like two coins, a piece of hair,

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 some other stuff that was supposed to be part of this Dibbock box ritual.

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 He goes, "I opened it up. I wasn't supposed to. There's like this etching on the back and blah blah blah."

215
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And then all this bad luck, and my mom had a stroke and two suicides. How would you like to buy this?"

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And he ends up selling it on eBay to this new owner. The new owner also feels very cursed by it.

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 They sell it, fairly quickly afterwards, to a man known as Jason Haxton.

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Now, Jason Haxton gets it, also gets hit with bad luck, but writes a book about it.

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Writes a book called "My Unlucky Day" with Ramona and Beezus.

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 He writes this book -- it wasn't a kid's book, I don't think it was a kid's book.

221
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 It's a Papa book. You turn the page and an old woman with sunken eyes comes out at you.

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 He writes a book about it, and him and Kevin -- Kevin Mannis --

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 are consultants on the movie "The Possession" in 2012.

224
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 I remember the Dibbock scared me so much. The story scared me so much.

225
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I didn't even want to watch that movie.

226
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And I did. I did watch it. It was okay. It was a decent movie. I give it three possessions.

227
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I only got possessed three times.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 It was an okay movie, but I remember I didn't want to watch the movie. I didn't want to watch the trailers.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 The story of the Dibbock really, really scared me.

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 The director of "The Possession," Old Borendahl.

231
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 He's not one -- that sounds like one of the dwarves from "Lord of the Rings."

232
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 No, he actually is like -- I think he's a Russian director. He directed "The Night Watch."

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 He directed the movie. He said crazy stuff started happening on the set.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 He said, "Five days after the movie wrapped filming, a fire broke out and destroyed all the props in the film."

235
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 So this box, this Dibbock box, is legend at this point.

236
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Like, in the paranormal community, this is way up there.

237
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I can't -- I don't want to say it's as big as, you know, Area 51 or something like that, but it's super well-known.

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 It's super, super well-known. It has movies based on it.

239
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Zach Baggins, biggest ghost hunter in the world, buys it from Jason Hachston, because he's the last person to have it, for an undisclosed amount.

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 We don't know how much he bought it for. And he puts it in his museum of curiosities.

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And he has called it the most cursed item on Earth.

242
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 This Dibbock box is just so powerful that if Post Malone is anywhere near you and you touch it, Post Malone will have bad luck.

243
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 So the legend has grown. The legend has grown. That's really where most stories end.

244
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 It turns out, two things. Two things have come to light recently.

245
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 One, this is only one of ten Dibbock boxes.

246
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Kevin Manis has seven more of them.

247
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Now, he's given one of these Dibbock boxes to Zach Baggins. So now Zach Baggins has two.

248
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Kevin Manis has six. And Kevin says, "Here's the full story.

249
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 There was some Jewish cabalist wizards during World War II, and they saw the threat of Nazi Germany.

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 So what they did was they summoned a demon, a Dibbock, to be specific, to help the Jewish people fight off the Nazis.

251
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 But they couldn't control it. This Dibbock became too powerful and began, it was like, "World War II walks away from World War II.

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I'm sure everything will be fine, guys. He walks away from World War II and he's doing all these other disasters like he caused the Korean War.

253
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 He's always just like, "Come on over here, North Korea. It sure is sunny down in the South Korea."

254
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 He caused all these other catastrophes and didn't really help the Jews out during World War II.

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 So these Jewish cabalist wizards had to capture the Dibbock and he's so powerful they had to separate him into ten different boxes.

256
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 So Zach Baggins has two of them. Kevin Manis has six of them, and the other two cannot be found.

257
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 They cannot be located. Kevin Manis says no one knows where they're at.

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 If all ten of these items are brought together, if all ten of these boxes are brought together, the demon will be unleashed.

259
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 If you thought Post Malone's tire blowing out on his plane was bad, just wait until the demon devours us all.

260
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 That recently came to light. And then another big piece of the Dibbock legend came to light. It's fake.

261
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It's 100% made up. 100%. The whole story is fraudulent.

262
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 This is fascinating. I'm going to read you quotes. This isn't Jason being skeptical and saying, "Well, I found..." No.

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Kevin Manis. Let's dig into this because this is so fascinating.

264
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I read an article recently on inputmag.com and the website seems to be very tech geared.

265
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Tech in like cutting edge technology, computer stuff, a little bit of fashion.

266
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 It seems to kind of be a lifestyle magazine. It's not set up to be a skeptical magazine or anything like that.

267
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Inputmag.com, there's an article by Charles Moss and it exposes with Kevin Manis' help the fraud that is the story of the Dibbock box.

268
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Now, I'm telling you, I'm going to be reporting this with a big smile on my face and I'm going to be laughing about this,

269
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 but also to be very... I didn't want to sugarcoat this. I was fooled too.

270
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Like, I was scared of the Dibbock box, right? I was scared of that legend.

271
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I didn't want to watch the trailer or the movie. You know what I mean? So I'm not saying, "Oh, look at me. I'm skeptical."

272
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 I was... Not only did I get suckered into the story, I enjoyed the ride along the way, but let's take a look at this.

273
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 It's so fascinating. Back in 2015, the first hint that this was fraudulent kind of got revealed on Facebook.

274
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And again, it wasn't some person going, "Well, demons don't exist." Or, "That's so foolish." You know, that's easy skepticism.

275
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Kevin Mannus made a Facebook post back in 2015. What happened is there's a web series called Haunt Me, or Haunt and Me, like Haunt Main.

276
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And it's a bunch of kids, a bunch of teenagers, early 20s running around ghost hunting. I've never watched a show. It sounds fun, right?

277
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 We always want to encourage people going out having fun ghost adventures.

278
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Trademark, I'm going to train work that name, Ghost Adventures. But you know what I mean? Like, we want to encourage that.

279
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 There's nothing wrong with that. I've never seen a show. But anyway, so in an episode, they start talking about a Dibbock's.

280
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And they start talking about, like, this Dibbock's contains, like, this level demon and blah blah blah blah blah.

281
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And Kevin Mannus gets upset by that. And so he posts this back in 2015 on the Haunt Me's Facebook page.

282
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Quote, "I am uniquely qualified to make these..." He started off by saying how you can't say this about the Dibbock's and stuff like that.

283
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Quote, "I am uniquely qualified to make these claims as I am the original creator of the story of the Dibbock's, which appeared as one of my eBay posts back in 2003.

284
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 The idea that Dibbock's boxes have some kind of history prior to my story, and the idea that a Dibbock's could contain anything other than a Dibbock,

285
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 along with any deviation to the type of contents I created to be found inside of a Dibbock's, is laughable at best."

286
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 How about this, he continues in his quote, how about this? This is super important. How about this?

287
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 If you or anyone else can find any reference to a Dibbock's anywhere in history prior to my eBay post, I'll pay you $100,000 and tattoo your name on my forehead."

288
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 So they were adding to the mythology, they were adding to this different type of Dibbock's and he's like, "No, I know what's in the Dibbock's because I created it. I mean, I discovered it."

289
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And people read this and they go, "Wait a second, if this is a real thing, how could you make such a bold claim?"

290
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 You say, "Nowhere in history was a Dibbock's ever there until I set it, until my eBay post."

291
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 So people, again, there's always people who are skeptical, then there's people who believe in the paranormal but are open to skepticism and then there are people who believe anything.

292
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And after that Facebook post popped up, people started to get suspicious. How can you claim if it's real if you can say it didn't exist before my eBay post?

293
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Charles Moss is interviewing him because he had recently heard about this Dibbock story like earlier this year.

294
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 He's interviewing him and first off, Kevin Manis has kind of given him some weird answers and he's kind of like messing stuff up and he's kind of getting some details foggy.

295
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And then he asks, "You know what Charles, let's do another interview, but next time really I want you to push me. I really want you to push me and get the BS out of the way."

296
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And so Charles Moss does some other research and does start interviewing him again and during the second interview we have this back and forth.

297
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Quote, this is a quote from Kevin Manis, "I am a creative writer. The Dibbock box is a story that I created and the Dibbock box story has done exactly what I intended it to do when I posted it 20 years ago."

298
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Which is what I ask him. Which is to become an interactive story in real time.

299
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And then Charles Moss goes on a write, "Though Manis did buy the wine cabinet at a yard sale, it was from an attorney, not the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor.

300
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 The carving in the back of it is my carving," Manis says. "The stone that was in the box is something that is a signature creation of mine also.

301
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Make no mistake, I conceived of the Dibbock box, the name, the term, the idea, and wrote this creative story around it to post on eBay."

302
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 The reporter, being a good reporter, begins to interview Kevin Manis' friends and they knew it was a fraud as well.

303
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 One of them said, "Oh, the hair in the box that was my hair." Even his mother was in on it. She didn't fake the stroke. She really had a stroke, but she lied.

304
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 He goes, "That was a mother's love for her to lie on paranormal witness for me." She made it up. 100% the story was made up.

305
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Charles Moss couldn't verify that there were two suicides that were linked to it. One guy supposedly knocked it over and then him and his boss killed himself.

306
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 He wasn't even able to verify that those suicides took place. And Kevin Manis goes, "Oh no, no, no, the suicides are real, but here's the thing.

307
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 When you have someone who has lied on the record for 20 years, fascinating, fascinating." It's 100% a lie.

308
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 So fascinating. Now what's happening is Jason Hachston is saying, "Listen, what I think is that he did buy the box from an attorney.

309
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Maybe his story's true, but what I think is he might have used Kabbalah magic himself to curse the item."

310
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And Kevin Manis is like, "No, I didn't do that. I didn't do that." It's all made up.

311
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 But it's interesting because we have all these people with financial motives based on it.

312
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Kevin Manis sold the box for a couple hundred dollars, but then he's a consultant on this movie.

313
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Jason Hachston wrote a book and is a consultant on this movie and sells it to Zach Baggins.

314
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And everyone has to kind of save their own butt. Now Jason Hachston goes, "Listen, I did get a string of bad luck after I got this thing."

315
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Kevin Manis says, "I told Jason Hachston the story wasn't real. I told the guy who bought it right after me.

316
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 I called him up and said, 'Listen, I'm sorry. I made the story up.'" And then when that guy sold it to Jason Hachston,

317
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Kevin Manis called him up and said, "Listen, just so you know, and I told the previous guy this story's fake."

318
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 So he's saying Jason Hachston knew it was a fraud. But Jason Hachston goes, "No, no, no. All this bad luck really did happen to me."

319
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 You know, the story's so fascinating on so many levels, but of course we're waiting to hear what does Zach Baggins have to say about this?

320
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Because he's the guy who's out the most. Who in the world was Kevin Manis and Jason Hachston before this happened?

321
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 But Zach Baggins, this is the centerpiece of his museum. He's done episodes about this, about this Dibbock's.

322
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 His professional reputation is on the line. What is he saying about this?

323
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Very, very interesting. Here's a quote from Zach Baggins.

324
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 "Owning the Dibbock's, there have been countless documented experiences people have had with it.

325
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Not just from myself, but my museum staff, my fellow crew members, visitors, and most..." This is so ridiculous.

326
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 "...and most notably Post Malone. Who cares, right? Post Malone, great singer.

327
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 That'd be like saying, 'Come and visit my world-famous roller coaster. It's Neil deGrasse Tyson's favorite roller coaster.'

328
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Who cares? He's not a roller coaster expert. I don't understand why you would evoke the name of Post Malone."

329
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 It's not helping your argument, but yet he does. Most notably Post Malone.

330
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And he goes on to say, "I don't believe that this is the full truth. I think there is so much more to the Dibbock's,

331
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 and regardless of its origins, it is very much cursed and evil."

332
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And then he goes on from there. I'm not surprised there are more controversy and conflict keep arising from it.

333
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Dibbock's always raised questions and intrigue, and this adds to its narrative. The narrative is that it's fake.

334
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And this is what I find so fascinating about the story. And again, I would broaden hook, line, and sinker.

335
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 The Dibbock's box, the Dibbock's box story scared me. I find this super fascinating.

336
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 But the origins of it, he says, "Regardless of its origins, no. The origins of it is what makes it the story."

337
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 You can buy one of these wine cabinets, these little wine cabinets that he turned this into.

338
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 They sell them. This isn't a rare thing. You can buy one of these wine cabinets.

339
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 It was the lineage. It was the story. It was what makes it unique.

340
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Really, it's just a wine cabinet at this point. And then any bad luck that you come across, and you go, "Oh, that's weird.

341
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 I went to this wine cabinet one day, and two weeks later, the wheel fell off my bicycle."

342
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 You want to make that connection. We have good and bad luck all the time, and we interact with new things constantly.

343
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Every time we're walking on the street, imagine how much your brain would break if every time something,

344
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 every time you had bad luck, you had to think of every new thing you encountered in the past day or two.

345
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 You're walking through a story. They got a new bag of Oreos on the counter.

346
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Now, if those Oreos came from John Wayne Gacy's kitchen, that's the origin of them.

347
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 They're super stale. But that'd be the origin. That'd be the lineage. That would make them curse.

348
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 There was that thing I heard. I think it was on the parapod. They said, "If you had two knives, two kitchen knives,

349
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 or maybe a sofa king podcast." It was one of the two. They're both great podcasts.

350
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 But if you had two kitchen knives sitting on a counter, the one on the left is an ordinary...

351
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 They had the exact same package. They're exactly the same kitchen knife.

352
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 The one on the left is a kitchen knife, and the one on the right is a kitchen knife that was used to murder a man.

353
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Is there a difference between those two knives?

354
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 So that's what we're looking at when we're talking about the Dibbock box. If the origin is fake, then it's worthless.

355
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 It's a fraud. It's fake.

356
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So there's two routes. I had a good chuckle about this whole thing. I didn't invest a ton of money in it.

357
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 I just invested time, and I do still think it's an interesting story.

358
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And to me, this makes it more interesting, because we have a conclusion.

359
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 But there's a couple different routes you could go through. One, the easiest route, and I'm sure it's the one that you guys are thinking about.

360
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 I bet you it's the one that'll go down, is that the Dibbock box was just a box, but because everyone was scared of it, we turned it into a tulpa.

361
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Like, we collectively made the Dibbock box real.

362
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 So you're right. The Dibbock box itself was just a wine cabinet with a bunch of junk in it.

363
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 But because everyone believed there was a demon in it, we made a demon go in it.

364
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 That's the easiest out for anyone involved.

365
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 They could say, like, Jason's Cabala Magic...

366
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 If Kevin Mannus really let Jason know it was fake, then that's an issue that Zach Baggins needs to take up with Jason.

367
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 But you could say, Jason could say, "Ah, Cabala Magic was used to curse this thing."

368
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 But I think collectively going forward, they'll go, "The Dibbock box was fake, but we've made it real through the tulpa process."

369
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 You could go that route.

370
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 But here's the thing. Paranormal researchers are always complaining about not being taken seriously by the scientific community.

371
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 All the time. I hear it all the time. How come they won't believe that my spirit box, or my EVP meter, or my temperature gauge that's showing that it's colder in here...

372
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 How come this isn't legitimate stuff? How come we get dismissed when we're Bigfoot researchers or UFO hunters and stuff like that?

373
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Well, stuff like this doesn't help, right? Stuff like this doesn't help when someone comes down and goes, "I've been defrauding you for 20 years. This stuff doesn't help."

374
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 But I think about it like this. We don't need to be like the scientific community. We need to be better than a scientific community.

375
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 So let me explain. The scientific community is rife with fraud as well.

376
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And we all know it. We pretend that it doesn't exist. We pretend that the sugar companies aren't paying for studies to show that artificial sweeteners give you nerve damage.

377
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 We pretend to think that cell phone companies aren't telling scientists what? No, no. Cell phones don't cause brain tumors.

378
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Any scientific study you see has been paid for by somebody. Either it's a private group or it's a college that gets its funding from the government or private groups. It's all bought off.

379
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Now, some of it's less bought off than others. But science is rife with fraud. It really is.

380
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 The difference is that pure science can tell the truth, but so often cigarettes are healthy for you until they're not.

381
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 I could list every... oh no, eugenics, that's the way to go. That's what science believed for the longest time and now it doesn't.

382
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And 40 years from now, people are going to look back at the science of today and be like, "You guys were barbarians. You guys actually believed that?"

383
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Anyways, so we need to be... as paranormal researchers, we need to be better than science. We need to call the fraud what it is. Fraud.

384
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 In the business... this is what I think. In the world of business, you call out fraud and you shut it down. And then that's it.

385
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 There are people who still believe in old-timey science stuff. They're just completely dismissed. The flat earth is perfect.

386
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Stuff that's been completely dismissed by science. There are people who still believe it. There are people who still believe that this dibbic box is cursed.

387
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 There's no one who still believes that Bernie Madoff was a good businessman. But we need to do that. We need to call out the fraud when we see it.

388
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 And Zach Baggins could easily say... Zach Baggins could easily come out and say, "I was duped. This dibbic box is not real."

389
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And I'm gonna sue everybody. I'm suing Jason Haxson if he really knew. I'm definitely suing Kevin Manis because he was perpetrating it.

390
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 I'm suing him because that's what we need for paranormal research to go forward. We can't keep piling on lies.

391
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 I really think that's what he should do. I think that would be a huge move for paranormal research because science has a hard time doing that.

392
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Science will hold on to that truth and hold on to that grant money as long as they can and keep pumping out the same study as long as this company, this conglomerate, or this group is paying them.

393
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 They'll keep saying stuff even though it damages people, even though it can hurt us. They'll keep pushing it until other scientists come forward and either because they've done good science and say, "That's wrong."

394
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Or because another group pays them off to run a study.

395
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 But we need to be better than that. And Zach Baggins, I would love it. I would have so much respect for you if you came forward and said, "This is fraudulent. I was duped. Everyone was duped. We believed it because that's what we do. We love hearing these stories and we love believing them.

396
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 But this was fraud. I'm suing them and let's move forward. And I'm gonna keep this into my museum because this is an important part of paranormal research that we get misled.

397
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 I think that would be great. And I think it would send a message to scientists. I could care less.

398
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 I've never been one of those people who's trying to find proof so I can prove to some nonbeliever that ghosts exist or do. I don't honestly care.

399
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 But if we want to send the message to, yes, we're gonna hold ourselves accountable just like the scientific community does, just like the business community does.

400
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 If it fails, if it fails the smell test, if it's fraudulent, let's call it out. And sue. And sue these people who committed this fraud. And that would just be a great thing.

401
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 But I don't think that's how the story's gonna end. I think it's gonna be, it was a tulpa now and we created it in our head.

402
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 And does that mean the other 10 boxes really exist out there? How far does the tulpa extend? I mean, you know what I mean? It's just easier sometimes to just say, "It came over. We lost. We lost this one, but we still believe in ghosts. We still believe in the paranormal."

403
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 And so on and so forth. I don't think that's gonna happen. I think they're gonna try to spin it that it is really haunted. Maybe it's even more haunted because the lie caused the curse to grow or something like that.

404
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 I find this story absolutely fascinating. I love it when stories have a conclusion. This conclusion is better than 10 Dibbick boxes being brought together and a demon bursting out of them and ruling over Earth as Zach Baggins as his own personal pet.

405
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 It's much better than that one. It's not as cool as if the Dibbick box itself was real and there was a demon trapped in there. Obviously as a believer in the paranormal and as a fan of it, that'd be cool.

406
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 But it does have an ending. It was fake and we have to acknowledge it was fake and to go forward as a parent. If people keep pushing that this is real, it just makes us all look super goofy. It really does.

407
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 You'll never really be able to prove the existence or non-existence of Bigfoot or UFOs unless they make themselves available.

408
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 But if something comes forward that we all talk about and it is knowably false and then we continue to talk about it, we don't need science to dismiss us. We don't need the normal world to dismiss us. We're asking to be dismissed.

409
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 If something is knowably false, provably false, and we still pretend that it's real, we deserve to be dismissed. And I don't think we deserve to be dismissed.

410
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 I think we know a lot about the world. I think we know a lot of the secrets that other people ignore. They just don't want to acknowledge that are there. But we have to know when to call it quits.

411
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And I think this is the time when we go, "We were wrong. We got fooled." Me, Jason Carpenter, I got fooled by the Dibbick box story. It was too good to be true.

412
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 But I will continue to look for the next story and the next story and the next story because I do believe the truth is out there, even though we may run into a few lies along the way.

413
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
