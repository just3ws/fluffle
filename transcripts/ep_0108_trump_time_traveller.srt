1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 A mishmash of Thanksgiving-based conspiracies, maybe?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
 And...

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,600
 Is Donald Trump a time traveler?

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,000
 The evidence may surprise you today on Dead Rabbit...

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,800
 Today on the Thanksgiving episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:29,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day out.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,800
 You're having a great day too.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,800
 It is the Thanksgiving special of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
 I'm actually recording this at five in the morning the day before Thanksgiving.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
 I can't sleep. My ear woke me up.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,800
 Plus I got an email from a listener named Shakira Shakira.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,600
 Cracking a joke and the email woke me up.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,000
 I had the alert on my phone.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,800
 But Shakira Shakira, who has given us great stories in the past,

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,200
 has also given me some great resources for an upcoming story.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,200
 So despite the fact that your email woke me up, thank you for the information.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
 But that's neither of them there.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,200
 So it is our Thanksgiving episode now.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,200
 I was bemoaning the fact that there weren't any Thanksgiving stories or like...

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,200
 Thanksgiving is the middle child of the winter holidays.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
 We have Halloween, we have Christmas.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,400
 And Thanksgiving kind of gets the short shift.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
 There's no "Shrift."

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,200
 There's no like Thanksgiving songs.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
 There's really no Thanksgiving movies.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,700
 I guess like Planestreams and Automobiles might be.

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,000
 That might take place during Christmas though, I'm not for sure.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 But I was like, there has to be some Thanksgiving conspiracies out there.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Now I did find a story about a Thanksgiving ghost, about a young woman.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
 This is so bizarre.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,800
 This woman, it's like she killed herself over love.

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,400
 And then her ghost is haunting this hotel.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,500
 And then I read a little bit more of the article and they're like,

35
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,400
 "She was married, but she was having an affair."

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,600
 And I was like, "Okay, well, whatever."

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,600
 So that story, and anyways, the ghost just floated down the hallway.

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,800
 Like those aren't really compelling ghost stories.

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,300
 And then I was like, "Well, maybe there are some good murders."

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,000
 And we're true crime podcast, maybe there are some good murders on Thanksgiving.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,400
 Come on, give me a horrible tragedy for my episode.

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
 And I looked and there was a couple family slaughtered,

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,400
 but surprise, surprise, most family slaughter stories take place during Christmas.

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,400
 And there was one interesting story on Thanksgiving,

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,700
 where there was this guy, his house kept getting burglarized.

46
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,400
 And he was like, "I'm tired of my house getting broken into."

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
 So he, this doesn't deserve a whole segment,

48
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,700
 but it's definitely worth talking about for a moment or two.

49
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,600
 So there was this guy, and it's super vague, but it's in the show notes.

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,500
 So there was this guy, it was Thanksgiving.

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,000
 This is like in the 90s, I think.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,400
 I should have been more prepared for this segment, but he's sitting in his basement

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,100
 and he got tired of his house getting broken into all the time.

54
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,700
 And these two teenage people who had been breaking into his house came in

55
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,900
 and one of them started walking into the basement.

56
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,300
 And he shot him with his rifle and the body tumbles down the stairs

57
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,200
 and he finished him off.

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,200
 And then at that point, the burglar's cohort/cousin, a young woman,

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,400
 came to the top of the stairs and the homeowner shot her too

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,400
 and she tumbled down the stairs and then he put the gun underneath her chin,

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
 blew her brains out.

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,100
 Now this is notable for two reasons.

63
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,900
 One, the entire thing was recorded because his house was getting burglarized,

64
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,300
 though, you know, for a long time.

65
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,700
 He had cameras everywhere.

66
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,800
 He had audio recording, video recording.

67
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,600
 So they, the police were able to watch from the moment that people were outside the house

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,300
 to the point where he was shooting them.

69
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,800
 And because it was recording the whole time, they had video footage and audio footage of him

70
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,400
 kind of muttering to himself.

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
 He waited in the basement all day long.

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 It was like six hours.

73
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
 He was just in the basement.

74
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,100
 He knew they were going to try to break in.

75
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,400
 And so he argued that he had the right to shoot them because they were in his house.

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
 The castle doctrine is a thing in a lot of states in America.

77
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,600
 You can defend your home.

78
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,700
 The police argued that he was lying in wait.

79
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,600
 He was down there for too long with his rifles ready to go, which is different.

80
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,100
 And the fact that he was, well, and the fact that he was kind of muttering in the darkness,

81
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,300
 like practicing what he was going to say afterwards, and the fact that he finished them off.

82
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,800
 Like he shot him and then he like, as they were laying on the ground, he shot him more times.

83
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,300
 That's Thanksgiving related because he did it on Thanksgiving and he didn't call the police

84
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,000
 till the next day.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
 He goes, I didn't want to ruin your Thanksgiving.

86
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,200
 I wanted you guys to have a good meal.

87
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,500
 He was eventually found guilty of two counts.

88
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,600
 I think it was first degree because he was lying in wait, which is a special circumstance.

89
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,200
 He got life in prison for that.

90
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,000
 But yeah, that, even that was that I kind of stumbled across that I was expecting more family massacres.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,900
 There were a few.

92
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,200
 I'm not disappointed that didn't happen, but there were a few nothing notable though.

93
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,700
 Okay, so I found a couple of tidbits of Thanksgiving trivia that you can share with your family.

94
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:53,400
 Okay, so here's some, here's some Thanksgiving based interesting facts and not like how much

95
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,700
 a turkey weighs when it dies or stupid stuff like that.

96
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,500
 But so we know the traditional story of Thanksgiving was the pilgrims were like, oh, I don't have nothing to eat.

97
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,100
 And then the Native America showed up as like, here's some food and they ate and they had a good time.

98
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,800
 And then there was like other stuff, you know, like people started slaughtering each other afterwards.

99
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
 The original family massacre.

100
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:24,400
 But you had a long period of time where that was just kind of a nice story to tell the idea of actually like Thanksgiving being a holiday didn't really pop up until like the mid 1800s.

101
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,100
 There was an author named Sarah Joseph Buell Hale.

102
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,600
 I'll just call her Mrs. Hale.

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,500
 Anyway, so or we'll just call her Sarah because I like that name.

104
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:40,600
 So Sarah wanted to really like she thought Thanksgiving needed to be this time where people get together and celebrate family.

105
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,100
 And she was an author and she would write scenes in her books where everyone's like, isn't Thanksgiving great?

106
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,900
 And the holiday didn't even exist.

107
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:55,300
 But she was putting it into her books and it was like people eating all this food, having a great time and readers were like, oh, that would be really awesome.

108
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:03,700
 If this was real, she was the equivalent of it be the equivalent of watching stars and being like, man, I wish I had a lightsaber, but she did that with Thanksgiving.

109
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,400
 So she was really pushing for Thanksgiving to be this holiday.

110
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,600
 Now, during the Civil War, Lincoln was thinking, you know what, this actually might be a good way to bring the people together.

111
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:24,500
 Like both sides, if we had this time where people were like, let's appreciate what we have and let's everybody knew that Sarah was doing this big.

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:32,500
 So Lincoln didn't just like come up with this out of the blue, but people were talking that this could be a good moment for people to just take things for what they have.

113
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,600
 You know, it was national tragedy.

114
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,500
 Everyone's dying, all sorts of stuff.

115
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,200
 And so Sarah wrote Lincoln a letter saying, I think Thanksgiving would be a great idea.

116
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,500
 Like we could use this to help bridge the gap between the North and the South.

117
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,700
 She was just, that's all she cared about was getting Thanksgiving made.

118
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:55,900
 Well, anyway, so Lincoln, before he even got that letter, thought, you know what, we need to have this national day that brings the country together.

119
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,600
 And this was Abraham Lincoln's version of Thanksgiving.

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,400
 This is what he had in mind for a day of giving the thanks.

121
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,900
 He wanted it to be a day.

122
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,200
 This is in his words, a day of public humiliation, prayer and fasting.

123
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,700
 So you would basically, you wouldn't eat.

124
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,600
 It's the opposite of Thanksgiving.

125
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:26,900
 You wouldn't eat and you would publicly humiliate yourself and you would start with the people acknowledging the supreme government of God and bowing in humble submission to his chastisements.

126
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,900
 They were then to publicly confess and deplore their sins and transgressions and beg for forgiveness.

127
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:39,900
 I don't see that holiday ever really taking any, that wouldn't work.

128
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,300
 I don't want to know your public sins, man, because people are weird.

129
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,200
 I don't want to know.

130
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,600
 I mean, if obviously if a friend came to me and said, hey, listen, I'm going through some trouble, that's fine.

131
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,200
 But I don't want to like, I don't want to be walking on the street and seeing people publicly humiliate themselves.

132
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,100
 And actually, that's interesting.

133
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,900
 Why do you want people to publicly humiliate themselves and publicly confess their sins?

134
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,700
 Because really, it's kind of the same thing.

135
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,900
 Because people are going to confess stuff that is quite humiliating.

136
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
 That's why they kept it secret in the first place.

137
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,200
 Could you, Jesus, can you imagine the town?

138
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,200
 Like we have town, everyone comes out into the town for Halloween and everyone comes out into town for Christmas.

139
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,300
 I don't want to walk down the street while people are being like, oh, I'm so bad.

140
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,200
 I ate all that food.

141
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,600
 Oh, I'm so bad at cheating on my wife.

142
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,300
 Please God, that would be horrifying.

143
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,200
 But that was Abraham Lincoln's vision for the original Thanksgiving.

144
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,500
 So while you're eating that turkey or doing whatever you do on Thanksgiving, it's probably eating turkey.

145
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,400
 Imagine, imagine it could be far worse.

146
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,100
 Abraham Lincoln got his way.

147
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,600
 Oh, and, fun note, I found this out too.

148
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,200
 Abraham Lincoln was the first president to pardon a turkey.

149
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,500
 This is conspiracy.

150
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,400
 Abraham Lincoln was the first president to pardon a turkey.

151
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:04,600
 So, and then nobody else pardoned, no other president pardoned the turkey until John F. Kennedy.

152
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
 No joke, no joke.

153
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,100
 John F. Kennedy, first president since Lincoln to pardon a turkey.

154
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,200
 Three days later, he was shot in the...

155
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,400
 Okay, but one more Thanksgiving related tidbit.

156
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,500
 I found this absolutely hilarious.

157
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,400
 So Thanksgiving always kind of gets brushed under the rug.

158
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,900
 If this was a part of Thanksgiving today, it would be the most popular holiday on the planet.

159
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,800
 So, so...

160
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,700
 Okay, so on Thanksgiving Day, they had this thing basically called ragamuffin day.

161
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,200
 So what you would do, this was in New York.

162
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,000
 This is in New York, but you would get people in New York would get frying pans.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Let me stop laughing here.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
 They'd get this is very serious.

165
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
 This is a very, very serious topic.

166
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:01,700
 People in New York on Thanksgiving Day, they would take their frying pans and they would throw pennies in the frying pan and heat them up.

167
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
 Make them really, really hot, right?

168
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,100
 People were poor back then.

169
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,800
 So if you saw a penny on the ground, you pick it up, especially...

170
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,600
 Especially children, because pennies are worth more back then.

171
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,700
 A child sees a penny on the ground and you pick it up, you have good luck.

172
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
 Isn't that what they say?

173
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,900
 It's money.

174
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,100
 Kids love money.

175
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,200
 So they would take the frying pan and heat up the pennies.

176
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
 Then they would call them red pennies.

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
 They'd throw them onto the street.

178
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,000
 They would throw them out their window and rain down on the street.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,200
 Kids would pick them up.

180
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,400
 Like you would literally watch kids would dress up for ragamuffin day.

181
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,100
 It was part of Thanksgiving Day.

182
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,900
 The kids would walk down the street and their costumes, you would see them coming and you'd be like, "Hurry up, Martha. Hurry up."

183
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,300
 She's like, "I'm trying, Eddie. I'm trying to get them hotter."

184
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,600
 And then as the kids were coming closer, you throw the pennies out the window.

185
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,000
 Now, I don't know why the kids didn't catch on after the third or fourth year.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,700
 That when pennies are falling down from window, they're probably red hot.

187
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,900
 But anyways, the kids would reach down, pick them up, horribly burn their hands.

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,200
 Why don't we do stuff like that anymore?

189
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,800
 Wouldn't that be... I mean, yeah, I get it.

190
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,000
 It would get sued and little kids would burn hands.

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
 But you know, you'd get those calluses.

192
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
 It would be good for working in the mines or in the smelting pits back then.

193
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,500
 So red hot pennied it.

194
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,700
 Ragamuffin day.

195
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,600
 Ragamuffin day.

196
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,500
 We should bring that back.

197
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,700
 I just found that.

198
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
 So, okay.

199
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,200
 Kids got horribly hurt.

200
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
 It's still kind of funny.

201
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
 Actually, they get horribly hurt.

202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,800
 You blister your finger.

203
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,100
 I mean, unless I guess you picked it up, put it in your pocket and you were in gasoline in your pants.

204
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,000
 But that's it.

205
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,500
 That's really all I could find that was conspiracy related for Thanksgiving.

206
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,800
 But it's a couple little facts you can tell your relatives.

207
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
 Flip your nephew a penny.

208
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,600
 Just be like, "Uncle, why are you wearing those oven mitts and have that bag of pennies?"

209
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,700
 You're like, "You'll see.

210
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,600
 You'll see."

211
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
 Now, I do want to say this.

212
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,700
 One of the main things that people have problem with when they get together for Thanksgiving is people talk politics.

213
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,000
 So people come.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
 Your family's coming from all over the country.

215
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,500
 They're all in different geographical areas.

216
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
 You travel there.

217
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,300
 They're going to have a different political view than you.

218
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,700
 You guys live in different areas.

219
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,000
 You guys have different education.

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,700
 You guys consume different levels of media, so on and so forth.

221
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,700
 And of course, you know, it's been what, two years since the Trump election?

222
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,800
 So there's going to be a lot of that still.

223
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
 People are still talking Trump.

224
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,900
 Trump.

225
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,600
 Now, depending on where you're at, one of your relatives is going to show up and be like,

226
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,100
 "Trump!

227
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,600
 Oh my God.

228
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,500
 He's a fascist.

229
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,800
 He's the next Hitler, blah, blah, blah, blah."

230
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,400
 And you're just going to try to roll your eyes.

231
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,700
 Or they're going to show up and be like, "Magga!

232
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,800
 Yes, build a wall!

233
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,300
 Lock her up!"

234
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,200
 And you're just going to be like, "You're going to roll your eyes."

235
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,300
 Depending on where you're at on the political scale.

236
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,400
 But I have an antidote for wherever you're at there.

237
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,200
 That whenever your relative is talking about Trump pro or against, you can look him in the

238
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,600
 eye and say, "Did you know Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

239
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,800
 Make sure to tell him you listen to it on Dead Rabbit Radio.

240
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,100
 You know, get the word out.

241
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,900
 But you'll be able to look at that person and go, "Did you know that there is actually

242
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,400
 possible proof that Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

243
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,500
 And then just sit back and they're going to look at you and they're going to say,

244
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
 "Teach me what you know.

245
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
 Teach me.

246
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
 Teach me these things."

247
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,400
 Okay, so let's get into this.

248
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,200
 This was really bizarre.

249
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,000
 Now, it's funny.

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,600
 So I got an email from a listener a couple of days ago and they asked me if I had ever

251
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 looked into this before and it was from Andrew.

252
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,200
 Andrew emailed me and I said, "This was originally the first episode of the podcast.

253
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,800
 Before I knew what type of format I was going to do, I did a test run of the show and it

254
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,900
 was, 'Is Donald Trump a time traveler?'"

255
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,900
 And it was funny because then I had completely forgotten about it because technically I had

256
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
 covered it.

257
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
 Like in my mind, it was a story that I'd already done.

258
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
 I recorded a whole like 10 minute segment.

259
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,740
 I think it's lost the time now, but then I went on and did episode one.

260
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,800
 So I kind of had covered it in my mind.

261
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,300
 He brought it back to my attention.

262
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,740
 So you're thinking, "Jason, is Donald...

263
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,400
 What possible proof do you have that Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

264
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,440
 My first answer to that would be like, "What proof do I need?"

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,160
 I mean, he's defied all odds, but there is proof.

266
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,240
 Or a series of coincidences that seem very, very odd.

267
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,840
 So let's go back.

268
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,200
 Let's visit the city of New York.

269
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
 It's November.

270
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,400
 A highly unpopular outsider candidate wins the presidency of the United States.

271
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,620
 And the city's on fire.

272
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,540
 Not literally, but with people riding.

273
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,700
 The entire east side is in a state of uproar.

274
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,860
 Police officers are moving through the street, warning people to stay off the streets as

275
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,540
 these riots go on.

276
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,060
 Mobs of vast sizes are organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists.

277
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,920
 And they threaten to plunder and to spoil the houses of the rich who have wronged and

278
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,320
 oppressed them for so many years.

279
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,240
 The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob.

280
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,600
 Would the troops be in time to save it?

281
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,040
 Now that's not my opinion.

282
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
 That's not from a news report.

283
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,600
 That is from a book that was published in 1900 called The Last President.

284
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,600
 The book The Last President is the third in a series of books about a little boy named

285
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
 Barron Trump.

286
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,120
 There was an author back in the 1800s named Ingersoll Lockwood.

287
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,200
 He wrote a lot of children's books, but these three books have come to attention recently.

288
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,200
 The first book was The Travels and Adventures of Little Barron Trump and his wonderful dog

289
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
 Bolger.

290
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,680
 Oh, no puppy.

291
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,800
 1893, he wrote the sequel Barron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey.

292
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,360
 So these were basically like Jules Verne type stories, Alice in Wonderland type stories.

293
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,600
 And then the third book was 1900 or The Last President was the name of that book.

294
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,520
 So Barron Trump is this little boy.

295
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,080
 So we're going to go, don't worry, this gets even weirder.

296
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,480
 The character of Barron Trump in the book, his name is like William Trump, Barron is

297
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 his title.

298
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,080
 And I guess I should say in case you don't know, Donald Trump's son is named Barron Trump.

299
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,000
 Donald Trump, that is the name of in real life Donald Trump's son.

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,240
 And in the book, the character is named Barron Trump.

301
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,840
 I guess I should have said that.

302
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,280
 Not everybody knows the name of Donald Trump's family, but yeah.

303
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,320
 So that's in the 1800s, there was a book series called about a kid named Barron Trump.

304
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,880
 Today Donald Trump has a real kid named Barron Trump.

305
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,440
 And you're like, maybe he read the book.

306
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,240
 Maybe he just named this kid after the book.

307
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,440
 That's fair.

308
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,360
 It's far more reasonable than what we're going to get into.

309
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,880
 This character, Barron Trump, lives with the Trump family.

310
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,360
 They live on Fifth Avenue in New York City in Trump Castle.

311
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,000
 Donald Trump in real life originally lived in Fifth Avenue in Trump Tower.

312
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,080
 Barron Trump has a buddy, a mystical guy named Don Fum.

313
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,840
 Now Don is like a signatory, it's like a sir.

314
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,800
 He's a Spaniard, so it's not like his name's Donald.

315
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,880
 There's this mystic guy named Don Fum who helps open these portals for Barron Trump

316
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,240
 and his dog, Bolger, to go on these adventures.

317
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,640
 No joke.

318
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,200
 He opens these portals and leads them to Russia.

319
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
 Okay.

320
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,560
 Again, just coincidence, coincidence, coincidence.

321
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
 Okay.

322
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,600
 So, in real life, Barron Trump does not have a dog named Bolger.

323
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,240
 They actually didn't even have a dog until Trump got elected president.

324
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,520
 They did get a dog when they moved to the White House.

325
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
 And Barron Trump loves this dog.

326
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,480
 The dog's name is Patton, like General Patton.

327
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,080
 Now, this is a bit of a stretch.

328
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,920
 But again, it's just odd.

329
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,800
 General Patton was a general during World War II and he was instrumental in one of the

330
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,120
 greatest Allied victories of World War II.

331
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,640
 Battle of the Bulge.

332
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
 Bulge?

333
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
 Bulger?

334
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,800
 Now, to be fair, before you guys shut off the broadcast, I didn't make that connection.

335
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,880
 I didn't make that connection.

336
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
 I read it on a website.

337
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
 So, don't blame me for that ridiculousness.

338
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,840
 And you're going to say, Jason, is that all you're going to do is you're going to read

339
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,200
 us coincidences between a children's book series and Donald Trump?

340
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
 But I'm not.

341
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,120
 Because that is honestly not even the weird stuff.

342
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,520
 Now we're going to get weird.

343
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,280
 This theory first came to my attention before I even heard about the kids' books.

344
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,560
 This theory that Donald Trump is a time traveler has predated his election.

345
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,080
 It was back in like the summer of 2016.

346
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,640
 Maybe even a little bit earlier.

347
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,560
 Was when this theory started popping up.

348
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,360
 And there's some, again, some weird stuff behind it.

349
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
 Nikolai Nikola?

350
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,160
 I just called him Nikolai.

351
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,200
 Nikolai Tesla is a famous inventor for inventing weird stuff.

352
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,640
 He was a contemporary of, believe it was Edison.

353
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,680
 Tesla was always working like he was working on free energy.

354
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,360
 He was working on wireless energy so nothing would have to be plugged in.

355
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,240
 He was working on remote control.

356
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,280
 He invented a remote control boat.

357
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,400
 I mean, we're talking like way back in the day.

358
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,640
 He died like in '43.

359
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
 And he had a long career.

360
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,640
 So we're talking like 1910s, 1920s, 30s.

361
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,360
 He was working on all this stuff.

362
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,280
 During World War II he was talking about inventing a death array.

363
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,400
 A thing that could just blow stuff up.

364
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,600
 So he was always working on all this crazy stuff.

365
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,800
 And there's been a ton.

366
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,040
 He's like the Tesla coil, you know, the electrical coil thing.

367
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,200
 Very very fringe and connected to things like the Philadelphia experiment that made the

368
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
 boat disappear.

369
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
 Just a lot of fringe science.

370
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,680
 The guy definitely was ahead of his time and he wasn't a crackpot.

371
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,760
 Not all of his theories panned out, but he definitely knew his stuff.

372
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,600
 But he ends up dying and the government really wanted his research.

373
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,280
 So they had this group back then called the Office of Alien Property.

374
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,960
 So if you died in America, but you weren't an American citizen, these guys would go

375
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,040
 take your stuff.

376
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,160
 They went in, they took all of his notes, all of his notes.

377
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,080
 To this day we don't even have access to a lot of the stuff that they took.

378
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
 There's a lot of...

379
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,880
 His research that we know is missing because it was mentioned in other places, but we have

380
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,080
 no record of it.

381
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,440
 Office of Alien Property then takes all of...

382
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,520
 They don't understand it.

383
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,240
 They're like, this is just high level math, high level science, we don't get this.

384
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,440
 Let's go to MIT.

385
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,800
 They can read this nerd stuff.

386
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,600
 So they give it to a guy at MIT named John Trump.

387
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,960
 Donald Trump's uncle.

388
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,920
 Donald Trump's uncle, John.

389
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,560
 Donald Trump's uncle, John, now has access to some of the most fringe scientific theories

390
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
 of the time.

391
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,640
 And honestly, probably even in our time.

392
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,560
 We have nothing even close approaching wireless energy.

393
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,280
 He said, John Trump said, "Ah, there's nothing in these documents."

394
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
 He didn't say that.

395
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,520
 John Trump basically said, "There's a lot of great things in these documents, but a

396
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,800
 lot of it's fringe stuff."

397
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,360
 I'm paraphrasing, but the question is this.

398
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,960
 This guy who was just outside the box, 100 years ahead of his time or more as a scientist

399
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,960
 dies, all of the stuff that he came up with, but he didn't have the means to do, gets

400
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,520
 given to this other guy.

401
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,400
 He goes through it, takes out a couple pages, turns it over to the government, says, "Yeah,

402
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,720
 I mean, here's what it means, but it's a bunch of stuff."

403
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,040
 And like I said, we know documents are missing from Tesla's work.

404
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,520
 John Trump's favorite, I guess it goes without saying.

405
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,920
 I don't know why I'm pausing like this.

406
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,760
 John Trump loved his nephew Donald.

407
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,800
 So here's the theory.

408
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,480
 This is where the theory started.

409
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,080
 That John Trump discovered the secret of time travel through Tesla's work and then gave

410
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,520
 those documents to his nephew Donald.

411
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,280
 Donald then uses those documents to build a time machine and go into the future and into

412
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
 the past.

413
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,600
 So the books were inspired by his adventures or possibly even, this gets weird when we

414
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:59,360
 talk about time travel, or even possibly that in the future his son will go back in time

415
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,120
 and the books are inspired by the life of the actual Baron Trump.

416
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 Could be very likely.

417
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,160
 Or maybe Baron Trump goes back in time and writes them himself.

418
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,520
 Oh my God, time travel.

419
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,440
 But anyway, so let's get back to Donald Trump.

420
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,480
 So this is the theory that came out during the election.

421
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,440
 Donald Trump has access to this time machine.

422
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,880
 And again, this theory popped up before the books were even on anyone's radars.

423
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,000
 The theory is, now this is where the theory splits, because there's a couple different

424
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,280
 ideas of what happens.

425
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,960
 I'll tell you what, if I buy into the theory that Donald Trump is a time traveler, this

426
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,320
 is what I think happened.

427
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,320
 Donald Trump goes into the future, everything's awesome, he uses his knowledge of the future

428
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,000
 to come back in time and make a bunch of money.

429
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,480
 But there's one thing that happens in our timeline that didn't happen when he first

430
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,520
 visited the future, and that was 9/11.

431
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,640
 Donald Trump lost a lot of friends in the attacks on 9/11.

432
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,880
 And that's when the Playboy mindset had to kind of flip for him, because he saw what

433
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,560
 the world could be.

434
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,320
 And this event happened, he didn't foresee and he lost a lot of people because of it.

435
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,040
 So it started to kind of change his mindset.

436
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,120
 Now you're thinking, okay, we have that aspect of it.

437
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,640
 Now you're thinking, okay, Donald Trump, fine, built the time machine, goes into the future

438
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
 9/11, does all that stuff.

439
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
 Now what?

440
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,000
 Well, like I said, it gets weirder.

441
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,240
 Pence, Vice President Pence, is also a time traveler.

442
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,880
 Did you know that?

443
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
 Make sure to tell your relatives that too.

444
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,240
 Not only is he also a time traveler.

445
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,880
 He's not from our timeline.

446
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,600
 He's from the future.

447
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,960
 He's from a future where everybody--

448
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
 [laughs]

449
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,280
 I'm not making-- okay, when I say I'm not making this up, I hope you know that there's people

450
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,600
 who believe this.

451
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,160
 I'm not sold on this idea, but the photographic evidence is a little weird.

452
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,960
 Mike Pence comes from a future where everybody looks like Mike Pence.

453
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,520
 That's what people are gonna look like in the future.

454
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,360
 Now I will say this, Mike Pence, he's a big dude.

455
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,200
 Like, I saw a picture of him, he is like a yoked up, or he's just a broad-shouldered

456
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,520
 guy, but anyway, so I don't know what that has to do with anything.

457
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,000
 So Mike Pence, in the future, everyone looks like Mike Pence.

458
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,320
 That's what humans are gonna look like, and he's like from far in the future.

459
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:16,920
 He traveled back with Donald Trump to say, okay, to avoid a terrible future, I have to

460
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,960
 become president, but they aren't gonna vote for me because I'm a big ol' weirdo-looking

461
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,320
 tank dude.

462
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,840
 So Donald Trump, you run for president, use your knowledge of the future so you'll know

463
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,840
 what other people are gonna do, and then I'll be your vice president, and then when you

464
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,720
 leave, I'll take over, and we'll have this utopian world where everyone looks like Mike

465
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
 Pence.

466
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,760
 And so, again, this is a legit theory if you believe.

467
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,560
 Donald Trump goes, okay, great.

468
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,880
 So Mike Pence, his time machine's better than Donald Trump's time machine because it was

469
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,040
 actually built in the future.

470
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,520
 So Mike Pence can actually send, like he can go back, say, five minutes to talk to himself

471
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,920
 five minutes before and send that Mike Pence back while Mike Pence still exists in the

472
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
 future.

473
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,400
 It's this weird causality loop.

474
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,360
 So there's multiple Mike Pintzes.

475
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,800
 Everyone looks like Mike Pence in the future, but also there's multiple Mike Pintzes in

476
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,840
 our timeline, and it's the same Mike Pence.

477
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:20,480
 And for whatever reason, Tim Cain's wife is a Mike Pence.

478
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,920
 Tim Cain's wife, Tim Cain was Hillary Clinton's vice presidential candidate.

479
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,480
 Tim Cain's wife is a Mike Pence.

480
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,920
 Now, they do look an awful lot alike.

481
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,040
 They really do.

482
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,240
 It's super bizarre.

483
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,400
 Now, again, I was reading this conspiracy theory before the election, and people were like,

484
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,280
 there's no way Trump is going to lose.

485
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,800
 There's absolutely no way he's going to lose because he's from the future.

486
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:52,440
 Okay, the Mike Pence, the planet of Mike Pintzes, whatever, the Baron Trump book, that's weird

487
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,560
 coincidences and things like that.

488
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,880
 But I got two more pieces of info for you.

489
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,840
 One, the day that Donald Trump won the Illinois primary during the election, lightning struck

490
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,360
 Trump Tower.

491
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,200
 Was that a moment where he was going to correct the time screen where he didn't win Illinois?

492
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
 Probably not.

493
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,120
 He actually kind of had the nomination sewed up by the time he won Illinois.

494
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
 But it is an interesting coincidence.

495
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,280
 However, Donald Trump famously said about his daughter Ivanka, if she wasn't my daughter,

496
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,040
 I'd be dating her.

497
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:33,760
 Well, one theory is that in an alternate timeline, Ivanka was born to another man and another

498
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,440
 woman.

499
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,600
 And they were dating, but because Donald Trump has been going back and forth so much in time,

500
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,320
 he ended up marrying the mother of Ivanka.

501
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,840
 Now it's his daughter.

502
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,280
 So now he can't date her.

503
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
 And you know what's so funny?

504
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,720
 I'm going to close the episode out like this, because I have really no other way to wrap

505
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
 this up.

506
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,680
 I've complained about other conspiracies in the past, like World War II was fake.

507
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,360
 I'm like, this is total nonsense, nuclear bombs or whatever.

508
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
 Nuclear bombs don't exist.

509
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
 Yeah, whatever.

510
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,080
 So there are certain conspiracies that I view, as when I cover them, I'm almost discouraged

511
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,080
 from researching more conspiracy theories, because I look at how misinformed some people

512
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,020
 can be to really think World War II never happened.

513
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,920
 This conspiracy fills me with a childlike joy.

514
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,720
 I just find it so amusing.

515
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,640
 And I think it's amusing because, one, it's a conspiracy theory that's fairly lighthearted.

516
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,880
 Like, again, love and reheat them.

517
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,280
 It's an entertaining theory.

518
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,000
 This doesn't have to involve holocaust not happening.

519
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,160
 It doesn't have to involve, you know, 9/11 was an inside job.

520
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,960
 It's not like this horrible, it doesn't have this huge death toll.

521
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,960
 A lot of the conspiracies are fairly like, dark.

522
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,480
 This one's kind of lovey-dovey and cute, in a way.

523
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,640
 It's a conspiracy theory that we're basically living through right now, because again, if

524
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,240
 he's a time traveler, it's going on.

525
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,000
 I have to admit, I read this conspiracy theory, like I said back in 2016.

526
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,800
 I can't look at Mike Pence without thinking there's a planet of them somewhere in our

527
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
 near future.

528
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,360
 I think it's just a fairly fun one.

529
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,880
 And again, the next time someone starts talking about politics and you'd rather not just be

530
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,600
 bothered, you'd rather just do something else, just turn around, look them in the eyes and

531
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,880
 say, "Did you know Donald Trump is a time traveler?"

532
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
 And then say nothing.

533
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,140
 And to make it even funnier, when they go, "What did you say?"

534
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
 Just turn back around.

535
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,480
 Just don't acknowledge them.

536
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
 So we did it.

537
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
 Thanksgiving episode.

538
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
 There we go.

539
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,400
 Hope I gave you some good topics to talk about over your Thanksgiving meal.

540
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,800
 Everyone have fun.

541
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,040
 Enjoy everything that you're doing, whether you're with your friends and your family,

542
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,400
 whether you're just hanging out by yourself, which is what I'm doing, whether you're doing

543
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,040
 stuff online, whatever.

544
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,840
 Just have fun for the day.

545
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,080
 Be safe.
