1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 Is it possible that a predator has learned to disguise itself in human skin?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then sleepwalking, 4% of all Americans sleepwalk at some point in their life.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And we've even heard stories about people committing brutal crimes while they were asleep.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 But something even more brutal, even more dark can happen when you close your eyes and fall asleep.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 *Midusa's voice* "I'm a wild big doll"

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon, Madusa Buzzcutt.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Madusa, thank you so much for supporting this show.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 That's a pretty dope name. I kinda get credit where credit's due.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Madusa Buzzcutt, it sounds like some sort of military operation.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Sounds like something like, sounds like some operation the CIA would come up with.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Go hunting bad guys, Madusa Buzzcutt, that's a great name.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 So Madusa, you're gonna be our pilot this episode?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Whatever vehicle we take, you're gonna be in charge of.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Just help get the word out about the show, really, really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Reviewing the show, talking about it with your friends, all those things help.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Madusa, first off, we're gonna use a vehicle we haven't used in a while, the Carpenter Caboose.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Have we ever used that? Is that something that we've had before?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We're leaving behind the Jason Station.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Choo choo!

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And we're taking the Carpenter Caboose.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Choo choo choo choo.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And we're leaving behind Oregon.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We're headed out to Manhattan in New York.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 In New York, Choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo cho

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Now it's 5pm, it's not super late, it's actually rush hour. So there's a bunch of people bustling about.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 This woman's walking through Penn Station, and she takes the escalator up to the street level.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And when she gets up to street level, about 30 feet away she sees someone who immediately catches her attention.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Now even though it's New York City, it's rush hour, the place is bustling.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 This man, she is drawn to this man.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 One of the things that draws her attention to him is he's 6'7", which is unusually large for any human, right?

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It's not the NBA playoffs, it's the subway system.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So even if even the NBA playoffs, she'd go like, "Oh, that guy's kind of tall."

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 He's 6'7", he's just standing there.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And the way he's standing, she immediately knows something's off.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 He has broad shoulders, he's standing there with his back arched, and his elbows are pointed backwards.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And she notices he's looking at all of the people who are walking around.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 He's motionless.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 He's standing there, arched back, elbows pointed out.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Just standing there, staring at everyone.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 She says, "From his angle, it looked like he was only really able to see the tops of people's heads."

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Like he was purposely taking this bizarre stance, he's looking at the top of people's heads.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And now she got the idea that he was trying to choose one of them.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 She looked at his face for only a second.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 She immediately turns, looks at the ground, and begins walking away as fast as she can.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And as she's leaving the scene, she gets the sensation that if she turns around, she's doomed.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 That fear washes over her.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 If she turns around and looks again at this man, it's all over.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 She says his face was light gray.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 She said it was almost white.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Not like white Caucasian, but white, chalky, in human life.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 He had a thick brow, and even in that brief glimpse that she saw of his face directly,

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 she says his eyes seemed like they could stare right through you.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And she turns, she leaves the area.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 She never looks back.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 The story is so simple, and that's what makes it creepy.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 This again came out of--think about it--Docs.com website, I go to a lot.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And they got it from the New Fork website.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And New Fork is the National UFO Reporting Center.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 So although this story didn't actually involve UFO, some sort of strange phenomenon took place here.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 The reason why I think the story is particularly chilling is when I was reading it,

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 and even when I was repeating it to you, that posture reminds me of a vulture just standing there,

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 looking for someone to choose.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It was standing there with a purpose.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 It wasn't a junkie passed out.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 It wasn't just someone waiting for their train.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 It stood there in that pose staring at people for a purpose.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And again, it also reminded me of a predator in the sense that it being so still,

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 it almost blends into the background.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 How many predators do we know?

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Like a Venus flytrap, obviously tigers are going to keep chasing you,

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 but even then, like a cougar doesn't sit there and it's not playing the bongos in the jungle.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 It sits and it waits and watches you pass by.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 It knows where you are before you know where it's at.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 It waits for the best moment to attack.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 That's what this felt like.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 It's interesting because this is not the middle of a wheat field in Kansas at 2am.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 This is a bustling subway system.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 This thing very well could have been, you could say it's alien,

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 but I almost figured that's like almost downplaying it.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 It almost feels like I kind of mentioned in the introduction,

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 a predator that has disguised itself as a human, that has taken human form.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 The statuesque tall man out of place, out of place.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Everyone else is going about their business.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 They read on the newspaper, they're thinking about what they're going to do for dinner.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 They're trying to figure out what else is going on.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 They're passing by this 6'7 man. They're too busy.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 They're looking down at their watch, at their shoes.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 They're not taking in everything.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 It was just this woman who could see this thing.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Camouflage in plain sight.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Took a form of a human but got it wrong.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Clay, gray skin, 6'7.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 But the eyes of the predator remained.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 If it was some sort of creature and it's standing there and it's looking for a suitable victim.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 If it figures someone actually uncovered its disguise,

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 that woman was in great danger.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Everyone else passing by, a luck of the draw, if this creature makes a move on them.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 But if this thing, whatever it was, felt like it could be exposed,

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 it may have seen out of the corner of its eye a woman stare,

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 slightly recoil, turn and walk away.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And this creature standing there looking at all these other people walking by.

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And then it thinks, did she see me?

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Does she know what I am?

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Its head slowly turns and watches her walk.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 If she turns around, if she looks again, she saw me.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Then I don't have a choice of who to kill tonight.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I have to kill her.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 The whole subway station is full of people walking by.

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Totally unaware of these events that are going on and he's looking at her and she feels the fear.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 She knows if she turns around, she will not make it home.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 She leaves the area, later she reports this to the National UFO Reporting Center.

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Where is this thing now?

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Does it have the same form or has it perfected its ability to camouflage into human society?

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Is it shorter now, the skin colors a little more on point?

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It doesn't stand in such a bizarre way.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 But the eyes are still there, the menacing eyes that can stare right through you.

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 If you're ever in a crowd of people and you see someone that seems a little off, standing there in the corner,

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 you can't really put your finger on it, but something is not right about them.

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Will you be able to resist the temptation to turn back around and take another look?

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Because if you do, you might uncover the truth that there really are predators disguised as us,

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 looking for the right victim, and you just made that choice a whole lot easier for them.

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Interesting spooky story, Medusa Buscutt, let's go ahead and hop in that carboner copter.

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And as we leave behind New York, this woman's chasing, she's like, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I looked back, I looked back."

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 We'll save her, you know, because we're helpful.

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 We save her. Tall guy shaking his giant tall fist at us as we fly away.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 We're flying away, we've saved this woman.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 I actually want to segue into this to a Dead Rabbit Recommends.

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I saw this movie a long time ago.

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 It really hits all of the things that I like about movies, self-contained horror movie.

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 That's really the big one. I like movies that take place in one location.

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 There's a movie called Super Hybrid. This is a creature feature, so it's not like this super cerebral horror movie,

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 like Resolution or Interior or Rewind. I've recommended all of those in the past.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 So, it's a really interesting creature feature.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 It's going to sound stupid when I tell you what it is, but it's about an octopus that learns to...

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 This is a good movie. It's a good thriller.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 It's about an octopus who learns how to disguise itself as a car.

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And that's kind of, I think, pretty much given away in the beginning.

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 That might be a first act twist, but the whole movie takes place in this auto-wrecker yard.

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It's like this guy owns this high-rise parking garage type place.

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And he tows cars and he brings them here, and they tow this monster car into this facility.

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And it's funny, because as I was watching it, I was getting low-grade panic attacks,

148
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 because the boss is one of the worst bosses ever.

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Not just the fact that people are getting murdered by this monster car, and he's like,

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 "I'm taking that out of your paycheck." You bled all over those other cars.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 He's just such a... I don't like to curse, but he's just such a bad boss.

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Like, just the first 20 minutes of him, maybe the first half hour, the first act,

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 is just him being... We've all had bosses like that.

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 If you're a boss like that, watch that movie, and then maybe you'll stop being a boss like that.

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I was just watching it being like, "Ugh, this reminds me of like 15 jobs I've had."

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And that is actually a testament to the acting and to the writing.

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Like, the character, the boss, was super irritating, and I couldn't stand him, he was on screen.

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 To me, that's a testament of good acting and good writing, because it was so realistic.

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 But it's called Super Hybrid. It's just a really fast-paced horror movie.

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You have this octopus disguised as a car, and it basically, they explain that, you know, it just hyper-evolved.

161
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 It used to disguise itself as like shells, the species of octopus.

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 It used to disguise itself as shells, or change the color to the floor, and then they're like...

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And then it just, I mean, I know that's kind of like, it's goofy, but just, I thought it was really well done.

164
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's a very well-shot, well-directed, well-acted, well-written horror movie with a ridiculous premise,

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 but it's very enjoyable. And the creature is near indestructible, because not only do you have to basically fight a car,

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 and you're trapped in a three-story parking lot full of a bunch of damaged cars, this thing looks like a damaged car,

167
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 not only do you have to try to destroy a car, the thing is wicked smart, as they say in Boston.

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 It's not the most high-faluting horror movie, but I saw it like four or five years ago, and I still think about it.

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 It still pops in my head. Even reading this story, I was having flashbacks to that, and I was like, oh yeah, Super Hybrid.

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So that, again, is a sign of a good creature feature when you're thinking about it years later, because a lot of them are pretty disposable.

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 But we know the carbonicopter is not an octopus, or is it? Medusa Busca might be one for all I know, has eight arms.

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 That's why Medusa can fly the carbonicopter so well. We're leaving behind the dead rabbit recommends of Super Hybrid.

173
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 We're leaving behind the creepy man in New York City, one of three million.

174
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 We're headed out to Pickering, Ontario.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 This was actually recommended to me from Fabio Nurbon, a via Gmail. He's actually sent me some other stuff.

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I don't recall what it was at the time. I think it was the possessed family who was doing the Ouija board and huffing paint.

177
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 That was a while ago, and some other witch story in Italy, I believe.

178
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 He's sent us some good stuff over, and this one I had never heard of before.

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So tip of the hat to you, let's go ahead and land that carbonicopter. We're in Pickering, Ontario.

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 It's May 4, 1987. Kenneth Parks, he's 23 years old. He's married.

181
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Things have been going pretty good in his life until recently. He started to gamble a lot, and then that's fine, right?

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 But then you get into the part where you become a gambling addict, and then you end up losing money, and then you end up owing money.

183
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 That's the bad part of it, right? If you can gamble responsibly, that's cool. Some people can't.

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Some people can't even run responsibly. They get runners high, and then you get addicted to running.

185
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 I mean, sure, that's pretty cool. You can run a lot if there's every zombie apocalypse.

186
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 I'm just going to crawl on your back, and you can take me everywhere.

187
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 But we think you have a problem. That would be really hard to do an intervention for someone who's addicted to running, because you have to catch them first.

188
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 They're like, "Aha!" Running away.

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 But anyways, that's not this guy. This guy had gambling debts, and then he had to pay off the gambling debts, so he began embezzling money from his job.

190
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And then the job finds out he gets fired.

191
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 So one night he falls asleep. He's watching SNL, watching Little Saturday Night Live.

192
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 [Sigh]

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Fall asleep.

194
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 His eyes flood her open, and he's standing in a police station, and he looks down, and his hands are cut to the bone.

195
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 He sees large gashes, muscle torn, and that unmistakable red-white color of human bone.

196
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And he begins screaming in the police station, "My hands! My hands!"

197
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 But the police are actually more concerned with something he said right before he began screaming about his hands.

198
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Just minutes earlier, police officers are filling stuff out, doing paperwork and stuff.

199
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And a man walks in, bloody hands.

200
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 The cops look up, and the man goes up to him and says, "I've just killed two people. My God, I've just killed two people."

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And the officer said, "They're watching this guy. He comes in. He's all bloody."

202
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 They believe him. They believe him, right? Because his hands are all cut to pieces.

203
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But as the cops are talking to him after he admits to killing people, they can tell he wakes up.

204
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Like, there is a moment where he says that, and then as the cops are processing what's going on, his demeanor changes, his voice changes,

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 and he realizes for the first time, Kenneth realizes for the first time, his hands are cut to pieces.

206
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 So even the cops are like, "We noticed the shift. It was as if he woke up."

207
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Sleepwalking is pretty common. I'm not gonna bore you with the details, even though I did a bunch of research on it.

208
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 One in three adults sleepwalk at some point in their life, and three to four percent of Americans sleepwalk regularly.

209
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 So that's pretty common. That's pretty common.

210
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 It's usually men, and it usually runs in families.

211
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Two percent of adults admit to being violent in their sleep.

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And people who steady sleepwalking, sleep issues go, "We think it's actually higher than that."

213
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 My grandpa, I remember hearing a story when I was a kid, my grandpa once was asleep,

214
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 and he thought that people had broken into his house and were trying to attack his kids.

215
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 So he began beating up my grandma, who was in bed next to him.

216
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 She's laying there, and the next thing you know, he's like, "Get away from my kids!"

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And he's punching my grandma. She has to first defend herself and then wake him up.

218
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 That was never reported to the police. That was back in the '60s.

219
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 That was never reported to the police. She wasn't hurt. She didn't go to hospital or anything like that.

220
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 So that's why sleep specialists think the number is way higher than two percent.

221
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 They said, "Most cases, if the other person is injured at all, they just go to the hospital.

222
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 They don't involve the law enforcement." But they go, "They may not even be injured at all."

223
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Like, if someone, you don't go to a hospital because you get a bloody nose, right?

224
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Now, I don't know how many times I've been punched in the face, and you don't go to the doctor.

225
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And if you know that it was a total accident and the person was asleep, you're just like,

226
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 "What? My grandpa never laid a hand on my grandma ever."

227
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 But that night, he was having such a horrible dream about their kids getting at someone broken into the house

228
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 and the dream was trying to kill the kids, being erupt.

229
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 So they figured actually is more than two percent of that happens.

230
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Now, we sleepwalking, I think everyone knows about that.

231
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And I think the idea of murdering people in your sleep, it's pretty well known in the true crime community

232
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 because every so often it's used as an excuse.

233
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I don't know how well that's known in the general community, but Kenneth Pickering...

234
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 There's a ton of stories about it. I picked this Kenneth Pickering one because it's one of the more recent ones.

235
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 But it goes way back. They can go back to the 1800s of this type of stuff happening.

236
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Kenneth Parks falls asleep on the couch and then this is how insane sleepwalking can be.

237
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And he had a history of sleepwalking. That ends up playing a part as we get to the end of this, but...

238
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He got in his car, drove down a busy highway for 14 miles, totally asleep.

239
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Now, your eyes aren't closed, your arms aren't straight out like you're in a Looney Tune cartoon.

240
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Like, to other people, you appear to be awake.

241
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 He gets in his car, he drives 14 miles to his in-laws' house, he lets himself in with his own key,

242
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 picks up a tire iron as he enters the house, and beats his mother-in-law to death with a tire iron.

243
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And then chokes his father-in-law. The father-in-law survived. Mother-in-law did not.

244
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Then he drives to the police station all by himself and he goes in, "I've killed some people."

245
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And then he wakes up. This was a huge court case, obviously, because people unfortunately murder people all the time,

246
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 but every so often a story comes out that's so bizarre, like some weird motive or some weird alibi or something like that.

247
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 This guy, Kenneth, was actually acquitted of these charges because they were...

248
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 His defense was able to prove that he had a history of sleep issues. He was under a lot of stress.

249
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 The mother-in-law's family, the victim's family, was like, you know, he was closer to them than he was to his own parents.

250
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 His wife was like, "We totally believe that this was sleep-related. We don't think he would actually kill his mother-in-law."

251
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And what's interesting is you have all of these researchers really have to come and study this case.

252
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And sleep researchers, because this happens, but you don't get a lot of data coming in on this,

253
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 because like I said, sometimes it'll happen to people and they won't talk about it.

254
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 You had people going over this. I was reading this article about this.

255
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I got a lot of this information from an article in Psychology Today called "Dangerous Dreamers."

256
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And they were saying that we have to look to be able to tell if someone's telling the truth,

257
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 and kind of more importantly, we have to be able to tell when somebody's lying,

258
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 because people will use this as an excuse. People will go and load a gun and then shoot someone and go, "I was sleeping!"

259
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 [snoring]

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And the prosecution's like, "We actually think this was not an accident. We think this was actually premeditated murder."

261
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 It's a thing called "malangering." Malangering, something like that, where some malag-malagrenine, I don't remember,

262
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 but the point is, is it's a word that I can't pronounce that means you're making up an illness.

263
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 It's an existing illness that you're using it to cover.

264
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I used to actually be obsessed with this idea.

265
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I remember I watched a ton of forensic files, because I'm a big true crime junkie, more so back in the day,

266
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 but ton of forensic files and documentaries about sleepwalking and murder and stuff like that.

267
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And this is actually pretty well-known stuff as far as sleepwalking, murder stuff.

268
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 It's not the most well-known, but if you're a fan of true crime, you've come across these types of stories.

269
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 What I had never heard of before, which is 100 times creepier than murdering someone in your sleep,

270
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 this is what Fabio sent me, this is absolutely terrifying, committing suicide while you are asleep.

271
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 This is something that, it actually has a name for it, because it, it, it, this is a really interesting issue.

272
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It's called "parasomnia pseudo-suicide," because it's not real suicide, right?

273
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 But you are taking your own life.

274
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 We don't know if it happens, technically, because you're dead.

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Like, someone who walks into a police station and they wake up, and it's still tragic that someone's killed while they're sleeping,

276
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 or even someone just getting beat up by a sleepwalker. Still tragic.

277
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 But, parasomnia pseudo-suicide, you just die in the middle of the night.

278
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And sleep disorder specialists look at this stuff and they go, "We believe this is real.

279
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 We actually believe this is a real thing."

280
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Because if you can drive 14 miles and open a door and beat someone to death with a tire iron,

281
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 choke out someone else to drive to a police station and admit to the crime, could you walk into traffic?

282
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Now, someone walking into traffic, and they, see, here's the thing, we have tons of cases of people doing this.

283
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 We just don't know if they're asleep walking or not.

284
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Being a sleepwalker and walking into traffic, that could be classified as an accident.

285
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 They have people who jump off their balcony, middle of the night.

286
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 They had a history of sleep disorders. They had a history of sleep walking.

287
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Did this person accidentally just fall off the balcony? They thought they were going somewhere.

288
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Did they commit suicide, or was it a combination of the two?

289
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 People with a long history of sleep disorders being found the next day with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

290
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And you have sleep specialists going, "They may have loaded the gun in their sleep."

291
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Tobias Wong was an artist, an up-and-coming artist in New York City.

292
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Long history of sleep walking. It was actually, a lot of people thought it was kind of funny and charming.

293
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Sometimes he'd wake up and there'd be a steak dinner that he had woken up and cooked in the middle of the night.

294
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Sometimes he'd come. There'd be little arts and crafts that he had made in the middle of the night.

295
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Sometimes he'd make tiny little hats for his cats.

296
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 So he could do complex actions while deep asleep.

297
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And he'd been able to do it his entire life.

298
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 So one morning this up-and-coming artist is found hanging in his apartment.

299
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 It's obviously ruled as suicide. He's the only person there.

300
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 There's no one else how to motive. He's hanging. Suicide.

301
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 But his family and his friends and sleep researchers who have looked at this go, he may have hung himself in his sleep.

302
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 The reason why I think that's more terrifying than murdering someone in your sleep, because while that is 100% awful, right?

303
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 You can figure out like a motive. You can make some sense of the tragedy.

304
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 With this, the person's just dead. And you go, anyone who's lost their friend to suicide, you always go, "What if I had picked up that phone?"

305
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 "What if I had made that phone call?" "Oh, I should have stopped by."

306
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 "Why didn't I stop by all this time?"

307
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 It doesn't take away the pain that that person died, but it takes away the pain of the suicide being the cause of death.

308
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I remember once I had a friend who was going through really, really hard divorce.

309
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 She found out her husband was cheating on her. And it was this big thing.

310
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And she was completely heartbroken and all this stuff.

311
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And how could he do such a thing? And she hated him and she loved him.

312
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And all of this stuff was going on.

313
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And it obviously went on for like months and months and months.

314
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And I remember once I was talking to her and I said, "Had he died," this is kind of cold-hearted,

315
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 "but had he died the day before he announced that he was going to divorce you, you would have never stopped loving him."

316
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 But because it went a day longer, he hated his guts.

317
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 He would have died a man who loved you to the end, even though he was having the affair and everything on you.

318
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 I didn't know any of that. I wouldn't know any of that.

319
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 And I always think that in context it was a comforting thing, basically.

320
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I was trying to say that we have to take things as a whole.

321
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 You can't take the last thing somebody does or this thing that happened at this point in their life

322
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 and have it define everything. Either way, you can't have them do one great thing and go,

323
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 "Well, then everything they did was great." Or you have them do one horrible thing and you go,

324
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 "Well, everything they did was horrible." Outside of obviously some sort of inhumane act.

325
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I'm talking about in this context, again, you could go, "What if Godzilla destroyed Japan, Jason?"

326
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 You understand what I mean. In the context of a relationship, you're going to have ups and downs,

327
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 depending on how these things play out. You have to take a look at the whole picture.

328
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 It's kind of what I was saying. And still, I think there's context lost there.

329
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 But that's my point. If you lose somebody on June 13th, they die in a car accident.

330
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It's tragic. You can't believe it. You're going to have to go on without them. It's awful.

331
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 But in a world where they don't die in that accident, but for whatever reason, they take their life on the 14th,

332
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 you're like, "Oh, my God, what could I have done differently?"

333
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 It's just an interesting, it's a very, very complex issue how people die in suicide absolutely complicates that.

334
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I'm a strict non-suicide person. I'm a strict anti-suicide person

335
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 because of these questions that are always left.

336
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 But this makes this even more a super complicated issue because we have real-world ramifications of committing suicide versus dying.

337
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Again, if you murder someone in your sleep, there's trials that can go on.

338
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 You could be innocent. They could have sleep specialists.

339
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 If you just, someone just wakes up and you're hanging, for one, I'm just going straight black and white.

340
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 This might sound like I'm diminishing stuff, but insurance payments, life insurance in a lot of US states,

341
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I think in most of them, will not pay out for suicides.

342
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 But if you did it in your sleep, if it was an accident, your family could be taken care of.

343
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 If it's real to suicide, $100,000 life insurance, nope, not going to pay it out.

344
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 So there's an important, there's important distinctions here.

345
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 One, it's the emotional distinction of being able to say, "No, they killed themselves in their sleep."

346
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 So they weren't at this moment of despair.

347
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 They didn't feel destroyed. They didn't feel left. They didn't feel alone.

348
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 It was, it was an accident. They made a noose. They loaded the gun. They shot themselves, but it was an accident.

349
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 They didn't mean to. They were asleep.

350
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 The insurance purposes, religious purposes.

351
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I mean, people who commit suicide, this episode is really dark and I apologize for that, but religious issues.

352
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Catholicism, if you commit suicide, that's like an unforgivable sin. You're, it's, it's, you're punished for it.

353
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 But what if you didn't do it?

354
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 What if you did not kill yourself?

355
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 But it looks like you did.

356
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 And I'm not talking about like a staged hanging because you owe the CIA money, or someone's trying to cover something up.

357
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 You wore a sleep watch and SNL and then the next morning people find you dead.

358
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And your Roman Catholic parents are besides themselves.

359
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 So all of these issues come into play over something that as far as we know may not even exist, but in theory, most likely does.

360
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Even the sleep specialists are going, "We have a name for it."

361
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And I'm sure there are people who woke up just like this guy woke up as he was standing in the police station.

362
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 People may have woke up right when they had the ball of Tylenol in their hands and being like, "What in the world is going on?"

363
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Who people who woke up right when that hammer cocked back.

364
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 But for those who don't and those who leave that legacy behind, what if it's not suicide?

365
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 It's weird. It almost feels like a life raft in a way.

366
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 I have a friend who killed himself.

367
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 And some friends you know everything that's going on in their lives.

368
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Some friends you know a little bit. Some friends are really good at hiding it.

369
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 He hung himself a couple of years ago in the middle of the night.

370
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And I remember thinking, I remember he invited me to go over and watch movies at his house.

371
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 He said, "Hey, you should come over. We watch movies every month. You should come over and watch movies."

372
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 I was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah."

373
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And I remember thinking after he hung himself.

374
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 I walked by his house sometimes going through town.

375
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 I remember thinking, "What if I was able to..."

376
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 "What if I take..." This is so dumb because obviously you had a huge social circle.

377
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 I'm not going to go into super details about him because he's a local and stuff like that.

378
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Obviously people in town would know who I'm talking about.

379
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 He has this huge social circle. He was a mover and shaker in town.

380
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 He's a young man. He's younger than me.

381
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And I had this thought. I go, "What if just the simple..."

382
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 "What if I had gone over to watch movies with him every other month?"

383
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 "If I had taken out that amount of time to go over there, could I have noticed something?"

384
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 It feels it feels it both vain, right?

385
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 It feels vain that I could have been the one to help.

386
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And at the same time, it feels a little like self-flagellation,

387
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 punishing myself for something that I don't really...

388
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Didn't really have any control over.

389
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I didn't know 100% of the circumstances of his whole life.

390
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I don't know if he suffered with issues his whole life.

391
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Or if it was caused by events.

392
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Or I don't know. I don't know.

393
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 But it's interesting because...

394
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And I'm going to wrap it up like this.

395
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 We want to find meaning in things.

396
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And suicide...

397
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Suicide, obviously, is someone's dying of cancer or something like that.

398
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 I get it, right?

399
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Like someone's...

400
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 You know what? The doctor says I have six months left.

401
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 I want to go and then the ocean jump off a boat.

402
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 That's...

403
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 We can have that discussion.

404
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 But when people are...

405
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Suicide seems to be such a chaotic element of life.

406
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 That I think it kind of puzzles everyone.

407
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 It kind of hurts everybody, right?

408
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And it's so...

409
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 It's the antithesis of what everything else seems to be trying to do.

410
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Which from the fly buzzing around your apartment to you,

411
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 everything's trying to stay alive.

412
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 So when someone kills themselves, it's this...

413
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 It's just weird to me.

414
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 It's funny because I always joke about people who believe in ridiculous conspiracy theories,

415
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 how they try to find patterns and meanings and reasons for things.

416
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Oh, this matches this and the reason why this calendar does this,

417
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 and these eight numbers add up to this politician's birthday.

418
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Because humans need to find reason in things.

419
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Planes just can't crash into a building.

420
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 There has to be this massive 80-year build-up to that, right?

421
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Can't just be one dude telling 20 dudes to do something.

422
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 It has to be this massive...

423
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Because that doesn't make sense.

424
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 That makes the world so fragile and vulnerable

425
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 that one person could tell 20 people to kill 3,000 people

426
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 and change the way that an entire nation works.

427
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 There's just too random.

428
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 So there has to be this huge thing and the Simpsons predicts it and all that stuff.

429
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 And it's funny because a lot of times I know that as a fact,

430
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 but when I read this story that Fabio sent me,

431
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 I thought of my friend, you know?

432
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 And I thought, "Maybe... maybe he didn't kill himself.

433
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Maybe it was this.

434
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Maybe it wasn't despair and loneliness or whatever else.

435
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Maybe it was this."

436
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 When we're faced with facts that...

437
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 We don't understand.

438
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 We want to understand them.

439
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 We want to find some sort of order in them.

440
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And so we'll cling to any life raft that comforts us.

441
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Sometimes it's a kooky conspiracy theory.

442
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Sometimes it's a couple articles that your buddy sends you

443
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 via Gmail about how some people who appear to have killed themselves actually didn't.

444
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Or didn't mean to.

445
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 It may not be the most rational life raft, but it keeps us afloat.

446
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Makes sense of things that otherwise don't make sense.

447
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Okay, so this has been a pretty depressing week of Dead Rabbit Radio.

448
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Yesterday's episode was pretty rough.

449
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 This episode was actually a lot rougher than I had planned on it being.

450
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I think tomorrow I was going to do something fun alien...

451
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 It wasn't fun. It was a terrifying alien abduction story.

452
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 I think I'm going to switch it up.

453
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I think I'm going to try to find some lighthearted stuff for tomorrow.

454
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Let's end the week on some happy stories that aren't...

455
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 But hopefully, I mean, even though these episodes...

456
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 These past couple episodes have been depressing,

457
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 hopefully you've been able to find some sort of...

458
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 No, I mean, they've just been pretty depressing.

459
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 If you are having thoughts of suicide,

460
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

461
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And that's for the United States.

462
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 But put some resources in the show notes if you aren't in the United States.

463
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I love you guys.

 But I'm glad you listened to it today.

470
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 We'll have a really fun upbeat episode tomorrow.

471

 I love you guys.

472
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Stay safe.

473

 I'll see you later.
