1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260
 Is there really two million dollars worth of treasure buried in the Rockies by an eccentric author?

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,780
 And then I tell you about my own personal experiences

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:16,980
 with the mysterious creatures known as the Shadow People today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:28,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,640
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. I'm a little sleepy, but this is our last episode of the week.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,920
 So that's nice. We have a really good episode today.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,760
 We have a great episode coming up Monday, and I want to let you guys know now that

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,620
 at the end of next week, I'm going, it's the end of season two.

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,800
 And I'm gonna take a week-long vacation like I did at the end of season one.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,840
 So we're gonna do this episode five more, then I'm gonna take a week off and then we'll come back and start season three.

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,640
 Each season is around 50-something episodes, but I didn't want to end the season in the middle of the

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,520
 week next week.

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,680
 So we're gonna do about 53 episodes, 52 episodes for season two, and then I'm gonna take a week off,

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
 and then we're gonna jump into season three.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,520
 Because I like to kind of break it up like that, and that week kind of helps me recharge a bit.

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,180
 I really enjoy doing the show. I love it a lot actually, but I

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,040
 also need to have like a little break where I'm able to just kind of catch up on movies and read.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,600
 I have three jobs on top of this, so I need a little bit of me time

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,760
 to just kind of veg out, because I'm kind of just always doing something, especially since this podcast happened.

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,360
 Everything I read, everything I watch is related to the show.

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,440
 So I just need to take a week off in between seasons and then like just watch Sweet Life of Zack and Cody for

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,920
 actually Sweet Life on Deck is the superior of the two shows, but you get my drift. Maybe I'll watch some Riverdale actually. I heard that's good.

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,240
 I don't only watch stuff with a sprouts in it, but that was just the logic there. Anyways,

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,880
 let's go ahead and get started here.

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,000
 So our first story is going to be, and I do have to forgive me.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,480
 I think someone might have suggested this on YouTube, but I was I always try to go back and

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,720
 find I was like, okay, I started looking into this and I was like,

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,480
 I think someone suggested this and I looked through my comments and I couldn't find anything. So if I forgot it,

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,760
 I apologize if no one suggested it, then I'm just going crazy.

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,600
 So the first thing we're going to look at is the compelling case of the Forest Finn treasure.

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,200
 Now Forest Finn was an art dealer.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,360
 He's kind of an eccentric man around town and this is in the

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,160
 2000s, so very very recently. He got diagnosed with cancer and he was like,

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,960
 he beat it and he's in remission, but the doctor said, you know, it can come back and he's like, well,

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,920
 okay, I'm just not going to wait around to die. What I'm going to do is if the cancer comes back,

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,120
 I'm going to take all these valuable collectibles.

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,040
 Collectibles is probably not right word for it, but he was an art dealer, art collector.

38
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,240
 He said, I'm going to take all these valuable artifacts that I have, put them in a treasure chest, walk off into the wilderness with

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,200
 my life story and a bottle of pills and my treasure chest and when they find my body,

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,800
 they'll find all of this treasure and my story. So basically he would just go out there,

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,920
 get to a nice little spot, take all the pills, pass away.

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,640
 Not not the most concise plan because most likely he would take a bunch of pills and then wake up in his own vomit and be

43
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,160
 super weak and be stuck out in the middle of nowhere and

44
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,760
 it's really hard to die from an overdose of pills,

45
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,080
 but he's all groggy and then a bunch of wolves show up and slowly eat him. Not the best plan, not the best thought-out plan,

46
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,360
 but what happened was the cancer didn't come back and he kind of like as time went on he goes,

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
 "You know what? I like the first part of that plan.

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,720
 Take out the suicide part of it. Let's go do a treasure hunt. Let's do a real-life treasure hunt."

49
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,440
 Now he grew up and he read all the books about, you know,

50
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,400
 I don't know the exact titles, but he read like mystery books and like Hardy Boy stuff, like treasure stuff.

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,680
 So he decides to again load up this chest. Now he has a

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,200
 bronze chest

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
 that he begins filling with

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:21,940
 riches, basically. It was basically it says here it has emeralds, rubies, diamonds, gold coins that he'd collected at gun shows and

55
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:28,680
 auctions, two gold nuggets he got as large as chicken eggs and an old Navajo bracelet with,

56
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:36,280
 and I'm quoting here, "22 prehistoric turquoise disc beads in laden silver." He loads up his treasure chest,

57
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,600
 goes to the Rockies,

58
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 buries it at a spot that he knows.

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,680
 That's just the first part of it. Now he has to start the treasure hunt.

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,520
 So he writes a book called The Thrill of the Chase and basically it's his life story and in the book

61
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,960
 it has clues to where the treasure is buried.

62
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,120
 Part of the big part of the clues is he has a poem in there, which we'll get to in a bit,

63
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,720
 but he has a poem in there that he says, "If you decipher the clues,

64
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,600
 it will tell you where the treasure is buried." Now, of course,

65
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,040
 this story goes viral fairly quickly. Now, originally you could only buy the book at a

66
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,120
 bookstore in his town and it goes for like a new, back then a copy went for $35.

67
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,240
 The book is in high demand now. People are trying to scour the book for the clues. The poem itself is online and

68
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,160
 it has a lot of clues. People have

69
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,560
 obsessed over this because what is in this box is valued between one to two million dollars. And technically

70
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,800
 that's one to two million

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,880
 tax-free dollars because if you found the treasure you could just take it home.

72
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,840
 I'm not okay. If there's anyone who works for the IRS, I'm not saying that that's what I would do.

73
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,960
 Please don't audit me.

74
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,040
 But if you found it, you wouldn't really have to claim it. So it would be just one to two million dollars.

75
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,080
 Forrest Finn has said that people have come between 500 feet and 200 feet of where he buried that treasure.

76
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:12,360
 He also gave a clue and he said because of his age, he's like in his 70s when he buried it. 70s, 80s around there.

77
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,840
 He said that it would be somewhere that a man of my age could get to. So it's not like off of a cliff hang or

78
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,740
 it's not like 20 feet underwater. It's a place that he could go.

79
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,000
 He said that when he buried it, he kind of sat there for a second and thought, "Did I just do that?"

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,280
 And then he kind of laughed and he's like, "Yeah, I did." And he realized it was the start of this adventure.

81
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,760
 So he buried it in 2010, 2010. People have been looking for it ever since. No one has ever found it.

82
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,640
 People are reading his life story, looking for the clues, reading the poem now. Like anything, of course,

83
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,360
 people become obsessed with it.

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,920
 There have been four deaths that are known to have happened because people were looking for this treasure. People have drowned.

85
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,640
 People have fallen off of, you know, heights.

86
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,920
 It's people who aren't

87
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,680
 equipped to deal with the wilderness like myself.

88
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,480
 Like I've never spent a prolonged amount of time in the wilderness.

89
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,000
 They find this book and they're like scouring maps and they're trading clues.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,880
 They have whole websites dedicated to kind of like trading clues.

91
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,320
 Of course, no one wants to give away their best clues because they're the ones who want to find it.

92
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,960
 But they're doing all this, but then once the rubber meets the road, once they go out to the wilderness

93
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,440
 and it's getting cold and there's coyotes howling and stuff like that, it's the Rocky Mountains.

94
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,240
 So it's not like the most hospitable place in America. You go out there and

95
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,760
 just, you know, your civilized side starts to break down really quickly and you fall and you get injured and stuff like that.

96
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
 So there's been four deaths,

97
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,360
 people looking for this and Forrest has said, you know what? I feel bad.

98
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,000
 Like that wasn't the point that people were gonna go out here and

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,440
 die. I was just hoping to give people a good puzzle to solve.

100
00:07:52,440 --> 00:08:00,160
 He has not revealed the location of the treasure yet. Nobody's found it. He said that as

101
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,720
 gold value goes up, if it ever reaches, if the treasure chest ever reaches to 20 million dollars,

102
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,120
 he'll retrieve it himself. That sounds like a very odd

103
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,400
 arbitrary number and that's seeing, I mean, even with gold values going up to go from 2 million to 20 million,

104
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,520
 he's around 80 right now. So, but whatever, he's like, when it reaches 20 million,

105
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,760
 I'll go grab it myself and which, which again is a really odd statement to make. Now, what happened recently

106
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:34,960
 was just on the 19th of October. So what was that? Like last week? That was earlier this, no, that was last week.

107
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:42,680
 Okay, so last week Forrest Finn's house got broken into by a guy looking for his treasure in his house,

108
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,880
 even though he said it was buried in the Rockies. This guy broke into this dude's house, broken a Forrest Finn's house.

109
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:56,360
 Aida Sandwich started digging up the backyard a bit and then found a box like a treasure chest and grabbed it and started running out of the house.

110
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,920
 Forrest Finn, I believe his daughter was there as well. They ended up calling the cops.

111
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,080
 The treasure chest that he took was just full, full of towels.

112
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,840
 And so he was arrested and now that guy has a go fund me for

113
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:17,200
 $25,000 to pay for legal fees and to get him back home. See, he was from Pennsylvania.

114
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,800
 He traveled to Arizona where Forrest Finn lives.

115
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,160
 Looking for the money, even though it's not supposedly there at all, it's in the Rockies.

116
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,560
 And now he's asking for $25,000 to pay his legal fees and to be able to go back home.

117
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,800
 His family, they were saying that he was really desperate because right now his family only has $130 in the bank and I sympathize with that.

118
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,120
 I don't think you probably did your family any favors by traveling pretty much from coast to coast,

119
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:51,080
 but desperation, I guess. It seems like it would cost more than $130 to get from Pennsylvania to Arizona.

120
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,400
 I guess he assumed that he was gonna go there and he would find $2 million. She'd be able to go back easier.

121
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,160
 I don't know, but that's kind of weird. Anyway, so he's stuck in Arizona right now.

122
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,600
 Forrest Finn, buries a treasure, $1 to $2 million.

123
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,400
 People are obsessed with it. They've been obsessed with it for the past, what is it now, eight years.

124
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,320
 A couple people have died. One guy broke into his house. He said, and I was looking again on the article,

125
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,040
 he said the poem, he believed the clues were leading him to this house.

126
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,480
 So let's take a look at this poem. So I'm gonna save us some time. I'm not gonna read the poem out loud.

127
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,980
 It's like 16 line poem. I'm not gonna read it out loud. One, because it really lacks context unless you have a

128
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:39,560
 map or you know the area. Two, it lacks context because other clues are also in his book, his

129
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,400
 biography, his autobiography, the thrill of the chase. Three, because I believe the whole thing is a hoax.

130
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,640
 I believe that Forrest Finn made the whole thing up.

131
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,640
 I think he made it up for multiple...

132
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,160
 The reason why I think he made it up is, and people have pointed this out too,

133
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,240
 for a man in his 70s to carry all of those items in that box.

134
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,720
 It was a bronze box. The box itself with all of the items in it would have weighed about 40 pounds.

135
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,480
 Now, that's not heavy for a lot of people to carry, short distances,

136
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,200
 but to hike with that

137
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,760
 can be troublesome and

138
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,200
 when you're an advanced age to be able to hike with that is troublesome. But let's assume that he's really fit and that's not a problem.

139
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:30,000
 He wanted people to hear his life story. That was his initial thing. They'll find the treasure,

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,120
 they'll find my body and my biography will be there and they'll read it. Which in

141
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:41,080
 really what would happen is if you found the corpse and it had a box of treasure and a bottle of pills next to it and a book,

142
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:48,080
 you'll take the treasure, definitely. You may take the book. Depending on who you are, you may take some of the pills.

143
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,360
 But it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna treasure that book or even read it.

144
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,760
 And even if one person does read it and then just throws it away or whatever,

145
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,280
 it was a bad plan. The idea of hiding a treasure and writing your life story and including clues to find the treasure

146
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:09,960
 means people are gonna pour over your life story. And he wrote a sequel to it as well. He wrote a sequel to it as well.

147
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,320
 So I

148
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,920
 think he wanted to get a story out there. I think a lot of times when we see people do stuff like this,

149
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:25,560
 I think one of the biggest fears people have is that they are forgotten or they leave no lasting impact on the world or any impact at all,

150
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,400
 even. People don't necessarily have to think they're gonna leave a lasting impact,

151
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,920
 but that they have some sort of thumbprint left on the planet. I think that's, I think that's one of people's most

152
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,160
 unspoken fears. And now this guy has a legacy. Even after he dies, people are gonna be talking about the treasure.

153
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,680
 I don't think it's out there. I don't think it's buried. The wife of one of the men who died searching for it,

154
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,240
 she said the same thing. She says it's a hoax.

155
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,560
 She goes, "I totally believe it's a hoax. I totally believe he made it up."

156
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,920
 And I think him saying stuff like, "Oh, a group was within 200 feet. A group was within 500 feet."

157
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,400
 I'm curious to how he knew that. Like, were groups contacting him and saying, "You know, I was so, I was,

158
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,640
 the last place I looked was by this bush." And he's like,

159
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,560
 "Like, how does he know they were so close? He doesn't go on all these expeditions with them."

160
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,200
 I think it's fake. But yeah, I think the whole thing. I don't think he buried it. I think that he is now

161
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,200
 someone that people all around the world know about. And people all around the world are reading

162
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,880
 his biography, which he admits is a little embellished, which is fine. I mean, that's a little irritating,

163
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,480
 but I think that's the least of his transgressions on this. I do not believe the forest fin treasure

164
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,040
 exists. I could be wrong. Someone could dig it up. He could finally dig it up, but I think he's just

165
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,800
 going to pass away and people will be digging up the Rocky Mountains for the next 100 years.

166
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,520
 It'll just become a legend, which is what he wanted really in the first place.

167
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,680
 So let's go ahead and move on to our last story. I wanted to go, you know, people have asked me

168
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,720
 about, you know, like what I personally believe and personal experiences I've had. And I'm pretty

169
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,840
 open with what I personally believe, but personal experiences I have, I'm a little more hesitant to

170
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,960
 talk about. Because obviously, when you talk about stuff like this, people tend to think you're crazy.

171
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,080
 And that's fine. But when you record stuff like that, when you record these type of stories,

172
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:24,680
 then you're basically immortalizing your craziness. Now, I'm going to preface this by saying that my,

173
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,560
 I have a thing, I've never been diagnosed with it. But, so I mean, take it with a grain of salt.

174
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:38,840
 But I have this thing called time dysmorphia. And what it is, is that I can't judge time.

175
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:48,200
 A day to you may feel like a day and a half to me. An hour to you may seem like two, three hours to me.

176
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,880
 Like I have a really hard time judging time and people go, oh, no, it's just because you're not

177
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,400
 busy or you need to read a book or something like that. And I'm like, no, I have to be,

178
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:03,400
 I have to have clocks around me. I have to have measurements of time, because otherwise I have

179
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:11,880
 no idea how much time has passed. So I'm saying that because I don't remember, and I've made this,

180
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,800
 I've made, I've made this mistake before when talking about stories where I'll say, yeah,

181
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:23,800
 I think I was 25. I think this took place in 1998, and I'm wildly off wildly off by years.

182
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,880
 So I kind of have to place it in the context of other things that were going on. I believe

183
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:37,640
 the stories I'm about to tell you happened around 1996. So really before a good chunk of my

184
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,240
 listenership was even born. But I was out of high school, and I was probably in my second year of

185
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:50,280
 college. And I was living at my grandmother's house. I would sleep in the living room.

186
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:57,000
 My great grandmother was still alive at the time, Grandma McGee. I would sleep in the living room.

187
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,160
 And the house always just seemed fairly eerie. This is out in Orangevale, California. It's

188
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:11,080
 a suburb/rural area on the border of Sacramento. The house was always creepy. I'd heard the occasional

189
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,440
 ghost story that had happened that my grandma, my grandma Miller had seen a ghost of one of her

190
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,960
 sisters in the house peeking from around the corner. Terrifying. But anyways, I would sleep in

191
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:33,560
 the living room on the floor. And I don't know what started it. I don't remember how it started, but

192
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:42,360
 I remember one night I was getting ready to go to sleep. I wasn't asleep yet. And I'm laying down

193
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,840
 on the floor. And I'm facing down the long living room. It was kind of an interesting

194
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,760
 design of a house. I had a really long living room. And I saw in the darkness, where there was

195
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,440
 just enough light coming in from the street light or the porch light outside the kitchen window,

196
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:10,440
 I saw the silhouette, the pitch black silhouette of a boy, I'd say was about as tall as maybe like

197
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:18,760
 a eight to 10 year old boy. I don't see the... Well, this is the weird thing. So the way that the light

198
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,800
 was coming in was that the room was flooded with darkness, but there was just enough light

199
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,080
 filling the room to kind of make out some details of just, you know, like the couch and,

200
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,680
 you know, the record player and the table and stuff like that. But the boy who stood there

201
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:47,480
 was so black. His body, his form was so black, it actually stood out into the darkness.

202
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:57,160
 Even though everything below the shoulders was completely covered by shadow, you could see

203
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:06,200
 where the fingertips ended, the shoes, the jeans. It was that, it was just void blackness.

204
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:18,520
 It was darker than shadow. And the second I realized what I was looking at, it ran towards me.

205
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:29,880
 Lightning speed. Before I even knew, before I could comprehend, it was within striking

206
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,520
 distance of me. Now, like I said, it was a long living room. The living room was probably about

207
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:44,440
 12 to 18 feet, and it was just there on me. And I say striking distance, and that's not a

208
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:51,160
 figure of speech, because right when I saw how close it was, I swatted at it

209
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:58,440
 out of instinct, like you would swat away a bug. And I made it kind of like this weird,

210
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,440
 terrified yell. I didn't yell, I just had this weird noise in my throat, and I'm laying down

211
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:18,040
 and I just kind of swatted at it. And as my hand went through it, it tore, and little gold filaments

212
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:26,760
 kind of came out of the form. So it would be like if you scratched something, and it just kind of

213
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,600
 shredded my, I didn't feel anything, but I just saw gold filaments, like where it had torn,

214
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,000
 where almost like the, there was no substance to it, but once I put my hand through it, it basically

215
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,280
 tore open, and the edge of each rip had this little gold filament alongside it. That, I'm,

216
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,600
 you know, it's, I'm trying to, I hope you get that visual, because it was quite terrifying to me.

217
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:59,960
 And then it just wasn't there. There's no puff of smoke. There's no blink. It was simply wasn't

218
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:07,960
 there anymore. Now I didn't go back to bed. And the rest of the time that I was staying at my grandma's house, I

219
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:17,240
 I didn't like facing that way when I slept, but I almost felt like I had to. I never saw that

220
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,560
 again. But what I started to see were the dogs.

221
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:36,360
 I started to see these big black shadow dogs. They looked more like bulls. They had the, the

222
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,800
 shit, not with the, not necessarily with the horns, they had these, they had, it was one of the,

223
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:50,760
 I think dog is the easiest way to explain it because the heads seemed like canines,

224
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:59,960
 but they had more of the like torso of like a bowl shaped creature with kind of shorter back legs.

225
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:11,640
 The thing with the dogs were this, they were always flat. It was like watching a two-dimensional image

226
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:20,600
 walk by. I didn't see them super often in the beginning, but when I saw them, I would get the

227
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:31,800
 sense that they were evil, sinister. I, the boy was the boy and I got more of the sense that

228
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:41,080
 I don't know what I, what I really thought of that emotionally, but the dogs terrified me. And again,

229
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:50,120
 it was that same thing of that dark beyond dark. And I would see them usually, they would walk

230
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,120
 along the wall because they were flat. So if they're, and this wasn't just in my grandma's house

231
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,040
 at this point, I was seeing these other places. If the wall had like a little corner, you would

232
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,200
 watch it and it would turn that corner like a shadow just being projected on the wall and would

233
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,840
 kind of move around the room. Now, of course, at this point, I think I'm going crazy. At this point,

234
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,440
 I think I'm actually losing it because what rational person would see stuff like that? So,

235
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:26,840
 you know, and let's, in this timeline in 1997, 1998, I wasn't smoking marijuana. I wasn't doing

236
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,840
 drugs. I wasn't drinking, but I was seeing these things. And I always were looking for ghosts. I

237
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,120
 was always investigating and being intrigued by this stuff, but there was no chemical outside to this.

238
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,920
 But I was thinking, I'm obviously going crazy. I'm seeing things. These things don't actually exist.

239
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:52,280
 And then I started seeing what most people know of as the shadow man, but I was seeing a lot of them

240
00:22:52,280 --> 00:23:00,680
 at once. The shadow men phenomenon is very common. You can find a ton of articles in it.

241
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,360
 I'll try to find some. Well, I won't try to find some. I'll link some in the show notes below.

242
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,280
 The shadow men generally come to people when they sleep. There's one of them that is

243
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,600
 sinister. They tend to wear trench coats and they have these big top hats and there's reports of

244
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,480
 them around the world. Now, the internet wasn't really a thing when this was going on. People had

245
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,680
 it, but it was like the, you know, the dial up. You didn't have all these resources, everything you

246
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,240
 wanted to learn about ghosts. You had to find in a book, hopefully, then television and then a friend

247
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,720
 telling you a spooky story. I had not heard of the shadow men that I can recall before I started

248
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,160
 seeing them. What was different about the shadow men though is one, I didn't get a sense that they

249
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:55,880
 were evil. I got a sense that they were almost beyond that, very advanced. I got a feeling that they were

250
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:06,040
 curious, maybe, but not curious like they want to communicate with me. Curious the way that

251
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:18,520
 I'm curious when I see a caterpillar walk across the leaf. Like the scale of intelligence was so

252
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:28,440
 vast between me and whatever this was that I was nothing to it. The other weird thing was that they

253
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:36,760
 also were darker than dark, but when I looked at them, I could feel this weird thing where my

254
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:44,040
 eyes and my brain wanted to put color in them. Like I could almost perceive a shifting color

255
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,320
 within the darkness. It's really hard to explain because I'd look at it and my eyes would perceive

256
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:57,320
 the blackest of black, this dark, dark form, but my mind could almost see color inside of it.

257
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,440
 And, you know, I talk about, I've mentioned stuff about ghosts and aliens where I go, I think it's

258
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,320
 more likely they come from another dimension. That's what this felt like. It felt like the colors

259
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,360
 that my mind was trying to perceive is something that's not perceivable in our dimension or with our

260
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,920
 the limitations of our eyes. So our brain just shuts down and says it's black because it can't

261
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:28,040
 perceive the colors that this thing actually is. So at this point, I have two options. I'm going

262
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:34,040
 crazy and I'm seeing this stuff everywhere or this stuff is real. Now, the way I always dealt with

263
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,120
 this stuff was I need to have other people witness it with me and I try to be and nowadays I'm very

264
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:46,520
 good at this. Back then I was kind of okay with it, but I have a rule that I don't tell you what I'm

265
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:54,040
 seeing. I let you see it and me see it and I ask you what you see. If we see the same thing, it's

266
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,640
 really there. If I go, oh my god, look at an old witch is flying across the moon and then you go,

267
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,560
 oh my god, you're right. That doesn't help me at all. If I look up and I'll go, hey, look at that.

268
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,880
 Someone else looks up and they're like, is that a witch flying across the moon? I'm like, mm-hmm.

269
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,040
 So I brought a bunch of friends over to my grandma's house because that was a hot bed of activity.

270
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,120
 You know, like I said, I'd seen the dogs other places and things like that. I would generally see

271
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,400
 the shadow men in various places, but I remember telling people that I think my grandma's backyard

272
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,720
 is haunted because I'm seeing some weird stuff there. At this point I'd actually had a room built

273
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,080
 onto my grandma's house because I was staying there for a long time. I love my grandparents.

274
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,480
 They're all passed away now, but it was a really good time living there.

275
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:50,120
 But so I brought over a bunch of friends and I was with my buddy Josh and my friend Jackie and a

276
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,280
 couple other people. And we were all like, oh yeah, we're gonna go go stunning, but let's start off at

277
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,080
 Jason's grandma's house because that place is totally creepy. And Jackie's 12, by the way,

278
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:10,040
 and I would have been at this point in time, 1997, would have been about 1920, something around there.

279
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,920
 Josh was about the same age. So we're just all young kids and then we got like this little girl

280
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:21,080
 hanging out with us. It was Josh's sister. So we go there and everyone hangs back because it is

281
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,760
 a creepy. It was a really creepy house. Everyone hangs back but me and Jackie. And I saw one of

282
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:34,040
 the shadow people standing in the doorway between the garage and the backyard. And I had a really

283
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,400
 weird visual that time. It was nighttime, of course. That's when you go go stunning with your friends.

284
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:49,960
 And the shadow man is standing there at night. And I look at him and these things are like

285
00:27:49,960 --> 00:28:01,400
 seven, eight feet tall. And what I perceived, like looking at him, it seemed like it was daytime

286
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,920
 on the other side of him. Now beyond his actual outline of his form of his nighttime,

287
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:14,360
 but I had this weird sensation that it was daytime behind him or through him.

288
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:21,400
 There were two other shadow men standing in the back of this backyard at night. And it would have

289
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:29,480
 been fall. It was a little cold. Now I told you my rule about not explaining stuff, but this was a time

290
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,200
 I didn't have that rule perfected. And me and Jackie walk up to the doorway

291
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,800
 and Jackie says something to the fact that this I'm really creeped out. And I said there's one

292
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,680
 in front because I told them again, I wasn't 100% on my plan, but I will get to that in a second.

293
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,600
 I told them I said, yeah, I think there's these shadow people walking in my backyard. I don't

294
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,400
 know how to explain them. They're just these big shadows walking around. I tell Jackie, I go,

295
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,120
 yeah, there's one in front of us right now. Now her being a 12 year old girl, not really thinking

296
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,720
 about anything. She sticks her hand right through the thing's chest now, of course, she doesn't see

297
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,080
 anything to her. She's just sticking her hand through a doorway into the dark backyard. And what I

298
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:17,160
 see is her hand, you know, where his chest should be or his stomach because she's quite short.

299
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:29,160
 And she goes, it's warm. My hands warm here. Now I didn't tell her, oh, it looks like daytime in him.

300
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,760
 But she was feeling warmth where her hand was there. Now I'm not going to let a 12 year old girl

301
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:46,280
 be more brave than I am. So I put my hand into him as well. And it was warm. And I start to kind of,

302
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,200
 I start to say something to her and my hand is just kind of where both of our hands are just

303
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,520
 sticking halfway through a doorway. Anyone walking by would just see two people sticking their hands

304
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,120
 through a doorway into the backyard at night. I say something to her and I look over at her and

305
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,760
 then I start to turn my hand because I'm kind of feeling the temperature. And now my hand is basically

306
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,920
 my my the back of my hand is facing me completely all five fingers are I'm looking at all five

307
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:21,000
 fingers. But the thing is my pinky and what is that my other index finger the pinky the finger

308
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,160
 next to the pinky they're gone. They're completely gone. All I see is my thumb my ring and my middle

309
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:35,960
 finger. And then is almost like just my hand was the rest the other two fingers and that part of

310
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:43,560
 my hand were completely gone enveloped in darkness. They didn't exist anymore. Wasn't a trick of the

311
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:49,400
 light. It was gone. And this is when I used my plan. I'm looking at my hand and it's flat out.

312
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:58,280
 And I go Jackie do you see something weird? And she looks over and she goes your fingers are missing.

313
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:06,520
 We both pull our hands out. We run back to the car. That wasn't the last time I saw the shadow

314
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,800
 people. It was the last time I interacted with them on that way. I never tried to communicate with

315
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:17,880
 them. Never tried to do a seance or Ouija board or anything like that. To me those things don't

316
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:24,520
 seem like they would work because these things didn't necessarily seem like ghosts. But I don't

317
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:33,640
 know what they were. It's been a long long time since I've seen a shadow man or one of those shadow

318
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:46,440
 dogs or the boy. But one of the last times I ever saw them. I remember I was driving home late at

319
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,200
 night. Just driving through Orangeville. It's maybe like two in the morning. I always stayed up late.

320
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:02,760
 And they were everywhere. I just saw two walking down the block here.

321
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:14,280
 A dog walking across the street flat but moving somehow. Sometimes they moved in pairs.

322
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,320
 Sometimes alone. But I saw them everywhere that night.

323
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,440
 I didn't sleep that night either.

324
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,520
 True story. Totally true story.
