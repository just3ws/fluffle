1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 When a flock of birds drop dead, science thinks they know the answer.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,720
 But do they even have a clue? And then we take a look at a bizarre conspiracy involving football.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,800
 Is it possible that the entire NFL is based around one goal? Pooping in your food.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:29,200
 And then we finish out the week with a truly terrifying story of a young boy

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,320
 left at home alone. He thought it was just going to have a nice relaxing day listening to some music.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,360
 Instead, his life ends today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:52,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,560
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys have some awesome

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,320
 plans for the weekend. Just to heads up some quick housekeeping. I am still looking for people to

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,240
 submit. We got a lot of submissions already, but if you want to be on an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio,

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,160
 all I need to do is to have you chant out "Earth First! Earth First! Earth First!" and we're going

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,800
 to remix... there's a reason for that? If this is your first episode you're like, "What? What am I

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,920
 listening to?" We're going to remix all of you guys into a classic episode of Dead Rabbit Radio,

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,200
 "Earth First!" If you want to hear that episode, I'll put it in the show notes. You have until

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,120
 January 31st. I moved up the date because it's the holidays. You have until January 31st to email me

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,280
 a recording of you chanting "Earth First!" Email it to DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com and just add

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,360
 permission that I'm able to use that sound clip. We are going to create this awesome soundscape with

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,880
 you, the Fluffle, and an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. So don't forget January 31st is the deadline

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,360
 for that. Also, take a look at this awesome fan art we have for Fan Art Friday. This is from Nick

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,000
 Buston. Nick Buston, longtime Patreon supporter, very active on the Patreon Discord and appears,

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,480
 hangs out with us when we do the live episodes on Sunday morning for the Patreon people. So that

22
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,480
 is so awesome. Nick, I really love this. It's the first time we're seeing this version, a 3D version

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,360
 of the Dead Rabbit Radio logo. Absolutely love it. And we always, always got to give a shout out to

24
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,920
 Ash Black, who actually designed that logo. So thank you, Ash Black. But Nick, what a great

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,840
 rendition of it. Really, really enjoy that. And then let's give a shout out to one of our

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,480
 Thanksgiving livestream supporters who helps the show so much. Give it up for Cantillians!

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,640
 Cantillians, also a longtime Patreon supporter. Cantillians, you're going to be our captain,

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,800
 our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,600
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot. Now, Cantillians, I'm going

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,360
 to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jet. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:03:00,960
 We are headed all the way out to Spain. Now, this might be too fast of a vehicle,

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,400
 because we're actually going to be talking about birds. I wanted something in the air,

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,800
 but we have a dirgeable. We have a copter. But I want to get there fast. Let's fly in this fast,

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,080
 fast jet. We're headed out to Spain. Specifically, we're headed out to Feral Spain. That's where

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,360
 all the crazy people live. They're all hairy and they run around. Feral Spain. It's November 26,

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:27,120
 2021. So, fairly recent story. We're at the Juan Cardona Hospital. We're walking around the outside

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,560
 of Juan Cardona Hospital. And it's in the middle of the afternoon. It's a beautiful Spain day.

38
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:40,000
 And there's trees near the hospital. And in those trees are birds.

39
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
 It's starlings, to be exact. I don't know what a starling sounds like. And we're standing there

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,840
 watching these birds in this tree. And there's a lot of other people milling about now. We're here

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
 because something weird's going to happen. That's why you're listening to this podcast.

42
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,280
 The people just going about their day on November 26th. They have no idea what's going on. They have

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,400
 no idea why all these handsome people are wearing Dead Rabbit Radio Flight suits

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,200
 standing in the middle of their parking lot. And then all of a sudden, 200 starlings

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,760
 fly out of these trees. And they're briefly in the air. And then they begin to drop dead.

46
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:25,760
 People watching this said, exactly what I just said. I'll just reiterate it. They go up in the air

47
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,080
 and they just seem to fall out of the sky. And no one can understand this. And I'm reading this

48
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,720
 article. I was reading this article on Coast to Coast AM's website. And they had these links in it.

49
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,200
 And they go, this is also really similar to something that happened in Wales in December 10th

50
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,840
 of 2019. So I went back and looked at that article. And that article, this resident, this local to this

51
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,080
 area in Wales was driving near the village of Baudedurn. And they see a flock of starlings flying

52
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,240
 through the sky. And they're like, Oh, how beautiful is nature? Because they just swarm in these elegant

53
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:07,600
 kind of formations. But on their way back home, there's hundreds of dead birds, starlings, laying

54
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,560
 across the street. They call the authorities up. Because here's the question. Whenever you find

55
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,480
 these dead birds, you're afraid that it's chemical, that there's something in the air. Now there are

56
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,320
 bird die offs like this that are connected to chemicals. But this one in Wales, they did autopsies

57
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,720
 on 35 of them, you know, they just take them at random. They said these guys died from blunt force

58
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,960
 trauma. So everything's okay. And in that article on the coast to coast AM, it goes, this is also

59
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,040
 similar to something happened in Canada back in 2018. So I'm clicking on that one. And that one

60
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,600
 is pretty much what we talked about. A guy is walking down the beach and he just to see starlings

61
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,560
 falling out of the sky. Now what's interesting is in that case as well, the corner, the bird corner

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,080
 says they just smashed into the ground. That's how they died. But the question is, why are they

63
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,960
 smashing into the ground? And this is something it's so funny. I read this litany of articles this

64
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,680
 weekend. And I thought bird, mass bird die offset. So it's talked about in the news all the time. I

65
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,920
 would normally not cover it. It's it's unfortunate if you're a bird, but for other people, it's just

66
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,800
 kind of inconvenient. So now they're driving home and their car is like, but like, I'm sure the

67
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,920
 coyotes love this type of thing. So I never really paid much attention to it. But the fact is that

68
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,640
 nobody knows what's causing this. What's interesting is the one in Wales, they go, well, what we think

69
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,120
 is because the starlings fly in formation, they usually follow the lead bird. And if you had a

70
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,520
 giant predator appear, all the starlings panic, they fly out of the trees, and then they crashed

71
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,760
 into the ground because the leader got so scared, he led the entire thing on some sort of kamikaze

72
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,720
 mission right into it's not even kamikaze because kamikaze, you killed the predator coming after

73
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,800
 you, they just smashed into the ground and died. But remember, that one didn't have a witness.

74
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,640
 So you could say yes, or maybe a predator showed up in the Canadian one on the beach, there was a

75
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,960
 guy sitting there and he goes, I was sitting there on the beach. And all of a sudden birds just started

76
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,720
 falling out of the sky. And the answer for that was, Oh, a predator must have shown up and scared

77
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,640
 them into the ground. And he's probably like, I mean, a whale, maybe I didn't see any large

78
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:28,560
 predator. And now we have this one in Spain with multiple witnesses in the middle of the day at a

79
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:37,920
 hospital. And they said they just fell out of the sky. It'll be interesting to see how long they go.

80
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,760
 Oh, there must have been a unknown large predator in the area that nobody at the, nobody of the

81
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,440
 hospital saw and it didn't get picked up on any security cameras. Just it was that this is really

82
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,320
 interesting because I always did also brush this off. But what is killing these birds? Why it's

83
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,440
 causing these birds to just fall out of the sky? I know we've had bird dios before and most of the

84
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,800
 time it is done without people seeing them, they just wake up to all these birds. So I don't know,

85
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,880
 honestly, I'm thinking, I'm thinking they're bumping into some sort of invisible object.

86
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,120
 The most likely thing I guess, honestly, to me, the most likely thing is these guys are being

87
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,640
 chemically poisoned. And they're dying because they hit the ground, but the poison, I mean, poison

88
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,520
 may not kill you, but I wouldn't recommend driving a car while you're on it. If you drank some industrial

89
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,040
 paint or got some waste in your lungs, it may not kill you outright, but the car accident,

90
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,680
 if you're driving to the hospital because you're sick as a dog or sick as a bird in this case.

91
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,800
 So what is killing these birds? Fascinating, fascinating story. And it's one of those ones.

92
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,720
 I don't think we'll have any answer for it. I just wanted to kind of highlight it because we have

93
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,840
 these mass dioffs as people are looking at them. And science will come up with an answer. The question

94
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,920
 is, is it the right one? I mean, anyone can come up with a answer. Cantillians, let's go ahead and

95
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,840
 toss you the keys to the dead rabbit robot. We're going to leave behind Spain. We're going to row

96
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,760
 all the way back to America. Specifically, we're headed to Santa Monica. I think where this guy's

97
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,480
 at. Hoove, ho, splash. Hoove, ho, splash. Row in that boat all the way back to Spain. Cantillians,

98
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,040
 the brave captain of this party vessel. The reason why we're headed out to Santa Monica,

99
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,800
 because we're about to meet the most lovable, face stealing hobo you could ever hope to meet.

100
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,520
 Once again, we're going to look at the life of Max Kramer. Max Kramer, we've done a couple

101
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:42,480
 episodes on already. Homeless man/video game developer/philosopher of our age. Because the

102
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,480
 stuff that he comes up with is just, mwah. It's what I like to describe as organized insanity.

103
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,160
 It's the ramblings of a madman, but he's able to put it into proper grammar and host it on a website.

104
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,320
 Now, this story was brought to me by Oogs. Oogs, thank you so much for the countless hours of Max

105
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,240
 Kramer-isms. He's still around. He's still active. Like I said before, I have not even gotten through

106
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,560
 all of the stuff he wrote back in the early 2000s. But he is a mind outside of society. Let's go

107
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,280
 ahead and take a look at this stuff. Because when you are a man outside of the norm, the first thing

108
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,040
 you're going to see is the hidden codes. Because I'm seeing like Pepsi billboards and Coca-Cola

109
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,480
 trucks driving by with those massive advertisements. My mouth is salivating as I'm thinking of a

110
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,920
 grilled cheese burrito. That's a new thing. That's a new thing that Taco Bell has. It's a

111
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:41,760
 exactly what it sounds like. But I'm a simple man. I'm a man who lives into base desires, right?

112
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,640
 I just sit there and I see this food and I want to consume it. I'm the ultimate consumer. What

113
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,920
 television show is going to show me an ad next? I can't see the code. So I just eat. I just eat

114
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,640
 this fast food, this grease, these oils. I don't understand what I'm putting in my body. But Max

115
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,680
 Kramer does. Max Kramer knows what I'm putting in my body. He's probably hiding in my closet and he

116
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,800
 takes little notes. The dude is a madman. He wants threatened to wear our skin and attack our children.

117
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,280
 So he is nuts. Well, let's take a look. Because he's broke the code here. You've got to be nuts.

118
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,480
 You've got to want to steal my skin to realize that Wendy's, you know, that delicious restaurant

119
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:31,200
 called Wendy's with the Frosties. Wendy's actually means when dies. So when you go to a Wendy's,

120
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,240
 what you're doing is you're eating humans. You are now officially accountable. If you've ever

121
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,600
 eaten a Wendy's in your life, which I just admitted I have, you're eating when dies. This is where they

122
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:53,120
 take people and when they die, they cut them up into square hamburgers. Now, I'm not going to tell you.

123
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,360
 I'm not going to tell you what he thinks about Burger King's Whopper because it involves a racial

124
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,160
 slur against my Italian brother and sisters. But he thinks that the Whopper is made of you. If

125
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,440
 you're Italian without saying the slur, he believes that when you're eating a Whopper from Burger King,

126
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,240
 you're actually eating Italian people. So you go like, you know what I'm done being a cannibal?

127
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,320
 I'm not going to go to Burger King anymore because I don't like Italian. I'm not going to go to Wendy's

128
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,120
 because I don't like eating humans. I'm going to go to McDonald's. Well, be careful what you order

129
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:35,200
 at a McDonald's because did you know that a Big Mac is what you're actually eating? You're actually

130
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,200
 eating a Jewish warrior, a Maccabee, a Jewish priestly warrior from the early second century.

131
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,160
 So you're wondering why that tasted so, so stale. It's because the meat is from like 168 BC.

132
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,840
 So he has this thing. If you haven't noticed the theme yet that fast food restaurants sell human

133
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,840
 meat. If you get, but let's say you don't want to go to fast food restaurant. Let's say you just

134
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,640
 want to go to your local submarine sandwich shop. Well, hold on. Max Cramer jumps out of the bushes

135
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,640
 and goes, what are you thinking? What are you thinking? A submarine sandwich means, the submarine

136
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,760
 part means this is meat from people. You like, damn it, Max. Can we just eat something that isn't

137
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,600
 human? He's like, no, not if you eat food. If you take, if you capture an enemy submarine,

138
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 if you capture an enemy submarine, because there's so many of those floating around nowadays,

139
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,720
 you capture an enemy submarine and you turn those people into meat. That's a submarine

140
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,840
 sandwich. That's what they mean by they say that you're eating, that would be like a hundred of

141
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,680
 these sandwiches produced every year. There's not that many people in submarines, Max. You take these

142
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:52,000
 submarine people and turn them into a submarine sandwich. But what's curious is that sandwich

143
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:03,360
 actually means a witch from the Middle East. So I don't know a lot about the Middle East,

144
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,800
 their military capabilities, but I'm pretty sure submarines aren't high on the list. I'm pretty

145
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,200
 sure there is not enough submarines owned by Israel, Jordan, Iran, Iraq, any of these countries,

146
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,200
 Egypt. They might have some, but I don't think it's enough to provide meat for all of these subway

147
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,200
 sandwich shops out there that sell submarine sandwiches. Oh, and by the way, subway, if you

148
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,000
 thought about going there, it doesn't mean eat fresh. It actually means they take people who have

149
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,440
 died in underground train crashes. And when's the last time you heard about that? He actually,

150
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,840
 okay, I'm giving him a little bit of credit because I'm saying underground train crashes as in a

151
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,600
 subway. He actually specified the underground railroad. And I'm assuming he does not think that

152
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,120
 you're eating Harriet Tubman when you go to subway. I'm thinking he meant underground train

153
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,520
 crashes and not meat from the 1800s. Could be wrong. So you want to go to in and out, you're

154
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,000
 like, "I just want the segment to end. I don't want to talk about eating people anymore." We're

155
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,720
 sitting in an in and out restaurant. They take the meat from prisoners because you get it prisoners,

156
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,240
 the revolving door, the school, the prison pipeline. It's not just words. Those are slogans for

157
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,760
 in and out burger. Jack in the box, Jack in the coffin, Carl's Jr. I didn't know this. Again,

158
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,880
 I'm not a huge scholar on World War II era Europe or the Nazis or anything like that.

159
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,760
 So I don't know if this is true. I doubt it. I think this is very, very suspicious.

160
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:42,080
 But Carl's Jr., the restaurant Carl's Jr. means Nazis. So now I love Carl's Jr. So I hope that

161
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,960
 doesn't say anything about me, but Carl's Jr. means Nazis. They do have the best barbecue sauce,

162
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:55,920
 not the Nazis. Carl's Jr. The reason why Carl's Jr. means Nazis to Max Kramer is because Jews

163
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:04,160
 in Nazi Germany were called juniors. Now, I don't think that's true. I don't, again, I'm not a huge

164
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:12,640
 scholar on the Holocaust, but I'm pretty sure that is not a fact. I don't think anyone was like,

165
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,400
 get the juniors over here. I don't think so. But again, I could be wrong. I could be wrong. He

166
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,600
 could actually know more about that than I do. He ends up wrapping up the list by telling us that

167
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,000
 Domino's, the last place we could probably eat at this point. Domino's means, well, Dom, again,

168
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,280
 I don't know if this is true, but Dom means blood in Hebrew. So when you say I want to eat Domino's

169
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,320
 pizza, what you're actually saying, what you're actually telling the universe is you want bloody

170
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:53,200
 nose, you want bloody nose pizza because you're saying blood in nose pizza when you want Domino's

171
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,280
 pizza. Now you know all these restaurants. Now you know all of this stuff that you didn't want to

172
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,720
 know that there's a guy walking around the streets of America today thinking that when he sees you

173
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,800
 walking out of Carl's Junior, you just ate a bunch of Jewish people and he's looking at you

174
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,120
 and he's judging you because he thinks you're a cannibal who supports Nazi empires.

175
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,080
 Let's see what he has to say about the NFL. Let's see what he has to say about the National

176
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,960
 Football League. He starts off kind of strong on this one. He says this, I'll agree with this,

177
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,840
 I'll agree with this first part. He says that football is a way to represent war. I don't think

178
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,320
 that's a groundbreaking statement that basically we are such a conflict driven species and we have

179
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,720
 tribalism and we love to beat other people that we've turned that aggression into sports where I

180
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,320
 can go from my town and you can go from your town and we can watch our two combatants fight

181
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,360
 against each other. It's modern day gladiatorial combat without people's heads getting rolled off.

182
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,760
 Totally agree with him but then he of course takes it to the next level. But the point isn't just

183
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,320
 a physical confrontation. This is where Max Kramer takes it. He sees it as a punishment.

184
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,560
 So this is what's actually going on when you watch a football game. You're not watching

185
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,360
 two armies fight because we did that already. This is two armies trying to throw poop into

186
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,200
 each other's food. Here's a quote from him and he's trying to explain a football game

187
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,560
 but he also sees it as us trying to poop in the enemy's supply lines. So if you have the

188
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:41,920
 Seattle Seahawks versus the Dallas Cowboys, every time they get down to do the hut hut hike thing,

189
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:48,880
 the quarterback, what he's actually symbolizing is poop. His poop coming out of his butt hole.

190
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,240
 You're like Jason of course. I know that you just want to keep talking about poop don't you?

191
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:00,000
 He's pooping into his hands that football is excrement and then his entire team has one goal

192
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,320
 to get his poop into the mouths of the enemy. Jason of course watched a lot of football.

193
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,400
 I've never seen anyone eat a football. This is how he explains it. If one doesn't have a toilet,

194
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:22,080
 this is actual quote from him. If one doesn't have a toilet, it must squat

195
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,800
 down and balance the self with one outstretched hand on the ground to make the ball of feces fall

196
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,520
 to the feet. If all the food is not digested, perhaps a quarter comes back to the plate.

197
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,800
 Quarterback. That's what that term means. You didn't know what you do now. The food goes down

198
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,520
 the line in factories. The touchdown in the end zone represents feces in the mouth and the stomach.

199
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,000
 He goes on to say that this does symbolize that no matter what side of the battle you're on,

200
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,040
 you've probably eaten feces in urine because people are constantly making touchdowns and what

201
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,920
 they're symbolizing is that the Seattle Seahawks went to the Dallas Cowboys Stadium and pooped in

202
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,280
 all their food. And then once again one of the most bizarre things about Max Kramer actually

203
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,680
 forgot until I was reading this all the way through just now. He goes on to say that he doesn't

204
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,640
 think black people are real. It is one of the weirdest quirks that I don't think I've really

205
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,280
 dove into it because he just kind of ends conspiracy theories like that. I haven't found

206
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,320
 the full one but he believes that black people are actually Asians. Might be specifically Korean but

207
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,960
 he believes that black people are actually Asians painted black to turn him gay.

208
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,880
 And that even pops up here. When I was reading through this he says that

209
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,240
 feces in urine appear to be in most food while people painted black celebrate and act like fools.

210
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,360
 But he thinks they're actually Asian men who are trying to seduce him. The dude is nuts. It's

211
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,360
 funny because sometimes I feel like I talk about him too much and other times I'm like we have

212
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,480
 barely scratched the surface with this guy. I really need to find out why. Can I ever? He's

213
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,320
 still alive. I would actually love to talk to the guy. Yeah it's just so bizarre and I just find

214
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,280
 it so interesting because I am into hidden symbols and codes. I don't talk about a lot on this show

215
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,800
 but I am into hidden symbols and codes and not ARG things but what we see in the world around us

216
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,320
 and how it works and how it affects people. I really do think about all that stuff and he takes

217
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,280
 that to the nth degree. I've never walked past the McDonald's and thought I wonder how many

218
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,840
 Jewish people are being eaten in there. I would assume the answer is always zero so I never need

219
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,200
 to think about it but yeah what a different breed. Max Kramer is so bizarre. So so bizarre.

220
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,880
 There's no other way to end that segment other than to toss cantilians. The keys of the carbon

221
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,000
 helicopter were leaving behind Santa Monica. We're headed all the way out to Poland.

222
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:00,560
 I wanted to give another shout out. I did another podcast recently called The Asylum Case Studies

223
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,440
 and it was me and the host Tressa. We watched the The Asylum Movie, three-headed shark attack.

224
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,840
 Asylum makes these really goofy. That's being nice. He's really goofy straight to sci-fi channel

225
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,840
 movies and I really enjoy Three Headed Shark Attack. That's a lot of fun so if you guys want

226
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,120
 some more Dead Rabbit to listen to this weekend I am on Tressa's show The Asylum Case Studies and

227
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,040
 if you love bad movies and if you love the culture of bad movies definitely give that a try. It's a

228
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,240
 really cool podcast. As we're headed out to Poland we also got to go back in time so cantilians

229
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:40,720
 hit that time travel button and take us back to the month of July 1948. Carbonicopter. It's flying

230
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,760
 over the Poland countryside. Specifically we're going to Sosnowyk in Poland. It's a bright summer

231
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,600
 afternoon. It's harvest time in the village and everyone's getting their sickles and their little

232
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,400
 clamps and stuff like that and they're walking out to where the corn is or the weed or whatever

233
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,360
 they're growing in Poland and they leave behind a young boy. Let's call him Timmy. He's a 12 year

234
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,880
 old kid and he is left behind in the village to, according to this report, he was left behind to

235
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,800
 guard his house which I don't know about. I mean if everyone in the village is leaving he's the

236
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,120
 only one here. Who's he guarding it from? I'm almost thinking that this kid they could have been like

237
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,280
 oh we don't want him back in the field. All these guys are all caught up when he was just doing that

238
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,000
 skythian accident. He was just skythian blindly cutting down that wheat baby. I gotta do it fast.

239
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,920
 Other people are like walking around no arms so they leave Timmy at home

240
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,960
 and he's sitting there. He's like well if I'm gonna guard the house I'm gonna do the best

241
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,880
 Dosh Garn house guarding I can do and he does it for about 10 minutes and he gets super bored

242
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,280
 and he goes inside. He goes I'm just gonna go listen to music. Now it's 1948. I actually didn't

243
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,160
 know this existed and maybe this is a huge plot hole in this presumably true story but

244
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,040
 he goes out to listen to the radio and he had headphones. Did they have headphones in 1948?

245
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,760
 And more specifically did they have headphones in 1948 in Poland? I don't know. I don't know.

246
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:16,640
 I probably should check that out. Let me let me check it out real quick. When were headphones

247
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,600
 invented?

248
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,760
 1910. Okay so they would have had headphones. Okay that makes the story. I was really iffy on the

249
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,240
 story honestly. I was gonna tell it anyways but I just want to read it up so it could have happened.

250
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,600
 Not that that's the most strange thing. I'm like see you guys later have a good weekend. That's not

251
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,000
 the strangest thing of the story. He's sitting there and he puts on the headphones and he turns

252
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,280
 on the music and there's no music coming out of the radio. Instead he's hit with a strange unbearable

253
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:59,360
 sound coming out of the radio. He takes off the headphones and he can still hear the noise

254
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,160
 and he's looking down at his headphones and he's thinking this must be really loud if without

255
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,880
 these headphones on he can still hear it pretty clear and then he realizes it's coming from outside.

256
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:21,920
 He stands up, he walks to the window and he opens it up. Outside what he sees are two

257
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:31,280
 humanoid entities. They both have thin short bodies with large disproportionate heads.

258
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:41,760
 Black piercing eyes too large to be a human. These are what we would describe as gray aliens nowadays

259
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,680
 and these two creatures in the middle of the day are standing there in silvery shimmering

260
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:57,760
 skin tight outfits. Now they don't notice him. They don't notice him looking out the window and

261
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,960
 seeing these guys. That doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all. Simply seeing these two inhuman

262
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:15,280
 figures causes him to go into shock and then fall unconscious. Hours pass. Remember everyone else

263
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,240
 is out doing the harvest. His parents eventually come home. They're like someone was supposed to

264
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,800
 guard her house. What's going on here? Where's the guard? They go in and they find their son

265
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:32,960
 unconscious on the floor and he is revived and the first thing out of his mouth is "I saw the devil

266
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:43,840
 I forgot to add this part. One of them, one of these aliens, which he doesn't identify them

267
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,040
 as aliens, aliens aren't really known in 1948 at all especially in rural Poland, but

268
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,960
 he's looking at one of these aliens and he had horns on his head. He had double horns on his head.

269
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,160
 Now UFOologists today wonder if what he was seeing was a gray alien with a helmet on, a horned helmet

270
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:14,000
 on, or if this alien did have double horns just grow naturally, which would be unusual for gray

271
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,720
 aliens. That's something that's not normally associated with them. But it doesn't matter

272
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,520
 to this kid whether or not he was wearing a horned helmet or actually had horns. I saw

273
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:33,280
 the devil. For the rest of his life, and he did not have an easy life, he blamed all of his

274
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:41,360
 misfortunes on these devils. He believed that everything that everyone went wrong in his life

275
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,600
 could be connected to seeing these two creatures standing outside of his window. Every illness,

276
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:56,720
 every failure, every unhappy moment in his life, it was the curse of the devils that caused it.

277
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,560
 No matter what he did, he couldn't overcome that infernal curse.

278
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:10,560
 I got this story from Albert Rosales, Humanoid Report. It's a really, really cool

279
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,520
 depository of this information. It'll be in the show notes. They got it directly from a

280
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,320
 email. Someone emailed them this story. It was just someone telling the story that had happened

281
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,640
 in their village from Poland. So take it with a grain of salt. But I think you can say that about

282
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,720
 any paranormal story. You can say that about any story you read on the newspaper nowadays, actually.

283
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:36,080
 Looking at this story, I really find this story curious, and I think it's a good way to end the

284
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,080
 week. On Monday's episode, I mentioned that there's a certain powerlessness that comes to

285
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,920
 meeting the paranormal. You're interacting with something that is so beyond humanity,

286
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,480
 that we can talk about punching gray aliens in the face, or doing extra-sisms, and making

287
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,640
 demons run away into the darkness. And those things do happen. But the overriding accounts

288
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,880
 of paranormal, a lot of times it's the humans who do the running away, right? We are very powerless

289
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,800
 in this paranormal aspect, be it a cryptid chasing us down, or a ghost trying to scare us.

290
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,920
 We're always trying to navigate around them. We have to adjust our lives for them. So there is

291
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:25,120
 this powerlessness. And imagine all this kid did. All he did was look out the window, and it drove him

292
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,600
 mad. It drove him to the point that whenever something didn't go right in his life, he believed

293
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,160
 it was because he looked out a window. The first thing I want to remind everyone who's listening

294
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,280
 to this is be careful what you wish for. Because a lot of people, I see this a lot in the paranormal

295
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,520
 community, where they go, "I've never seen a ghost. I've never had a paranormal experience,

296
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,720
 but I really want to have one." You see that a lot when you're looking in the paranormal community.

297
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,400
 They are fans of the subject matter, and they kind of wish that it would happen to them.

298
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,800
 Be careful what you wish for. You may get a gray alien showing up and teaching you peace,

299
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,000
 love, and kindness. You may get a ghostly visitation from a past loved one telling you everything's

300
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,040
 okay. You can also just as easily get a demonically possessed monster rampaging around your house,

301
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:17,600
 or seeing something so incomprehensible. And that's what a gray alien would be.

302
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,520
 A lot of times we look at pictures and we look at movies like Paul, and we're seeing these

303
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:30,080
 X-Files versions of them, and that's all makeup and CGI. You, to see something that has not evolved

304
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,600
 on the planet Earth, I truly think would break your brain. You can look at the weirdest animal

305
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,120
 on Earth and go, but that's still evolved here. It's still part of our DNA. Something that came

306
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,000
 from another planet, it would just, and if it's from an interdimensional realm, which gray aliens

307
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,120
 very well may be, it's even more mind-boggling. So be careful what you wish for, because you may

308
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,400
 see something that drives you insane. Also, the second thing to take away from is, he didn't

309
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:02,000
 wish for this. He didn't wish for this at all. There's no, aliens, gray aliens were not a thing

310
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,080
 in 1948 that imagery was not out there in the mass populace. He saw something, he didn't want to

311
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,480
 see it. He wasn't reading these sci-fi magazines, he wasn't looking forward to tales from the crypt

312
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:23,280
 being invented, so he could read in the 1960s. He just walked by a window and saw something so

313
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,560
 shocking he passed out and then he believes for the rest of his life, everything that went wrong

314
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:36,640
 was because of this visitation. So it's not just about be careful what you wish for, it's about

315
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,360
 be careful where you exist. But then there's one other way, there's one other thing that I find

316
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,160
 very fascinating about this story, is that we do have to look at the skeptical side of things.

317
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:56,800
 And the most realistic answer is he looked out his window and he saw a trick of the light.

318
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:06,880
 He saw something that was something else. Maybe he fell asleep, maybe he had sleep paralysis,

319
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:14,080
 maybe it was some normal event and it still broke his brain.

320
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,800
 He looks out of his window at a particular time and for whatever reason

321
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:28,240
 his mind conjures up, his imagination creates the image of these two short skinny people

322
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,960
 with big heads and black eyes wearing skin tight silvery suits.

323
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:42,400
 It's not real, it's not real. Any skeptic in the world and most scientists, most normal people

324
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,520
 would say this story isn't real, there are no such thing as great aliens or aliens in general

325
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,080
 and they're definitely not hanging out in Poland to be spotted by one person in a village,

326
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,200
 they just don't exist. So he didn't see anything. And to me that is even more tragic,

327
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,480
 that's even more disturbing because that means that the human mind is so frail

328
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,360
 that you can look out your window and there's nothing there. But your mind creates something,

329
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,640
 whether it is imagination, whether it is a dream, whether it is a trick of the light,

330
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,960
 you're looking at something from a weird angle, it didn't exist, he saw it and it drove him insane

331
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,640
 anyways. What's worse, spending the rest of your life blaming every failure

332
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,760
 on a bizarre pair of creatures standing outside your house and their energy, their darkness

333
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,320
 infused the rest of your life, no matter what you did, you can never succeed in anything.

334
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:53,040
 What is more scary, that or looking out your window at a perfectly normal pastoral setting.

335
00:33:53,040 --> 00:34:00,240
 And simply because he's standing at the wrong angle and something catches the light in just

336
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:10,800
 the right way, his mind imagines devils. His own mind drove him insane because of a trick of the

337
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:20,080
 light the rest of his life was miserable. What's worse, being driven mad by a vision of aliens,

338
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:28,000
 or being driven mad by nothing. At least the aliens you figure you would be one of the few

339
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:37,920
 special individuals in human history who has seen alien life. Maybe that's worth going mad for,

340
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,960
 maybe it's not really, I want to want to do it, but maybe that's worth spending the rest of your

341
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:51,120
 life wishing what could have been if you hadn't seen that infernal duo. But at least you saw something.

342
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:59,120
 In a skeptics world, in the plausible world, he looked out his window and there was nothing there.

343
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:08,480
 And his life was miserable for nothing. His failures continued to mount and he blamed

344
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:16,880
 nothing. That small patch of land outside of his house contained no alien presence.

345
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:28,560
 But he still felt it. It still scarred him. And to the bitter end, he blamed every bad thing in

346
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:38,560
 his life on something that never existed. I guess the lesson here is, when you hear the bump in the

347
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,600
 night, when you hear the rummaging through the closet, when you see something moving in the

348
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:52,720
 distance just by the tree line as you're driving home, simply by looking, simply by turning your

349
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:03,440
 head to see where that sound came from or where that blur moved. You are risking your own psyche.

350
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:11,520
 You are risking your mind. You may see something that absolutely breaks your hold on reality

351
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,960
 and will spend the rest of your life cursing the moment you made that decision.

352
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,720
 But in this case, we've learned there doesn't have to be anything in the darkness.

353
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,760
 There doesn't have to be anything moving through the trees.

354
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:37,120
 Just by thinking there is something out there could be enough to ruin your life.

355
