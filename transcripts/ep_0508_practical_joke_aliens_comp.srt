00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 Today we go back in time to meet the very first battle rapper in ancient Greece, huh?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,240
 And then what would you do if you were confronted with a UFO who said it could give you anything you wanted and

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,540
 Then told you to eat poop today on Dead Rabbit Radio

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:28,280

 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day, too

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,240

 We could always use more reviews just talk about it online, but let's go ahead though and hop in the

14
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,120
 Rabbit do we have a hang glider?

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,840
 Let's hop in the hair glider. Oh, they'll only use this for one episode

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,360
 CJ's like great. I get the

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
 Experimental thing that we're hopping the hair the hair hang glider

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,060
 Whatever whatever we'll just catch a cab hang gliders tied up on the top

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,960
 CJ's like taking down driving a cab

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,240
 Why my support is patreon?

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,800
 Fine. We'll take the head wrap hair. We'll take the hair hang glider. We're flying off to Greece CJ's like yippee

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,080
 We're headed to Greece. We're going back in time as well. We're going back in the year 540 ish

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,760
 We're gonna meet a man named hippo knacks of a fetius now hippo knacks

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,760
 We don't have a lot of his poetry not a lot of it

25
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:59,340
 Survived, but he's very well-known at the time. He was well-known as a vulgar poet who hung out with the criminal class

26
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,660
 I eat a gangster rapper, right? He would sit there and he was just busting flows writing this poetry down

27
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,660
 He's like yo guys. I got a good one for you. Then he sits down with a chisel

28
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,380
 And then he holds up the tablet they're like

29
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,560
 Like and then he waits for his opponent to respond it's like 15 minutes

30
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,360
 He's like oh yeah, he was this battle rapper who just write this vulgar poetry ran with the criminal class

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,960
 He was super ugly as well. That's really what he was. I mean

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,040
 That's not a good thing to be known for right being known as a vulgar battle rapper. That's fine

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,360
 And being ugly, you know on that on your tombstone, but anyway, so people knew him in town. He was pretty famous

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,820
 He was also a he was also a jerk to people that was another thing that kind of goes along with being a battle rapper

35
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,720
 You're not gonna be like battle rapping about how nice the guy's toga is that makes it

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,300
 He wants to marry this woman so he goes to the father and he's like hey

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,940
 You might know me for my extreme ugliness and my battle raps. I'd like to marry your daughter

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,580
 Now the guy he went to his name was buppalus buppalus is like

39
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,840
 Have you looked in a mirror lately here? Let me invent a mirror real quick because it's super ancient Greece

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,400
 He's sitting there. He's polishing something down. Here you go. Look how ugly you are

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,200
 You're not marrying my daughter. Hipponax leaves now buppalus was not a good guy to mess with either. He was a master sculptor

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,560
 Not he wasn't a statue himself

43
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,920
 Sculptor he was the guy who made the statues

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,120
 He is far well known in history of his work because it wasn't you know written down on scrolls and stuff

45
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,140
 Survived when Rome wanted to decorate their

46
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,620
 Colosseums and stuff like that. They were using buppalus statues

47
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,100
 Had a little sign a little B at the bottom. They were using his statues. They took him from Greece

48
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,380
 His artwork was used to fill temples in Rome. It lasted the ages buppalus decides to go

49
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,060
 Not only can you not marry my daughter, but he starts making

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,100
 sculptures of Hipponax

51
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,460
 Who's this ugly guy so he starts making these comically exaggerated

52
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,780
 Ugly statues I mean like hey look everyone this guy wanted to marry my daughter and people in town thought it was hilarious

53
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,700
 Which it kind of is right? I mean maybe the first time but apparently this guy made multiple ugly statues

54
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,260
 His work is celebrated

55
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,260
 Hundreds of years later, but he just couldn't stop making the eighth ugly statue of this dude

56
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,260
 So Hipponax

57
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,980
 Responds the only way that he can he writes a poem

58
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,980
 So Hipponax writes this poem about buppalus at the very first

59
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,420
 Distract buppalus's mom's name. So you know where this is going

60
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:52,060
 Bopalus's mom's name is artie artie, which means virtue and

61
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,260
 Hipponax just drops this

62
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,620
 Bopalus the mother effort with artie and

63
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,440
 People were like he didn't just say effort. It was the Greek word for someone who?

64
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,220
 bangs their mom the audience basically

65
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,220
 Basically goes nuts at this point

66
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:20,620
 Bopalus the man who bangs his mother with virtue is really what that line means because his mom's name means virtue

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,660
 People were like what in the world is going on it continues it talks about his mom

68
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,540
 Sorry this episode segment is not for kids

69
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,700
 It talks for all the sex acts Bopalus does with his mom talks about him banging his mom talks about the mom

70
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:42,440
 Giving oral sex to Bopalus talks about how such a loser Bopalus is that his mom

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,660
 Has to have sex with him the audience is losing it

72
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,220
 They're like dude. I haven't heard anything this funny since I've read this story of edipus rex

73
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,340
 So I'm also like that wasn't a comedy. He's like I know but it was still funny

74
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,580
 So this poem he also goes on to say like I'm beat him up

75
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,380
 Beat him up which is kind of a mild thing right like you're like oh dude you bang your mom your mom's doing all this stuff

76
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
 By the way, I'm gonna punch you in the eye

77
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,180
 That doesn't matter anymore you some of this horrible stuff about me

78
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,620
 There's these ugly statues of hippon acts around town, but everyone in town has heard this poem at this point

79
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:24,340
 It's a viral hit in a time when viruses were wiping out towns. This one was a snappy viral hit

80
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,020
 Bopalus killed himself

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,620
 Because people would not stop laughing the diss track was so

82
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,260
 hard

83
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,260
 This master sculpture

84
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,820
 Sculptor getting not a statue

85
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,980
 hung himself

86
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,700
 Due to a diss track. We don't really know what happened

87
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,780
 We don't know if hippon acts felt bad about it after that or if he did a little b-boy pose

88
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,220
 He could have like as Bopalus is being taken into the grave

89
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,900
 He's like he invents cardboard puts it over the grave and starts breakdancing

90
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,620
 We don't know I would imagine hippon acts was it was a jerk

91
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,220
 But you can be a jerk and still feel bad about causing someone to kill themselves

92
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,780
 But yeah, is that the very first diss track? I would argue so I don't think anyone was dropping stuff during the odyssey

93
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,540
 They're like yo you turn into a pig. That's the only thing I know about the odyssey

94
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,260
 Yo, I shot an arrow through hoops. You made some hoops, but a shot and there

95
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,420
 I don't even know if that's from the odyssey or from like an episode of duck tails or something like that

96
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,580
 But didn't they do that didn't they have a

97
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:30,040
 Like Robinhood you didn't oh Odyssey dude odysseus like come back first a bunch of people turn into pigs

98
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,380
 Like his men they're on a boat and they left Troy

99
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,140
 We should have a story coming up on Troy. I have to do a bunch of research on it

100
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:43,920
 But he leaves Troy. He's floating on a boat and then they go to an island where Sears sees that and all of his men

101
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,920
 Get off and they turn and turn into pigs and then he magically has a supply of hot dogs

102
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,160
 Everyone's like he comes back to Greece. They're like what happened to your crew and he's like

103
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,240
 Here have a hot dog a bunch of people turn into pigs and then he sails away and then

104
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,080
 He goes back to Greece and his wife doesn't recognize him and his dog

105
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,000
 Recognizes him and that was like to show how loyal a dog is over your family

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,520
 And then he's like good dog and then they go you're not Odysseus and he goes

107
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,080
 Yeah, I am and then he has to shoot an arrow through a bunch of stuff a bunch of soldiers

108
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,160
 But she's all just trying to take him and he shoots arrows through him

109
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,400
 No, isn't there like a bunch of hook a bunch of circles and he shoots an arrow through it

110
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,640
 This is a very long explanation for a joke

111
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,600
 They probably didn't make any sense

112
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,240
 But anyways, that is the story of Odysseus if you have a book report to on the Odyssey soon

113
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,160
 You have to have read Odyssey just listen to that. I should do a whole audiobook. I should do a whole podcast series

114
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
 Of me reciting

115
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,940
 Books that I've never read. I'm like the story of Beowulf. So Beowulf met Angelina Jolie

116
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,940
 I should just do that. That should be a whole podcast

117
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:01,880
 CJ from the UK. Let's leave behind old timey grease. Let's hop on the carpenter copter

118
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,400
 We are headed out to new timey grease specifically. We're going to the year 1999. It's June 8th

119
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,600
 We're leaving behind old statues and stuff. We got some brand new togas. I got a statue of an ugly dude

120
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,000
 I'm hanging on to it. We're flying over grease. We're specifically going to Anno Cortesi Anno Cortesi

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,120
 It's 2 a.m. In the morning. There's a student named Demetres Helanus

122
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,760
 He works at this farm. It's 2 a.m. And he has to go turn off some water valves

123
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,880
 He's like, oh, it's time to go to bed at 10 10 p.m. Just like a normal human and then he wakes up at 2

124
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,320
 Oh my god, the farm's flooded. I left the water valves on. He obscended his motorcycle

125
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,000
 He drives through the pitch black farm to go shut off the water valves and then

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,520
 He looks up and there is a golden triangle in the night sky

127
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:01,400
 Just this bright golden light like someone cut a triangle out of reality. Yeah, it's 2 a.m. Dude

128
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,440
 I'm still getting used to the light and the triangle is just floating there and it says to him

129
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,800
 Don't be afraid

130
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,200
 I am the Almighty. I will do whatever you ask of me

131
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,760
 So you think for a second, right? This is an opening, right?

132
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,560
 Whatever you ask this this triangle appears says that it's the Almighty so you're assuming it's God

133
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,160
 That'll be wrong assumption. We'll find out soon. You can have anything about it for a second

134
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,120
 You can have anything which you could ask for like I mean obviously you could go

135
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,640
 I want peace and love for everything in the environment to be

136
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,740
 Or you could be like I want to have the number one podcast in the world

137
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,480
 Or anything in between right? Maybe you want to help the environment and have the number one podcast

138
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,240
 Who knows but you have anything to ask this triangle?

139
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,160
 Demetrius thinks about it and goes yeah, I have these horrible migraines have these horrible migraines

140
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,720
 Can you get rid of them and let me let me add something else on that? I want to quit smoking and the triangle goes done

141
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,000
 Thinking small but those are important things to Demetrius. He the migraines immediately go away

142
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,840
 He's like oh, oh, that's so good. Usually when I have those migraines. I'll listen a triangles in the sky

143
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,640
 Migraines gone and he pulled out his pack of cigarettes and throws them in the ground

144
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,160
 And he feels the bitter taste that's enveloped his mouth for years due to smoking just disappeared

145
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,640
 He's never had a cigarette sense as far as we know

146
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,560
 So the triangle held up its end of the bargain triangle disappears

147
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,500
 That is a great night. You met a triangle

148
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,880
 Give you the wish that you wanted you got two wishes and two is that you know you're fast

149
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,040
 You got to outthink the triangle. He's out the water valves now. He pulls out his flashlight. He's looking around

150
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,960
 Triangle appears above him was a what oh great am I gonna get another wish?

151
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,760
 The triangle appears and it goes in reference to his flashlight throw it away. I

152
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,640
 Will light your way from now on he's like, oh, okay

153
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,920
 I mean you did cure me of an addiction and got rid of my migraines

154
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,440
 So he tosses the flashlight and now the triangles just kind of floating there. He's like working on the valves and he's like

155
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,240
 Imagine he's thinking this is kind of a weird use for divine power like I had a flashlight

156
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
 It worked just fine, but then the triangle goes now

157
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,000
 I want you to go and tell all of your work buddies about me

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,640
 The guy's like, I don't really have any friends at work. The triangle's like, yeah, I'm trying to get you to meet

159
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,880
 I'm trying to get you to meet other people, but go tell your work mates about me

160
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,320
 So to meet you's like, okay, you know the triangle did cure my addiction

161
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,120
 So I should go do that so he goes to like the workers shack and he's like hey guys. What's up?

162
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,520
 It's 2 a.m. Oh, by the way, remember everyone's asleep except this guy. Hey guys guys wake up wake up

163
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,200
 You won't believe it. There's flying triangles out there. It got me to stop smoking and

164
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,240
 It replaced my flashlight and what's like dude go to bed. What are you doing? Did you leave the water valves on again?

165
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,880
 He's like go to bed dude. It's like 2 a.m. He's like, huh, so he goes back out

166
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,960
 No one believes him in the shack goes back out

167
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,880
 The triangle appears again. He goes Demetrius pronounce your name differently this time Demetrius

168
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,360
 You went and told the workers about us and they didn't believe you now

169
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,840
 Go tell your girlfriend about us and he's like what triangle's like go tell your girlfriend about us

170
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
 And he's like well they did cure my migraines

171
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,800
 His girlfriend isn't living a shack on the workplace. He has to get in his car. He drives all the way to his girlfriend's house

172
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,840
 He knocks on the door wakes her up. What is it? Maybe two thirty? It's like dude

173
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,740
 You won't believe this triangle outside. It's fine triangle outside

174
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:38,560
 Caused me to stop smoking no one will believe me is a girlfriend's like I don't believe you either and it's 2 30 a.m

175
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,640
 What are you doing now? What did you leave the water valves on again? It's like listen not about the water valves

176
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,520
 Okay, I should have used my wish that everyone forgot about the water valves. No, there's fine triangle out there

177
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,080
 The girlfriend doesn't believe him so he gets back in his car

178
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,320
 He starts driving back to the farm remember this triangle can easily just appear and show itself to the girlfriend to the workers

179
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,560
 It's basically at this point making him sound insane. It's like

180
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,440
 Like it's looking in through the window. It's like behind the blinds. It's like dude watch

181
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,520
 You know, he's actually telling his girlfriend and you hear what she's saying. No, no, no

182
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,860
 But she looks really mad and super tired

183
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:17,920
 The aliens on the other side of this thing are laughing because at this point I think any casual observer would go

184
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,560
 This isn't the almighty. This is definitely someone who's just pulling practical jokes at this point

185
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,960
 Did cure him of his crippling nicotine addiction and his migraines and replace this flashlight to be fair

186
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,760
 But it can obviously like show itself off and it's telling him to go off and tell these people and then it just

187
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,840
 Disappears it's like hiding so now he's driving back to the farm and the triangle shows up and says get out of your car

188
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,920
 Get out of your car and he's like what?

189
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:49,720
 Well, you did and so he gets out of his car and he's still like miles from the farm and the triangle's like just run

190
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,040
 Just run this one. I'd be scared of the triangle gets me out of my car now

191
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,480
 It's like you run human he runs and he says he's able to run with superhuman speed

192
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,120
 So he actually gets to the farm faster than if he took the car

193
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,560
 That's awesome

194
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,400
 Except for when he has to go back to the car later and he doesn't have super speed, but we don't know about that part

195
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,120
 We just know that he gets this farm super fast the triangle appears above him

196
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,200
 He's all alone in the middle of the farm. No one believes him and the triangle goes

197
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,200
 You're pretty cool dude, man. You run super fast. He's like really you guys think I'm cool. They're like, yeah

198
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,280
 You're so you're super cool, you know, it'd be really cool

199
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,460
 You can almost hear the interdimensional creatures laughing on the other side of the void

200
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,160
 You know, it'd be really cool if you you got that lighter, right? He's like, yeah, I got a lighter

201
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,120
 He's like burn your hand. What what you want me to burn my hand? Yeah, dude

202
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,000
 It'd be super like we burn our hands over here all the time

203
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,280
 Burn it he goes on, you know

204
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,480
 Haven't been steered wrong yet by these guys and he takes this lighter out starts burning his hand

205
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,360
 Demetrius says he feels no pain during this but he can see he's holding the lighter on for so long

206
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,760
 He can smell his skin cooking this smell

207
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,880
 He said actually started to make him sick to his stomach. So he stopped and the triangle goes do it again

208
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,520
 It's like what no

209
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,920
 He sure it doesn't hurt. It's kind of weird that doesn't hurt, but this do it again. He's like, uh-huh

210
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,640
 Get a little nervous now. He's lying

211
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,800
 Burn he did it three times

212
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,200
 Setting his hand burning his hand. He said never felt any pain, but he could smell the flesh cooking

213
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,760
 Then the triangle goes

214
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,760
 You know what would be really cool. He's like damn it. You know, it'd be really cool

215
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:43,040
 You got a bunch of dirt in you. He's like what no, I don't they're like, yeah, no trust us

216
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,920
 We have this special device that can determine a person's dirt amount in their body

217
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,160
 You have a lot of dirt in you Demetrius

218
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,680
 burn it out

219
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,760
 Swallow the flame and burn it out

220
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,740
 This story is interesting because we've talked about this on other stories the level of degrees like the first

221
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,380
 Off the triangle shows up and says what do you wish and he gives it to him and then he's like

222
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,860
 Replace the flashlight you replace the flashlight tell your workmates tell your old friends stuff like that

223
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,980
 It's a matter of degrees if the very first thing the triangle goes. Oh sure. You don't have to smoke anymore

224
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,540
 Swallow flame you'd be like no, but it's on a level of degrees

225
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,340
 He's already agreed to do so much stuff that this triangle's told him to do with really no ill results

226
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,540
 Other than the smell of flesh cooking when the triangle tells him to eat flame

227
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,860
 He does it whether or not it actually burns out the dirt in his body because the triangle says you have the dirt in your body

228
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,380
 You have to swallow flame to burn it out. I mean, I don't know if that happened at this point when I was reading the storm thing

229
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,940
 And these aliens they're just a bunch of frat boy. I assume they're aliens honestly

230
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,100
 Imagine two alien frat boys got a hold of a spaceship. They're their spacesuits have popped collars on them

231
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,220
 They're flying through the galaxy and they see this dude out in the middle of nowhere and they're like, oh dude

232
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,460
 Let's see how far we can push this dude

233
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,900
 Because that's really what it seems it seems like just to be this slow escalation because we're not done yet

234
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
 He's now swallowing flame

235
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,620
 And then they go tell you what tell you what okay. That was we just wanted to test you now

236
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,580
 We want you to hold that flame and he's probably thinking please no please no more flame related stuff

237
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,740
 And they go we want you to sing this

238
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:26,220
 Orthodox him you got to sing it three times while holding the lighter. You're like, oh, I can easily do that

239
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:33,100
 I'm not burning myself. I'm not swallowing flame and he does it and the triangle is like good good a little pitchy a little pitchy

240
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,780
 but

241
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,780
 decent decent hymnal singing

242
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,220
 Then they go. Hey, you see that dirt over there

243
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,100
 Yes, yes triangle. Yes triangle. I see the dirt and it's like

244
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,020
 Uh, you need to eat it now at this point I would go wait a second

245
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,820
 Then I just burned the dirt out of me, but Demetrius

246
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,740
 eats the dirt

247
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
 Just walks over it takes a big old handful of it

248
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,860
 Okay, to be fair. I don't know if it was a big handful

249
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,220
 He's gonna taking a dirt clot and eating it, but he eats the dirt

250
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,780
 And then I imagine at this point on this on this frat controlled UFO. It was a booze cruise

251
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,540
 Someone else grabs the microphone at this point and was like dude. You guys are small potatoes, right?

252
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:20,700
 Yeah, sure burning himself eating dirt. Whatever. Let me show you how it's done at kappa kappa gamma

253
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,180
 He grabs the microphone and goes hey

254
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,060
 Yeah, it's new voice. Uh, it's dimensional thing. Sometimes our voice has changed due to like, uh

255
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:33,180
 Stuff it doesn't matter, but anyways new voice. I want you to get a cup of water

256
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:39,580
 Demetrius like okay. I see where this is going. It's pretty fine. It's a cup of water and then the voice goes

257
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,140
 See that fertilizer over there

258
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,460
 Mix it with the water and drink it

259
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,900
 Now Demetrius may not be the smartest guy on the farm. He's definitely the most gullible

260
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,140
 But even he knows that fertilizer mixed with water is a

261
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:01,100
 Extremely toxic poison. It'll create a concoction that will drop you on the spot if it doesn't you're definitely

262
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,260
 Gonna be dead soon

263
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,220
 But he trusts the aliens is there laughing on the other side. They're like, oh dude. He's really gonna do it

264
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,020
 We're totally gonna murder this guy. Come on bleep blorp. Don't go that far. I'll tell you when I'm done

265
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,820
 Bleep blorp says to the to the pledges

266
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,020
 Tell you when I'm done. We're gonna push this guy as far as you can. He takes his fertilizer and water

267
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,380
 Looks up at the triangle. You guys like after I do this, we're gonna be friends, right? You guys are gonna like me after I do this

268
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,460
 Uh, yeah, dude, you you'll be like totally awesome. Demetrius is like, okay cool

269
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,780
 look look look look

270
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,540
 You can taste the fertilization you can taste the manure

271
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,820
 But the fact that he can taste it proves that he doesn't die

272
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,380
 So despite the fact that he the aliens now made him drink poison

273
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,460
 It really he's believed it obviously the whole time he has superhuman powers. He's running fast. He's not being burned

274
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,020
 So on his mind, he may be thinking well

275
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,420
 They're gonna protect me from the fertilizer poison as well

276
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,220
 So he trusts them and they do protect him. It doesn't kill him

277
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,180
 We can look back at this and laugh and go man, this guy's so gullible. I would have never drank that

278
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,980
 But at the same time I also have never ran a two miles in a minute and a half

279
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,380
 So I guess there would be a level of that

280
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,260
 But then just to top it all off to prove that these aliens truly are intergalactic frappers

281
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,700
 They got this guy to drink what he knew as poison. How do you top that?

282
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,780
 How do you end off a night after tricking a guy to drink poisonous manure water?

283
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:33,180
 You get him to drink his own urine at this point as Demetrius is drinking his own urine

284
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:39,980
 I imagine the aliens in the triangle just completely besides themselves laughing it up

285
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,740
 Because there is no other reason why you would want someone else to drink their own urine unless you were trying to trick them

286
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,380
 I can't think of one right, but Demetrius does drink his own urine

287
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,540
 He's like now are we friends now? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're friends the aliens tell him also

288
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,540
 I don't know this seems like a weird addition

289
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:05,740
 Like they've been doing all this stuff all night and then they give the standard message like someday all the evil doers will be destroyed

290
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,940
 It seems a little like she's a little anti-climatic after I drank poison and survived

291
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:19,580
 But they tell him that and then the aliens leave but they can't leave without doing one last practical joke on this dude on poor Demetrius

292
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,940
 Maybe that he's suffering the debilitating effects of drinking poisonous poop water

293
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,620
 Maneuver fertilizer mixed together poured in a stew and down his goal. That's possible

294
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,020
 But he says that after the triangle left

295
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,540
 He heard music for about 10 minutes. He heard music in the air

296
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,140
 Now I don't know what type of bands that Demetrius listens to

297
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,340
 And I definitely don't know what type of what type of prog rock band bleep lorbs a member of

298
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,020
 But this is how he described this music that he heard

299
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:58,300
 He said it resembled quote many birds singing. That's kind of cute, right? Many birds singing and then

300
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,540
 animals screaming

301
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,020
 live wolves and jackals howling

302
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,220
 And it went on for 10 minutes

303
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,860
 So it's like

304
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,780
 And Demetrius just sitting there belly full of poison

305
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,780
 He's like oh this music is so so beautiful. I'm so glad the triangle came to me

306
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:26,060
 Live wolves jackals and what was the birds? I how could even hear the birds over the animal screaming?

307
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,180
 This has to be

308
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,660
 a joke not in the sense that

309
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:39,100
 This guy's making it up because this it will assume that this encounter is real just for the sake of you know UFO stories, but

310
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,420
 This can't be what aliens are actually like. This can't be what the other

311
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:49,180
 intelligences are like in this universe like sure they did get him to quit smoking and cured his migraines

312
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:56,300
 But in return they humiliated him and so that concludes the story of Demetrius

313
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,220
 Demetris, did you know that that actually in greek

314
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:07,260
 That means name of a thousand pronunciations you pronounce it however you want. It's totally okay with all the demetrius eyes out there

315
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,940
 So that is his story

316
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,860
 And I think it's a very revealing look at what may actually happen when aliens do try to invade this planet

317
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,860
 We've always been thinking of like flying ships and like blowing stuff up

318
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,820
 That stuff will probably happen. Something will probably happen regardless

319
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:27,020
 But maybe it won't be a war between two military superpowers. Maybe it'll be

320
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,260
 A haze battle against two fraternities

321
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,740
 The fraternity of glip glop glorp out there floating around space

322
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,620
 They're out there with like their paddles, but they're lightsabers. Ah, this hurts way more than it should

323
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,260
 They're doing all their toilet paper

324
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:49,420
 entire black holes the toilet paper keeps getting sucked in and then you got the real fraternity

325
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,020
 The earth fraternity terra terra terra

326
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,780
 And you know what we don't put up with any intergalactic shenanigans like if it comes down to a technological war

327
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:03,980
 Sure, they'll probably win. They do have lightsaber. They do have lightsaber technology in their haze paddles

328
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,500
 But if it comes down to a haze war

329
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,340
 Humanity will destroy these aliens like sure. They got this guy to drink poison. That's pretty funny, right?

330
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,700
 But I'm sure we could come up with something way better than that

331
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,620
 I think if you got all of the fraternities together you got a great meeting of the mind get out of my way general

332
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,740
 I picked on you in high school and now I'm taking over your job. They're just walking into the UN pushing everyone over get out of the way

333
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:33,900
 Popped callers everywhere. You've never seen that many pastel pink polo shirts in your life

334
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,020
 And you work at a pastel pink polo shirt factory the fraternities have now taken over the UN

335
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,660
 four hours after the big pong party

336
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:47,740
 Four hours after everyone is done drinking they sit there and they go okay now it's time to defeat these aliens

337
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,620
 So bring it dude bring it. We have the best

338
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
 bullies on the planet

339
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,860
 Actually, of course because this is only the planet. We have the best bullies in the universe

340
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,100
 So aliens if you think you can prank all the demetrias of the planet

341
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:09,500
 Maybe you'll get one or two, but there's no way you'll be able to defeat all of terra terra terra the best fraternity

342
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,220
 in the universe

343
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,340
 Can I can I start my own fraternity called terra terra terra?

344
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,860
 I'm gonna have to look into that because that would be super that would be super dope

345
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,540
 We all get like letterman jackets. They just have a picture of the earth on it

346
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,500
 And then like a line through the earth were for the earth

347
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,700
 We're not saying no earth, but a line wait. No, you'd have a picture of the earth and then like

348
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,980
 An alien you'd have to have an alien in there. How about you have a picture of the earth, right?

349
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,620
 You're like just just finish the episode hold on you have a picture of the earth on the back of your letterman's jacket

350
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,940
 And then and there's like a thumb

351
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,540
 There's like a thumbs up

352
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,420
 For the earth and then this is a very cluttered letterman's jacket and then kind of underneath the left armpit

353
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:54,140
 There's like an alien sneaking up on the earth and he has like an x through him

354
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:59,260
 And then on the right side of the armpit like I said very very cluttered letterman's jacket

355
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:04,460
 so alien with an x through it earth with a giant thumbs up and then

356
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,780
 On the other side like on the right hand side

357
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:14,060
 You have a picture of a super sexy alien space babe and a dude in a super tight pastel pink polo shirt

358
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,140
 Popped collars of course with his arm around the space babe

359
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:26,140
 Yeah, there we go. I want that letter. I want that letterman jacket. Are you willing to join terra terra terra today?

360
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,700
