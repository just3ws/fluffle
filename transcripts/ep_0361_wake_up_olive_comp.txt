 A grim discovery.
 Stardoles scientists. And then we travel to Reading, California to investigate whether or not a cult is taking over the city.
 But this isn't any cult.
 It's a cult that can raise the dead today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 [Music]
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenteror.
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a lot of fun today.
 Let's go to Poland. Let's go to the year 2013
 Poland.
 Bing! We're magically there. Carpenter copters in the shop. We're just walking around a bunch of trees are surrounding us.
 We're hanging out with a bunch of bat researchers. These guys are hunting bats. So we're there. We have rifles.
 We're like, they're like, no we're not hunting bats like that dude. You lunatic swark.
 He's showing up with shotguns to blow these, blow these bats away. We're like, oh, I thought that's what we were doing.
 We put our rifles and shotguns away. They're like, no we're observing the like migration pattern.
 Then we just kind of zone out as they kind of tell us what they're actually doing with the bats.
 But while they are looking for the bats, this is what happened. True story here. They're hunting bats.
 They're searching for bats and they know that the bats tend to hang out in this underground
 abandoned nuclear bunker, which is probably the four coolest words you can put together.
 And so they're in there. They're shining their flashlights and the bats are like
 And they're like all flying out all dramatically. There's some guy in the corner being like, oh today's the day both my parents were killed.
 There's actually a thing called the Bruce Wayne syndrome in the bat research community. They don't let orphans
 work with bats because they're afraid what's gonna happen. It's an actual thing. Don't Google it. Don't look don't look it up
 But it's called the Bruce Wayne
 What did I call him before the blue? It's not the Bruce Wayne syndrome. It's the Bruce Wayne Claws. They have it at universities. Bat
 universities. They don't they when you go to apply for this joke's taken too long. You guys got it. It was dumb
 Let's just keep going here. A bunch of bats flying around some guy in the corner going hmm. What scares a criminal?
 And the rest of the bat researchers are like again
 Another vigilante was born on this research trip as well, but as we're watching the bats fly around
 something
 Unexpected happens. Not the birth of a crime fighter. No, they expect that at this point when they're walking around this bunker. They hear a
 Now like what is that noise like we get it? There's leaves and stuff on the ground
 They're making the noise and who wasn't a goblin story doesn't involve a goblin coming up behind them
 And they were never seen again. No the crunching noise was from them walking around
 They're like that's weird and they're looking around making sure none of their co-workers are eating rice Krispies. None of them are
 They're walking on ants and they're like, okay big deal. Huh? You know me finish. They're walking on
 one million ants a
 Million ants in there they went in there to steady bats and instead they found a colony of one million ants and
 in a pitch dark
 Nuclear bunker and they're kind of scratching their heads and they're like
 I wonder what what all these ants are doing in here
 Wonder what they're also scratching their heads because bats keep landed in their hair
 But they're like why are a bunch of ants in here? So they went and got some ant dudes
 They went and got some ant scientists to come to this bunker
 They go back to the university and they're like hey, yeah, we did all our bat stuff
 But you guys might want to go check this place out. And so this is what this is terrifying. This is terrifying
 So they go there. They're looking at ants. This is what they surmised
 This is what they've figured out is that there's no queen down there. And I like that's weird
 So this isn't an actual like ant colony because that'd be fine million ants big giant colony
 They're living here, but here's the thing. There's no queen which means they can't reproduce
 Every ant down there is from someplace else. There's no food at all people aren't dropping sugar cubes down there
 There's no Eminem wrappers. There's nothing. So the ants are surviving by eating other ants
 There's no light down there. It's pitch dark. That's why the bats loved it so much
 But the ants, you know, they can do darkness. They live underground, but you know, they like a little light
 They like a little sun sun on their back
 No food
 Not having food or being able to procreate is more important than their ability to suntan
 But for me, I wouldn't want to be trapped in the dark all the time
 I wouldn't want to have to eat other humans and I do like procreating as well
 But those are the three biggies. So the scientists are like how what is going on here?
 They don't have a queen these aren't these ants weren't born here. Where are they coming from?
 They don't have food down here. So why would they be in here in the first place? And as the scientists are like, hmm
 Stroking their chin and ant falls on their head. They're like, hmm
 Where'd that come from? They flick it into the darkness and they hear it immediately being eaten by other ants
 Hmm now that I've gotten rid of that ant now I can think about where are these ants coming?
 Another ant falls on its head. He's like hmm the ants are
 falling through vents
 Around the nuclear fallout shelter. Now. I know what you're thinking because I was thinking the same thing
 Why would you build a nuclear fallout shelter that had vents kind of defeats the purpose you're like oh
 We're safe now. It's time for me to breathe in some of that sweet sweet it radiated dirt
 But apparently there are vents. Maybe there's some sort of weird filtration system that's broken down since
 1960 when these things were built but ants are falling from the surface into this bomb shelter
 So what's happened what they imagine and there's a million down there
 So what has happened is over it. They're not all alive a bunch of them are like half eaten
 So basically it's probably 500,000 and then 500,000 half bodies
 But the ants are falling through the vent into pitch blackness on top of hundreds of thousands of other ants
 And just be like where am I? Oh my god
 I just up there to get a suntan
 Eating a little bit of a pair getting ready to procreate with the queen next thing I know
 Pitch blackness and he can feel his comrades crawling all over him. Ah get off of me get off of me
 And it's basically sink or swim because you fall down there those ants are starving
 So if you can't immediately start fighting for your life bite people with your pinchers
 You are snapped in half by one of your own clan because all of these ants
 actually were from a
 ant hive
 ant colony on the surface
 Because they ended up the scientists goes
 This is our theory that these ants are actually from the surface from this other colony that's right by here
 They built a bridge out of the bomb shelter back to the surface and when the ants would found the bridge and they crawled up
 They got to the colony. They were immediately accepted back into the colony
 so all of the ants that were falling down in there were from the same clan and
 You you came super close to being food like that
 Most of them probably did become food and the ants that were stuck down there. They had no queen
 They had no social system all they could hope for was for another sweet sweet brother to fall through that chute
 So they could gobble them up and the scientists decided to leave the walkway there because they're like this is going to be an ongoing
 Problem ants are going to keep falling through here and now when they fall through here
 They'll be in there for a little bit and then they'll find the bridge and they'll be able to walk back up to the surface
 totally fine
 But one thing they noticed as they were leaving there was a group of ants who refused to take the bridge up
 They wanted to continue to live their life in darkness looking for a family member to fall through that hole
 Gobble them up
 I find this story terrifying
 That story super creepy. I think you and it's 100% true. There are still a bunch of ants down there
 I completely review they're like I don't want to live by the Queen's rules anymore. I'd rather commit cannibalism than be part of the system
 Man, I'm not a cog in the machine. I'm a cannibal
 I don't think I'm shocking anyone to say if that same type of situation happened with humans if there was a thing where humans were
 Falling into a giant pit the first couple humans would be like oh no
 We're trapped in here and you have a couple people go into shock and a couple people just kind of die
 But other people would be like we're gonna survive no matter what and as more humans kept falling in there
 Eventually, they'd be like we don't have any food
 We're gonna eat the newest humans and then eventually human would fall down there who was stronger than the existing humans
 And he would eat him in retaliation create a new social order and you would have an entire
 Eventually over enough time you would have a culture that was built for the darkness that was built for cannibalism
 And if people were like Jason, this is the dumbest analogy ever
 You're saying there's a pit big enough for like 60 or 70 people to fall into
 And they immediately devolve into cannibalism, you know what I'm saying
 I think it's creepy because I can definitely see the same thing happening now before we move on our next story
 I just want to remind my dear listeners a couple different ways you can support the show you can support us on patreon
 It's in the show notes
 We have a merch store in the show notes if you can't do either of those that's totally fine
 You can give us a review anywhere you listen to the podcast or you can promote the podcast let your friends know you listen to the
 podcast all four of those things help the show
 So so much they really help the show grow
 Now let's go ahead and move on to our next story
 So we're leaving behind the forest of Poland before we start walking out of the force you're like Jason
 You really don't have any ants in your pocket. I was like no man. No don't I pull my pockets out. You're like your other pocket
 I'm like a pull the chance come out of my back pocket. He caught me. I'll see you guys later
 I throw a bunch of sugar. I'm like replicate and call me your queen and then we
 Disappear you walk through a portal. We're in Reading, California
 So we're now in Reading, California, and you and I are walking down the street. I do you see me just scan on the ground
 I'm like where my ants where my ant brothers. You're like Jason. Stop looking for ants. I was like
 We're walking through Reading. You're literally holding my chin up
 so I can't look at the ground and we see a giant church in the middle of the city and it is Bethel Church and
 You're like so why did you bring us here? You're not taking me to church. Are you you're not gonna pray to the great ant God?
 I was like no no no no no I'll do that later Bethel Church
 They have a huge music ministry big internet presence and a huge somewhat say
 Outsized presence in the city of Reading the city of Reading has
 90,000 people in it and this church claims to have about
 11,000 members so that's over 10% of the population of Reading
 Attends this church
 At that point a police car drives by behind us and like that's weird. I'm like, yeah, it is weird. Let's walk
 Let's keep walking through the city here. This church has been around for quite a while and their claim
 They have several claims to fame. They do have this big music ministry, but that's really not what we're gonna talk about today
 They have some beliefs that some would consider unusual now. I've talked about this before on the show
 I'm a Christian myself
 There's a lot of people who believe that my beliefs are unusual that Jesus died came back from the dead three days later that
 You know Moses part of the Red Sea those are all things. I don't believe the book of Genesis. I think is a total
 Metaphor I don't think that the story happened literally like that as you get farther in history. I believe the New Testament
 I believe that these things happen so and I believe the book of Revelation is a metaphor as well
 So but so I just to let you guys know where I'm at and you could say well Jason
 That's ridiculous like you're telling me that you believe people can actually come back from the dead and and I'll say yes
 That is part of my faith that I believe people can come back from the dead. However
 I think there's a limit to it now
 Here's the thing there are
 That and that's a key detail to this story because I want you to know where I'm coming from with this story
 Because I'm going to be start mocking some of these guys beliefs and this is always interesting thing when you cover religion when specifically when a
 Believer covers religion at what point does a belief become
 completely bizarre to a lot of people the idea of someone being crucified being
 Put in a tomb and then coming back three days later is
 Completely impossible and to me. I'm like, yeah, maybe it may have happened. I believe it happened
 So when these people when Bethel ministry begins preaching that they can bring people back from the dead
 It raises a lot of eyebrows and not only raises eyebrows in the secular community
 But even in the religious community we go what?
 That's happened like two maybe three times in the Bible
 Jesus brought a dude back to life
 Jesus himself came back to life and there's probably something else that happened in there that I'm not aware of it's a big book
 But it's super rare. So when a church shows up that basically says you can do this too if you join us
 Just as it's basically revenge of the Sith. It's really what Palpatine promised Anakin Skywalker
 He could do but this is real
 This is a real place and Bethel has this thing called the Bethel school of
 Supernatural ministry and other people have called it the Christian hog warts
 And so you're like dude if that's why you brought me to Bethel so we could stand outside of a cult like church and
 Then go and visit their school of supernatural ministry. I'm totally down. You're like converting Christianity
 I'm like no no no no no no no no it's not as cool as you think it is
 I mean, it's cool be whatever religion you want, but don't don't change your life just because of a cool name of this school
 So I looked into it of course
 I thought about attending it and you have to be in readying to do it
 I was hoping they had online classes or something like that
 But I also imagined you were like flying around shooting laser beams out of your hands. That's what it sounds like
 Supernatural ministry gives you two powers. They're both fairly lame
 One is the ability to heal people and you're like Jason. That's not lame doc. I'm a doctor
 I listen to your show you calling me lame first off. Yeah secondly
 Yeah, sure healing people would be cool
 But when someone says they have magical powers and the power is basically can be replicated by a bandaid
 That's not a magical power, bro
 so they believe that they can heal people by laying hands on them and
 They have the power to preach again not a superpower
 You can take a speech 101 class in college and get that power as well now
 They may have other powers in there some people are saying that they know how to walk through walls one of the big things
 They do and before you get excited. They can't they can't do that
 But they also do this thing called grave soaking it's where you lay on the grave of a
 Previous Christian religious prophet type of guy and you can soak up his energy
 Apparently that was something from the bible as well
 I mean the bible has a lot of weird stuff in it
 but
 They think you can do this now again back in the bible moses is thrown sticks down and they've become snakes and and all sorts of stuff
 There's stuff in the bible that happens that doesn't happen in real life anymore
 So the fact that in the bible they're able to do something doesn't mean that you can be able to do it now
 But that's one thing bethle teaches
 That if it was a miracle in the bible, it's good now
 You're like jason who cares these people are just walking around and they're telling people that they can heal people and they can lay on a grave
 I mean, are they bugging you now? There's also been allegations that bethle church is
 Taking over redding california. They're getting into the police forces. They're getting into the mayor's office into city council
 They allegations of them getting sweetheart deals
 Because they're starting to gain political power and I have to say to that like I don't endorse that
 I don't think it's a great idea, but that happens everywhere
 Every everywhere does that and it's unfortunate
 But when if you if you have a small group of people and small being relative, you know
 There's 11,000 of them in a city of 90,000 but when you have a group of people you have to do one of two things
 You can create a community or you can take over an existing community
 And we see examples of that happen on the internet. We see subcultures infiltrate existing forums and websites
 And within a matter of months, they've taken over
 That forum or that website or they start their own and we see this in cities or as well
 Scientology has done this to clear water. Disney has done it to like orange county. You see corporations do it
 You see religions do it. You see cults do it. You see political organizations do it
 This is just something that human organizations do. I don't endorse it
 But whenever someone tells me group x is slowly taking over this community
 I always say I always have the same reaction. Well, that's just what people do
 I don't endorse it and that might sound like an endorsement
 But if it was happening in my community, I would if I and we did have that actually up here in the dows
 We had the raw niches before I moved up here. However, you pronounce it
 We had that colt in the dows that was trying to take over the raw niches
 And I know i'm mispronounced it again and they ended up sprain
 Like e.coli all over the the salad bar
 I've never covered that on the show because it's such a well known
 I remember reading about it when I was a kid in california
 It was one of the biggest I think it still is the biggest biological attack from a terrorist group in united states history
 But the church taking over a city allegedly
 Telling kids they can go out and spend a bunch of money enjoying this college
 And they'll get these supernatural ministry powers the powers to talk and the powers to heal
 And they've been walking all over the city whenever they see people in wheelchairs
 Their stories of these kids surrounding them and being like walk walk walk in the old lady wheelchairs
 I was like, what are you talking about? There was a story going around that some kid had an asthma attack
 And they wouldn't call 911 they were trying to heal the kid and the kid ended up having brain damage
 I saw that story get passed around a couple times. I could find no
 News articles on that you figure that would have been a big news story unless
 Even if they've infiltrated the news organizations of redding
 I think that story would have gotten out there was another story about a guy
 Who fell and or was pushed off of a cliff by a member of this
 Supernatural ministry school broke his back and bashed his head in
 And they didn't call an ambulance for six hours because they were trying to find him to heal him and he sued them
 And then the judge said you can't sue them because they legally don't have to call the cops and he lost the case
 But he appealed it and now he's actually going to try to sue him again
 You want to go out you want to pray in the street? Totally fine. You want to tell people you can bring people back from the dead?
 Whatever. It's not going to happen. It's totally bizarre
 But whatever all of that stuff being said the reason why I know about Bethel church
 The reason why I really came to my attention was because of olive
 Now olive was a little girl
 This all happened super recently
 December 14th 2019 olive hyal highly genthal olive highly genthal two years old
 stops breathing
 and dies
 The mom kailey
 She is a member of Bethel church. The whole family is a member of Bethel church, but kailey's a member of the church
 She is in their music. She's done music with them as well
 So her recordings have been out there and things like that very very active in this church
 She posts on instagram after her daughter dies
 And i'm going to read this instagram post for you. We're asking for prayer
 We believe in a jesus who died and conclusively defeated every grave holding the keys to resurrection power
 We need it for a little olive a line
 That's her middle name
 Who stopped breathing yesterday and has been pronounced dead by doctors
 Absolutely tragic story. Absolutely a heartbreaking story
 And if it was just there, yes family in need. We need prayer
 Please be here for us as we're suffering from the loss of our daughter all of that stuff
 But this is where we continue. We are asking for bold unified prayers from the global church
 To stand with us in belief
 That he will raise this little girl back to life
 Her time here is not done and it is our time to believe boldly and with confidence
 Wealed what king jesus paid for it's time for her to come to life
 So that caused
 a lot of controversy
 online
 But not at first at first actually this instagram post that went out to people who are supportive of Bethel church and people began
 praying for olive and putting it the hashtag wake up olive
 And the belief was if like she just said enough people prayed that jesus and all of his power and majesty would bring
 This two-year-old girl back to life
 And started to spread around the internet starts trending wake up olive wake up olive
 Just the those three words just the combination of words is chilling
 Wake up olive
 Day three if you're not familiar with biblical stories jesus died on the cross according christian faith three days later
 He came back to life
 They went to go visit him at the tomb and the the big boulder that was blocking his tomb was moved away
 Jesus was no longer in there
 There's a couple angels chilling in his tomb and they're like hey guys, you're too late
 Jesus is out. He's taking care of business. So knowing that now it's december 17th. It's three days after all of his passed away
 Kaylee starts her instagram post that day
 Day three
 Is a really good day for resurrection
 Oh man, and I I get it. I get it. This family has lost a two-year-old child
 And you're hoping for a miracle
 I totally get that and I think you guys realize that i'm not busting a bunch of jokes
 I totally get where that's coming from day four next day instagram post starts with
 Day four is a really good day for a resurrection
 I found out about this because
 The when the controversy kicked in because now we're on day four people are beginning to get wind of this and saying this is
 This is suffer this is extending the suffering of this family and the family is like no no no no
 Like this can happen the church believes that people can be brought back from the dead today
 There's a huge musical concert going on people are out celebrating praising the lord praying for olive to wake up
 December 20th
 2019
 They start planning the memorial service the miracle did not come
 olive will not be resurrected
 I don't want to criticize this family for wanting a miracle
 I don't really even want to criticize the church. I think the church probably is more at fault for
 Putting this belief in people's heads that people can be brought back from the dead
 But I don't want to spend the last few minutes of today's podcast
 Wagging my finger at someone who has religious beliefs different than mine. It's a tragic story
 It involves a church that has bizarre beliefs, but not
 They're not telling people to go out and commit jihad. They're not telling people to go out and blow up abortion clinics
 They're not telling people to do these unspeakable acts
 They're basically have a belief that's weirder than my belief that's weirder than
 You know two billion people's beliefs
 But not by a massive long shot
 The reason why I wanted to cover this story is because we look at paranormal. We look at conspiracy theories stuff like that
 What if
 It worked
 What would happen to human society if it worked?
 We've had stories of people getting frozen in ice. They've been clinically dead for five hours
 They're thawed not frozen in ice but frozen. They're not a block of ice. They're not captain america, but people who have been frozen
 They're clinically dead. They're thawed out. They're back to life
 We have stories like that people who have been brain dead a longer than we thought you could survive being brain dead coming back to life
 We've had miracles
 but
 Being dead for three days that has only happened once and again
 You could argue whether or not that even happened back then but what would happen to human
 society to belief
 To the way everything is structured
 if
 this
 worked
 Could you imagine the news that day it would filter out slowly
 From the town of redding. Olive was alive
 Most people wouldn't even know the backstory at this point three days in the controversy really hadn't started
 But you would start to get wind in the news
 A miracle it happened
 And you could say well people who don't really follow religious news
 They probably wouldn't know about it
 But if your church succeeded in bringing back someone from the dead you would make sure everybody knew
 There would be doubters. There would be skeptics
 There would be people going to redding to see if it was actually true and you'd have the local coroner
 Local police officers saying no, it's true. She had passed away and now she's back to life. Look at her and you would look
 There's a young girl playing in the yard
 Now here's the thing. There are already suggestions. We've talked about them early in the episode that the church of bethle has taken over
 The city of redding
 So skeptics would go that that's impossible
 There was no way this girl could have come back from the dead and we know this church is infiltrating
 The pillars of power. So who's not to say they already own the coroner? They already own the police department
 It has to be fake. This can't have happened
 But the story would still get out there that a little girl died and after three days of intensive prayer
 She came back to life
 It would change
 everything
 It would change the entire course of human history
 Because not only would you have proof that it's possible to die and then come back three days later
 Not only would you have proof of a faith of a billion people on this planet?
 You would have proof that it could happen today
 You would have proof that all the ministers all the clerics
 All the rabbis of the world could talk about miracles all they wanted
 But there was one church in redding, california that could actually raise the dead
 What do you think would happen to every other religion overnight?
 If it was proven that this group of 11,000 people had the key to immortality
 They had the way the truth and the light
 Their prayers
 worked
 Somewhere out there
 In the infinite sea of alternate realities
 Olive came back to life
 Somehow some way
 A miracle existed in the infinite expanse of time and space
 She came back to life
 And society completely restructured itself
 Because a little girl defied death because the church worshiped and prayed so hard
 That all notion of science all notion of
 Established religions was broken over the course of three days
 In that reality
 So close to our own
 Olive is alive again
 In that reality that's so close to our own
 Every religion has just formed into one the one religion that can provably work the church of bethel
 In an alternate reality so close to our own
 You have a church that doesn't work on infiltrating local government
 But has already infiltrated the governments of the world
 Bringing olive back wasn't just about restoring life
 Into a two-year-old girl
 Bringing olive back was about proving that bethel was the one true religion
 Was proving that only they had a direct line to god
 Performing the greatest miracle of the modern age
 Proved that the church of bethel
 Was the only true religion
 One world
 One religion
 One miracle
 And in that reality so close to our own
 It's the perfect place for another biblical figure to make his appearance
 The antichrist
 Appears in that world
 Not all miracles
 Come from god
