1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
 When a man is confronted by aliens from another world, they order him to do the unthinkable.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,880
 And then we travel to the United Kingdom to meet a couple of friends who are out smoking

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,120
 a little bit of weed and enjoying some fresh night air.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,680
 Little did they know their lives would forever change when the phone rang today on Dead Rabbit

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,680
 Radio.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:35,200
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,120
 I'm your host Sesa Garmin and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,960
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,520
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,840
 Let's go ahead and introduce one of our Christmas livestream contributors coming into Dead Rabbit

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
 Command right now.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,320
 Everyone give it up for Jonathan Bellach.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
 Woohoo!

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
 Yeah come on in.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
 Come on in buddy.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,640
 He's shaped like a big old bell walking in ding dong.

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,920
 Jonathan you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,800
 If you can't support the Patreon, if you can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,400
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,680
 Now Jonathan let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Jason Jalob.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,560
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,680
 We're going to drive all the way out to Mexico.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,080
 Jonathan's driving us on out.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,280
 There we got the AC on full blast.

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,440
 We're just kicking back and enjoying the ride.

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,640
 Specifically we're headed down to La Palma O'Oxka.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,200
 La Palma O'Oxka.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,760
 People right now are looking at maps.

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,920
 They're like that's not how you're granted.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,240
 Well luckily we're not going into that town.

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,680
 We're going near it.

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
 It's December 1st, 1979.

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,320
 We're near La Palma Oxka and a man is stumbling out of the darkness.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,520
 He's just covered in blood.

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,440
 People are coming out of their homes because he's like freaking out right.

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,680
 He's wailing in pain and fear.

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,240
 People are like oh man that sounds like terrible.

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
 Let's look out our window.

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
 See what's going on.

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,840
 The suit's covered in blood and he's freaking out.

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,080
 And they noted like that would be alarming enough right.

43
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,400
 If you heard someone wailing in pain and he looked out your window and he saw a man walking

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,080
 through the darkness covered in blood that would already be bad enough.

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,360
 But it doesn't take long for the townspeople to realize that most of the blood is a little

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,600
 bit on his shirt, a little bit on his arms.

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,280
 But most of his blood is below his waist.

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,320
 So that should give you an idea of where the story's going.

49
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,760
 Let's travel back in time to just the day previous.

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,720
 It's 5pm November 30th, 1979.

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
 There's this worker.

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
 We don't have his name.

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,400
 We don't have the name of this unfortunate soul but we'll go ahead and call him Jerry.

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,040
 Jerry's working at a local palm grove.

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
 And he's using his machete to cut down weeds.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,920
 Shop, shop, shop, shop.

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,720
 And the weeds are just falling everywhere and then he just keeps chopping.

58
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
 He's like, I'm doing a good job.

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 I'm a big boy.

60
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
 Chop, chop, chop, chop.

61
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
 Chopping them up.

62
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:08,920
 And then all of a sudden these eight tall men just kind of walk up on him.

63
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,400
 Now I'm going to tell you that I found this story on ThinkAboutToDarkStone.com.

64
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,600
 That's not the whole story.

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 That's not the whole story.

66
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,000
 You were like, Jason, wow.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,800
 You're really hurting for material.

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,720
 Oh, that's my, oh my God.

69
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,880
 Anyways, that's not an EVP.

70
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,640
 That's just someone who doesn't own a muffler.

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,600
 This guy's, oh, where is, oh yeah, I found this on ThinkAboutToDarkStone.com.

72
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,400
 They got it from Robert E. Bartholomew who wrote a book called UFO Lore.

73
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,240
 I actually couldn't find any proof of that book existing.

74
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,800
 I found a bunch of other books written by Robert E. Bartholomew.

75
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 We'll talk about him in a second.

76
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,640
 He's very famous in the study of UFOs and mass hallucinations and ghosts.

77
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,200
 He's been consulted a lot about the Havana syndrome thing.

78
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,760
 We'll talk about that in a second though.

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,520
 He is an expert in the field of parapsychology though.

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,040
 But I couldn't find a book called UFO Lore.

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,400
 But so remember that.

82
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,040
 I want you to remember that this comes from UFOology, the way I'm going to tell you the

83
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,120
 story.

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:16,240
 These eight tall dudes walk up to Jerry and they were described as having dark skin, not

85
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,760
 dark green skin, not dark skin with scales.

86
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,080
 They were just darker skinned people than Jerry.

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,160
 They were wearing green goggles.

88
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,880
 I don't know if those are normal, right?

89
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,760
 And they had communication devices.

90
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,240
 So that could either be a little badge from Star Trek or Wokitalki.

91
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,120
 And they were all brandishing a style of weapon that Jerry described as a machine gun.

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,080
 In quotes he described them as "machine guns."

93
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,000
 So I'm having a hard time figuring out if this, I believe the story's probably real.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,160
 But I don't know if he was confronted by eight unusually tall, unusually dark, unusually

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:11,800
 green-goggled aliens who had futuristic weapons shaped like Earth machine guns and communicators.

96
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,720
 I mean, that's so vague.

97
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,840
 But he believes that they were aliens.

98
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,400
 He believes that he was confronted by these aliens, right?

99
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,400
 And these aliens are speaking Spanish.

100
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,800
 These aliens are speaking the language that is of that area, right?

101
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:41,320
 And these aliens/men with machine guns, they order Jerry to cut off his own penis.

102
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,280
 And he does.

103
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,080
 Chops it right off.

104
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:52,160
 And then wanders around the darkness for hours on end until finally he walks up to La Palma

105
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,880
 Oxyca and he's moaning and wailing and he's holding his crotch probably in one hand.

106
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,760
 In the other hand, I wonder if they let him pick up his penis.

107
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,320
 I wonder if he was allowed to carry it.

108
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
 Oh, my hands getting tired.

109
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
 I've been carrying this all night long.

110
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,200
 You put it in your pocket at a certain point, right?

111
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,520
 But I don't know, we don't have a lot of follow-up to this.

112
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,280
 Whole bunch of questions to this story, right?

113
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,400
 Because definitely when I saw this, that is the whole story now we can start dissecting

114
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,520
 it, no pun intended.

115
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
 He drops his penis off.

116
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,640
 These aliens showed up and they made him drop his penis off.

117
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,680
 What's interesting about this story is one, we've never come across a story like if this

118
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
 is UFO related.

119
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,200
 Because it was in a book, it was in a book that doesn't exist called UFO Lord by Robert

120
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
 Bartholomew.

121
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:52,520
 Bartholomew who again is a very famous name in parapsychology and mass hallucination.

122
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,400
 He's the guy, he's done a lot of speeches.

123
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,440
 He wrote a book about the Havana syndrome.

124
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,040
 That was where the ambassador, US ambassador staff in Havana, Cuba started to get sick

125
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,840
 and you saw headlines all over the world about a sonic live and there was being used against

126
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,400
 our ambassadors and he just chalked it up to mass hallucination.

127
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,760
 Maybe it was, I'm paraphrasing, right?

128
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,440
 I didn't read his book book.

129
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,280
 He goes, "If this same sickness had overcome a bunch of steel workers in the middle of

130
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,360
 Idaho, we never would have thought it was any sort of weapon."

131
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,560
 He's written a lot about mass hallucinations.

132
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,200
 He's written a lot about ghosts and UFOs.

133
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,400
 He has all these books out.

134
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,640
 It seems to be more of a skeptic.

135
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,040
 I don't know what book they're referring to.

136
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,320
 There is no book called UFO Lord but I always like to use the term Lord.

137
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,840
 I can't think of another time that an alien forced a human to mutilate themselves or another

138
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
 person.

139
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
 That would actually be kind of interesting.

140
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,600
 I mean, I wouldn't want it to happen to me but like for her.

141
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
 I don't know.

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,520
 You see that in horror movies and stuff like that where like the alien goes, the alien's

143
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
 basically jigsaw.

144
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,160
 He came all the way from across the galaxy to be like, "You think you can cut down the

145
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
 palm trees?

146
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,200
 But what do you hold in your palm most of the time?"

147
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,080
 Tip-top, Jerry.

148
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,200
 That's never happened, right?

149
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
 That's never happened.

150
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,960
 I can't think of another time where an alien forced someone to mutilate themselves.

151
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,560
 Now it could be that the reason why.

152
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,920
 Maybe that's how cows are getting mutilated.

153
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
 The aliens are coming down.

154
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,560
 They're like, "You got to drain all your own blood."

155
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
 The cows are like, "What?

156
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
 How is that even possible?"

157
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,880
 They're just thinking really hard.

158
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,160
 Their eyeballs pop out and then all their blood disappears.

159
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,440
 I've never came across anything like that in the lore.

160
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,080
 I think it's most reasonable to think that this guy was doing his job and just some dudes

161
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,520
 showed up on machine guns and they're like, "Yo, chop your dick off."

162
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,520
 And he's like, "Huh?"

163
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
 Even that's pretty weird, right?

164
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,320
 I know humans are sick.

165
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,000
 I could see that happening, but you'd be like, "What?

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Fine.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,760
 I guess if you have a machine gun to your head, you might do it."

168
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,840
 It's weird because was he implying that they telepathically made him chop off his own penis?

169
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
 Or what?

170
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
 And then what did they do afterwards?

171
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,240
 He chopped his penis off and then he ran away screaming and they're like, "Okay, now

172
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
 what do we do?

173
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,640
 It's fun for about five minutes, but do we do it again?

174
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,600
 Do we go out of the town and get drinks?

175
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
 Who knows?"

176
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
 So bizarre story.

177
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
 Absolutely bizarre story.

178
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,200
 Did aliens come down and make a guy chop his penis off?

179
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,640
 Was it aliens?

180
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,680
 Was it a group of people, just normal humans with goggles, making people chop their dicks

181
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
 off?

182
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
 And if so, are they still out there?

183
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,760
 They're right behind you right now.

184
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
 You're like, "Huh?"

185
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,160
 You turn around and you only see seven tall dudes.

186
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,280
 You're like, "Whoa, that was close."

187
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,600
 And then you turn back around and the eighth one's chopping your dick off.

188
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 What if this is?

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,040
 What if this does happen more often?

190
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
 Right?

191
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,640
 What if this does happen more often?

192
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,160
 We don't hear about it because the people, then the aliens are like, "Ah, yes, good

193
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
 start.

194
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,400
 You've chopped off your genitals.

195
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,960
 Now chop off one of your arms."

196
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
 And he chops it off.

197
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,280
 He's like, "Oh, can I stop now?"

198
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,640
 And the aliens are like, "Hmm, let me see.

199
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,640
 I don't like the way your liver is looking at me."

200
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,840
 You're like, "Ah, chopping your liver out."

201
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,520
 Jonathan, fly us out of Mexico.

202
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,840
 We are headed all the way out to the United Kingdom.

203
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,120
 Jonathan, we're in the United Kingdom.

204
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,840
 The year is 2009 and it's nighttime.

205
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,920
 We're going to meet a young man named Keith.

206
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,520
 He's 17 years old and he's hanging out with his friends in the United Kingdom.

207
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
 He tells us this.

208
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,680
 Now, Keith isn't his real name.

209
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,320
 He doesn't use real names.

210
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
 Well, we're going to meet three friends.

211
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,480
 Keith, Randall, and Michael.

212
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,240
 Those are the names that I'm going to give them.

213
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,000
 And they're out smoking some weed in this deserted field.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,520
 It's kind of like right next to a tennis court.

215
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,680
 So you're sitting there, you're smoking weed and just enjoying the beautiful night air

216
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
 of Britain.

217
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,840
 And all of a sudden Randall gets a phone call.

218
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:02,720
 He gets his phone.

219
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
 Hello?

220
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:12,320
 Keith said right when Randall answered the phone, he started flipping out.

221
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,520
 He just began screaming as loud as he could into the phone.

222
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,760
 Now Randall was sitting down.

223
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,720
 They're all kind of sitting down while they're smoking.

224
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,560
 And Randall flops his body backwards and begins just screaming into the phone.

225
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,280
 And Keith and Michael are completely taken aback by this.

226
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,440
 Keith goes, "I've never heard someone scream like that before."

227
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,640
 Ever.

228
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,720
 It was this loud, piercing scream and he was just spouting off gibberish.

229
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,200
 They couldn't make any sense of what he was saying.

230
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,120
 And at the same time, he was writhing around on the ground.

231
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,240
 His entire body is just contorted and twisting and he's rolling around on the ground and

232
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,880
 he's just screaming.

233
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,200
 Keith put it like this, quote, "I can't even really describe how bad this was.

234
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,520
 The noises he was making were disgusting.

235
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,760
 I can't even try to explain it."

236
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,200
 Keith says even thinking about it, he wrote this post anonymously, but he goes, "Even

237
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,600
 thinking about it now, all these years later, it makes me physically ill to remember the

238
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,560
 noises Randall was making as he was rolling around on the ground just screaming."

239
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:31,800
 And then his eyes started to bug out and he begins to laugh.

240
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,760
 He begins to laugh so loud that the cacophony of laughter is now replaced to screaming and

241
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,280
 his eyes just seem to be protruding from his head and then all of a sudden Randall completely

242
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,400
 stops making noise.

243
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:55,240
 He's not screaming, he's not laughing, and in a very comb manner he takes his phone,

244
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:05,200
 puts it into his pocket, gets up, walks over to the tennis court fence and starts climbing

245
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
 it.

246
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,640
 Once he gets to the top of this 10 foot fence, he jumps off head first into the ground, breaks

247
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,120
 his neck, and dies.

248
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,780
 They obviously called the police, right?

249
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,080
 They obviously needed to get some sort of assistance for him, but when the police show

250
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,280
 up, he's already dead.

251
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,480
 Died on impact.

252
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,640
 The police show up and the ambulance shows up, takes the body, takes it away, and Keith

253
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,280
 and Michael are just dumbfounded and they're telling the cops what happened.

254
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,480
 And the police just completely write it off as a stoner kid having an accident.

255
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,640
 "No, no, I mean, like, yeah, we were all stoned and stuff, like everybody got this phone call

256
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,840
 and like you went crazy and you mean like how sometimes people can have bad reactions

257
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
 to weed?"

258
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,960
 "Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, but it was more than that."

259
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,080
 Like he was screaming and then he started laughing.

260
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,840
 "Well, you mean the way that people laugh when they're like, "Yeah, yeah, obviously,

261
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
 but it was more than that."

262
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:09,600
 Like, I don't know what happened, but he, like, it wasn't just an accident.

263
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
 Something happened.

264
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,480
 But the police just completely filed it as dumbstoner kid does dumbstoner thing.

265
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,760
 So there was no real investigation into this and what would you investigate, right?

266
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
 The phone?

267
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,440
 You're going to have the cops start doing a search for Samara?

268
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
 Getting search warrants for all the local VCRs?

269
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,160
 I mean, like, what are you going to do?

270
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,200
 Now, after this happened, Randall's family moved away pretty soon afterwards.

271
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,400
 And Keith and Michael, it really messed him up.

272
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,480
 He said Michael started doing ketamine.

273
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,240
 He started self-medicating and he's not the same person he used to be.

274
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,440
 He pretty much rotted his brain out with drugs.

275
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,720
 Keith goes, "I started taking Selexa.

276
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,160
 I started taking an SSRI drug."

277
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,120
 Okay, it just wasn't really working for him apparently.

278
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,600
 He did stop it.

279
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,520
 He says, "Most of the time I try not to think about it, but ever since that day when I get

280
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:20,000
 a phone call and it shows a no, a number or block number, I never answer it."

281
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It's a fascinating story.

282
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,360
 And if you think about it, let's say that this phone call went out to 10 people at the

283
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
 same time.

284
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,460
 Let's say that he wasn't targeted or 100 people or 1,000 people across the world and

285
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,880
 50 of them answered it.

286
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,240
 50 of them go, "Hmm."

287
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,160
 And out of those 50 people who actually took the call, let's say all 50 of them killed

288
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,520
 themselves, how many people would just be racked up as a suicide number, right?

289
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,680
 And you could have people be like, "No, that guy would never kill himself."

290
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,840
 And the officer goes, "Listen, all we know is that your boyfriend jumped off a 10-story

291
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
 balcony."

292
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,240
 So, I mean, you can say all day long that he didn't kill himself, but there was evidence

293
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,520
 of no one else in this room and your boyfriend's at the bottom.

294
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,600
 I don't know why the cops are being so rude to this girl, but you know what I mean?

295
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,360
 Even if it was somebody who you'd be like, "Dude, I can't believe that guy would ever

296
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,640
 kill himself," that would be the only thing you could realize.

297
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,920
 Oh, an accident, right?

298
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,400
 Someone getting the phone call and laughing hysterically and then walking into the bathtub

299
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,400
 and spilling water all over the ground and then slipping around.

300
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,560
 You know what I mean?

301
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,280
 It would be creepy and it would be effective, right?

302
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,080
 And I gotta wrap this up soon because I could just go on and on about this, but there's

303
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,080
 that idea that you can hack the human brain.

304
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,640
 There's actually been a lot of talk about this recently.

305
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,720
 You can hack the human brain.

306
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,520
 We think of it as we have our thought patterns.

307
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,020
 We have our soul.

308
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,840
 We have these ideas that we march forward, but it's electrical impulses that are carrying

309
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,600
 all that stuff back and forth.

310
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,960
 What if you could disrupt the way that the brainwaves were working, not magically, but

311
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:04,800
 there was some sort of code, despair code type of thing that actually makes the brain

312
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,920
 go loopy and makes you kill yourself?

313
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,240
 And again, most of these deaths would just be chalked up to suicides or accidents.

314
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,300
 There was two witnesses to this one and the police totally didn't investigate it.

315
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,620
 And if those kids hadn't, or if Keith himself hadn't posted this online, then we never would

316
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,820
 have heard of it either.

317
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,340
 So how many other people suffered from that phone call that night or since?

318
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,860
 Are these phone calls still going out there?

319
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,780
 Is someone still auto-dialing numbers?

320
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,940
 And when you pick up, you go mad.

321
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,440
 It's a terrifying idea because we all have to communicate with each other.

322
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,480
 And if there is a disease that is spread as a meme, as a communication, as a form of media,

323
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,480
 the chances of you getting it are, I mean, it's incredibly high.

324
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,240
 Whether or not you have, if you have a cell phone, you'd be incredibly susceptible to this,

325
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,640
 but some people don't have cell phones.

326
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,000
 Well, you have a home phone.

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
 Some people don't have home phones.

328
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,160
 Well, you know, okay, Amish man, you'll get a letter in the mail.

329
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,340
 Like how do you avoid a curse or a disease that's spread via media?

330
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,460
 Because we know how to protect ourselves from airborne diseases.

331
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,020
 We know how to protect ourselves from, you know, skin-borne diseases and monkeypox.

332
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,780
 Geez, that's terrifying.

333
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,540
 You got monkeypox running around, but I know how not to get monkeypox.

334
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,100
 But imagine if there was something out there that was spread via media.

335
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:46,360
 That's always been a trope in the paranormal horror community that there is.

336
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,480
 I've done episodes that I thought were cursed.

337
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,760
 I still released them.

338
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,240
 You can't avoid communication.

339
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,040
 You'd have to be a monk in a cave to avoid this signal.

340
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:04,280
 Now obviously, you're not having these mass die-offs because of these phone calls, but

341
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,120
 it didn't matter for Randall and his family and for Keith and Michael who saw this and

342
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,340
 went to some serious mental trauma themselves.

343
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:24,500
 The only thing Randall did wrong that day was pick up his phone.

344
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,560
 And that was enough to kill him.

345
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,560
 The police report may say dumb stoner kid does dumb stoner things.

346
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:42,440
 But to Keith and Michael, they know the truth.

347
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:55,680
 That a insanity-fueled death is just a phone call away.

348
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,160
