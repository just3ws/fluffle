 queer ghosts and queer ghost hunters
 bees
 Interrupt your civil rights in Britain and
 Then we take a trip to the farthest reaches of space with the Mandalorian conspiracy today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys are having a great day too
 I know I often say that this is gonna be a short episode because I'm not feeling good
 This is gonna be a short episode because I'm not feeling good and it's funny because every time I say it's gonna be a short episode
 It ends up being like 35 minutes long
 I think you can tell from the sound of my voice that I'm really on my last leg as far as
 Sore throat health I need to go to bed as soon as I can but I wanted to get this episode out for you
 And I previously just got then recording 15 minutes of stuff and was like yeah, I don't like it
 So I'm starting over I'm starting over for you guys my friends
 Yesterday's episode I finished off with the story about queer ghost hunters
 I teased you he gave you a little tickle little little tickle tickle about queer ghost hunters and what's interesting
 We're not gonna spend a ton of time on these guys because I kind of think it might be a joke. It's really really hard to tell
 Queer ghost hunters you go. Oh, it's a bunch of queer people that are hunting ghosts. That's interesting
 Well, they are that they are a bunch of queer people interviewing not interviewing
 Investing what am I what's oh man? I'm so tired
 Hunting ghosts queer people hunting ghosts. That's the name queer ghost hunters. They're not queer ghost interviewers
 So they're not just queer people who hunt ghosts. They're queer people
 They're queer people who hunt ghosts, but the ghosts they hunt are
 Gay like they hunt gay ghosts and and lesbian ghosts and stuff like that
 Which oh which brings up a whole bunch of questions and I'll get to those in a second, but
 This is their logic when ghost hunters show up at a place
 They're like how many women have you slept with and the ghost will be like oh five or whatever little EVP farve
 And they said well, that's weird that every time someone shows up
 They ask a ghost if it's a man if he was married if it's a woman they ask if it was a husband now
 What's funny is I'd have never really heard that I've never when I used to watch a lot of ghost hunting shows
 I never hear them show up and be like so
 Did you like blonde or brunette women like I think that might be something that they perceived was going on
 But I don't know I've never seen that at least, but I'm not saying it's not happening. I've just never been aware of that
 And they said that if you think about this why I thought was kind of funny
 If you think and it's true in a sense if you think about the most haunted places
 It's places where gay people
 hung out the most
 you have
 theaters like big ballrooms and stuff like that and a bunch of gay dudes hanging out there
 Operas stuff like that theaters operas big fancy mansions
 That one's a little more iffy because big fancy mansions were just where rich people hung out insane
 Asylum's in prisons though
 Which I mean there was a point in time where if you were gay you did get sent to the insane asylum
 And it was you know sodomy was a crime now those last two
 Here's the thing this is the thing I this is the thing really that's the most interesting thing about this
 They self-identifying 4.5 percent of the population I self-identifies as LGBT queer people
 So even in a in the world of the paranormal you're still gonna scale that in
 So in the amount of which which not every human being leaves a ghost just right off the bat and
 Out of those ghosts you would figure five maybe high-ball at 10% of all the ghosts that can be encountered are
 Queer so you're actually making it even harder for you to find ghosts
 But they have this YouTube show
 Like two and a half seasons long. They're still trying to get new episodes
 Where they keep running into gay ghosts and you go Jason. How do they know they're gay?
 Well, they have these
 dowsing rods and they go
 Are you gay and then the rods move and they're like oh lesbian lesbian ghost
 Which again, I think the whole thing might be made up
 They did raid third they they did raise $35,000 on Kickstarter and they currently have a patreon going
 Part of me part of me thinks it's a parody
 But it could be real but here's my questions about it one first off ghosts are incredibly hard to hunt hunt in the first place
 You're making it even harder if you only want to find queer ghosts secondly
 What's the ethical ramifications of outing someone after they're dead?
 Because they don't I mean a ghost from the 1800s. They'll be like we're gay. They went to a
 They went to a nun graveyard and they go there's a bunch of lesbian nuns nuns
 They were a lot of lesbian nuns out there, which I don't know statistics on lesbian
 I don't know the Venn diagram between lesbians and nuns
 But anyways they go to a nun graveyard and they're just walking around the graveyard going we're gay
 We are gay so feel comfortable talking to us come to the back of our van
 Sit in our van and talk to it if I was from the 1800s and I was a gay nun
 I could be like oh what and I and they're doing in the middle of the day
 Which was weird too like oh and then you crawl out of your grave your little ghost crawls out of your grave
 And then you're like telling them yeah, I'm gay and then you go back to sleep or wherever you go
 They don't understand they're on YouTube. They don't understand video cameras or anything like that
 So outing someone after their death is that there was one where the guys was like
 Who do you think is cute in the group or do you think Mike they're talking to a guy ghost and there's three guys in the room
 And they're like which one of us do you think is cute and it's like
 Mikey and he's like oh they just see they're
 Well, I think that parts made up to like that's the whole that's the weirdest thing about this like
 It's so hard to get a ghost to just admit what its name is but this one is like giving it relationship advice
 Being like I love your shirt like though. I think it's a setup. I really think it's a wind up
 But it raises some interesting questions one
 Does your sexuality go with your spirit I
 Think there's a lot of stuff
 That we assign biological traits to that would have no
 Relevancy to be in a ghost. Let me say this to
 John Jack London did not write cannery row. That was John Steinbeck. I looked that up afterwards
 I had a sneaking suspicion while I was doing some editing. I go great. So
 Jack London did not write cannery row that was on yesterday's episode
 But on yesterday's episode I said that ghosts may just be these forms that then we put a physical
 presentation on top of that's why famous people
 Show up looking as you remember to Marilyn Marilyn Monroe's ghost is an uploaded fat gross
 Blob because she has she laid in her own organ
 She what's that thing called when you get all purple not not holding your breath
 Well, that happens when you die too, but rig a mortis if you saw her ghost, she'd be all glamorous. I
 Think the idea of like there might be some forms out there that we're putting thought projections on and
 That's why we would see a white ghost as a white dude and a black ghost as a black ghost
 But why would the soul matter in that case the actual soul
 The the energy that is existing outside the body would if it's black or white
 Then what if the ghost as a living person had Down syndrome does the ghost have Down syndrome if
 the ghost was
 If you had somebody who had both their arms chopped off and they died their ghost wouldn't have both their arms chopped off
 I'm thinking that right because otherwise everyone who died would basically it'd be like Beetlegees
 She would be the death you'd be a ghost of your
 Of your body, so I don't it's so why is it that you would see a oh an Asian ghost
 Appear like an Asian man and a white ghost appear like an Asian man
 No white ghost would appear as a white man
 But how does that of that's your that's the physical body that shouldn't affect what the soul looks like I
 Don't imagine if a guy who's three feet tall his soul is not three feet tall
 So if the biological and that and I you can you can we can argue about that because obviously that's not what we see
 When you see a ghost of George Washington
 It looks like George Washington, but I think that is just our representation or our perceiving the energy that's actually there
 So extrapolating that further
 Sexuality is who we are your your your sexual preference. I guess it should say is who you are attracted to
 It's who your body reacts to
 When I see an attractive woman walking down the street my body reacts to that whether it's my eye my eyes go
 My blood pressure goes up whatever like I'll see an attractive woman
 I will feel an attraction towards her like physically and I'm not talking about pop it
 You know, I'm not talking about you know getting a boner
 I'm talking about I can feel my body react to a beautiful woman in my presence or a beautiful woman walking 50 yards away
 But those are biological markers. There's it's a biological thing. That's happening when I'm seeing a woman. I want to mate with
 my ghost
 Would my ghost be like a
 Little cartoon ghost eyes. I don't think so. I don't think your sexuality is
 such an important component of
 Your soul
 Because your soul if you imagine if you think about something like the Tree of Life
 We're not getting to the other two stories
 By the way, you talk about something like the Tree of Life that we've discussed before
 The soul exists before your body and
 Then your soul is in your body and it may exist by
 Millennial or it may exist by simply moments, but your soul goes into your body and then it leaves when you die
 so your soul is
 Beyond sexual preference. It's be if in
 Living times if while I'm alive. I love to eat chili beans and rice and then I die and my soul is has that same dietary preference
 And but all that's there to eat is nothing because I'm a ghost
 The dietary preference doesn't carry over either. I don't I this might this might sound super rambly
 But I feel like I'm trying to put my thoughts together while we're constructing this you're like Jason
 This might be the least funny episode and I apologize for that also. I'm sick, but
 the
 idea of your preferences
 existing before or after
 you die seems
 Universally such a minute thing and then I feel the same thing what about race or or your sex or your gender I
 Feel that none of I feel that the soul itself is
 Neither male nor female or both
 It's neither white black eastern European Persian. It's all of those and nothing
 Most likely nothing is most likely not both male and female. It's simply transcended that
 So I don't think you could have a straight ghost or a gay ghost
 You could have a ghost of someone who was gay who died
 But I don't think the ghost is still like search, you know going on grinder the same way
 I don't think that a straight ghost would be going on Tinder
 I
 Course I have absolutely nothing to back any of that up. I just find it in I find it interesting that
 In the realm of ghosts these questions don't really get asked
 Let me ask you this - this is an interesting question if a trans woman died
 Would her ghost
 be a trans woman or a woman who was born a woman?
 There's tons of questions
 Because what would be the what would be the represent?
 Let's say I'm totally wrong with my idea that souls have no sexual preference no dietary preference no race
 Nothing like say I'm totally wrong and all that and if you're a white dude and you die your ghost is a white dude in
 That theory if you're a trans woman or a trans man and you die is your ghost that of a trans woman or trans man or
 a
 Woman who was born a woman or a man who was born a man. How would your ghost?
 Be what is your ghost? What is your soul on that level?
 So as much as I think the queer ghost hunters is a parody because and they don't seem to be fair
 They seem like a lovable bunch of ragamuffins and they don't seem to take themselves super seriously
 And I think that's why I keep leaning on the parody thing because in the beginning the like during their credits
 They kind of do the serious pose like the ghost hunter shows and they kind of start laughing so you're like they don't take themselves
 That's you seriously
 But they raise a whole host of questions
 What survives death
 What survives death and it's one of those things that will never know obviously
 But I guess as long as you have groups they're not as far as I saw I watched a couple episodes
 So they're not actively and asking these questions as far as I saw but having these kind of groups that are kind of
 Not traditional ghost sending groups
 It is it does kind of make you think about the stuff on a different level
 So I congratulate them for that. Maybe we do have time for the last two stories here
 But I do have to go soon because I'm super sick
 Bees
 Let's leave behind the queer ghosts the queer ghost hunters. We're gonna go to Britain and
 There's a bunch of bees flying around right I'm gonna try to get a little bit of humor in this one
 Cuz that one was just sounding like like I was super stoned and just going off the top of my head
 Which to be fair I was going off the top of my head, but not super stoned
 Here I don't even need to do bees. Yeah, I've already told you that right bunch of bees flying around
 Here is the thing this might
 I'm so tired. Okay. Where did you go bee be notes? I actually had to take notes for this hold on in
 1980 Britain the the most police state in Europe. I swear to God these guys are so brutal in 1980
 They enacted the bee act
 Which means
 If the authorities think there are bees in your home they can go in without a search warrant
 Not only can they go in your home it is it is it is specified
 They can also go into any vessel
 boat
 Hovercraft aircraft what are they chasing down co-ver commander or vehicle of any other description
 In which he has reasonable grounds for supposing there are or have been bees or
 Other things subject to control under an order under that section. So probably like wasps hornets
 Yeah, all they have to do is show a badge if they think be if they think you had bees in your hovercraft aircraft
 They just show a badge and then they kick down your door and get in now. Hopefully
 I'm just about to give up on this episode
 Okay, let's move on to our next story
 You know what jokes bad when you don't even finish it
 Let's just get on with the next story so I can go to bed
 You'll have to email me and you'll have to say hey Jason
 We would rather not have an episode than an episode where you're one clearly dying and to
 Barely trying so let me know in the comments like share subscribe this video
 Share it with your friends. Maybe not this one
 Mandalorian the Mandalorian
 You know you guys hear me talk about this is our last story
 You guys have heard me talk about Disney in the past
 Usually I taught I say I watch a lot of Disney stuff, but every show often I'll make a comment like they're I
 Said that they were I
 used Disney of
 Faking death threats against theater that were showing the Joker I
 Reference that Mickey Mouse may be a representation of the ultimate evil a summoning spirit. That was a long time ago
 all sorts of stuff and I also
 quite often make fun of
 The new the sequel trilogy Star Wars movies both on the show in real life. I've never seen any of them
 I've never seen Force Awakens the last Jedi. I've read the plots and they sound super stupid and
 I never saw Rogue one
 I have seen that Darth Vader scene quite a few times like near near when he's walking on the hallway and
 I watched a little bit of Han Solo
 And I thought it all pretty much sucked except the Darth Vader scene was cool
 But I had no interest in watching any of the Disney Star Wars stuff. I was a huge fan of the original trilogy
 I'm actually a fan of the prequels and
 So
 But I really wanted to see the Mandalorian and I do watch a lot of Disney stuff
 So I recently signed up for Disney Plus Disney Plus is the service that you too can subscribe to for just 699 and one
 If you use the promo code dead rabbit
 You'll get nothing off because it doesn't exist. Anyways
 So I got Disney Plus
 I got it because I wanted I was really curious about the Mandalorian
 But at 30 years of Simpson episodes plus all the other Disney Channel stuff
 I watched all that stuff is included in their basic package for 699 a month
 So I watched the episode of the Mandalorian now what was interesting was I began to snoop around and check out stuff
 see what other people thought about Mandalorian YouTube videos Easter eggs stuff like that and
 Just clicking on randomly I found a couple of them and they said the comment. Hey listen man not a fan
 Basically what I just said I'm not a fan of the new sequel, but this
 Mandalorian show this Mandalorian show reminds you why you love Star Wars this Mandalorian show is a love letter to the fan
 And I heard that on a couple different YouTube videos and I thought
 Disney's paying people to say this
 Like this is weird because they're using kind of the same terminology
 Now I have to say two things to this one obviously I have no proof of that
 But it seems like it's right up a wheelhouse Disney totally screwed up Star Wars with the last Jedi
 They were already people were okay with the Force Awakens. I thought it was stupid that they just told the same story first order
 Resistance rebel I thought all this stuff was dumb thought all this was super stupid
 I thought it was a total fake out or they made it look like Finn was going to be the next Jedi and then he's like
 Or and then Ray gets the sword you're like what like even on the posters he had the lightsaber really kind of just a weird
 I stormtrooper being a Jedi. I thought was an interesting concept
 but anyways I
 Totally screwed it up with the last Jedi to the point that Han Solo was a huge flop and
 The last Jedi didn't make as much money and no matter how much they spin it people are now coming out and saying how much they
 Don't like that movie even though these same people at the time were defending the last Jedi
 Which again makes me think that Disney was pumping money into these YouTube people
 To prop to prop it up and to say if you don't like last Jedi
 It's because you have a defect of a personality the last Jedi is actually this totally great subversive film this slow-speed chase
 Through space that takes place in about eight hours. What a great epic Star Wars movie, but anyways
 Mandalorian comes out and all of a sudden the thing has changed. Oh those sequels boo
 This reminds you why you liked Star Wars this reminds you why you like sorry and that's actually a perfect marketing thing and
 Disney's always had this conspiracy around them that were not always but fairly recently
 That they're manipulating
 ratings and rotten tomatoes and
 basically social engineering people Batman vs. Superman
 Civil war yay, and you look at all the reviews and people's reactions saw this up Batman vs. Superman is
 200 times better than Civil War
 now
 It wasn't a very well constructed film, but what it tried to do is basically the difference between
 watching someone try to jump the Grand Canyon and
 Only making it halfway
 Versus someone on a three-foot slip and slide in the backyard
 that's the difference between Civil War and and Batman vs. Superman
 This idea that you shoot for the stars at least she'll hit the moon Civil War was basically like oh remember those dudes
 Anyways anyways, I think Disney does prop up their properties and now they realize that the last shit
 I sucked they have to admit to that I think they knew it early on but anyways now they're telling people
 Hey and subscribe to Disney plus six ninety nine a month and you'll get to watch this new show if you're a true Star Wars fan
 This is this is what it is. I think that Disney is
 Do and run in the same game, but now they're actually pooping all over their past properties to get support for this one
 Because people are using that same terminology
 What's weird too is that
 They're kind of right
 like I really really enjoyed the Mandalorian and it reminded me of
 Old Star Wars it reminded me of the original trilogy the way that it looked the way that it felt
 so really really well put together television show and
 It's not doesn't dumb stuff down
 There's a scene. This isn't a spoiler Mandalorian walks into a room. This takes place like five or six years after return
 Mandalorian walks into the room and there's a guy sitting behind a desk
 There's four stormtroopers and their armor is totally dirty and scuffed up not battle scarred like actually dirty
 And they're standing around and one of them looks a little skinnier than you would imagine a stormtrooper to be
 That's it
 They just kind of stand there and there's this little meeting and
 Then he leaves
 Now a dumb television show before he went there. They would have been like hey look out about this guy
 He's hired rogue Empire soldiers after the fall of the Empire
 They needed something to do and you'd be like okay
 So they're actually like old stormtroopers or a guy could have said yeah the guy rolls with stormtroopers
 Turns out it's just a bunch of bandits who found some armor
 But still they might shoot you in the back and you'd be like oh then these guys are you you don't know the movie
 The show is really good at just like putting you in a room
 Using terminology you don't know and you're kind of like well, I guess I guess that means a bucket
 I guess that means something you put it in I don't really understand what they're talking about
 So the show is actually pretty smart as far as that goes but
 Yeah, I and the whole episode is like that. It's just it assumes you are a resident of this galaxy
 So you should know what they're talking about very very well done show
 But does that mean that
 There is no conspiracy doesn't mean that Disney is not I just realized that this has nothing to do with the topic of the show
 I just am talking about Mandalorian at this point
 Does this might honestly be this I'm not even going to title this episode anything
 This is a this is an episode. This is a spin-off for a new podcast
 This is the lost episode
 Does that mean that Disney actually is a spin-off for a new podcast?
 Does that mean that Disney actually isn't pulling a conspiracy? I
 am almost for certain that Disney is paying people to say
 All of our other stuff sucked
 But this is the good one and the sad thing is is that they've been working on this bounty hunter show for like 10 years
 I remember hearing about HBO going to have a star war show focusing on bounty hunters
 If this had come out first
 And it was a hit which I am sure it's shaping up to be
 It would totally change the whole dynamic of these prequel these sequel movies that are just rehashes
 Death stars and stuff like that totally would have changed look. I think it's directed by the guy who did a lot of the clone war stuff
 But anyways, it didn't it came out after we had to sit through princess layoff flying through space
 and all that other stuff so
 Is Disney committing a conspiracy?
 To get people to watch their show probably it's it's actually now that I say it's not a conspiracy
 It's called marketing. You know what?
 This episode has completely gone off the rails. I apologize, but
 Here's the dilemma. Do I release this episode?
 Knowing that it's it's it's barely functional as an episode it barely works
 or
 Do I put a message on twitter saying sorry guys not feeling good. No episode tonight
 If
 You're hearing this episode
 Then you know which decision I made obviously
 I'm going to get a good night's sleep
 And I will be back monday with it with a relevant episode an episode that makes sense
