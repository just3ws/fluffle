00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 Season 16 is here and we start off with a bang! First off, what happens if someone's

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,360
 furry fetish becomes contagious? And then we take a look at a terrifying true crime story

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,960
 ripped right from the pages of a horror novel. A young woman named Nelda leaves a note for

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,480
 her living boyfriend saying, "I'll be right back, I'm going to the store." And she is

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,560
 never seen again. Or was she? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:40,400
 [Music]

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,560
 Carbner. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I just got

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,440
 off of my two week vacation that I take every 50 episodes. It's always super invigorating

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,240
 for me to do that. I played it to the Fortnite. I shot a bunch of children in the head. That's

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,160
 basically what Fortnite is, right? I'm basically demolishing 12 year old children for my own

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,160
 entertainment. But I'm glad you guys are back to listen to more Dead Rabbit Radio. The

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,760
 show would be nothing without the fluffle. First off, let's go ahead and introduce one

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,960
 of our new Patreon supporters. Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is longtime listener

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,680
 of the show. Long time giving me stories guy. I don't know if we should have an official

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,760
 title for that. It's Fabio Nurbon. Everyone give a round of applause to Fabio. He's walking

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,680
 in the Dead Rabbit Command. I don't want to dox the dude, but he's like our Italian correspondent.

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
 He's like, "Tang it. I'm in witness protection. You're supposed to say what country I was

19
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,920
 in." He's been our Italian correspondent. He sent us a bunch of stuff. Fabio, you're

20
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,920
 going to be our captain or pilot this episode. You guys can't support the Patreon. I totally

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,600
 understand. Just help spread the word about the show. That really, really helps out a

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 lot. Word of mouth helps the show grow. Fabio, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,360
 to the Jason Jalopy. Let's get it out of the garage. We haven't used it in a couple weeks.

24
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,280
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed all the way out to old timey

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,960
 Germany. Old car, old Germany. That's perfect. Now when I say old German, I'm not saying

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,160
 like 1944. That's not where we're going. We're going like way old timey back, like

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:27,880
 past black and white. We're in sepia-toned land. This is like pre-1879. That's somewhere

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,240
 between the evolution of life on earth and 1879. This story takes place. You can picture

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,720
 dinosaurs in the background if you would like, but I honestly don't think it took place

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:47,520
 that far back. We're in the town of Do-Dow. That's in Wittenberg, Germany. In this town,

31
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,240
 there was an old, you're like David Jason. Are you just reading this? Are you just reading

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,600
 that? It's a fairy tale. Hold on. Hold your fairy tale related suspicions till the end.

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:06,000
 There's this old woman living in the town of Do-Dow and she always has poultry to eat.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,080
 She always has like a duck or chicken or a geese and she's always like, oh man, she's

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,000
 brady. She's walking around town. She has a big gold chain. That's a picture of a turkey

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 leg. I mean, I don't know if everyone else in this town was going hungry, but it was

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,320
 suspicious that she was always eating big geese. She's this old lady, right? She's

38
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,840
 not walking around with an Elmer Fudd musket. People were a little suspicious. Specifically

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,560
 her grandchildren. We're like, I bet you there's something about grandma because she

40
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,160
 seems to, she's always flossing on us with how much meat she has. Look at our bones.

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,800
 So they spy on the grandma and they realize that, I didn't know this was a thing. It makes

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,480
 sense. There's a thing called a fox strap. Now I know what a wolf strap is. It's like

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,040
 a belt made of wolf fur. Turns you into werewolf. But this old lady, she had a fox strap. So

44
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,840
 she'd put it on and she'd turn into a fox and she'd run and then she'd kill geese and

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,040
 chickens and ducks and stuff. Then drag them back to her hovel and then cook them. I don't

46
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,720
 know why she just didn't eat them raw as a fox, but you know, maybe raw geese taste disgusting.

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,320
 I don't know. So anyways, the grandkids are like, Oh, dude, that's dope. Our grandmas

48
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
 aware of Fox. But you know, they also know that like snitches get stitches, so they're

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,960
 not going to turn their grandma in. Plus now she's cutting them in now that they know the

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,240
 secret. They're like getting extra meat. But one day at school, the teacher was like

51
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,200
 teaching class and he goes, Hey, everyone. So we've learned the alphabet and we've learned

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,320
 all about these numbers. I start to talk about that's all he knows. For whatever reason,

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,280
 they start talking about magic in the class. And he's like, Yes, magic is real because

54
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,040
 it's old timey Germany. We still believe stuff like that. And the kids are super excited.

55
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,400
 They're like, Oh, now we can finally participate. We never learned the alphabet, but we can

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,080
 participate in this discussion. They start to tell the school master and the other students

57
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,400
 are grandmas as magical powers. She has this Fox strap that she puts on. She becomes a

58
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,120
 Fox. And I think the people in class probably didn't believe them. They believed in magic.

59
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,520
 They believed in the evil iron curses, but they're like, I don't know. I've heard of

60
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,280
 a wolf strap never heard of a were Fox. So the kids need to bring this in for show and

61
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,800
 tell. So they go to the grandma's house. Jason, this is a fairy tale, right? Like hold on.

62
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,000
 Let me finish it. So they go to the grandma's house and they sneak in this fairy tale music

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,360
 playing. There's a fairy narrating the whole story. They crept around the corner with little

64
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,320
 kid feet and they get into their grandma's storage center and they steal the Fox strap.

65
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,520
 And I don't know what the grandma was doing right now because she should have caught these

66
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,400
 dudes, but she didn't. They got the whole Fox strap and they take it to school the next

67
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,280
 day because they're like, we got to prove to these dudes that magic exists. So they bring

68
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,080
 the Fox strap to the schoolmaster and they're like, look, this basically they give him a

69
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,560
 grody piece of Fox skin. Like dried up Fox skin and goes, my grandma wears this at night

70
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,160
 or during the day or whenever Fox's live. And she runs around and chases geese and brings

71
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,760
 it back home and we all eat geese. And the schoolmaster's like, oh, you know, I've heard

72
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,960
 the legends of the wolf strap. This seems odd. I've never heard of the Fox strap before.

73
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,320
 So the schoolmaster gets the Fox strap. And he's like, I don't know, this is just kind

74
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:30,160
 of like a gross piece of fur. It's the kids feelings are like, oh, and then I if someone

75
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,160
 gave you a wolf's belt, you would assume you'd put it on like a belt, right? Hold up your

76
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,640
 your trousers or your pantaloons or something. But apparently with a Fox, this makes sense.

77
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,560
 Actually, I think about it. Foxes are tinier. So a Fox belt wouldn't wrap around your waist

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 unless you were like a little thumbelina person. So this belt isn't activated by putting it

79
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,720
 around your waist. This belt is activated by putting it touching it to your forehead.

80
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,800
 And the schoolmaster unknowingly, like he's maybe saw like a fly landed on his forehead

81
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,960
 and he wanted to swat it or there was just a swat on his brow. He goes, oh, this smelly

82
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,040
 Fox meat will get rid of this tiny drop of sweat. He touches his forehead with it and

83
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:21,440
 instantly in front of the entire class turns into a Fox. He makes a little Fox noise. Now

84
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,840
 the class freaks out, right? And they scream so loud it scares Professor Fox. So he jumps

85
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,480
 out the window and runs away. Now everyone in town is made very aware of this situation.

86
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,880
 It's not something that kids would go home. They're like, what happened at school today?

87
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,360
 Nothing. And they're just like eating their porridge. I'm sure I'm pretty sure class was

88
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,680
 dismissed for that day, right? Everyone went home. And so everyone in town knew about the

89
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,760
 professor who turned into a Fox. What are you gonna do, right? It's like a Fox. There's

90
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,120
 a bunch of Foxes in the area probably that grandma starving to death. She's like, oh,

91
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,600
 no, where's my where's my belt? She's withering away. Fox takes off. And the Fox finds this

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:09,400
 little hill and makes a house, makes a Fox house, a nest, whatever that is, a cave. So

93
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,720
 when I'm reading this, when I'm reading this fairy tale, when I'm reading this, what could

94
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,880
 only be described as a fairy tale, I thought, man, he's really adapting to Fox life very

95
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,960
 quickly. Like if I turned into a Fox, I'd be like, bros, help me. And then I assume I'm

96
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,560
 doing it on a Friday night when I'm sitting around with my buddies. They're like chasing

97
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,120
 me, told you not to touch that Fox into your forehead. I'm like running around. I'm like,

98
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,440
 guys help me. And then we maybe go on like some hangover jackass, esk adventure, where

99
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,800
 I'm just like a Fox and like we go to Vegas or something like that. I would assume that's

100
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,240
 what I would do. And my whole goal would be to want me to sexy Fox. And then to, um,

101
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,760
 to turn into a human. And now I have a sexy Fox. Like, oh, no, these babies, these babies

102
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,240
 are going to be monsters. But you know what I mean? Okay, maybe scratch the sexy for the

103
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,080
 people who didn't shut off the podcast scratch that part. But you'd want to turn back into

104
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,920
 a human as soon as possible. Sexy Fox or not. He doesn't do that. He just makes a house.

105
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,400
 That'd be the last thing I would do. I want to make a house. I would live in my human

106
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,960
 house, but he makes a house. So he's like in it for the long run. Being a Fox must be

107
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,320
 pretty cool. So what happens though is everyone in town is like, dude, don't go outside for

108
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,320
 a while. You can't go outside because there's a human Fox. There's a where Fox running around.

109
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,160
 Even though we can't, we can no longer attend the funeral of that poor old woman who starved

110
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,600
 to death. Don't go outside. But there's a random group of hunters in the area and they're

111
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,960
 hunting Foxes and they see this Fox running around on the hill and they're like, oh, dude,

112
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,760
 this is perfect. Let's blow this thing's brains out. They load their muskets and they fire

113
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,000
 and all of a sudden the naked dude is sitting on the hill. And he's like, oh, don't shoot,

114
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,520
 don't shoot. What had happened was the bullet had hit the Fox strap and shattered it or

115
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,560
 ripped it into pieces and then he immediately turned back into a naked dude. And then at

116
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,760
 that point, since he like werewolves, the penalty of werewolves was death. If you could

117
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,400
 shapeshift, you were immediately put to death. So that, you know, he was probably a little

118
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,720
 worried. There's a bunch of guys with guns. Luckily it takes them like three minutes to

119
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,880
 reload them. So they have time to think. But he's like, I listen, I didn't mean to become

120
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,080
 a Fox. This kid brought this thing to school. I thought it was fake. Had a little bit of

121
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,360
 a sweat on my forehead. I touched my forehead and they go, how long ago did that happen?

122
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,720
 He's like, I don't know, eight months a year. They're like, well, you took to being a Fox

123
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,680
 pretty quickly. So that is the, he goes back, he goes back home and apparently gets his

124
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,080
 job back. He just get fired for turning into a Fox. The union's going to have to update

125
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,280
 their contract to make that a fireable offense. And then the, the hill that he went to make

126
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,880
 his house on, they named Fox Hill. So today you can go to the Dow. You can go to Fox Hill

127
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,720
 and you can probably like walk around and maybe, maybe find his babies. Maybe he met

128
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,480
 as sexy Fox as well. I think they probably named it Fox Hill just so he would never

129
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,880
 forget the fact that he became a Fox because I mean there's a hill, there's animals on

130
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,680
 every hill, right? There's not where animals on every hill. Turtle Bay wasn't named that

131
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,880
 because there was a where turtle floating around. But yeah, so Fox Hill, a constant

132
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,080
 reminder to this man that one day he turned into a Fox in front of all of his students

133
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,400
 and then spent quite a while in the middle of nowhere naked. And then had to come back

134
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,280
 home and ask for his job back. So I did find that story in a book written by a guy named

135
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:47,840
 Carl Barge. He's an author and a historian. The book was called Legends, Fairy Tales and

136
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,040
 Customs. So take, take a choice, right? I consider that a legend. I consider that an urban legend.

137
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:03,000
 But Legends, Fairy Tales and Customs from Mechlenburg. I say it's a legend, you may say that sounded

138
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,640
 suspiciously like a fairy tale. I looked into some more of the stuff that Carl Barge wrote.

139
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,600
 Because he did a lot of research on like medieval time Germany. And he had this tip, he had

140
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,760
 all these tips on like how to not have nightmares. Which I assume you have a bunch of nightmares

141
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,800
 if you lived in Germany at any point in your life. So let's say you're having, this might

142
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,960
 actually save your life. Let's take another vehicle for this. Fabio, I'm gonna go ahead

143
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,880
 and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're leaving behind Germany. We're headed

144
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,040
 to your bedroom while you're sleeping. We're standing, you're asleep. If you're listening

145
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,520
 to this, you're asleep right now and the rest of the show is standing around you staring

146
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:46,040
 at you while you sleep. And then I talk really loudly to explain this. The way to stop nightmares

147
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:53,040
 is this. You have a keyhole in your door, you stuff it, you put like tissue, you don't

148
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,000
 have, I mean apparently once you do this, you're never leaving the room. Right? You're

149
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,400
 all using superglue. You put, generally they used hay and the keyholes were bigger. I think

150
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,440
 if you stuck hay into a modern keyhole, you're gonna have to call a locksmith. You're like

151
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,360
 "Oooh, what a perfect night. No nightmares at all." You realize you died of carbon

152
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,360
 oxide poisoning. You sealed off the room. You stick in hay or whatever into your keyhole.

153
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,880
 That's step one. Two, put your shoes with the, take your shoes off. I should have said

154
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,320
 that for you, for you dummies out there who would have spent the rest of the night just

155
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:34,760
 standing there. Take your shoes off and place the toes facing the door and then walk backwards

156
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,800
 to bed. He has another tip which may be more or less feasible depending on your bed. You

157
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:48,040
 take a piece of steel and you put it in your bed straw. So back in your bed, then you're

158
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,560
 basically a bunch of hobos that are sleeping on piles of hay, super itchy. But you put something

159
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,120
 in there. Now if you're like on a Tempurpedic mattress or you're in a water bed, I did not

160
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,800
 recommend doing this. You're like "Aww, no nightmares tonight as you're drowning." I

161
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,880
 don't know in a modern like sleep foam bed if you can take like a file, like a steel

162
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,080
 file and shove it in. But my favorite way to stop a nightmare. This is one you can do

163
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,640
 today. You don't sleep on straw. You're no longer riding the rails like some crazy hobo.

164
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,680
 You don't wear shoes. You wear crocs and they can't face the door or you don't want to stuff

165
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,280
 up your doorknob. I totally get it. This last one you can do today. Why did you live

166
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,400
 near a body of water? This one's great. This one's great. First off, it has my first favorite

167
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:43,440
 ingredient ever to any sort of spell or ritual or just anything. Urinate in a clean new bottle.

168
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,040
 So you got to get a new bottle for this. You have these horrible nightmares. So you go to

169
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,880
 the new bottle store and you grab a bottle. You take it home. Don't do it at the store.

170
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,720
 You will get arrested. You urinate in a clean new bottle and then you have to hang the bottle

171
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:09,760
 in the sun for three days. So you got to let that urine just bubble up. It's super hot.

172
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,640
 It's like you're in the Sahara. You're like, "Eh." It's bubbling. It's boiling. Then after

173
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:23,920
 three days you have to carry it without saying a word to a running stream and then throw

174
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:32,520
 it over your head into the stream. After that you have no nightmares. I read that and I thought

175
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:41,720
 that's not true. Not that I don't think it would work, but someone made that up as a

176
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,160
 joke. I'm not saying Carl did, but someone made that up as a joke because let's picture

177
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,080
 this right now. You have to walk through your village. You have to walk through your medieval

178
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:58,200
 village holding a bottle of three-day old hot urine. People are like, "Hey Joey, what's

179
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,040
 up bro? How have you been? Hey Joey, what are you carrying? Joey? You're just walking

180
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,280
 through town. You can't say anything, right? You're just walking through town. Hey dude,

181
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:14,920
 what's- Dude, are you carrying urine? Hey Joey, Joey, what's going on? You just walk

182
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,920
 through the village totally quiet and then they see you get to stream and you check it

183
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,360
 on the river and then you walk up and you're like, "Hey man, how's it been?" We need to

184
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,120
 hang out more often. That has to be a joke. No one could do that. I mean I guess if you

185
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,640
 weren't walking through town and you're like sculpting through the darkness with the- Actually

186
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,600
 that's even worse because they see- They know you're like the town weirdo who's always

187
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,800
 like hiding behind bushels of fruit with your- You're constantly spilling it all over their

188
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,480
 grocer stand. I think someone made that one up as a joke. I guess we can figure it out.

189
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,360
 Test this. Test this. If you live near a stream, live stream yourself, not the urinating

190
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,400
 part. We can skip that part but live stream yourself throwing urine into the river unless

191
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,360
 that is considered pollution in your area. Oh man, I guess probably you can't do that

192
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,520
 this day but I think out of all of them that is the funnest one and we had it ended on

193
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,240
 something fun because this next story is super creepy. Fabio, I'm gonna go ahead and toss

194
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,880
 you the keys to the carpenter copter. We are leaving behind your bedroom. We are headed

195
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:28,680
 all the way out to Lake Charles, Louisiana. It's October 14th, 1993. We're in Lake Charles,

196
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:35,840
 Louisiana. There's a little house on 18th Street and in this house there is Nelda Louise

197
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:43,040
 Hardwick. She's a 34 year old woman who seems to have lived a pretty rough life. She has

198
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,800
 numerous surgical scars all over her body. She has a full set of dentures and her left

199
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,880
 leg is shorter than her right leg so she walks with a very noticeable limp but she's living

200
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,600
 her life. She's living her life. She has four kids and she lives with her boyfriend and

201
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:10,180
 they all have this little happy family and on October 14th, 1993, bathing the kids, beat

202
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,960
 boxing, beat boxing on the kids, scrubbing them down with a big old brush and then the

203
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,400
 boyfriend takes the kids and reads them bedtime stories and they're like, "That is the fairy

204
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,720
 tale of the teacher who became a fox." The kid's like, "I think it's more of a legend."

205
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,240
 All the kids go to sleep, the boyfriend goes to sleep and then the boyfriend wakes up next

206
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,800
 day and he sees a note on the table and says, "I'm going out to the store. I'll be right

207
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,200
 back." Nelda. She's like, "Oh, okay, you know, that's fine." She left a note but then he

208
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,120
 realizes this note was left in the middle of the night. It's the morning now, she's

209
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,720
 still not home. He calls the police and the police begin an investigation fairly quickly

210
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,120
 on this because of, I'm assuming, health concerns. What's interesting about the story is there's

211
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,600
 not a lot of information out there on this. It's fairly sensational but I couldn't find

212
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,280
 a lot of stuff on this but the police begin an investigation relatively quickly. When

213
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,200
 adults go missing in situations like that, the cops could be thinking, "Maybe she just

214
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,240
 want a new life. She has this boyfriend she doesn't want. She doesn't want the kids."

215
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,400
 She's like, "I can't bathe these kids anymore. They're super gross." She bounced but they

216
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,520
 start an investigation right away to believe that not only is she involuntarily missing

217
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,960
 but she's at risk and they just believe that there's foul play involved. The boyfriend's

218
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,080
 like, "Listen, she loved the kids. She never would have left the kids, family members,

219
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,160
 everyone are saying this is so out of character for her." They start looking for her and of

220
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,280
 course everyone's hoping for the best but she's not found.

221
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:58,200
 Five years later, May 8th, 1998, we're in Hancock County, Mississippi that's 242 miles

222
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:14,840
 away. On Interstate 10, cars are flying down the road and out of nowhere, a woman runs

223
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:31,440
 onto the interstate and is instantly killed when a car hits her. Someone get an ambulance.

224
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,640
 Can I get a statement please? It's so anyways. Horrible, right? She's an identified woman.

225
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,520
 They take the photos of her hoping someday they could find the loved ones but they don't

226
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,400
 know who this woman is. They do the autopsy cause of death, getting hit by a car. She

227
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,840
 is a Jane though so she's buried in a potter's field which is where you put people who don't

228
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,440
 know who they are, they don't have enough money. Prisoners end up in potter's fields,

229
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,120
 people, unidentified victims end up in potter's fields. They're basically just, your gravestone

230
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,640
 is like a number because they don't know who you are. They put the body to rest, they

231
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:16,080
 give you a sign, you a number like 191, unidentified body. In 2013 the hardwicks are still looking

232
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,200
 for her. Nelda's family is never giving up the search and you do start to look at Jane

233
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,360
 Doge, you know, checking hospitals, checking morgues, stuff like that. They and investigators

234
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,040
 come across the story of this woman who ran onto the road, they look at photographs of

235
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:38,240
 the body, they identify this deceased woman as Nelda. The coroner is then asked about

236
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,680
 this and apparently he's shown the photographs as well and he believes that it's Nelda. And

237
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,520
 he said it's actually a one in 1000 chance that it's not her. This has to be the same

238
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,560
 woman. And they go there's only one way to be sure. Go to the potter's field, dig up

239
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,160
 the bones, do it at midnight when it's super spooky, there's a raven on a nearby gravestone,

240
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,400
 dig up the bones and do a DNA test because she has relatives that are alive and then

241
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:15,520
 you could conclusively say this was Nelda. So they dig up the grave, open up the casket,

242
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,800
 eeeeeee, spooky jack-o-lantern is there, flame, little candle flickering. They open up the

243
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:34,680
 casket inside this coffin is a male's skeleton. Her body's grave marker was mislabeled and

244
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,920
 they look out at the potter's field all of these other graves. They have no idea where

245
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:50,560
 the body of Nelda is and the investigation is called off. To this day Nelda is still

246
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:58,420
 reported as missing but it's most likely the family and investigators believe there's

247
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:06,840
 a pretty good chance that she's in this potter's field. But what makes the story so terrifying

248
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,440
 is what the coroner says and really what I think a lot of us think when we're hearing

249
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,840
 this or reading this. She gets abducted in 1993 and five years later a woman, Nelda,

250
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,480
 is running onto the interstate and gets hit by a car. The coroner's theory is that she

251
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:37,540
 was kidnapped and kept alive for five years in captivity until one day she finally escaped.

252
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:46,100
 And as she's running free for the first time in five years she's also panicked and fearful

253
00:23:46,100 --> 00:24:00,240
 that she will be caught again. She sees the interstate and she keeps running. Maybe she

254
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,760
 was trying to cross it assuming that her pursuers would not be so risky she could just get over

255
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:16,100
 the busy interstate. She has a shot, she has a chance at getting back to her family. Maybe

256
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:24,060
 she was running to the interstate and was hoping to flag down a car or maybe she knew

257
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:30,780
 she wasn't going to get away. This wasn't her first escape attempt. She'd done it before

258
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:40,560
 but she knew this would be her last. She ran onto that freeway hoping she wouldn't make

259
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:51,400
 it off the interstate alive. Suicide as opposed to slavery. Whichever one it is or any multitude

260
00:24:51,400 --> 00:25:00,760
 of others since a terrifying ending. The thing is even if we could with 100% certainty prove

261
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,380
 that that was Nelda on the interstate. If we could find the right set of remains through

262
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,020
 the DNA test and prove that was her we still would not come any closer to answering the

263
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:18,820
 question where she had been for the past five years. What her life had been like. A young

264
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:26,540
 woman leaves her house at night says goodbye to her sleeping children and her slumbering

265
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:36,240
 boyfriend and goes to the corner store to get some groceries. She is then held in captivity

266
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:46,600
 for five years and then dies on a freeway. We know how depraved human beings can be towards

267
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:53,640
 each other. But a lot of us only know it in theory. We read about it in newspapers or

268
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,780
 we read about it in books or see it in movies and we understand that humans can be this

269
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:12,060
 dark. But Nelda knew it as a fact. She experienced day by day the brutality of humans. Humans

270
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:22,060
 so brutal they kept her alive for five years after snatching her away from her family. Where

271
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:45,660
 was she all that time? Who had her? And are they looking for fresh victims to this day?
