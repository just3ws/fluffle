1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
 In the conspiracy war, has the CIA switched sides?

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,560
 What would you do if a man walked up to you in the middle of the street and said, "Can

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,600
 I throw your blood in the Mariana trench?"

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,800
 And then finally we take a look at a young man who was enjoying a bright sunny day with

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,920
 his two buddies, sitting on a lawn across the street from a library.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,440
 Everything was just peachy keen until a plane shot a space beam and turned into a demon.

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:44,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,280
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,760
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,400
 And guys, before I get started here I wanted to announce that yes, this Thursday it will

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:02,080
 be November 25th and at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time we will do our Dead Rabbit Radio Thanksgiving

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,200
 live stream special.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
 We're gonna have me.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,720
 I can't promise any fun guests because I've never had a guest on the show but it'll be

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,840
 me and you.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,840
 You are the fun guest and be here.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,560
 We're gonna do a live chat on YouTube.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,080
 So if you got questions, you got comments, be there and we will hang out as a fluffle

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,320
 on Thanksgiving 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,880
 We will probably, I'm imagining an hour minimum maybe two but definitely try to get there

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,480
 in that first hour because I can't guarantee a second one.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,720
 A lot of times I'm pooped out within that first hour but yes.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,880
 Thanksgiving November 25th 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.

27
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,400
 Join us for the Dead Rabbit Radio Thanksgiving live stream special on YouTube.

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,520
 First off let's go ahead and introduce today's Patreon.

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,440
 One of our newest Patreon supporters walking into Dead Rabbit Command with a strut.

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
 Give it up for Louis Lopez.

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
 Everyone give him round of applause.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,640
 He's like, "Is that how you pronounce his name?"

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
 I'm pretty sure.

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
 Louis, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon that's fine too.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,720
 Just helps with the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

37
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,360
 You know what else would help out a lot?

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,000
 When you send your name, when you support the show, tell me how to pronounce your name.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,200
 But Louis or Louise maybe?

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,560
 A Mr. Lopez we'll call you now.

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,720
 Louis, we're gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,040
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

43
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,040
 We are headed all the way out to the deep state.

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,400
 So Washington DC, pretty much anywhere Washington DC or Washington DC adjacent, the place is

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
 full of deep state agents.

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,320
 Now back in my day, because I'm much older, 45 years old, but I've been into this conspiracy

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,200
 theory stuff since I was 12.

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,600
 Back in my day they were called the shadow government.

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,120
 It was what conspiracy theorists believed were the people who were running the country.

50
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,680
 Now the term has evolved to deep state lifelong.

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,720
 I will talk about these guys quite often on the show, but it's people who have been in

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,840
 their job for 20, 30 years.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,600
 They've been working in DC longer than any president, longer than any senator, and they

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,640
 have vested interests in keeping their job the same.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,160
 They have all of these contacts.

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,440
 So you really wonder who controls the power in cities like DC.

57
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,720
 Is it the elected officials or is it the people who have worked there for decades and

58
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,560
 have these contacts and have this power, right?

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,480
 They're doing favors for each other and they're wielding this power.

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,720
 So the deep state, the shadow government, there's always this idea that they are the

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,840
 one secretly pulling the strings.

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,880
 It's no one you can ever vote out.

63
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,740
 And it is hard to fire someone from a government job anyways.

64
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,160
 So once they're in, they're in.

65
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,280
 And we've always kind of seen this interplay.

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,520
 When you have the deep state, you have like accountants, things like that.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,560
 You have people, maybe I don't know, marketing executives, vote more.

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
 I don't know.

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,720
 I don't know if you need a marketing executive to run a government, but I'm sure you do.

70
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,960
 But you definitely have to have like statisticians and all this stuff.

71
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,280
 Maybe I don't know what the point is, is that there's a bunch of people that you don't

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,960
 even know who are probably actually forming these cabals to control the government.

73
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,720
 Not Illuminati stuff.

74
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,520
 Not this highfalutin reptilian stuff.

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,880
 Just people who have been working the same job longer than some of us have been alive.

76
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,920
 They wield in tremendous political power.

77
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,160
 And imagine when you're at work that one person you don't really like who's like a total

78
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,560
 busybody and always ratting you out to the boss.

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,120
 Just because you're stalled, just because you've embezzled some money, oh you narc.

80
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,080
 And you know that one person you don't like who you also suspect is breaking into the

81
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,600
 fridge and eating your lunch when you're not around.

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
 Imagine people like that.

83
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,560
 Imagine the Matilda of your office wielding this power behind the scenes.

84
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
 Because that's what it is.

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,640
 It's lifelong bureaucrats.

86
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,360
 But you've always had this breakdown that you have these nerds, right?

87
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
 You have all the time.

88
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,600
 I'm in so much trouble with the IRS.

89
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
 I can insult them all day long.

90
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,200
 So you have those dorks over there in the IRS just counting money and stuff and hounding

91
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,280
 me and sending me letter after letter.

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,200
 And then you have like the sexy ones.

93
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,280
 The sexy members of the deep state which would be FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security.

94
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,080
 They're a bunch of dorks too.

95
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
 They're new to the game, right?

96
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
 They don't have the legacy of the CIA.

97
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
 The FBI.

98
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,640
 The very bloody and cruel legacy.

99
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,040
 And so that's really the thrust of this matter today.

100
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,280
 Because it's always been, you have the sexy members of the deep state, FBI, CIA.

101
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:31,640
 And for the longest time, it was the FBI and the CIA was on the side of like a conservative

102
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,680
 right wing.

103
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,920
 People on the right wing used to like the FBI is what I'm trying to say.

104
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,980
 They used to support law enforcement.

105
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,320
 They used to support the CIA because you got to fight those commies over in Guam.

106
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
 You got to do all this stuff.

107
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,040
 You got to, yeah, we had to go to Vietnam and CIA.

108
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,800
 That's how I grew up.

109
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,680
 Was that in right wing circles, because again I was researching this conspiracy stuff for

110
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,840
 decades or talking back like in '88.

111
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,880
 I really got into it.

112
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,560
 The right wing supported the CIA's actions in the Iran-Contra scandal.

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,320
 The Oliver North was a right wing hero.

114
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
 Right?

115
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,360
 Conservative hero.

116
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,660
 And then it switched.

117
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,340
 It switched really, really quickly.

118
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:22,260
 And I remember watching this all unfold when the right wing stopped loving the FBI and

119
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,100
 then the left wing took them in.

120
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,220
 It's super weird to watch.

121
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,340
 And that was down to Ruby Ridge and Waco, the siege at Waco.

122
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,340
 Both of those things were seen as assaults on right wing beliefs.

123
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,940
 That wasn't Reaganomics that they were going after, but Ruby Ridge was a militia group.

124
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,180
 Waco was, as far as they go, we weren't a cult.

125
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,300
 We were just collecting weapons and all hiding out in this compound.

126
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,300
 There's a lot of stuff about Waco, whether or not any of those allegations are true,

127
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,460
 all that stuff.

128
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:04,340
 But that is when I remember very vividly watching this pivot away from "Don't worry, the FBI,

129
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,020
 the CIA is on our side."

130
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,300
 That would be the right wing militias used to believe that.

131
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,300
 But after Waco and after Ruby Ridge, that completely changed.

132
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,260
 Ruby Ridge was like a family was gunned down by the FBI up in the woods and there was this

133
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
 shooting.

134
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,100
 Again, I'm oversimplifying these things.

135
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:28,020
 And so for the longest time, really since the mid-90s, we started to see this shift

136
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,980
 where the left wing began to trust the FBI.

137
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,380
 You guys, you just got to trust the FBI.

138
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
 These guys, what?

139
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,940
 The FBI is the one reporting this stuff.

140
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,820
 I'm just the journalist reporting the story.

141
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,820
 Don't you guys trust the FBI?

142
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,500
 I thought you guys were patriots.

143
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,660
 We started to see that shift, which was also incredibly weird for me because the FBI and

144
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:55,100
 the CIA in the 60s, really from the 60s till now, I believe, but they really made a strong

145
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,340
 push to shut down peace movements.

146
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,660
 They made a strong push to shut down Black nationalist movements.

147
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,900
 They directly went after the Black Panthers in any group.

148
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:11,580
 The FBI went after any group that had any hint of racial solidarity.

149
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,420
 They shut it down and CIA is coming in right behind them with boxes full of cocaine showing

150
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,260
 people how to make crack.

151
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,020
 And it is so weird, the ping pong that, because I remember when I was growing up, the right

152
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,980
 really loved the FBI because they took care of those insurrectionist groups in the left

153
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,340
 or like, no, they're a bunch of traitors.

154
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,660
 I can't believe they shut down all the peace movements.

155
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,380
 And then I watched that needle turn and it went from them being on the right and ally

156
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,180
 to the right to now enemy of the right.

157
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,500
 They'll come in and they'll kick your door down and they'll take all your guns and stuff

158
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,700
 like that.

159
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,740
 And so the left took them back in.

160
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,660
 You have them being embraced by the left side more than the right side nowadays.

161
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:59,060
 And so that whole history lesson, that whole ramble going on.

162
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,060
 Something interesting.

163
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,980
 I was reading Real Raw News the other day.

164
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
 The website.

165
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,100
 I talk about that website as if it's even remotely legitimate.

166
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,540
 It's pure fiction, but I love going to it.

167
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,060
 It's something I do basically on Saturday night when I'm done with all my serious research.

168
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,580
 I wonder what this lunatic's writing today.

169
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,660
 He has an article out today and this is important because Real Raw News is really one of the

170
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,260
 leading voices in this conspiracy theory culture.

171
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,260
 It's so bizarre.

172
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,780
 I kind of predicted it, but I'm starting to see more of their stuff popping up all over

173
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:39,300
 the place and he constantly is doing GoFundMe's and he's making $12,000 like a month just

174
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
 on the GoFundMe's.

175
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,540
 That doesn't include the advertising or anything else on his website.

176
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
 So it's insane.

177
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,140
 Maybe every two months, but it's insane how much money he's pulling in.

178
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,260
 He recently had an article that was titled, caught my eye, among all the other stuff

179
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,020
 about Chelsea Clinton's clone being killed in Guantanamo Bay or whatever other nonsense.

180
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:05,260
 He had this headline, "Deep State CIA Spooks Defecting to White Hats?"

181
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,460
 And this article stated that, deep center pretty much with that line said, so a spook

182
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,820
 is a slang term for a spy.

183
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:20,860
 Basically we're having members of the CIA leave the corrupt political machine and their

184
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
 writing letters.

185
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,500
 This happened on November 10th.

186
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,980
 He made it up on November 10th.

187
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:30,100
 There's a better way to put this, but 34 CIA field agents wrote letters to Governor Greg

188
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,740
 Abbott, Ron DeSantis and Kristen Noem.

189
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,660
 Those are Republican governors apologizing for a bunch of stuff that if I told you, the

190
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,820
 channel would get demonetized and probably yanked.

191
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,100
 The normal stuff.

192
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
 They're apologizing.

193
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,780
 We're so sorry that we stole those elections.

194
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,620
 And then we're sorry about to steal the one in 2024.

195
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,500
 But anyways, we're sorry that we're going to do that.

196
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,860
 So please, Republican governors, will you have our backs?

197
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,980
 We want to join your side.

198
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,540
 We want to reject the darkness.

199
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,460
 And then it goes off into this whole anti-vance thing.

200
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,140
 And again, I'm not going there.

201
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:14,740
 The point is, the point is, is these 34 fictional CIA agents have had it.

202
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,420
 They want to leave this group and then apparently another six are off the grid.

203
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,860
 Another six CIA agents.

204
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,260
 They just no one knows where they're at.

205
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,500
 So I mean, I don't know if that's supposed to sound ominous or they're just at like getting

206
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,140
 a breadstick at Saburo at the mall.

207
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,140
 I don't know.

208
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,700
 Like that's, that's, I don't know if I'm supposed to be watching out for six rogue CIA agents.

209
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,260
 But yeah, and then they go, a lot of others want to join us, but they are too scared.

210
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,940
 They're scared that they'll lose their jobs if they sign this letter.

211
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,620
 But don't worry, Republican governors, we, the CIA has your back.

212
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,980
 This is super important.

213
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:58,260
 As dumb as this is, as made up and fictional as this is, this is super important because

214
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:05,380
 I believe that this is signifying the shift back.

215
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,900
 It's been one of the weirdest things because you have right, and I keep using the terms

216
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
 right wing and left wing.

217
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,860
 I know there's a lot of blurring in the middle and I'm just trying to make it as succinct

218
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
 as possible.

219
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,500
 I could go on with all these other political ideologies, but when you have right wing or

220
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,460
 right, right leaning people, they tend to be more law and order, right?

221
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,900
 So it's weird that for the past 30 years, they have distrusted the FBI and the CIA.

222
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,980
 They're like, oh, local law enforcement.

223
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,380
 I'm totally behind, but federal law enforcement.

224
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,780
 And I know that there are people who do feel that way.

225
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,780
 States rights and all that stuff.

226
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:46,460
 But it's been a weird divide, especially because, so I think honestly that this is a shift

227
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,020
 back.

228
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,340
 This is a shift back.

229
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,260
 And I think in the next two or three years, we will start to see federal law enforcement

230
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:03,900
 be re-embraced by more conservatives and start to be lambasted by the liberals.

231
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,340
 And this is the first step of that.

232
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,140
 I think we're actually seeing a sea change in that movement.

233
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,540
 It makes sense because I've seen it twice already.

234
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,220
 Nothing is permanent in life.

235
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,740
 Nothing's permanent in life, especially conspiracy theories.

236
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:24,540
 So I, you know, the real raw news, as much as they make stuff up, it, I'll tell you this,

237
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,620
 like I have had my encounters.

238
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,060
 I've talked to you guys, I've had my encounters with the FBI.

239
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,780
 I have had my encounter.

240
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,300
 CIA, CIA, you guys only $3,000.

241
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,900
 I know I've said enough words to pop up on some carnivore computer that this podcast

242
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,340
 is actually being listened to.

243
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,460
 You guys owe me $3,000.

244
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,940
 You know why you owe me $3,000.

245
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,060
 They interfered in some business I was doing.

246
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,060
 But that's it.

247
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,460
 I've never really had any close contact with a CIA operative, at least that I know.

248
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:58,700
 But I do believe, real raw news is a bigger, has a wider reach than this show.

249
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:05,860
 And I do believe when shows get a certain level, you do get contacted by CIA, FBI, whatever

250
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,620
 group may be in your area.

251
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,780
 Hopefully, hopefully not Stasi or something like that, KGB.

252
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:18,020
 But I think that this is, I think that someone reached out.

253
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,980
 I think someone reached out and I think we're going to start seeing a push for the FBI and

254
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,460
 for the CIA to be embraced by the conservatives.

255
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,740
 They're going to make the push themselves and the movement will take them back.

256
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,220
 I really, really believe that.

257
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,820
 And I could be wrong, right?

258
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
 That's real wrong.

259
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,380
 There's a bunch of articles about Mike Pence and his gay Filipino lover hiding out in

260
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,460
 a hotel in Italy and then they both got shot.

261
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,460
 That was an actual article.

262
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
 That was an actual article.

263
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,900
 I didn't cover it on the show because it was too absurd.

264
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,420
 But Mike Pence got shot in the belly.

265
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
 Don't worry.

266
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,460
 He was fine until they took him to Guantanamo Bay and hung him.

267
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,740
 There was no, I think his Filipino lover was killed on the scene.

268
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
 But Navy Seals did that.

269
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,580
 They didn't actually do that, but that's the news stories.

270
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,620
 But I do think, I think this is a sea change.

271
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:10,900
 And I found it very, very odd as Real Raw News is so anti-Deep State CIA, FBI, NSA throughout

272
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,660
 their, very, very interesting that they ran this article, even giving a glimmer of hope

273
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:22,260
 to his readers that law enforcement, federal law enforcement is back on their side.

274
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,260
 And they're not even investigating.

275
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,260
 Nothing happens by accident if you are a conspiracy theorist.

276
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,140
 There's a reason this article was published.

277
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,980
 And Lewis, he's like, Jason, please.

278
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,140
 I think it's Lewis.

279
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,020
 So we'll call you Lewis the first time.

280
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,100
 Lewis, I'm going to go ahead.

281
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,700
 We got to get out of here because I just exposed the CIA's operation.

282
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,980
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dreadnought, our battleship.

283
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,540
 We are leaving behind Washington, DC.

284
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,700
 We're headed all the way out to the Mariana Trench.

285
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,060
 Does the battleship have a giant whistle on it?

286
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,380
 Is it like a Carnival Cruise Line?

287
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,300
 Is there like the captain of the battleship being like, land a hoi over there, look out,

288
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,260
 and then they shoot some boats.

289
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,260
 They're coming over this way.

290
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,340
 And then, so then like other boats knows that he's coming.

291
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
 I don't know.

292
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,980
 Have you guys ever seen a camouflage boat though?

293
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,220
 I thought it was a joke.

294
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,500
 I figured it's just a boat.

295
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 You paint it blue, right?

296
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,780
 Have you ever seen a camouflage boat?

297
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,780
 It's the weirdest thing.

298
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,780
 I guess I can't say that.

299
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,260
 I guess I can't say that because we talk about Bigfoot.

300
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,820
 We talk about UFOs and all sorts of craziness.

301
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,180
 A camouflage battleship, camouflage boat warship.

302
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,420
 You think it's painted like waves?

303
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,300
 You think it's a picture of maybe the little mermaid swimming?

304
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,580
 So if you're flying a plane overhead, you just think, oh, look at its aerial.

305
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,420
 How come she's 80 feet long?

306
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,580
 No.

307
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,700
 It's painted in zigzags and diagonals because when you're-- if a plane's coming overhead,

308
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,100
 right, you're kind of boned anyways.

309
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,220
 But when you're watching a boat, when two boats are getting ready to fight each other,

310
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,820
 you're constantly looking at which direction it's headed in and like the angle and whether

311
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,380
 or not the captain's blowing the whistle.

312
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,460
 They'll like fire towards the horn.

313
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,180
 But so they have all these diagonals and zigzags painted onto the ship.

314
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,060
 So by looking at the ship, you cannot tell which direction it's turning.

315
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,540
 Now what's weird is that I've seen photographs of camouflage boats and I'm like, oh, it's

316
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
 going straight.

317
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
 I can totally tell.

318
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,980
 But they should hire me as a naval commander.

319
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,900
 But I imagine that if you're on another boat and you're trying to be like, what direction

320
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
 is he going in?

321
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,780
 And they're like 90 stern things, 90 stern things.

322
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,380
 And then you wouldn't know that he's really like port.

323
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,900
 Like, oh, he should have said 90 port things.

324
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
 But it's too late.

325
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
 You're being eaten by a shark.

326
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,420
 So yes, that is a handy fact.

327
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,220
 Now I have to find some links proving that.

328
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,300
 There's a bunch of naval officers shaking their head right now.

329
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,700
 They're like, that's half true.

330
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,900
 But thanks for listening to the podcast anyways.

331
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,700
 Luis, I'm going to go ahead and direct you in this dead rabbit battleship, the dead rabbit

332
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
 dreadnought.

333
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,420
 We are headed out-- we're right here actually now-- the Mariana Trench.

334
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:13,980
 So the Mariana Trench, which I will do my best not to refer to as the Maranara Trench,

335
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,300
 as I famously have on this show before, this podcast before.

336
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,820
 I practice not doing that.

337
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,980
 The Mariana Trench.

338
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,060
 And it's November 30th, 2013.

339
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,300
 And right now there's a dude.

340
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,580
 His name is Kristen von Hornstlet.

341
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,540
 He's an artist.

342
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,860
 And he paints and stuff like that.

343
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,860
 But then he also has these-- he's like a conceptual artist thing.

344
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,480
 It's like a stand-up comedian who has stage fright.

345
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,500
 So they go, I'm just going to do wacky stuff around the world.

346
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,140
 And maybe people will pay attention to me.

347
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
 One of them was this.

348
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,100
 This is kind of-- so if you go to his Wikipedia page, there's two things about him.

349
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
 There's two things about him.

350
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,860
 If you go to his Instagram page, there's a bunch of beautiful artwork.

351
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,060
 He's really talented.

352
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,300
 But when you go to his Wikipedia page, there's two articles about him.

353
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:00,100
 One of them is him building a giant sculpture full of human blood-- little samples of human

354
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,580
 blood on pieces of cloth-- that he's going to drop into the Mariana Trench.

355
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,780
 So in the future, people in there could be cloned.

356
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,740
 That's why he spent too much-- he wants to combine science and art.

357
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,080
 And he wanted to say, you know, they may dig it out in 500 years.

358
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,480
 They may dig it out in 100,000 years.

359
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,680
 But there's a chance that by the time they're able to get this out from the bottom of the

360
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,440
 Mariana Trench, cloning technology will be available.

361
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,560
 So he went around the world and asked for samples and said, how would you like to live

362
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
 forever?

363
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,960
 It's just kind of an interesting thought experiment.

364
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,020
 And he wants to put up a ton of these, 10 on land.

365
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,700
 He wants to put four more in the ocean.

366
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,860
 But there's only been one put down so far in 2013.

367
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,860
 And it was really the main one going into the Mariana Trench.

368
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,140
 The other ones were basically directions to the Mariana Trench, just in case 10,000 years

369
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,940
 from now, no one knows there's something down there.

370
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,940
 That was this experiment.

371
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,020
 So that's cool, right?

372
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,300
 That is a cool blending of science and art.

373
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,980
 His other experiment got him kicked out of a country.

374
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,860
 The other experiment really went south.

375
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:08,080
 He thought it would be really cool if he went to a destitute village in the middle of Africa

376
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:16,880
 and said, remember when porn ads, remember when porn websites used to pay people to get

377
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,240
 their name tattooed on their head?

378
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,340
 So right now there's probably some guy walking around with dog fart tattooed on his forehead.

379
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340
 He wanted to do that.

380
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,320
 But he had them to do a dog fart.

381
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,140
 He went to this impoverished African village and he said, if you change your name, if

382
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,860
 you go to your local courthouse and legally change your name to Hornsleith, change it

383
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:45,340
 to my last name, nothing else can't be Mr. Hornsleith, can't be Joey Hornsleith, has

384
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,100
 to be Hornsleith, I will give you an animal.

385
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,140
 What do we specifically, he'll give him livestock.

386
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,900
 It's not like someone's going to change the name.

387
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,020
 It's like, here, you get a horn to toad.

388
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
 What?

389
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
 You get a squirrel.

390
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,440
 You get a goat and pigs.

391
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,680
 And people are doing this.

392
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,960
 People are like, well, you know, my name is part of my family lineage.

393
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,840
 What would be the purpose of one pig too?

394
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,280
 Because then you get a pig and then it like grows old and then you're like, oh man.

395
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,000
 And then it should have been it, but instead I had too much fun riding it around the village.

396
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,040
 If you have one pig or you get it and you eat it, you're like, all right, I traded my

397
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,920
 name away for basically like, how many meals can you get out of a pig?

398
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,220
 Not many, right?

399
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,380
 If you figure it, I heard that I've heard that every pig we've eaten, like every piece

400
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:38,340
 of pork you've ever eaten came from a pig younger than six months.

401
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,180
 Although I have a friend and she's a vegetarian.

402
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,280
 She's also told me other vegetarian trivia, quote unquote trivia that turned out not to

403
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
 be true.

404
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,840
 You know, I used to work in a mortuary and one day Sabine told me that the bodies of

405
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,160
 vegetarians when they're rotting or when they're being burned in the crematory, they

406
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,880
 smell better than the body of a meat eater.

407
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
 And she said that to me and I was just kind of sitting there.

408
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,020
 I was eating dinner this conversation.

409
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
 I have a dinner.

410
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,020
 I was eating dinner.

411
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,020
 I thought about it and I go, that's not true.

412
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,020
 That's not true.

413
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,620
 No, I used to work in a mortuary.

414
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,520
 There's a hundred reasons why that's not true.

415
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,020
 And then she was just, we were sitting then I just kind of let it sit for a while.

416
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,800
 Let it sit for a while like a stinky fart, like a dog fart.

417
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 And then I said, hey, um, that's not true.

418
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,760
 I go, her original statement was when you cremate a vegetarian's body, it smells better.

419
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,480
 And I go, I've been around a lot of bodies.

420
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,760
 I used to work in a crematory specifically.

421
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,040
 I used to work in a mortuary, but we were burning bodies.

422
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,360
 You never smell them.

423
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
 You never smell them.

424
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,400
 If you did, if you did, you'd be constantly thrown up.

425
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,720
 A burning human body is a horrible smell.

426
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,960
 Burning flesh is something uncanny valley about it.

427
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,120
 Like it drives you away from the scene.

428
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,920
 But yeah, I go, that's not true.

429
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,480
 And I said, and then she goes, well, maybe it's an amorex.

430
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,960
 And I go, no, that's not true either.

431
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,840
 And again, I'll tell you why you would never be able to know that information about it.

432
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,040
 Unless someone specifically told you that's my niece.

433
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
 She was a vegetarian.

434
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,120
 And that was she smelled like someone just put a glade plug in into her navel.

435
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,620
 You wouldn't know.

436
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,120
 And you would need such a huge sample size.

437
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,600
 I go, there just doesn't make sense.

438
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,560
 And then I looked it up and I didn't believe me.

439
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,280
 She didn't believe my lifetime experience.

440
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,520
 I looked it up and it turns out not to be true as well.

441
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,440
 But the point is, is that he, what were we talking about?

442
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,680
 We were talking about eating pigs.

443
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
 It doesn't matter.

444
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,480
 I don't know if you really eat every piggy-eaten has been young in the six months.

445
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,960
 But what are you going to do with one pig?

446
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,760
 He goes to this village and he has these people change their names and people are doing it

447
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,520
 and they're getting pigs or goats, pig or a goat.

448
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,760
 And then the local, the local government found out about this and they said that that's,

449
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,000
 that's so slimy, dude.

450
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 What?

451
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,480
 No, I'm just trying to help people out.

452
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,360
 And I'm trying to like do this art thing.

453
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,640
 And they're like, what's the message?

454
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,680
 And he's like, uh, he's a pig under each arm.

455
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,280
 He's like, I don't know.

456
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,240
 It came off as tacky because you have this guy who's wealthy, not like Sue.

457
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,160
 We can raise $2 million to drop a chunk of metal in the water, but he is kind of exploiting

458
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
 this town.

459
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,240
 He could just give him all pigs if he wanted to give them purple pigs, make that your art

460
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
 project.

461
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,320
 And eventually this is what I would have done.

462
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,960
 This shows how honorable I am.

463
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,320
 I would have been like, dude, I'll totally change my name and gotten a pig and then just

464
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,840
 said, Hey, everyone just call me Jason.

465
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
 That was dumb.

466
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
 I just ripped this guy off for a pig.

467
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
 That's what I would do.

468
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
 And maybe that's what everyone else was thinking.

469
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,680
 Cause eventually everyone stopped using the name Hornslef.

470
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,360
 The point is, is that now there is a giant sculpture at the bottom of the Mariana trench

471
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,440
 and it's full of human blood.

472
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,600
 And because of the way it's designed, I'm assuming that it didn't immediately get crushed

473
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 when it hit the ground.

474
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,640
 I don't think you'd go down there and find metal spaghetti, but let's assume that everything

475
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,760
 was done correctly and it's able to withstand the pressure.

476
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,760
 It's fascinating because by the time a culture became advanced enough to go into the Mariana

477
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:01,480
 trench and pull something out, they would be, I mean that is, that we're, we're past.

478
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,800
 I would say by the time we can do that, we're flying around the solar system.

479
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,120
 Cause the, it takes more energy.

480
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,520
 Don't, don't fact check this.

481
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
 Don't fact check this.

482
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,040
 But it takes more energy to go to the bottom of the ocean cause all that water pressure

483
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,800
 and pull something up.

484
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,840
 Then it takes to go from here to the moon.

485
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,920
 Now again, don't fact check me.

486
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,800
 I'm assuming that once you go, the rocket or the space shuttle, whatever you're using

487
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,120
 gets, yeah, once you get out of Earth's gravity, that's the easy part.

488
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,560
 Everything else after that's really easy.

489
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,960
 As long as, as long as you're advanced mathematician, you can figure out everything in space.

490
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,120
 The hardest part is leaving, but the hardest with going to the ocean, the hardest part

491
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,520
 is coming back and going down to the here, right?

492
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,960
 So by the time we're able to do that, no, my question is this, I have like a bunch of

493
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,080
 parts of my body that have fallen out, like teeth and blood.

494
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,840
 I have some blood too, saved the way.

495
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,560
 And I've always thought about taking that and putting it in a, like an airtight box

496
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
 and burying it.

497
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,920
 I know it's not, I know it's not as advanced as what this dude did.

498
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,960
 And then I was thinking about taking like some stuff I've created, like all my podcast

499
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,000
 episodes and putting them on a flash drive and throwing that in there and writing a letter.

500
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,240
 And then maybe like taking a rock and writing the letter in Spanish or something like that.

501
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,840
 And then like a bunch of, bunch of rocks and put out different alphabets.

502
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,920
 This is, I can barely, I can barely speak English.

503
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,000
 I can barely speak English, but somehow I want to create a Rosetta Stones.

504
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,360
 I want to have a bunch of little stones that have like the Spanish alphabet, which is also

505
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,600
 just the English alphabet, but little things above some of the letters.

506
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,960
 And then, then bury the box.

507
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,840
 So then 10,000, 1000 years from now when they're building houses or whatever, they're building

508
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,680
 like space ports or something like that, they'll find this metal box and they'll open it up

509
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,400
 and they'll have all these rocks in it.

510
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,680
 And they're like, oh, they're just moving those away.

511
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,840
 They're like, oh, I know what this is.

512
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,120
 This is a USB drive.

513
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
 We're from the future.

514
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
 We know about all technology.

515
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,680
 I don't know why he thought he'd have to carve stuff out on rocks.

516
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,640
 Anyways, and then they can like listen to my podcast in the future.

517
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,040
 And then there'd be like my tooth.

518
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,600
 I have like two teeth and some blood in there.

519
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
 I haven't made the box yet.

520
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,200
 I just, I've written out the bloods in my fridge and the teeth are on my bookcase.

521
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,480
 But then I figure like, what if they clone me in the future?

522
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,480
 Like they like the podcast so much and they like my amazing skills of carving rocks.

523
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,280
 That technology's been long lost to them.

524
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
 They're like, what?

525
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
 You can write on a rock?

526
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,960
 Who was this God?

527
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
 And so they teleport me.

528
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,120
 They don't tell, they clone me into the future and I'm like walking around and stuff like

529
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,920
 that and I'm teaching them things.

530
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,880
 They're constantly rolling their eyes.

531
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,840
 They're like, we know that Jason.

532
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,600
 I'm like, did you know that bodies, it doesn't matter what you eat.

533
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,880
 Bodies smell the same when they rot.

534
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,920
 They're like, oh, great.

535
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,360
 So but then I thought, what if, let's put out a conspiracy cap.

536
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,400
 We're going to have to wrap up the episode like this.

537
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,880
 We're going to have to save the magical plane story for tomorrow's episode.

538
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,160
 Imagine this.

539
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,400
 If you can be cloned in the future, I get cloned say 10,000 years in the future.

540
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,400
 So I would be the equivalent of a caveman to them.

541
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,880
 It would be so shocking.

542
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,760
 They're like, look at his, look at his rivelling muscles and the sparkle in his eye.

543
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,760
 Those have been wiped out through years of de-evolution where we're now just a bunch

544
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,320
 of nerds floating around in float chairs.

545
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,560
 My first question is, where's my soul?

546
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,800
 Like right now my soul's in this body.

547
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:43,360
 But if I get cloned, is my soul now divided in two?

548
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,760
 Does that body have my same soul?

549
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,600
 Does the soul, my theory would be this.

550
00:28:51,600 --> 00:29:00,800
 Your soul, because it's not really an issue of a matter, but it's energy or something

551
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,320
 we can't really quantify.

552
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,440
 It could be in two places at once.

553
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,360
 So my soul would be in both bodies at the same time.

554
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,880
 The full jason experience would be located in both bodies.

555
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,960
 I think that would also explain stuff like quantum immortality.

556
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,360
 Where with their alternate universes, all of those jasons share a soul.

557
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,840
 So if you die in one timeline and you slide into the next, you're not a raving lunatic

558
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
 in the new one.

559
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,560
 You still have your same soul.

560
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,920
 You still have your same moral code.

561
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,200
 You still have all of that.

562
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,320
 So it can be spread out across multiverse.

563
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,680
 Why can it be spread out in one universe?

564
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:48,600
 So if I'm cloned, that's my soul is also in that clone.

565
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,200
 But if the multiverse theory is correct, and right now there's an infinite number of jasons

566
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,480
 running around doing just totally awesome stuff, they're running around.

567
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,880
 Now I'm probably putting too much into this, but they're running around in the years from

568
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,440
 1976 to 2052 or whatever.

569
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,840
 That would be that timeline.

570
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,880
 But if I'm able to get cloned in the year 10,000, now I have a clone.

571
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:26,000
 Now I have this new me outside of the designated time zone appropriate for a jason carbonator.

572
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Does any of this make sense?

573
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,280
 I'm gonna keep going.

574
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
 I'm gonna keep going.

575
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,440
 Just buckle in if it doesn't.

576
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
 This is my concern.

577
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,280
 This is what I'm getting at.

578
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,480
 This is why I have not buried the box.

579
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,280
 And this is why I would not give blood to this hornslith dude.

580
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,640
 Maybe if he gave me a pig, it might be a little more tempting.

581
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,040
 But my fear is this.

582
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,600
 What if I bury the box tomorrow?

583
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,520
 Once the box has been buried, the game is on.

584
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,040
 And you have to bury it deep enough so it's not like some dog can come around and be like,

585
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
 "Oh, I love human blood."

586
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
 And dig it up.

587
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,640
 Like you bury it deep.

588
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,480
 So you know that it's not gonna be discovered for a long time.

589
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,400
 I bury it and then I get recloned 100,000 years in the future.

590
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,840
 That's me.

591
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,240
 That's my soul.

592
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,320
 What if they beat me up?

593
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,640
 What if I get tell- What if I'm in the future now?

594
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,080
 And they're like, "Oh yes, we've always wanted to experiment on a caveman."

595
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
 And I'm like, "I'm not a caveman.

596
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
 I'm not a caveman."

597
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,680
 And they start torturing me or turning my body into goo would suck.

598
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,920
 That's on my top 10 things that don't want to happen while I'm alive is turning into

599
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
 goo.

600
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,720
 And then because they can clone me, they do all this horrible stuff to my body and then

601
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,280
 like I'm melting and my organic waste is going into the sewer.

602
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,320
 Eyeballs are falling through the sewer grate.

603
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,600
 And then like as my eyeball is slowly watching, as I'm slowly, I see another me crawling out

604
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,080
 of a clone chamber.

605
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,080
 And then I know that this circle is just gonna keep going.

606
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:11,400
 It'll be infinite torture and pain for all those sickos in the future.

607
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:18,320
 How do I know this is legitimately why I will not submit my DNA for a possible clone experiment?

608
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,880
 Because I don't know how nice they're going to be to me.

609
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,080
 Because think about it.

610
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,840
 If you could clone a dinosaur, what would you do?

611
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
 You'd hunt it.

612
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,760
 You'd clone a T-Rex and you'd blow its brains out and then you'd clone another one.

613
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,360
 We all know that's 100% what we would do.

614
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,360
 Maybe you would clone a Brontosaurus and ride that to school or something like that.

615
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,560
 But then eventually, eventually you're gonna watch an episode of Flintstones and get really

616
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,400
 hungry for some Brontosaurus rib and eat it.

617
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,800
 And then it dies and then it's brought back to life and then you eat it again.

618
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,320
 And anything else we would just hunt.

619
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,120
 If today we met a human from 10,000 years ago, it would not be like Encino Man.

620
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,960
 It would be far, far more depressing.

621
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,120
 They would experiment on him and try to figure out what made him work.

622
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,120
 Maybe they'd let him walk around for a bit and be like, "Oh, oh, is he's walking through

623
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
 Times Square?"

624
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,680
 But eventually, eventually the deep state scientists are like, "You know, we're taking

625
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,720
 him back to the lab and cutting his brain open in like 10 minutes, right?"

626
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,800
 And the other one's like, "Oh yeah, totally."

627
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:25,240
 So I would caution you, if this basically episode is saying, if you've ever thought about being

628
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,240
 cloned in the future, I would caution you because we assume people in the future are

629
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,040
 gonna be better than we are now.

630
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,120
 That's a lot of faith in humans.

631
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,720
 I'm very pro-human.

632
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,480
 We talk about that a lot on this show.

633
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,360
 But even I'm a little suspicious of how we're going to treat people from 10,000 years ago.

634
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,080
 We can barely treat our neighbors decently.

635
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
 Today.

636
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:55,080
 So if you travel 10,000 years in the future, you are not a neighbor.

637
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,080
 You're not a...

638
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,880
 You're not even really a human.

639
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,640
 You're an ancestor.

640
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,080
 I'm just very, very suspicious of how I may get treated 10,000 years from now.

641
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
 That might sound like a bizarre...

642
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,960
 That might sound like a bizarre paranoid belief to have, but I still haven't buried my teeth

643
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
 in my blood.

644
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,080
 I mean, I guess maybe that's a good thing that somewhere out there in the wilderness,

645
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,960
 there is not a box containing pieces of my own body, a flash drive containing some podcast

646
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:32,800
 episodes, and the box itself is very, very heavy because it is weighed down with rocks.

647
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,160
 One for every known human language.

648
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
 There'll only be two.

649
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
 There'll only be two.

650
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:42,520
 I do English and Spanish and then maybe I cling on something like that just to throw

651
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,720
 them off, just to throw those nerds in the future off.

652
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,160
 Luis, I will go ahead and get you eating, get you in the Carbenter copter this episode

653
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,360
 and that's something that I always want to give.

654
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,480
 So stick around Luis, you're gonna be in the Carbenter copter.

655
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,840
 Tomorrow's episode, you get a double header.
