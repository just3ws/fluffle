1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
 More proof that meth makes you go crazy, the resistance movement fails to bring out their

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:15,100
 A game, and the biggest conspiracy that has ever happened on US soil.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,060
 Who killed John Lennon?

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:44,700
 This is the 14 Family Podcast.

5
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,620
 Okay everyone, my name is Jason Carpenter, this is the 14 Family Podcast.

6
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,900
 Podcast about paranormal, conspiracy theory, true crime, and all sorts of other weird news.

7
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,140
 And it's already happened.

8
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,900
 This is episode 4, and I'm barely able to record it.

9
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,100
 It's funny because I thought I could do a weekly podcast, but I know after probably

10
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,980
 about 2 or 3 weeks I'll stop recording.

11
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:19,300
 The neat thing about doing a daily podcast is it's actually more shorter, there's less

12
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,700
 work involved, so it's actually easier to do.

13
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,660
 But man I've just been dealing with some crazy migraines today, and I was like, "I don't

14
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,540
 want to do it, I don't want to do it," and I thought to myself, even though these are

15
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,020
 kind of introducing, you know, introductory test podcasts, you got to do it.

16
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,020
 You got to do it every day.

17
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,020
 You got to do it every day.

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,300
 We got some good stuff coming up though in the future that we'll be talking about as

19
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,300
 we go on.

20
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,460
 So yeah, yeah, I'm going to try to keep the energy level up.

21
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,700
 First off, you know, last episode I was talking about meth use and just how I couldn't stand

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,820
 that I thought it was probably one of the worst drugs that I came into contact with,

23
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,900
 not personally as a user, but just as the people in my life.

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,860
 And here's a little tip, if anyone wants to find anything entertaining online, what

25
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,540
 you can do is you can Google blank conspiracy.

26
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,020
 You can also do it on YouTube.

27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,660
 You can YouTube blank conspiracy.

28
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,620
 And what's going to happen then is that you will be able to find the weirdest conspiracies

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,060
 you probably never would have thought of either, you know, in any sort of way.

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,340
 So earlier today I was looking at some videos and looking at some good topics to talk about,

31
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,340
 and I Googled meth conspiracy.

32
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,580
 Now obviously a lot of the stuff that came up was, you know, charges for conspiracy for

33
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,420
 distribution and things like that.

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:56,100
 But one of the second links that I found was this.

35
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,020
 To prep the sample you're about to hear.

36
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,700
 It's late dusk.

37
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,260
 It's like there's just a little bit of sunlight, but whoever's recording it is completely

38
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,260
 bathed in shadow.

39
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,260
 They seem to be walking around surprise, surprise.

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,260
 It's some sort of trailer park.

41
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,260
 Anyways, here is the video.

42
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,260
 We'll have the audio for you.

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,260
 The title of it is heroin in crystal meth government conspiracy.

44
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,260
 Let's listen to this.

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,260
 It's getting pulled up right here.

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,260
 I hope you guys are doing good.

47
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,260
 I hope you guys are doing good.

48
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
 I just have a really bad headache.

49
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,260
 Yeah, I hope you guys are enjoying the podcast so far.

50
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,260
 I really enjoy doing it.

51
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:42,260
 It's actually getting in like my creative fluids pumping in other parts of my life as

52
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,260
 well.

53
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,260
 So I'm having a lot of fun.

54
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
 It is on me.

55
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260
 I just can't see right now because I'm white.

56
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,260
 I mean it's dark.

57
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,260
 Can you imagine being white and it's dark and you're fucking with blacks and you can't

58
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
 see them and they want to kill you?

59
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:01,260
 So apparently black people, black people have an advantage to being in the dark.

60
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:09,660
 I think that is probably one of the most old school racist things possible that somehow

61
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,260
 their skin color gives them an advantage to dark combat.

62
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,260
 To like night combat.

63
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,260
 Which you know, I mean I don't necessarily see how that's possible.

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,260
 You see whether or not someone's skin, and you know this guy's obviously on meth.

65
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,060
 Whether or not their skin is white or black, you still see like a six foot figure moving

66
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,060
 towards you.

67
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,620
 But anyway, so he's afraid of getting stopped because he's, and you know what's weird is

68
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,820
 like I said you can't really tell what he, what race he is.

69
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,500
 I'm pretty sure he's white, but even that he seems a little unsure of himself, what

70
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,740
 color, what race he is.

71
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,260
 So let's keep listening here.

72
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,140
 Oh yeah, when you're like, that's why the lion don't go into the jungle because he

73
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,140
 get eaten for food.

74
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:02,140
 He's like, "Oh, I'm gonna go get some food."

75
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,140
 And I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna go get some food."

76
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,140
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm gonna go get some food."

77
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,140
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm gonna go get some food."

78
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,140
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm gonna go get some food."

79
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,140
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm gonna go get some food."

80
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,140
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm gonna go get some food."

81
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,140
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm gonna go get some food."

82
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,540
 And it's interesting because anyone who's been around meth addicts for, you know, any

83
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,140
 period of time, the conspiracy theory thing is really big.

84
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,740
 They're super observant.

85
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,380
 So he goes on to explain it as he sees people smoking meth and as he's probably smoking

86
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,740
 meth himself as it starts to turn brown, he perceives that as truth that there's heroin

87
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:50,500
 in the, in the meth as opposed to simply turning brown when they're caught on fire.

88
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,300
 I don't know how he explains a pink hamburger patty turning brown as your cookie man, but

89
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,500
 that, that's where he's at mentally.

90
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,300
 Methanphetamine that people are smoking.

91
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
 Okay.

92
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,300
 I see it turning brown.

93
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,900
 I've seen it before, right?

94
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
 And there's a quick fix.

95
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,980
 What you do is you heat it, right?

96
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,220
 Smoke it and when it's still liquid stop and then from the back end, just put a little

97
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,820
 acid in it and let it go in and pop and it'll get all that shit out.

98
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,900
 Back it out where it came in onto a plate and it'll whiten it and it'll make it so you

99
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,860
 don't get dumb.

100
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,580
 Into our methamphetamine, it's definitely a cultural problem.

101
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,780
 So yes, confirm this guy does smoke methamphetamine.

102
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,020
 And to be honest, I had no idea what he was talking about where he was like emptying the

103
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,220
 pipe and the liquid and put something in it and it pops because I, not a, I don't know.

104
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,780
 But I'm sure if I have any listeners who are a methamphetics, former methamphetics or

105
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,340
 just a recreational meth user, don't do it.

106
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,340
 Don't do it at all.

107
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,380
 But maybe they know more of what's going on.

108
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,380
 We're almost done here.

109
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,380
 And you know what?

110
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:01,260
 It's a conspiracy to make people fucking stupid and basically fucking brain dead.

111
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
 Okay.

112
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,780
 So, you know, and that's always the amazing thing.

113
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,540
 If you type in blank conspiracy, you will find out.

114
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,860
 You'll find something you didn't know before.

115
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,900
 I did not know that the US government was putting heroin into crystal meth, which is funny

116
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,740
 because if you think about it, wouldn't that actually make them less like crazy?

117
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,460
 Would that actually, I don't think they're doing it to make people dumb, as he keeps

118
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,460
 saying.

119
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,500
 But I don't know.

120
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,260
 Maybe it helps them come down from it.

121
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,980
 Meth is terrible.

122
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,580
 Meth is absolutely terrible.

123
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,140
 I remember once I was at a party.

124
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,460
 One of us was throwing a party and a lot of people who were invited were meth users.

125
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,220
 And I knew that, you know, there's a lot of people who weren't meth users, more people

126
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,620
 who weren't meth users, I should say, but there was a few meth users there just because

127
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
 the area we grew up in.

128
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,260
 And one day I'm at this party.

129
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
 I'm sitting there.

130
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,460
 I'm drinking a soda or whatever.

131
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,780
 This young man sits next to me.

132
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,780
 He's probably older than me at the time, but and he goes, Hey, I came up with an invention

133
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,060
 like just out of the blue.

134
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,340
 And I'm like, great, this guy is totally high.

135
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,860
 And he's going to tell me the weirdest invention possible, a meth invention, like something

136
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,620
 you would come up with at three in the morning after being awake for two days.

137
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,260
 He goes, don't you hate it?

138
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,860
 Don't you hate it when you're sucking on a straw and the liquid comes up to the straw

139
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,100
 and you're drinking it and you're drinking that.

140
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,260
 Dude, actually it's funny because I'm totally about to give away his super secret idea.

141
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,300
 But anyways, he's like, when you're drinking a soda and you suck in that liquid up and

142
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,660
 you're drinking it, it tastes really good.

143
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,540
 But then the second you stop sucking, it goes all the way back down the straw.

144
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,980
 And for you to get your next drink, you have to apply all of that pressure again.

145
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,580
 You have to suck all of that pressure again into your, into your mouth.

146
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,860
 So here's the thing.

147
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,860
 Someone who is on meth, that would be the most frustrating thing in the world to be

148
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:08,540
 drinking a soda or whatever and stop drinking and watch that liquid moves down the straw.

149
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,980
 Realizing in just mere seconds, he or she is going to have to re-suck that straw and

150
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,980
 bring that liquid back up.

151
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,420
 That is like a Herculean task.

152
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,340
 That is the level of pushing the boulder up the hill to a meth addict having to, to apply

153
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:29,060
 .008 milliseconds of time to suck liquid up into a straw.

154
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,780
 So anyways, he's like, yeah, doesn't that suck?

155
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,180
 No, no, I've never considered that to be a problem.

156
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,180
 Ever.

157
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,820
 Ever considered that to be a problem.

158
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,020
 But anyways, so he goes, so I came up with an invention.

159
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,980
 I was like, okay.

160
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:51,100
 And then he pulls a dye and then he pulls a blueprint out of his pocket of a drawing,

161
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,500
 drawing of a straw with, so it's like a standard straw.

162
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:03,980
 He basically just drew a line, but maybe about a half inch from the top, there is a circle,

163
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,740
 like a little globe built into the straw.

164
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,700
 So it's like a regular straw with like basically a little reservoir near the tip.

165
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,580
 And he goes, that's the reservoir.

166
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,620
 That way, when you suck up into the straw and you stop drinking, it doesn't go all the

167
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,260
 way back down the straw.

168
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:31,860
 It collects in this little globe here, so your next drink is that much faster.

169
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,980
 You can't, I can't debate that with him.

170
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,340
 Not because I don't think the sciences sound, but the first thing that popped in my head

171
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,300
 was straws cost what, a quarter of a penny to make?

172
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,780
 They're extremely cheap because it's just a plastic tube.

173
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:56,180
 Once you start putting a little ball on the top of it, now straws are going to cost more

174
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
 to make.

175
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,740
 You're going to have to have different packaging for them.

176
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,820
 They're going to be unwieldy at first, like where do you hold the straw at?

177
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:11,340
 These are all thoughts that I'm having instantly after hearing his pitch that I don't think

178
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,780
 he ever considered to him the idea of the sucking was the main thing.

179
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,580
 It was driving him nuts.

180
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,500
 He did tell me though, if anyone wants to rip off this idea, that he mailed himself a

181
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,860
 copy of the diagram and it's dated on the envelope.

182
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,860
 If there's ever any trouble, he can always refer to that earlier envelope.

183
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,020
 Now, here's the thing, that doesn't work.

184
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,700
 That's never, as far as I know, because I used to look into a lot of trademark law.

185
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,540
 I used to have to deal with trademarks and copyrights and all that stuff from other businesses

186
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
 that I had.

187
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,980
 That doesn't really hold up in court.

188
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,540
 You have to go to the trademark office.

189
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,620
 You have to have it go to, you know, I do the trademark, do the copyright, the mailing

190
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,980
 yourself the form, it's not really going to hold up in court.

191
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,540
 That being said, I doubt that he, one, still has the original envelope that he sent himself,

192
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,700
 two, that he's still complaining about making the straw he could be, and three, that anyone

193
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,500
 would rip that idea off in the first place because it just, on a financial level, it

194
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,180
 doesn't make any sense.

195
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,060
 But anyways, so, you know, you have these interactions with people who are using meth,

196
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,460
 and they're just, it's almost like they're in their own world, because kind of they are,

197
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,340
 you know, they're addicted to a drug and that kind of becomes the main thing.

198
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:37,660
 I don't want to rag on meth users all the time, but I do see a lot across contamination

199
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,620
 between meth use in particular and conspiracy theories.

200
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:49,260
 You get meth is a big one, marijuana, obviously, is a big one with conspiracy theories.

201
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,460
 Those are the most likely.

202
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,020
 A cocaine maybe a little bit.

203
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,140
 You don't get many heroin, people who are heroin addicts engaging in conspiracy theories,

204
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,500
 their main thing is just getting more of the opioids.

205
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:11,660
 So, so I mean, you know, it does, maybe that is a legit conspiracy, the government is,

206
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,020
 no, it's not a legit conspiracy, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt.

207
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,460
 If the government was putting other drugs into the meth supply, heroin may, maybe not

208
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,340
 necessarily make them dumber, but to calm them down, it's, it's possible.

209
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,740
 Super unlikely.

210
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,060
 The guys probably just burn and stuff and it's brown.

211
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,220
 I can just imagine though being this guy's friend and every time I'm trying to smoke

212
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,740
 meth, he's like, let me check it out.

213
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
 Let me check it out.

214
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
 Let me see if it's brown.

215
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,980
 Let me see if it's brown every, every time he would have to be the worst person to share

216
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,260
 a meth with.

217
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,580
 And that's a really low bar.

218
00:13:48,580 --> 00:14:00,020
 So this one, this next story, it's just so, it's just so bad, not bad as in.

219
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,860
 Not bad as in a subject matter wise, but here's the thing.

220
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,140
 This is, we're getting a little political here and I know people are very divided in

221
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,140
 here.

222
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,060
 You have people who are Republican and people who are Democrat.

223
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,580
 You have people who are pro-Trump and you people have anti-Trump and you have that in,

224
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,500
 in the Republicans, you have people who are pro and people anti-Trump.

225
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,100
 And then we have the resistance movement.

226
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,060
 I've no problem with any of that.

227
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,380
 As long as it's not leading to people actually being assaulted or attacked, you can have your

228
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,140
 political views, but if you're out there beating people up, you can't be doing that.

229
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,620
 That's a totally different form of governments of, and it's not dialogue and it's terrible.

230
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,900
 However, if you are going to protest things, do it in a quality manner.

231
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,580
 Do it, do it with a little, be proud of your work.

232
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,340
 Don't just throw stuff together like this podcast, which I literally just record for

233
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,380
 20 minutes, edit for 20 minutes, throw it online.

234
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,380
 I love it.

235
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,380
 It's great.

236
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,780
 I kind of wanted that access television vibe.

237
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,660
 But anyways, so I came across this today.

238
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,860
 It is a group called Pussy Scouts.

239
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,980
 And I just haven't been able to really suss out where they are.

240
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,820
 To be honest, it might actually be a troll.

241
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,500
 The thing is, is that we have come so far that you can no longer tell if someone's being

242
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,380
 actually sincere in their beliefs or if they're trolling because it all seems the same.

243
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,860
 This is a group called Pussy Scouts.

244
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,860
 You can go to pussyscouts.com.

245
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
 It's their website.

246
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,380
 I found this on YouTube, but it is a music video.

247
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,740
 It's a rap song with, because you're not going to be able to see it so play the audio, but

248
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,180
 it's only a minute long.

249
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,540
 I'm not going to make you do it too much, but it's a rap song with four little girl

250
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,660
 scouts rapping about President Trump.

251
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,620
 Anti, that obviously should be with the Pussy.

252
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,500
 Sexual Soulter, you know, Muslim bands, racist things like that.

253
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,540
 They can make those valid points, but just do it well.

254
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,220
 I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
