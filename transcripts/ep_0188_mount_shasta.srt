1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A terrifying test that you can have done for less than $100.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,500
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy theory that there are Lemurians living inside Mount Shasta.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,300
 Did an advanced race leave their continent only to find themselves within the California mountain?

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,700
 And more importantly, is that information being covered up by the Smithsonian today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:32,200
 [Music]

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,700
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Just a quick reminder, you want to support the show?

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,700
 We have merch. You'll see the link in the show notes for our merch store.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,700
 Also, tell your friends, tell your family if you really like the show.

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,200
 Get the word out. I got flyers you can print out as well. Those links are in the show notes as well.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,500
 So let's go ahead with that little pitch aside. Let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,700
 Now, the first thing we're going to talk about is from the conspiracy iceberg.

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,700
 And it's one of those that does seem like it's just a jumble of words, but it was quite easy to find.

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,700
 It's because it's such a specific phrase. We're going to be looking at something called...

15
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,700
 This is going to sound technical, but we're going to dive into it, but not literally because it's kind of gross.

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,700
 But we're looking at the Hamster Zona Free Ovem Test. And I could probably say that better.

17
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,700
 The Hamster Zona Free Ovem Test.

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:39,700
 What this... Okay, here's the thing. For as long as I can remember, I think it's been pretty common knowledge that animals of different species cannot mate.

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:46,700
 Like, that's just something like you can't... I think you kind of realize that pretty early on because you hear stories about like Minotaur and stuff like that.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,700
 And you're like, "Oh, that's crazy." And people go, "That won't actually work. You can't bang a bull and give birth to a baby with a bull's head."

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,700
 You're like, "Oh, yeah, I guess that kind of makes sense." Like, that seems to be pretty like Biology 101.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,700
 That seems to be like Biology 1. You're taught that before you even know about biology.

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,700
 It's probably to stop you from banging a dog.

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,700
 So, it's always been common knowledge. But... this is where it gets weird.

25
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,700
 There's a ton of research papers on this. This is a very, very common test that they do.

26
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,700
 It's to test fertility in Min. Test the sperm. Whether or not your sperm can inseminate an egg.

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,700
 And you go, "What does that have to do with hamsters?" Well, yeah. That's where it gets weird.

28
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,700
 So, you just can't have a dude try to inseminate a bunch of human eggs, right?

29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,700
 And then you have a bunch of babies, and the guy's like, "I just wanted to know if I was fertile. Now I got 10 babies."

30
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,700
 So, scientists go, "Okay, what if we used hamster eggs?" And of course, the other scientist is like,

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,700
 "I remember learning in middle school. That was impossible." The first scientist looks at him and goes,

32
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,700
 "Forget everything you learned in middle school." And the guy like automatically forgets his division table.

33
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,700
 And he can't be a scientist anymore. So, the first scientist says goodbye to his now idiotic former pal

34
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,700
 and explains the scenario to us. This is what it is. If you take a hamster, and really this works with any mammal,

35
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:16,700
 if you take a mammalian egg and you remove the zona pellicida, it can be any other mammal sperm can't enter that egg.

36
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,700
 The little zona, so this is the, that's why it's called hamster zona free ovum test.

37
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:31,700
 If you take an egg of any mammal and remove that zona, any sperm of any other mammal can actually penetrate that egg.

38
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,700
 Now, the scientists say, they go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa." It doesn't mean that you can have a baby with a hamster.

39
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:45,700
 That's not what we're saying. We're saying, scientists say, the sperm enters the hamster egg, and then he immediately breaks down.

40
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:51,700
 So they go, "See, you can't bang a hamster and have a hamster baby." But that's not entirely true.

41
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,700
 This is where it gets kind of weird. So the reason why they do this test is to test male fertility.

42
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,700
 So first, this is all sorts of creepiness. First, and this is very, very common. It's like a procedure cost 55 bucks.

43
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,700
 You take a hamster and you treat it with something called pregnant mare's serum. Now, I know what a pregnant mare is,

44
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,700
 but I have no idea what the serum is. Do they like squish? Do they like take a mare, a pregnant mare, and like squeeze them like a sponge

45
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:25,700
 and the juice that drops out of her? You inject into a hamster? You just kind of rub the hamster on the side of the horse to get it all married?

46
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:33,700
 Who knows? I don't. But you inject this, or it's treated, sorry, with pregnant mare's serum.

47
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:40,700
 It sounds like something like a witch would need for a pot. And so, mass produces eggs. So you have a hamster that'll produce 40 eggs.

48
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:48,700
 Then you take the human semen and you get it all over the eggs. So imagine that you never mind. I don't need to do an analogy for that.

49
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:57,700
 I think you're very, very clear on what I mean. And then they look to see how many of the sperm, spermatosis, are able to penetrate.

50
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,700
 So, and they're like, if it can penetrate like X amount of eggs, then that means you're fertile. If it can't, then it means that you're infertile.

51
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:11,700
 And there have been debates over whether or not the test is effective and actually treating or check, it doesn't treat it, but to actually check if someone's infertile.

52
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:20,700
 But scientists say, listen, the little sperm goes into the egg, you know all, you know the birds and the bees. But then after one cell division, it completely breaks down.

53
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:29,700
 However, there's controversy about that because other scientists say that's not true. What we have to do is by the time it splits into two, we shut the experiment down.

54
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:38,700
 And other scientists go, that may not be accurate. There's actually a term for these things. They're called humesters.

55
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:50,700
 Once the egg, I don't think it's a scientific term, but once the sperm enters the egg, once, even if it divides once, in a lot of people's minds, that is life.

56
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,700
 Life begins at conception, it was conceived, it died afterwards, but a lot of people consider that life.

57
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,700
 And most of the papers on this are scientific and they're behind like paywalls and stuff like that.

58
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,700
 And even the ones that aren't behind paywalls, I don't understand what they're talking about.

59
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:15,700
 So I had to go off a, so a lot of my knowledge came in a very, very brief overview of a Wikipedia page. It's maybe like eight paragraphs or something like that.

60
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,700
 And then I followed a couple of the links, but again, like it was written for people smarter than me.

61
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:35,700
 But an interesting point in that Wikipedia article was saying, this can also be done in reverse, where you take a human female's egg, remove the zona pellicita, and inject that with another mammal.

62
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:45,700
 They also state that they've never impl-- they would have to then implant it in a uterus to nurture it, and that's never been done.

63
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,700
 And I read that and I said, that is 100% a lie. Somebody's done that somewhere.

64
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,700
 Somebody has taken it to the next step.

65
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:06,700
 If the technology exists to do this, to remove the zona part, and put in another breed, another species into that, somebody's put that into a uterus just to see what happens.

66
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,700
 I do not believe that that has never been done, ever.

67
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,700
 So is it possible to create a half human, half animal hybrid?

68
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:24,700
 According to Science right now that they will admit to, it is for a split second possible to create a human animal hybrid.

69
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:33,700
 But the next time someone tells me the story of the Minotaur and then tries telling me that that's impossible, I'm going to tell them about this.

70
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,700
 This vague conspiracy from the conspiracy theory iceberg, and say, is it impossible?

71
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,700
 I don't know, man. Somebody's done it. Somebody's put it in a uterus just to see what would happen.

72
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,700
 They're like looking at the female, at the other female scientists, they're like, hey, what are you doing this weekend?

73
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,700
 She's like, nope, I'm not putting a humster up in me.

74
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,700
 So, but yeah, somebody's done it. Somebody's done it. Creepy though.

75
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
 I never thought it was even possible.

76
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,700
 But apparently it is, and they use it as a fertility test.

77
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,700
 And if it's that common, then the CIA has some sort of like half human, half horse guy running around the Bureau.

78
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,700
 I mean, come on, why wouldn't you? If the technology's there, why wouldn't you?

79
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,700
 Sorry, I probably just outed one of CIA's greatest secrets. C-Biscuit was an undercover agent.

80
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,700
 Okay, so the next story we're going to talk about here is really interesting.

81
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,700
 Now, I've touched on it a couple of times before, and I wanted to get in one more example of this, and then I'm going to lay it out.

82
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,700
 Because this is a conspiracy theory I've actually come around on. Kind of odd.

83
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,700
 Again, I don't really know how to feel about it, but it's an interesting story.

84
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:48,700
 The year is 1904. The place, Stockton, California.

85
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,700
 Modern-day hellhole, I think it's the murder capital of California.

86
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,700
 I may be, that may be Modesto or Fresno or any of the other cities in that state.

87
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,700
 There are all the murder capitals of the state. It's quite odd.

88
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,700
 But back then, Stockton was just a city. Didn't have a bunch of guns.

89
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,700
 Well, they probably had guns, but not a bunch of murders.

90
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:17,700
 And so, in the city of Stockton, in the very peaceful, tranquil city of Stockton, everyone's like, "Man, this area is great. I can walk around at 3 in the morning. This is awesome."

91
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,700
 In the city of Stockton, a man shows up into town.

92
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,700
 Almost like a music man type guy. Like, not like he literally has an accordion.

93
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,700
 He might have, but I mean, like, he comes into town and he has to tell the people of Stockton.

94
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,700
 He's like, "First off, I'm very shocked no one tried to shoot me on my way in this town."

95
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
 And they're like, "What are you talking about?" He's like, "I just give it 100 years."

96
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,700
 So he goes, "Secondly, let me tell you a story about Mount Shasta."

97
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,700
 This man's name was J.C. Brown. And he was an older man. He was like, in his 70s.

98
00:09:51,700 --> 00:10:05,700
 And he said, "I have found a passage into the mountain. And inside the mountain, I found the most amazing things. I found riches beyond imagination.

99
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,700
 More gold than we could ever cart out.

100
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:17,700
 Mummies, 10 foot tall mummies with gold and spears, and not just made of any regular gold.

101
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,700
 With spears, you could bend. And then they would morph back into shape.

102
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:29,700
 And everyone's like, "What? What?" Nobody knows what the word "morph" means back then, but he then shows him a clip from Terminator 2 and they get it.

103
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,700
 And he goes, "Not only that, I found these golden tablets with an indecipherable language.

104
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,700
 I found what I presumed to be the king and queen of this underground city.

105
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,700
 They were dressed more magnificently than the other mummies.

106
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,700
 I just need your help getting all this stuff out."

107
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:57,700
 This story took the town by storm. And he ended up getting 80 volunteers to come out.

108
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,700
 And he would give these weekly speeches talking about the great things he found under there.

109
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,700
 Now he did say, "I'm not going to tell you guys where it's at. I'm going to go with you guys."

110
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,700
 And I actually hid it. I hid the opening that I found.

111
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,700
 But trust me, we are going to go into Mount Shasta. And we are going to come out millionaires.

112
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,700
 Mount Shasta has a long history of being connected to paranormal activity.

113
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,700
 Now, some people say that it's a hub of UFO activity.

114
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:36,700
 Natives in the area said it was like a spiritual place that they had seen. Ghosts, I mean spirits, ancestors, stuff like that.

115
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
 They considered it sacred.

116
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:46,700
 The story of Mount Shasta really took off, though, when a guy wrote a book called "A Dweller of Two Planets."

117
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,700
 There was this author named Frederick Spencer Oliver. And he wrote this book.

118
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,700
 Now it was a two-tube. Anyone who read it goes, "This is a fictional book."

119
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,700
 It's a story about this guy who comes from Lemuria. And we'll get into that in a second.

120
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,700
 But he comes from Lemuria. And he goes through this karmic journey of reincarnation and struggle and stuff like that.

121
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,700
 And him and his race end up in Mount Shasta.

122
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,700
 Now, they were kind of spread out in the area, but in Mount Shasta there was a city called Telos.

123
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,700
 Now, he wrote this book and people were like, "Oh, it's kind of interesting. Novel."

124
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:25,700
 But Oliver swore that it wasn't fake. That he wrote it through the process of automatic writing.

125
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:32,700
 So something would take over his body and write down words. He also said he would have visions of it and he would write down the story.

126
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,700
 Now, what he said in this book was he talked about Atlantis and Lemuria.

127
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,700
 They've both--it's those kinds--basically Lemuria was the Atlantis of the Pacific.

128
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,700
 And Atlantis was the Lemuria of the Atlantic.

129
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:57,700
 So in this book, though, he says that this race of people, interdiscons advanced race of people, live in the middle of Mount Shasta.

130
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,700
 And he says he was getting these messages from somewhere else, automatic writing, visions, stuff like that.

131
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:10,700
 And in this book, the races advanced. They have stuff like anti-gravity aircraft, they have anti-gravity submarines, which is kind of weird.

132
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,700
 Maybe they just had regular submarines and it was just poorly written.

133
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,700
 They had television sets, they had wireless phones, they had air conditioners, they had high-speed railways.

134
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,700
 And this advanced society existed in this mountain.

135
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,700
 And this book was written in 1896.

136
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,700
 Now, of course, Jules Verne--there was science fiction just starting off in the late 1800s.

137
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,700
 And Jules Verne would write about spacecraft and stuff like that.

138
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
 And HD Wells and things like that.

139
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,700
 I think Jules Verne did have spacecraft. I think he just had blimps, which worried the height of technology back then.

140
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,700
 But anyways, you know what's weird I was thinking about today?

141
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,700
 Can you imagine a world without radio waves?

142
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,700
 Like, you figure I'm like--the radio really is magic.

143
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,700
 The fact that I can turn on a--I was thinking about if I traveled back in time, and I went to like night, Southern Roundtable days.

144
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,700
 First thing I would do is try to invent a radio.

145
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,700
 Now, the problem with that is I don't know how to build radio today, but that would be the highest level of magic.

146
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,700
 Not like it's play and music, but that I could talk to the king when I'm like out on patrol.

147
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:21,700
 It's bizarre to think that like in World War I, they're like, "Here, run this cable across a no-man's land and give it to this other dude."

148
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,700
 So I can talk to him, and then like 20 years later, they just like pick up a box and go, "Hello?"

149
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
 Super bizarre.

150
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:35,700
 The radio, the ability to be able to talk to someone across distances is one of the most magical things I think humanity's ever done.

151
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:42,700
 A buggy is just a horse with wheels, and a car is just a wagon without a horse.

152
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,700
 The radio is just like magic. You can talk across the planet.

153
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:52,700
 But anyway, so there was a level of technology. Like there were science fiction writers who were predicting stuff.

154
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,700
 But that might lend a little credence to the fact that he may have been getting these visions from somewhere else.

155
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
 Now, he never got to enjoy the fruits of his labor. He died before the book was published.

156
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,700
 He died five years before it was published. His mom released it.

157
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:11,700
 But that book, The Jeweler of Two Worlds, created basically was a huge inspiration on New Age movement,

158
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:18,700
 ascended masters movement, and really championed the idea of Lemurians and Atlantis,

159
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,700
 and the fact that Lemurians lived in Manchester.

160
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:31,700
 So there was already a lot, and it's spot, I mean, that book really did a lot for the stuff we know about Atlantis Lemuria today.

161
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
 A lot of it came from that book.

162
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:38,700
 Now, the idea is that he wrote this book and it became super, super popular.

163
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:45,700
 The book was published in 1905, but you got to remember that it was in 1904 that JC Brown showed up in Stockton.

164
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,700
 So he predated the publishing of that book.

165
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,700
 And I'll tell you this right now. JC Brown was a real person. He was investigated by the police.

166
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,700
 People were looking into him. There was news articles on him. There was a lot of contemporary evidence.

167
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,700
 So that is, JC Brown existed. Probably gave a little bit of a spoiler with the police investigating him, but he actually existed.

168
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,700
 So a year before this book that was published that talked about Lemurians in Manchester,

169
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,700
 he was already telling people there is a city inside the mountain.

170
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:25,700
 Now, JC Brown gets 80 people together and he's like, "We are going," after a couple months, he says, "We are going to go into Manchester."

171
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
 He has the expedition planned.

172
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,700
 And everyone shows up to the appointed meeting spot.

173
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,700
 They're all going to get in their cars or buggies or dirgeables or whatever they're using to take.

174
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,700
 And everyone shows up except for one person, JC Brown.

175
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,700
 Never seen again. Could never find him.

176
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,700
 Now, there's been some retcons, because I looked into this a lot.

177
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:57,700
 There's been some retcons that some of the people are saying that he took something out of the cave and all of these bad fortunes.

178
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,700
 Dog died of AIDS and his mom fell off a bridge into a ladder and then fell off the ladder.

179
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:09,700
 There was a lot of ridiculous curse stuff that I only found on one website and it really felt like a retcon.

180
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:09,700
 They're like, "Maybe, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, e

181
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:18,700
 They're like, "Maybe, eee, you feel bad luck." And none of the other articles talked like that. The rest of them are just like, "Here's a dude who disappeared."

182
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:25,700
 Now, he was real because the newspaper, and you can see a copy of the newspaper online, made fun of him.

183
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:31,700
 They're like, "Ugh, this guy had been talking about this crazy gold adventure. He went missing. He skipped town."

184
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
 Isn't that funny, people of Stockton?

185
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:40,700
 People of Stockton are like, "Man, this is the worst thing that'll ever happen to our city." It's us getting hoodwinked, right?

186
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:49,700
 The idea is this, was that when I was reading the articles, I was thinking, "Oh, he probably got a bunch of investors to give him money and then he skipped town."

187
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,700
 That wasn't true. He was investigating it because everyone was like, "Where'd this guy go?"

188
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,700
 He filed a missing persons report. The police came out and started looking for him and they go, "Well, maybe he was just a scam artist."

189
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,700
 People were like, "He asked for no money. No one gave him money. He just needed volunteers. He just disappeared."

190
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
 The police were like, "That is kind of weird."

191
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,700
 If he had said, "Everyone give me 10 bucks," which back then, he's like, "Everyone give me 10 cents."

192
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,700
 They're like, "Oh, I don't know. I'll have to get a loan from the bank." He didn't do that. He just disappeared.

193
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,700
 The only man who knew the entrance to this tunnel with these 10-foot mummies disappeared.

194
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,700
 To this day, there are still theories that Lemurians live in Mount Shasta.

195
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:35,700
 People in the towns around them say, "Oh, we see the Lemurians in town. They're these tall white people with white robes and they're so gentle and peaceful and new-agey and all that stuff."

196
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,700
 And sometimes people see them walking around the mountains and that may or may not be true.

197
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,700
 I would assume if you were a super advanced race, one, you'd have more advanced technology than a robe.

198
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,700
 Like you'd have a holographic hoodie or something like that.

199
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,700
 And two, if you were a super advanced race, why would you go to town to buy a squash?

200
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,700
 There may or may not be Lemurians inside Mount Shasta.

201
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
 Most likely.

202
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,700
 Oh, you want to know something weird too? I don't want to keep going off on tangents.

203
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,700
 You know why they call it Lemuria? It's named after Lemurs.

204
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,700
 Because the guy who named it says there had to have been away from Lemurs to get from India to Madagascar.

205
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,700
 But India's Lemurs aren't in the Middle East or Africa.

206
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,700
 Therefore, there must have been a giant continent in between there.

207
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
 And I'm going to call it Lemuria.

208
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
 And everyone else is like, "What are you talking about?"

209
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,700
 It turns out it's because of like, Pangea, the supercontinent breaking up and stuff like that.

210
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
 But he came up with that theory way before.

211
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,700
 He's like, "There's no way you could have a similar species on this island and then on this other continent.

212
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
 It's impossible."

213
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,700
 And then they go, "Well, you know what? Supercontinents you could."

214
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
 And if it was already dead, you can't know rebuttal to that.

215
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,700
 But anyways, that's why it's called Lemuria. It's named after Lemurs. That's ridiculous.

216
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,700
 At least it lances sounds like totally badass, but the point is this.

217
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,700
 So there may or may not be Lemurians in Mount Shasta.

218
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,700
 Most likely not, but I mean, most likely not, but possibly, possibly.

219
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,700
 That's not the way I want to conclude this episode.

220
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,700
 We've talked now about giant mummies multiple times.

221
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,700
 Actually, twice on one episode, I think I've dropped a couple references throughout the run of the show.

222
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
 And then once tonight.

223
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,700
 On the episode about the Death Valley men.

224
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,700
 I forgot the name of it, but it was the Underground Cities in Death Valley.

225
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
 My memory is really getting shot with this show.

226
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
 They had two groups of people.

227
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:33,700
 You had two prospectors who found an underground cavern full of giant mummies, full of gold, and they both disappeared.

228
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,700
 And then you had a third guy who, like years later, who said he knew where the entrance was and then he disappeared.

229
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:45,700
 And then you had always a reputable source, Charlie Manson, in the same area in Death Valley,

230
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,700
 where he knew an entrance into the earth where there was a bunch of radical people down there and grooving.

231
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,700
 You could drink the milk and honey river and all that stuff.

232
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
 And he got caught.

233
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:01,700
 But both of those areas where the prospectors and the businessman were, and then Charlie Manson's little place,

234
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
 are both now controlled by the government.

235
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
 You can't go there.

236
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,700
 One's a weapons testing range.

237
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,700
 The other one's considered a totally off-limit nature preserve.

238
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,700
 It's full of fish that are like 10,000 years old.

239
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
 Or that's not true.

240
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,700
 It's full of fish that haven't gotten outside of the pond in 10,000 years.

241
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
 Huge difference.

242
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,700
 They don't want anyone falling in the water and killing off a bunch of fish that would otherwise become extinct.

243
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
 That's the story.

244
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,700
 So, I always thought that was weird, that the two places where apparently portals to these underground cities are now controlled by the government.

245
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
 And they're both completely off-limits.

246
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
 It's not like it's Yellowstone or something like that.

247
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
 But here's the thing.

248
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,700
 You find these giants, you find these passageways, and things like that.

249
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,700
 There has been a conspiracy theory for a long time that I've always scoffed at.

250
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,700
 I thought it was as funny as there's a conspiracy theory on the conspiracy iceberg that I want to cover,

251
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
 but I can't find anything on it.

252
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
 It's that Tupac was always a hologram.

253
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
 He was always a hologram.

254
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
 He never existed.

255
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
 Find that hilarious.

256
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:04,700
 But one of the things I thought equally hilarious was Smithsonian destroys giant skeletons.

257
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:11,700
 The idea of a Smithsonian scientist wielding a sledgehammer in a lab coat, I just find hilarious.

258
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,700
 And I've seen that conspiracy going around for a long time.

259
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:22,700
 The Smithsonian spent its time destroying giant skeletons in the late 1800s, early 1900s.

260
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,700
 And I'm thinking, why would the Smithsonian walk around smashing skeletons?

261
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:33,700
 Or more sinisterly, making people disappear who had found passageways underground.

262
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,700
 It was always a conspiracy theory that I thought was fairly ridiculous.

263
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,700
 And you can find news articles from back in the day saying this giant skeleton was found in Texas.

264
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
 Archaeologists find this giant skeleton in Mexico.

265
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
 Look at, here's a picture of a giant skull.

266
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
 Here's a picture of a human size skull.

267
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:55,700
 Now, the late 1800s, early 1900s, journalism was notorious for yellow journalism.

268
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,700
 It started a war.

269
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,700
 It got so bad.

270
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
 They would just make stuff up in the newspaper.

271
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,700
 William Randolph Hearst would just be like, "I just print it.

272
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
 I don't care."

273
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,700
 So a lot of those sources are hard to trust.

274
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,700
 But the conspiracy theory has been around for a long time.

275
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,700
 The conspiracy theory is that these giant skeletons were found.

276
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
 The Smithsonian was destroying them.

277
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,700
 One of the best pieces of evidence, and this is the thing,

278
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,700
 I don't think that's true that they're finding these giant skeletons and the Smithsonian is destroying them.

279
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:36,700
 But one of the best pieces of evidence for that conspiracy theory is a true document known as the Powell Doctrine.

280
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
 Super, super brief overview.

281
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:46,700
 In 1879, John Wesley Powell was named the very first director of the Bureau of Ethnology.

282
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:54,700
 Basically, not ethics, but ethno stuff, like anthropology, races, stuff like that.

283
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:01,700
 And he worked with the Smithsonian to the point that he basically directed their ethno-knowledge board.

284
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
 And he had a classification system.

285
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:12,700
 He came up with basically three levels of races, three levels of civilizations or societies, I guess would be a better term.

286
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,700
 You have savage, which is the lowest race. They're basically barely human.

287
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,700
 You have barbaric, and those people are human.

288
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,700
 They would be equivalent of the barbarians that sacked Rome.

289
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,700
 Basically, like, they have some sort of culture, but they're also very vicious people.

290
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
 And then you have civilized.

291
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,700
 So he saw the Europeans as civilized, and he saw the Native Americans as barbaric.

292
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,700
 He felt that they were cultured in their own way, and they did have like writings and stuff like that.

293
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,700
 But the Powell Doctrine was very, very, very specific on one thing.

294
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:55,700
 So let me read this to you. This is from his paper on limitations to the use of some anthropological data.

295
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:05,700
 In the monuments of antiquity found throughout North America, in camp and village sites, graves, mounds, ruins, and scattered works of art,

296
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:13,700
 the origin and development of art and savage and barbaric life may be satisfactorily studied.

297
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:22,700
 Incidentally to, hints of customs may be discovered, but outside of this, the discoveries made have often been illegitimately used,

298
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:32,700
 especially for the purpose of connecting the tribes of North America with people or so-called races of antiquity and other portions of the world.

299
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:39,700
 A brief review of some conclusions that must be accepted in the present status of the science will exhibit the futility of these attempts.

300
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:49,700
 Basically what he's saying here is that the natives in North America are the natives in North America,

301
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:57,700
 and you have ancient tribes in other parts of the world, Europe, India, Africa, things like that.

302
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:06,700
 If you find evidence of mound building in Native America, and then you find evidence of mound building in other parts of the world,

303
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:18,700
 that's only because humans like to build mounds. It does not mean under any circumstances that the Native Americans had any contact with any civilization older than the Native Americans,

304
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,700
 and they did not come from another continent at all.

305
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:28,700
 When you go to, he specifically talks about the mounds and he's talking about the Pueblos in Southwest United States going into Mexico.

306
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:36,700
 He said, "You find those Pueblos, and there are people living in them now who are at a less technologically advanced than the people who built the Pueblos."

307
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:45,700
 That simply means that there was someone there that came from there that built it, and then people just forgot how to build them.

308
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,700
 No outside interference at all.

309
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:59,700
 These are the civilizations that exist now, and we will not take under any consideration that the Native Americans had contact with people from other continents.

310
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:06,700
 We don't know, and then he goes into detail, he goes, "We don't know where humanity came from. We don't know what continent we started on."

311
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,700
 Again, he's writing this like 1876, but he goes, "We don't know where we came from. We don't know what continent we started on.

312
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:18,700
 We don't know how we spread across the globe, so until we know those things, we have to treat everything separately."

313
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,700
 Now his defendant, that might you go, "Oh, so?"

314
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:30,700
 Here's the thing, the Smithsonian to this day still uses a pal doctrine, and what it says is that when, and you, we've run across this for years,

315
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:37,700
 they'll find Viking inscriptions on the East Coast, and they're like, "Oh, look it, it's from 1300 years ago.

316
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:44,700
 This predates Columbus." And the scientific community goes, "Nope, no it doesn't. That was just a chicken scratch, and it looks like Norse symbols."

317
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:50,700
 And people will be like, "You know, I felt, it's weird. There's this tribe, we covered this in another story too.

318
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,700
 There's a tribe of Native Americans in the Southwest, and sometimes the kids are born with blonde hair and blue eyes,

319
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:02,700
 and they talk about a Viking ship, a ship with a dragon on its head, crashing, and they're like, "Nope, never happened. It's a coincidence."

320
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:09,700
 That is part of the scientific community still follows the pal doctrine, and it's weird because those are so minor things.

321
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:18,700
 Who cares if the Vikings showed up before Christopher Columbus? And pal specifically says, "Nobody showed up before Christopher Columbus. Nobody."

322
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:28,700
 That's when the first Europeans came over. So this, it might sound like a little thing, but it's actually really big on how the scientific community

323
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:35,700
 and the Smithsonian specifically views earlier exploration of the United States.

324
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:48,700
 The pal doctrine put forth 100+ years of how the Smithsonian views Native Americans vis-a-vis European contact, and it didn't happen.

325
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:56,700
 It just didn't happen. So this is where we go back to the Giants. This is where we go back to Mount Shasta.

326
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,700
 Basically, what do all of those stories have about the people going underground and finding these caves?

327
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:13,700
 They all have proof of advanced civilizations existing either before the Natives were in the area or at the same time the Natives were in the area.

328
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:21,700
 And if that fact is true, and the Smithsonian believes that it cannot be true,

329
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:29,700
 one of the leading scientific organizations in the United States believes that it cannot be true, they're faced with a choice.

330
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:42,700
 They can either rewrite 100 years of the pal doctrine, they can rethink the past 100+ years of their thinking that there was no contact between the civilized Europeans and the barbaric Natives,

331
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:54,700
 and that any writing, any customs, any building that is the same on the Native soil that is in any other part of the world is just a coincidence.

332
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,700
 Or they destroy it.

333
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:06,700
 Now, again, I don't think the Smithsonian as an organization is destroying giant skeletons

334
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:17,700
 and covering up proof that there were more advanced races either before the Natives or during the time of the Natives, or really more advanced races than anyone else on Earth.

335
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,700
 But just because as an organization they may not be covering up that information,

336
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:38,700
 it doesn't mean that individuals so loyal to Powell and his doctrine and the belief that he put forth wouldn't take it upon themselves to destroy that information.

337
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:50,700
 And what's even more odd is that some people have pointed out that the Powell doctrine, and in speeches and writings Powell later made,

338
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,700
 it may not have been his decision to put that forth.

339
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:02,700
 He may have been told or ordered to by someone higher up than him to make that claim.

340
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:13,700
 If that's the case, if the government actually set out to cover up the existence of advanced races in the United States from everyone

341
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,700
 and ordered leaders of the scientific community to be complicit in that cover-up,

342
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:26,700
 we have a lot more things to worry about than a few broken giant skeletons.
