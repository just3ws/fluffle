1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
 If you stumbled across a human sacrifice in progress, would you try to stop it or would

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,760
 you join in?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,640
 You know what Jason, that's not a question.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,640
 There's only one answer to it or is there?

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,960
 We're going to take a look at a little thought experiment and then we travel into cyberspace.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,200
 Are you ready to fight for humanity's future?

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,520
 Are you ready to take on the Chrome Lords?

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:41,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,520
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,840
 It's almost Christmas dude.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,280
 That's insane and I will be doing a Christmas livestream.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,640
 Like Jason, you should just do a livestream that's not during a world holiday that we

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,120
 can actually participate in.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,720
 I am looking at doing more regular livestreams, not during holidays where you're incredibly

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,800
 busy.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,160
 I am trying to etch out a little bit of time but we'll get into that.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
 We'll see.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,240
 I would really like to do more livestreams but until then let's go ahead and get started

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,280
 with this episode walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our Thanksgiving

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,960
 livestream contributors who sent a very, very, very generous donation.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,960
 So give it up for ChimeChile.

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
 Woohoo!

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
 Yeah!

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,520
 Alright, come on in to Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
 ChimeChile.

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,320
 ChimeChile, longtime contributor, longtime very generous contributor to Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,120
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,680
 If you guys can't support the show financially, it's totally fine.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,280
 It honestly is.

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,560
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,720
 That helps out so much.

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
 It really, really does.

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,600
 If you get any value from the show, just spread the word.

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,240
 How much you enjoy Dead Rabbit Radio.

38
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,320
 ChimeChile.

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,040
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
 Jason Jalopy.

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,320
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,600
 Drive us all the way out to the middle of the woods.

43
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,520
 And this is a really interesting thought experiment.

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,680
 I came across this the other day.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,920
 I was on the X board and someone posted something about being a willing human sacrifice and

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,560
 there was kind of this conversation going on about what that would entail.

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,920
 To be clear, this person wasn't saying they wanted to sacrifice themselves.

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,120
 It wasn't some weird masochistic thing.

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
 There's kind of a conversation about it and you would see people post things like, "Well,

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,680
 a willing human sacrifice generates more power than if you broke into someone's house and

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,560
 dragged out a teenage girl kicking and screaming and sacrificed her."

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,000
 You would get more power for whatever ritual you're trying to do if the participant was

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 willing.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,360
 That's the kind of citation needed, right?

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,720
 I'm not for sure if that's the case.

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,640
 It would seem...

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,840
 I would think if it was dark magic, right?

58
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,080
 If it was dark magic, it would be the inverse.

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,320
 Because it would want more of the suffering.

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,440
 That's the whole thing about it, like the adrenochrome.

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,280
 The adrenochrome theory is that it's the suffering that creates the adrenochrome that

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
 makes it so powerful.

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,960
 If someone's like, "Oh, dude, I would totally like for you to pull out my adrenal gland.

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,440
 I'll be super scared.

65
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
 I swear.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
 Do it."

67
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,880
 It wouldn't work as well as if you did it against someone's will.

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,360
 But who knows, right?

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
 Who knows?

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,200
 It's not something that I'm ever going to find out about unless I'm being sacrificed myself.

71
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,040
 And I was like, "Oh, yeah, this magic is going to be pretty cool because I'm terrified."

72
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,880
 But all these different people were talking about being a human sacrifice.

73
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,520
 And again, they weren't lining up to do that.

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,320
 But just kind of the concept of it.

75
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,280
 What I thought was interesting is that as I was reading it, I kind of came up with this

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,560
 idea.

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,560
 One of the people said that people are still sacrificed, people are still sacrificed in

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,960
 religious rituals to ensure that the sun rises.

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,600
 I mean, literally that's what they said.

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,560
 They said, "Without it, the sun won't rise."

81
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,680
 So the reason why the sun rises each day isn't because the earth is revolving around the

82
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
 sun.

83
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,080
 It's because this sacrificial act, there is a group of people out there sacrificing a

84
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
 human.

85
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,160
 Is it every day or do they do like a bunch on one day?

86
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,480
 Do they let it pile up?

87
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,000
 They have their in and their out box.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,880
 And they're like, "It's probably time to sacrifice all those people.

89
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,640
 We've been pushing it a little too close."

90
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
 We're not for sure.

91
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,240
 But this person said, "It's, quote, entirely necessary.

92
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,720
 Without it, the sun won't rise."

93
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,400
 Then they went on to say the word "soldier" literally means sacrifice to the sun god.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,320
 So implying that war itself is some sort of mass ritual.

95
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,120
 Now let's do a couple of fact checks on that because I was like, "I don't know.

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
 I don't know."

97
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,280
 It turns out that soldier does not mean that.

98
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,760
 Soldier actually means mercenary.

99
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,880
 It comes from an old French word that is like "suder."

100
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,080
 And that was someone who was hired to fight and then it meant to mean for pay and now

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,880
 just soldier is generic term for anyone fighting in war.

102
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,160
 So that's not true.

103
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,480
 But the idea that war is a mass ritual held by the elite, that's not a new theory.

104
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,680
 That's actually quite old.

105
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,440
 I've heard that for a long time.

106
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,760
 That these wars that we fight, whether or not land is gained or lost, it's actually

107
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,560
 this huge black magic ritual that's churning out the bodies of all these young men, plus

108
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:56,600
 all of the civilians in the war zone and it is part of some sort of super diabolical ritual.

109
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 More blood for the blood god type of thing.

110
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
 So we have that.

111
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,600
 I thought, because I'm reading this, I go, "What if this was true?"

112
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,240
 Not the war thing, not the war thing, but what if Chime Chili's driving us out into

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,080
 the middle of the woods?

114
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,520
 We're wearing our cloaks, we're sneaking through all of the security.

115
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,720
 The security's just looking for people not in cloaks.

116
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,880
 They're really bad security.

117
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,160
 And we get to the ritual that's actually being held.

118
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:32,080
 And there's probably about two dozen worshippers here, two dozen people in similar garb as

119
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,200
 ours and they're holding this ritual.

120
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,640
 There's a young woman tied down to a stone in the middle of the woods and they're getting

121
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,640
 ready to sacrifice her.

122
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,560
 Our first instinct is going to be to start beating people up.

123
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,200
 Not the girl on the stone, you're like, "Me first, punch, punch, punch."

124
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,640
 Okay, now you can sacrifice her.

125
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,960
 Our initial instinct, if you came across anything like that, would be to start beating up the

126
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,240
 Satan worshippers, right?

127
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,880
 Just beating up this coven of people.

128
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,120
 And they would be super, admittedly, they'd be super easy to beat up, right?

129
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,480
 Like whenever you see photos of these people who are supposed to be the elite, who are

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,600
 supposed to be these like hardcore worshippers of the demonic, they're never physically

131
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
 fed.

132
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,400
 They're never Arnold Schwarzenegger, they're never buff.

133
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,560
 I don't think I've ever come across.

134
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:29,520
 Any conspiracy story involving a boxer or an MMA guy or whatever who also worships

135
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
 Beelzebub.

136
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,960
 I think it's always the weak people, right?

137
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
 It's always the weak people.

138
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
 It's always some billionaire or some artist or something like that.

139
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,360
 So we could clean house.

140
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,760
 We could totally take all of these guys.

141
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,440
 And I think that would be our initial reaction, right?

142
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,840
 We'd save the girl.

143
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,280
 But what if we did this with an episode last season, we did a little thought experiment

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,520
 about aliens, kind of doing the same thing here.

145
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:06,780
 What if we show up at this ceremony and we are told by these people, they take their

146
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,280
 hoods off and they go, "Listen, we know you're about to beat us up.

147
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,360
 We've been beat up several times in the past just by being bullied in school.

148
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,680
 Please don't beat us up.

149
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,040
 We have to sacrifice this girl.

150
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,400
 We have to sacrifice her not because we're trying to get riches or more power or anything

151
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
 like that.

152
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,480
 We did those ones yesterday.

153
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,640
 You missed those ones.

154
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,160
 We have to sacrifice this girl.

155
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,880
 We have to do it once a year.

156
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,320
 We have to sacrifice a young woman or a young man.

157
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,200
 We have to sacrifice a young person.

158
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,880
 And if we don't, the sun won't rise for the next year.

159
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,320
 This is something that high priests and priestesses have been doing since the dawn of time.

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:07,760
 If we don't sacrifice somebody, only one person, the sun won't rise for a year.

161
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,960
 Now obviously that sounds fake.

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,240
 We're still winding up our punches.

163
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,560
 But for the sake of argument, this is what we did with the Alien episode, I said, "If

164
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,520
 aliens came down and could prove beyond a matter of a fact there was no trick, no hidden

165
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:29,600
 agenda, no monkey paw-like twist, if the aliens could convince you that they were fighting

166
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,160
 only against the evil humans, would you side with the aliens against evil humans?"

167
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,880
 And it was whatever humans you thought of as evil.

168
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,960
 Whatever group or government or whatever, that was the one they were after.

169
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,520
 You just thought experiment.

170
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,360
 So this is the same way.

171
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,920
 Whatever it takes, because obviously you're not going to believe them, right?

172
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
 You're not going to believe them.

173
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,040
 You're just going to think they're a bunch of perverts who want to sacrifice young people

174
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,240
 in the woods.

175
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,480
 But whatever it takes, they actually are able to convince you, and it's not a trick, it's

176
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,840
 not a twist ending, they are able to prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt that if

177
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:17,000
 they do not sacrifice this young person tonight, the sun will not shine for a year.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,600
 I mean, it would pretty much be the end.

179
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
 It would be the end of humanity.

180
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,360
 I mean, maybe we could go a year without no sunlight, I don't think so.

181
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,840
 Would you let them kill that girl?

182
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,520
 And it's a tricky one, right?

183
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,160
 Because first off, when I thought about that, I go, I don't know, like, because I want to

184
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,360
 trust them.

185
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,680
 I want to trust them at all.

186
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,920
 They are in the middle of murdering somebody, right?

187
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,320
 The aliens, at least they came down and they're like, hey, we want to talk to you, buddy.

188
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,800
 They're in the middle of murdering somebody.

189
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,960
 They're in the middle of getting ready to kill this girl.

190
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,360
 So obviously they have a high hill to climb to gain my trust.

191
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,160
 But whatever they could use, I don't think they could show me some sort of religious text

192
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,080
 or anything like that.

193
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,520
 But if they did convince me 100%, whatever they used to do it, if they did convince me

194
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:20,400
 in the end, with no tricks or twists or anything like that, I didn't get fooled at the ending.

195
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,920
 At the end of this conversation, I knew 100% that if this young woman was not sacrificed

196
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,000
 tonight, the sun would not shine for a year.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,200
 What would I do?

198
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
 That's a hypothetical thought experiment.

199
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,400
 I just thought it was really cool.

200
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,080
 There's no correct answer to it.

201
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,720
 I think, obviously, it's made up, right?

202
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,040
 Obviously I doubt this is happening.

203
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,920
 But again, like, when I was reading this stuff, this guy who said that soldier means sacrifice

204
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,840
 to some guy, that's not true.

205
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,760
 But when I was reading it, I go, what if there's at least people who do believe that and they

206
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,720
 are sacrificing somebody every single day or on a regular schedule and they're doing

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,160
 it and as they're doing it, they're praying to the sun god.

208
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,880
 And they actually believe that the reason why the sun is still rising is because there

209
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,720
 are this long line of priests and priestesses stretching back out through history.

210
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,800
 So people could be doing it because they think it's real.

211
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,080
 Then extrapolate it out, that what if it was real?

212
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,480
 And it would depend on the person tied to the rock, right?

213
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,240
 If it was just some random teenager that kidnapped off the street, this dude hitchhiking and they

214
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,840
 threw him in a van tied him to a rock, you'd be like, can't you just get some, aren't there

215
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
 better people to tie to the rock?

216
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,680
 Aren't there actually bad people out there in the world?

217
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,920
 Serial killer, tie serial killer to the rock.

218
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,720
 What if we just only did human sacrifices on bad people?

219
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,360
 Those are the people, those are generally the people doing the human sacrifices.

220
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
 I think that's why.

221
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,120
 I think if they kidnapped a serial killer, they're like, hey, Barry, how have you been?

222
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
 Haven't seen you in a long time.

223
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,560
 Sorry, I thought you were just some teenager walking on the street and they let them go.

224
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,200
 And then anyways, an interesting thought experiment nonetheless, also kind of grim.

225
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,560
 Chime chili, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous carpenter

226
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,680
 copter or leaving behind this spooky forest.

227
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,160
 Take us all the way out to a blockbuster video.

228
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:35,040
 Chime's like, so we're going to Bend, Oregon, the location of the last blockbuster on earth.

229
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,240
 I go, look again, my friend.

230
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
 Look again.

231
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,920
 And we all look out of the carpenter copter and there's blockbuster video stores as far

232
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,600
 as the eye can see.

233
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,800
 Because it's the year 1995.

234
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:03,320
 Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to meet the Chrome Lords.

235
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,600
 There is a AI program called mid journey AI.

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,560
 And like all of these AI programs, you know, I've obviously played around with them a

237
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,120
 bit on the Patreon discord.

238
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,880
 We have an entire board set up for just people playing with the AI programs.

239
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,800
 You type in a string of words and it spits out some images.

240
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,400
 I'm a novice with this stuff.

241
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:34,080
 Obviously, whenever a new one comes out, I type in dead wrap radio, try to get some logos.

242
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,120
 But recently on mid journey, I think this was one person, but it may have been several.

243
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,560
 But I do kind of think it's one.

244
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,240
 I think it at least started with one person.

245
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,040
 Other people have jumped on.

246
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:53,560
 There's a new movie for lack of a better term that's been popping up called the Chrome Lords.

247
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:02,600
 And what it is, is it's a movie that supposedly came out in the mid to late 90s.

248
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,520
 That is a rip off of Terminator and Robocop, but had this really deep lore, had this really,

249
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,960
 really cool world building behind it.

250
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:18,320
 The plot was a little clunky as far straight to video movies go, but the movie never existed.

251
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,000
 The movies never existed, but someone wrote up that description and then produced over

252
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,960
 a hundred screenshots from the movie, the Chrome Lords.

253
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:39,040
 And it looks almost exactly like the VHS screen grabs or the photographs you would see on

254
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,400
 the back of a video cassette box when you're walking around blockbuster.

255
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,920
 While putting them in the show notes, they kind of have to be seen to be believed, but

256
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,400
 it's absolutely fascinating.

257
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,880
 Now when you're working with AI, some of it doesn't look a hundred percent.

258
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,200
 Some of them looks maybe a little more like a painting or like, you know, like concept

259
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
 art.

260
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,160
 But as you continue to look at the photos, they're not photos.

261
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,880
 As you continue to look at the images, it would be a better term, your brain begins to

262
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:16,160
 become convinced that this is real in some way or another.

263
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,560
 Your mind is creating a story.

264
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:27,560
 It does seem like there's some sort of conflict between humanity and these cyborg warriors.

265
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,560
 And because some of the robots start to look more skeletal and some of the humans begin

266
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,080
 to look more robotic, my brain was creating this idea that there was this movie.

267
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,760
 And I knew it was fake, but there was this complicated relationship between the robots,

268
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,480
 the cyborgs and the humans.

269
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,360
 And the humans were becoming more, the cyborgs were becoming more robotic.

270
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,000
 The humans were becoming more like cyborgs.

271
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,100
 By the time you get to the image of the robot crucified and all these other robots like impugn

272
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:05,280
 humans looking up at this crucified robot with this very, very 1990s straight to video color

273
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,520
 palette in this photo, your brain has completed this movie.

274
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,720
 The Chrome Lords is something taking over humanity and washing away the remnants of what was once

275
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,020
 living flesh.

276
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,760
 But anyone can look at these images right now and create their own story.

277
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,600
 And I don't, I mean, like even that, I didn't, I was looking at the photographs.

278
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,500
 I mean, there's a photograph also of a robot playing poker, right?

279
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,860
 Or working at a roulette table or something like that.

280
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,180
 So I don't know where that fits into my mythology, but I didn't purposely set out to think any

281
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,580
 of that stuff.

282
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,580
 It just kind of pops in your head.

283
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,900
 And this is super fascinating.

284
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,260
 I love this.

285
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,020
 But you also would get a segment of people going, where do I find this movie?

286
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:58,120
 I can't find any information about it on Wikipedia or IMDb, like what?

287
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,240
 And then other people would post, hey, numbskull, it's fake.

288
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,360
 Like this is fake.

289
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,100
 AI art is a really cool toy and it's already starting to go sideways.

290
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:15,080
 It's already starting to create some serious issues, well, or not so serious issues.

291
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:21,680
 Fiverr type artists, you know, people who can bust out logos for you for like $5, $10

292
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,820
 like they're going to go extinct because of these AI art programs.

293
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,220
 I was messing around recently with this one that you take a photo, I'll put this one in

294
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,060
 the show notes, I'm gonna have a lot of fun with it.

295
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:40,540
 You put a photo in there and within a minute it is turned into an anime photo.

296
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,820
 Something that would have taken someone hours to draw is provided to you for free.

297
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,220
 I'm sure the Chinese government scraped my computer for all my information, but I didn't

298
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,240
 have to pay technically for it.

299
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:00,120
 For free I get an anime version of myself and when the AI starts doing fursonas, when

300
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,520
 you can send them a picture or send them a description within a minute, you get what

301
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,960
 looks like a professionally drawn picture of you as a furry.

302
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
 I'm gonna do that for you.

303
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,040
 I'm gonna send you a bunch of furry pictures of yourself.

304
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,520
 When that happens, that will also completely collapse the economy because there's a huge

305
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:25,020
 economy on the internet for people to draw fursonas.

306
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,860
 So we'll have that.

307
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,700
 There will be a gulf between people who are super eclectic artists who are doing stuff

308
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:37,140
 so far out of the norm that they're known and then you're gonna have the greats that

309
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,700
 are still around.

310
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,860
 But the journey it takes to go from being a beginning artist to becoming one of the

311
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:48,880
 greats or just to become commercially viable will be removed because the AI art is going

312
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
 to do all of these things.

313
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:58,720
 To create this many images of the Chrome Lords would have taken hundreds of hours.

314
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,960
 You would have to dress sets because some of these looks so realistic.

315
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,000
 You would have to hire actors and build sets and costumes and all that stuff.

316
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,260
 It's fantastic for the consumer but this could be something that replaces storyboard artists

317
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,260
 as well.

318
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:21,660
 And eventually it could be something that replaces a whole slew of professions within

319
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,660
 the film industry.

320
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,460
 And all of that stuff, the way that science, the way that technology interacts with humans,

321
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,620
 interacts with society, it's fascinating to me.

322
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,540
 But that's not the main reason why I'm talking about this.

323
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,560
 It will get malicious where people will create things to mislead you.

324
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,360
 And there's nothing new with that theory too.

325
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,920
 There's always been the concern with deepfakes that eventually there's gonna be a deepfake,

326
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,280
 a 100% convincing image of a world politician saying, "You know what?

327
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,800
 Who cares what the Poles think?

328
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,560
 Who cares what the poor think?

329
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,800
 Us rich people, we can eat babies all day long and nobody can stop us."

330
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:08,620
 And it will be 100% it will sound like them, it will look like them, it will act like them.

331
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,060
 And of course I think you would have half the people not believe it.

332
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,380
 Because they're like, "I agree with that world leader.

333
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,900
 I don't agree with the baby eating thing.

334
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
 I think that's fake."

335
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,980
 And you don't have half the people who do agree with it.

336
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,860
 But that's always been the concern and we haven't seen that happen yet.

337
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,940
 We haven't actually seen that happen yet.

338
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,000
 But as this technology gets better, it will become more malicious.

339
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,720
 It will become a way not just to fake what a politician says.

340
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,500
 But I think you could actually break somebody's will.

341
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,280
 I think you could break somebody's psyche with this type of thing.

342
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,720
 I think that you could create images that are so convincing that they could convince

343
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,440
 you the Chrome Lords did exist at one point.

344
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,540
 And here's the thing, if somebody showed me these images and goes, "You know there's

345
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,460
 a movie called The Chrome Lords and there's a late 90s movie as a rip off of all this

346
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,900
 other stuff and I'm looking through these."

347
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,740
 And I didn't know that they were AI generated.

348
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
 I had no clue.

349
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,560
 Let's say the technology is 30, 40% better than it is.

350
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,700
 And I didn't know and I'm talking to someone and they're telling me this movie existed that

351
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,020
 they saw and stuff like that.

352
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,500
 My reaction would be, "Wow, that sounds really cool."

353
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,400
 Yeah, they never got put on DVD and it's not on streaming or anything.

354
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 I'm like, "Oh, that sucks, man.

355
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
 It's too bad."

356
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:40,080
 Because at the end of the day, I haven't seen every movie ever made and that does happen.

357
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,600
 There are movies you don't have access to anymore.

358
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,920
 Oddly enough, Last I Check Dogma is one of those.

359
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,400
 I read an article probably last year and they said Dogma, unless you buy a used copy on

360
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,920
 eBay, it's not streaming anywhere.

361
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,620
 The rights are all tied up by the Weinstein Corporation and that dude has bigger problems.

362
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,620
 He has to worry about...

363
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,620
 They go, "Unless you buy a used DVD of Dogma, you can't watch it."

364
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,780
 Like that movie's pretty much close to being erased.

365
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,420
 You have to buy a copy from someone else who has a copy.

366
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,860
 They're not making anymore.

367
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:19,380
 So in a movie like Dogma, big movie release with big movie stars can disappear.

368
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,320
 There may come a time where nobody has a copy of Dogma.

369
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
 Chrome Lords?

370
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
 Yeah, sure.

371
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,320
 That sounded really cool.

372
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
 That sounds like it's cool.

373
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,000
 I have a huge book, the complete book of zombie movies.

374
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,040
 Every zombie movie ever made up to 2005, 2006 maybe.

375
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
 And I can't find most of them.

376
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 They were never released a video or they were released a video but never turned into DVDs

377
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,440
 and then you can't get a copy no more.

378
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,320
 So it does happen.

379
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,780
 So you can create movie after movie after movie and convince people they were real and

380
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,900
 they're not.

381
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,780
 But that wouldn't necessarily break your brain.

382
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
 That wouldn't...

383
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,780
 You'd be like, "Oh, it's too bad."

384
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,280
 You wouldn't go like, "I'm going crazy.

385
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,560
 I can't watch the Chrome Lords."

386
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:13,540
 What I think is interesting, a more interesting idea is the opposite.

387
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,100
 And again, I think this is also a little bit of a thought experiment.

388
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:26,040
 Is it possible for someone to convince you a movie that you saw, that you know you saw,

389
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,960
 was radically different than what it actually was?

390
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,880
 We've always probably seen Titanic at this point.

391
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,920
 You're talking to someone and they say, "Yeah, I really like Titanic but I thought it was

392
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,920
 kind of cheesy at the ending where her and Jack both got on the raft and then they both

393
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,420
 got saved and they went to America and the last scene was them surrounded by their children."

394
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,220
 I'd be like, "Wait, that's not how Titanic ended."

395
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,940
 And they go, "Yeah, that's totally how Titanic ended."

396
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,380
 And we don't have a copy of Titanic sitting around us to watch.

397
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:11,300
 We go to a website and this dude starts showing me screen grabs of multiple images of this

398
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:17,480
 happening of her and Jack on the raft and then the spotlight shining in their face as

399
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,400
 the boat comes by and then them hugging as the heart of the ocean is wrapped around her

400
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,640
 neck and then we see them back in Chicago.

401
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,360
 All the cinematography looks exactly like James Cameron, the staging, everything like

402
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
 that.

403
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,080
 He shows me like 10 or 15 images and says, "Yeah, this is how Titanic ended."

404
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
 That's not how it ended.

405
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,460
 That's not how it ended at all.

406
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:48,020
 I would have to eventually go out and find a copy of Titanic because that would if someone

407
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:54,980
 was showing me images that were 100% accurate to what would be in the film because these

408
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:02,740
 AI programs will scrape every single second of these films and it doesn't have to be

409
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740
 moving.

410
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,740
 You don't have to imitate Jack's voice or Rose's voice or anything like that.

411
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740
 It's just these images.

412
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,560
 If someone's showing me this website, I would have to then go find Titanic on streaming

413
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,800
 or go and I mean, I can't rent a copy, right?

414
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 I'd have to find it on streaming.

415
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,300
 I'm not going to buy it on eBay.

416
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,600
 I was like, "Oh, maybe my memory is destroyed."

417
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,320
 But $13.99, I'll just sit here and be confused.

418
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,320
 Eventually I watch it and I go, "I knew that was in the ending.

419
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,160
 I could easily go track down."

420
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
 Well, it wasn't that easy, right?

421
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
 I had to find it on streaming.

422
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
 I guess that's relatively easy, right?

423
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,160
 You're like, "Dude, how lazy are you?"

424
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,260
 I watch the ending and I go, "That jerk."

425
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,220
 And the next time I see him, I was like, "Dude, that's not the ending of Titanic."

426
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,940
 "Oh yeah, I was just joking with you, blah, blah, blah, blah."

427
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,260
 He was James Cameron.

428
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,140
 He wanted to get one more rental on Titanic.

429
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,260
 That would be that process, right?

430
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,980
 Someone is trying to convince me of something that I know for a fact didn't happen.

431
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,980
 It happened.

432
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,380
 They were trying to get me to change the ending.

433
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,500
 And that's a very personalized example of it.

434
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,320
 So what happens is people are going to keep pumping out all of this data.

435
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:18,080
 And I'd say 99% of it is to be creative or funny, pulling a goof, right?

436
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,840
 But as more and more and more and more of these AI images, and eventually we're going to get

437
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,160
 AI generated video, like completely indistinguishable from the source video.

438
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,680
 And I think audio would be the hardest part, but we'll get that too.

439
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:41,580
 We're going to create all of this stuff that nowadays I can track down a copy of the movie

440
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,780
 Titanic and watch it.

441
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,260
 And reaffirm my belief that that wasn't the ending, that ending was never produced.

442
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:55,180
 But future generations won't be able to do that.

443
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,260
 It'll be harder for them to find a copy of these movies.

444
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,300
 It'll be harder for them to track it down.

445
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
 And really, I think at a certain point, they won't care.

446
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,000
 The same way I don't care whether or not Chrome Lords is a real movie, it looks cool.

447
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,040
 But if someone told me it was real and I just didn't catch it on video, I'd be like, "Oh,

448
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
 that sucks.

449
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
 Too bad I can't watch that.

450
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
 That's unscathed."

451
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,280
 And then I'd go about my day.

452
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,440
 And you're going to create all of these illusions.

453
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:27,440
 You're going to create all of these chunks of lost media spread throughout the internet

454
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,080
 that people are just going to take as fact because it's easier to take as fact than it

455
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,040
 will be to track down the truth.

456
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,600
 And again, you're like, "Okay, Jason, people are messing with movie endings.

457
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,740
 James Cameron, your personal friends at James Cameron, he's messing with your brain."

458
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,600
 That also doesn't...

459
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,700
 How does that change the world?

460
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,900
 How does that break humanity?

461
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,720
 I think that it's the stepping stones.

462
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
 I won't wrap it up like this.

463
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,240
 I don't want this episode to go on for too long.

464
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,840
 But I think there are these stepping stones that, one, you convinced me that a movie never

465
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
 existed.

466
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,040
 That'd be fairly easy to do.

467
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,360
 Because I don't know, there's a lot of movies out there.

468
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,120
 As long as it wasn't something super bizarre, if they were like, "Do you ever see that movie

469
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,880
 where Ronald Reagan had sex with a monkey?"

470
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
 I'd be like, "That doesn't exist."

471
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,440
 And if it does, I don't want to see it.

472
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,640
 But if it's just the Chrome Lords, I'd be like, "Oh, yeah, man, that sounds like a cool

473
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
 movie.

474
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
 That sucks.

475
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
 I lost media."

476
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
 That's the first step.

477
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,240
 And then you've got to convince me that a movie that I did see has changed in some way.

478
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,000
 And I think that, when people are confronted with that, it does psychologically mess with

479
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 you.

480
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,520
 When someone goes, "Hey, do you know C-3PO used to have one silver leg?"

481
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
 You're like, "What?

482
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
 No, that's not true."

483
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,800
 Yeah, C-3PO had one silver leg.

484
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,280
 He was like a junk robot.

485
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,320
 He was just like...

486
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
 It showed how just kind of worn out he was.

487
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
 What are you talking about?

488
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,720
 He had a full golden body.

489
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,920
 And then someone shows you a photograph of C-3PO with a silver leg and you're like, "That

490
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,760
 is weird."

491
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,400
 That 100% was my experience when I saw that.

492
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,520
 It was the same thing when the first time it came across.

493
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,600
 The Mandela Effect was the Bernstein Bears in the way it was spelled.

494
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,760
 And I go, "That is not true."

495
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,160
 That messes with you a bit.

496
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
 It really does.

497
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
 It messes with you.

498
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,240
 I can go, "I get the quotes.

499
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,080
 Life was like a box of chocolates versus life is like a box of chocolates."

500
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,760
 That doesn't mess with me, right?

501
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,760
 But I know the way that book was spelled.

502
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,040
 The C-3PO leg have kind of come to terms with it, but it still messes with me.

503
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,880
 What happens though?

504
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,040
 This is the ultimate test.

505
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,640
 This is the ultimate psychological test.

506
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,800
 This is where things like mid-journey AI and the people behind it, not the programmers,

507
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
 but the people using it.

508
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,560
 This is how bad things can get.

509
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,600
 99% of the people using these programs are doing it for fun or for the art of it.

510
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,720
 But what happens when...

511
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:07,240
 What happens when someone is able to sit you down and ask, "What's your favorite movie?"

512
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,760
 And you say, "Transformers 3."

513
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,040
 They start laughing.

514
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,640
 They're like, "Seriously, that's your favorite movie?

515
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,560
 What's your favorite movie, Jason?"

516
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
 "Transformers 3, Dark of the Moon."

517
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,480
 It's not the best movie, but I love it.

518
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,840
 What happens when they're able to convince you that your favorite movie, your favorite

519
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,680
 movie, the movie you've seen so many times, you know it in and out.

520
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
 You know it in and out.

521
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,880
 What happens when someone's able to convince you that movie never existed?

522
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,100
 Or if it existed, it was so radically different than what you remember.

523
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:47,480
 What happens when the technology gets to that point where it's not creating new images,

524
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,720
 but actually deconstructing what already exists?

525
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:03,800
 And someone can sit you down and prove to you that your favorite movie never existed.

526
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,200
 And you might think that's impossible, but is it?

527
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,880
 It's hard.

528
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,000
 It would be extremely hard, but it is not impossible.

529
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 It is not impossible.

530
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,080
 I mean, you could say, "Let's take out torture."

531
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,480
 Obviously, if someone started to waterboard me and say, "St. Transformers 3 never existed,

532
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,080
 it's going to be a pretty short torture session."

533
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,160
 I'm like, "Optimists, forgive me.

534
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,160
 It never existed."

535
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:39,760
 Outside of torture, outside of actual, like, your solitary confinement until you admit

536
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,840
 minions 3 never existed, I think that it would work.

537
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,760
 I think that you could honestly sit somebody down and prove to them that their favorite

538
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,680
 thing is not real, or it is so radically different from what they remember.

539
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,520
 It's basically a completely different movie.

540
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,720
 And that's the real problem that we get into with this stuff.

541
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,680
 That is the future of the Chrome Lords, because right now we're creating movies that never

542
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,520
 existed, but eventually you will be able to create...

543
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:16,240
 I mean, they could sit you down and they go, "Your favorite movie was Dangerous Liaisons."

544
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
 Watch this.

545
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,360
 They put the movie in and it's a totally different movie.

546
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,640
 You're watching it and you're like that, I do not remember that scene.

547
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,760
 I remember this scene, but wait, what?

548
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,640
 I never saw Dangerous Liaisons.

549
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,120
 I was like, "Some guy probably gets stabbed in some girls' boobs or probably bouncing around

550
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,520
 in a corset."

551
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,960
 But other than those two key scenes, everything else is different.

552
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,640
 You could do it.

553
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,320
 You could absolutely do it.

554
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,840
 And again, people might do it on accident.

555
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,160
 I want to go over this passage here before we wrap this up.

556
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,480
 I thought this was really interesting.

557
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,800
 Someone wrote this out on this thread, on this thread about the Chrome Lords AI.

558
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,960
 Someone says, "I wonder if this will.

559
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,440
 I wonder if this AI program will eventually be used maliciously to mess with historical

560
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,720
 documentation."

561
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,920
 For example, he gives this example.

562
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,200
 Let's say you don't like the Mona Lisa.

563
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:34,360
 You have the AI produce 100 million copies of the Mona Lisa with very, very minor changes.

564
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,440
 And you can have this program running for years, creating all these alternative versions

565
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,360
 of the Mona Lisa.

566
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:49,960
 Some noticeably different, some slightly different, but you're actually filling the Internet

567
00:34:49,960 --> 00:35:00,640
 full of Mona Lisa's versus the limited number of actual photos taken of the Mona Lisa.

568
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,840
 You've now created a million to one gulf between the fake images and the real image, which

569
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,920
 there is a concrete number of actual photos taken of the Mona Lisa versus 100 million

570
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,240
 false ones.

571
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:25,080
 And he goes, "You could do the same thing on a bigger scale with maps, portraits, films,

572
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
 etc.

573
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,680
 You could flood the Internet with fake images, fake media, until it's absolutely impossible

574
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:39,680
 to find historically accurate information like we can today.

575
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,920
 Today I can stream Titanic."

576
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,240
 But when Dogma came out, it was everywhere.

577
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,880
 You could get a copy of Dogma everywhere.

578
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,720
 Who's to say where we'll be in the future?

579
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:59,000
 Now Titanic obviously is a much bigger movie than Dogma, but what happens when a streaming

580
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,520
 service accidentally starts airing the wrong version of Titanic?

581
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,920
 Now obviously the change of the ending would be so drastic, a lot of people would notice

582
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
 it right away.

583
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,440
 But let's say there was someone who wanted, who didn't like Titanic and started making

584
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,000
 all of these minor changes and created thousands upon thousands of versions of Titanic that

585
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,920
 only a super fan would notice the difference.

586
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,840
 But as time goes on, the chances of people seeing the false version of Titanic would

587
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,960
 override the chances of someone seeing the authentic version.

588
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,160
 And the people who watched the movie early on, they'd be like, "I must have misremembered

589
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
 that.

590
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,360
 I swear in that scene he was wearing a life jacket, but in this version he's obviously

591
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,560
 drowning."

592
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,120
 You're just flooding the Internet full of all of this fake information.

593
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,760
 And you're doing it on purpose, if you're being malicious about it, you're actually

594
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,600
 trying to mislead people.

595
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
 And this isn't impossible.

596
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:04,960
 A long time ago Fabio Nurbon sent me a story where a guy actually did this.

597
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,200
 Fabio Nurbon, a long time ago, sent me the story about the Street Sharks cartoon.

598
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,600
 It's a cartoon from the 1990s.

599
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,400
 And in 2003, there's this dude named Jordan Miner.

600
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,580
 He was in middle school.

601
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,960
 He found a website called TVTOME.com.

602
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,200
 He started creating fake episodes and created a fake character and said that Henry Winkler

603
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:35,320
 was the voice of this guy named Meat Hook and posted it all over TVTOME.

604
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,120
 He became an editor of the Street Sharks TVTOME.

605
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,960
 He's doing it as a joke.

606
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:50,600
 And then TVTOME got bought by TV.com, which was owned by CBS Interactive Media.

607
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,960
 So it got linked up into Wikipedia.

608
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
 All this information got pushed onto Amazon.

609
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,240
 It got pushed onto IMDb.

610
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,560
 It became official information.

611
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,720
 These episodes that never existed looked like they were lost media.

612
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
 Looked like they popped up.

613
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:12,720
 And since the cartoon was impossible to find, you could buy the DVD if you really wanted

614
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,200
 to see Roxy the shark who never existed.

615
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,360
 But most people just read it and accepted it as true.

616
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,120
 Some guy wrote an article later on about Henry Winkler's career and he goes the lowest point

617
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,560
 was when he was Meat Hook on Street Sharks.

618
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
 What was he thinking?

619
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,880
 He didn't think about it at all.

620
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,880
 That never happened.

621
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,120
 He never was on Street Sharks.

622
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:41,000
 And that was just from a television Wiki page that got bought up by a corporate conglomerate.

623
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,500
 And that happened.

624
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:48,200
 The Titanic example seems extreme now because we know that that's not how it ended.

625
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:57,800
 But the more the fakes come out, the more the real disappears.

626
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,880
 I just find this absolutely fascinating.

627
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
 I really do.

628
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,400
 I think you could.

629
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,600
 We see it happen with Mandela Effect.

630
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,040
 We see it happen with the Street Sharks thing, right?

631
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,960
 Where you can confuse people.

632
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,200
 Our memories are Fruit of the Loom had a cornucopia.

633
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,240
 But all of the images now say it doesn't.

634
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,800
 Mandela Effect does add the paranormal theory onto it that we're shifting time streams.

635
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,360
 And Mandela Effect may be real.

636
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,320
 I think some of the examples are flawed.

637
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,160
 But I've never said it doesn't exist.

638
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,800
 I do think there is something behind the Mandela Effect.

639
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:44,720
 What if you could just create Mandela Effect's 100 million of them in a matter of a week?

640
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,840
 Really really break someone's brain if you could convince them that something they loved

641
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,640
 never existed or was radically different.

642
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,120
 I could damage the human psyche because there are so many things that song that you love.

643
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,640
 You remember where you were the first time you heard it.

644
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,000
 You know all the lyrics to it.

645
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,760
 That album that got you through that bad breakup.

646
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,480
 But then years later you go, "I want to check out that album.

647
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,120
 I don't want to throw another bad breakout.

648
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,560
 I'm going to check it out."

649
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,000
 And there's more false versions of the album out there than the true.

650
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,160
 And you listen to the false version and you go, "This isn't real.

651
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
 This isn't real.

652
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
 This isn't real.

653
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,160
 This isn't real."

654
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,800
 But because the only thing you can find are the false versions, you have to realize that

655
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,880
 no, your memories are false even though your memories were real.

656
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,280
 The evidence is false.

657
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,880
 The evidence today is fake.

658
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,600
 That could really blow your brain out.

659
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:55,480
 It really could mess with the sense of self that we have.

660
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,920
 Because then you'll just question, "What is true?"

661
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,840
 All these movies I watch, like it seems like 30, 40% of them are different than I remember.

662
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,120
 All these songs I loved, it seems like so many of them are different.

663
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,040
 It's not the same lyrics.

664
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,800
 But anyone you talk to, if they didn't hear the original media 10 years ago, they will

665
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,120
 go, "No, it always had that."

666
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:29,360
 Imagine a world where your memories themselves outside of the Mandela Effect, like real life-changing

667
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:39,680
 memories, moments that were so personal to you are being falsified over and over and

668
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,480
 over and over again.

669
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,960
 You would basically either have to choose, and I think this would be the most likely

670
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,400
 thing, to believe the lie.

671
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,280
 You go, "Well, maybe I heard all my favorite songs and all my favorite shows.

672
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,200
 Maybe I'm wrong."

673
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,240
 And you accept the lie.

674
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,760
 Or you just go nuts, you realize that the world is false.

675
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,440
 Things that you believe in can change rapidly, and everyone around you goes, "No, this was

676
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,000
 how it always was."

677
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,760
 And the creepiest thing about this whole thing is even if you do, for peace of mind, even

678
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,800
 if you do to fit in, accept the lie.

679
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,720
 You go, "I know these songs weren't super popular.

680
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,240
 I know a bunch of people didn't listen to them back when I listened to them, and they're

681
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,920
 saying they're different today."

682
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920
 Okay.

683
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,520
 And I know the shows and the movies that I liked weren't super popular, and not everyone

684
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,160
 saw them 10, 20 years ago, but people are saying they're like this today.

685
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,840
 I must be wrong.

686
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,880
 I must be remembering wrong.

687
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,800
 The evidence in front of me is the truth.

688
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,800
 This is the truth.

689
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:10,920
 Even if you accepted that, you accepted the new reality, the way this AI is pumping out

690
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:21,640
 images, the very next day, everything is different.

691
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,840
 Every moment you have to sit and think, "I must be wrong."

692
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:33,320
 This is the new truth.

693
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:47,120
 And how long could the human brain do that before it finally, simply, broke?

694
