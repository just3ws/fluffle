1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
 What happens when you hear a ghost story so scary you never drink alcohol again?

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,060
 And then we travel back to the Victorian era with world famous conspiracy theorist Hans

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,640
 Warmthat to investigate his newest claim.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,980
 Steampunk was real.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:31,980
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,760
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,260
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,960
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,960
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and get started right now walking into

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,960
 the show.

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:16,500
 We're all longtime supporters of the show.

13
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:31,900
 Robert Paulson was so entertained by my episode The Hey Hook where I tell a story about how

14
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,140
 I used to carry around a hey hook.

15
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,140
 I used to use a hey hook.

16
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,700
 I'll put it in the show notes and you're like what's going on this is my first episode.

17
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,580
 I'll put it in the show notes and it's a fantastic episode.

18
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,660
 I used to use a hey hook when I lived out in Sacramento.

19
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,100
 I didn't bail hey.

20
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,600
 Spoiler alert.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,700
 And I ended up losing the hey hook.

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,940
 I ended up not having it anymore.

23
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,820
 But Robert Paulson made me a new one.

24
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,820
 Look at this.

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,820
 I know the photo is just of it embedded in the wood but that is a fully functional hey

26
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,780
 hook that he actually forged himself in the fires of Mount Doom.

27
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,180
 Apparently he made the hook, he made the handle and he made the giant piece of wood.

28
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,300
 He says it looks like a rabbit ear and I would concur.

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,540
 With the quote, the key to winning every single fight is to not get in them in the first place.

30
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,620
 Which I said apparently I mean I believe it.

31
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
 I never said believe it.

32
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,100
 But I was like oh that's a really cool quote.

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,100
 I wonder who said it.

34
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,100
 And he's like you did.

35
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,020
 On the episode the hey hook.

36
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,420
 So thank you so much Robert Paulson.

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,740
 What an amazing gift.

38
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,700
 I have a policy and this is a policy I followed for years and years and years.

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,620
 I never ever take photographs of any of my weapons.

40
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
 Ever.

41
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,620
 There's never any photographs of bats or knives or chains or brick a brick or whatever.

42
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,740
 It is a rule I follow.

43
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,540
 I never take photographs of my weapons.

44
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,380
 But this here is more of a work of art.

45
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,420
 However you should well know that it's right next to where I do all my work so if I do

46
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,020
 get surprised someone may get a hey hook in their head.

47
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,220
 It might hopefully never be used as a weapon.

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,860
 But what a fantastic awesome birthday present.

49
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,220
 Robert Paulson now let's all board the dead rabbit dirgeable we are leaving behind dead

50
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:28,740
 rabbit command fly us all the way out to Alaska.

51
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,380
 Specifically we're headed out to Sitka Alaska.

52
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,380
 Tiny little town in Alaska.

53
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,540
 It might be a booming metropolis for all I know.

54
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,980
 But I looked at it on Google Earth.

55
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,740
 They didn't look that much of a jump in place.

56
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,420
 It looked like a rural town.

57
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,580
 In Sitka Alaska we're looking for a place called Rookie's Corner which appears to be

58
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,020
 a maybe a slang term for a certain road.

59
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,020
 I couldn't find it.

60
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,140
 Another source on this story specified the address.

61
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,180
 It's 1615 Sawmill Creek Road.

62
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,060
 That looks like it's in the middle of the forest.

63
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,100
 I actually pulled that up on Google Earth as well as like I don't know if the story took

64
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,420
 place deep in the woods.

65
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,660
 If you do decide to try it out there you're not going to want to visit the story.

66
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,260
 The story is absolutely terrifying.

67
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,420
 But if you do you might want to just ask around.

68
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,260
 Don't just show up out of the house in the middle of the woods and be like is there a

69
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,260
 ghost there?

70
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,660
 Because you might end up being the ghost soon enough.

71
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,540
 We're walking around Sitka Alaska.

72
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,460
 We are just standing on the street corner.

73
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,960
 Rookie's Corner.

74
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,060
 And we're just kind of hanging out.

75
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,060
 It's cold.

76
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,060
 We've got our mittens on.

77
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,700
 Big jackets and stuff like that.

78
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,060
 And drink some cocoa.

79
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,420
 Drink some hot cocoa.

80
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,420
 And all of a sudden we hear...

81
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,420
 Oh man.

82
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,420
 Oh.

83
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,020
 That's not just me stretching.

84
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,940
 That's not just a 46 year old man stretching.

85
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
 We hear it and we're like what?

86
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,940
 Where's that noise coming from?

87
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,940
 Oh no.

88
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
 My body.

89
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,940
 My body.

90
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,940
 And we're like when the world's gone.

91
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
 That was me.

92
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,940
 That was me actually stretching.

93
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,940
 I'm like oh Agin.

94
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,940
 We hear these moans and these cries.

95
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,940
 Coming from somewhere around us.

96
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,940
 We're looking around.

97
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
 Where could that be?

98
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:13,940
 And we're eventually able to triangulate that these voices are coming from some bushes nearby.

99
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,940
 Like right on the street corner.

100
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,940
 Like what?

101
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,940
 Oh man.

102
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,940
 Where are those voices coming from?

103
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,940
 And you try to stick your head in the bushes.

104
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,940
 I'm pushing you into the bushes.

105
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
 You're trying to find the source of that moaning.

106
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,940
 You're sticking your head in the bushes and as you're trying to like check things out.

107
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,940
 A car drives by and almost screams you.

108
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,940
 Luckily I pulled you aside.

109
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,940
 Luckily I was the one pushing you into the bushes in the first place so I had a good grip

110
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,940
 and I pulled you out and I was like bro dude can you believe that happened?

111
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,940
 I almost watched you die but I saved you.

112
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,940
 I was like oh that would have been a really cool ghost story.

113
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,940
 A podcast host makes his own ghosts.

114
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,940
 I was thinking about it and I was like huh.

115
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,940
 But I saved your life.

116
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,940
 I saved your life this time.

117
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,940
 You may not know what happens in the next episode.

118
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:07,940
 The what we're hearing is the terrifying death cries of a young woman.

119
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,940
 This is a really interesting ghost story.

120
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,940
 This is a really interesting one.

121
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,940
 Let's take a look at this.

122
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:20,940
 So apparently back in the day on Rookie's Corner there used to be this really well known bar.

123
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,940
 People would go in hey Johnny give me a shot of whiskey.

124
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
 Glu-glu-glu-glu.

125
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,940
 Yeah dude that was pretty good.

126
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
 Give me another shot of whiskey.

127
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
 Glu-glu-glu.

128
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
 And people are like playing pool.

129
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,940
 I'm assuming right there's usually pool at bars.

130
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,940
 People are walking around drinking beers.

131
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,940
 They're having a good time.

132
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,940
 And in this bar we're going to meet this young woman.

133
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
 We don't have her actual name.

134
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,940
 We don't have a time period for when this story took place.

135
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:48,940
 Some people say it took place in the 1800s but considering one of the key elements is a truck.

136
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,940
 I don't think that, well maybe Hans Wormhat would disagree in the next story.

137
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,940
 But they didn't have pickup trucks in the 1800s.

138
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,940
 There's this young woman.

139
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,940
 We're going to call her Maggie.

140
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,940
 And she's walking around the bar.

141
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
 She's like oh dude I love being drunk so much.

142
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,940
 She's shooting back whiskey and everyone else is drinking other stuff.

143
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,940
 I don't know.

144
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
 I don't go to bars at all.

145
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,940
 I'm not a drinker myself.

146
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
 Whiskey, vodka, margaritas.

147
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,940
 They're all just drunk.

148
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,940
 This is a very popular bar in the area.

149
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,940
 For all I know it's the only bar in the area.

150
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,940
 And it's a sports bar too so they would have pool and probably a bunch of television sets.

151
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,940
 Also a reason why this didn't take place in the 1800s.

152
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
 The football games going on.

153
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
 People are watching boxing matches and all this stuff.

154
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,940
 It's a party.

155
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
 She's walking around.

156
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
 She's having a good time.

157
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,940
 Everyone's having a good time.

158
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,940
 Everybody's drunk.

159
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,940
 But now it's time for Maggie to go back home.

160
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,940
 Well Maggie does the smart thing.

161
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,940
 She doesn't drive.

162
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
 She doesn't drive.

163
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,940
 However she then does not a very smart thing.

164
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,940
 She decides to walk home drunk.

165
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,940
 And she's ten sheets to the wind.

166
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,940
 That's the term right?

167
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
 Like she's done.

168
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
 She isn't just having a little buzz.

169
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,940
 She is slopping away out of the bar.

170
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,940
 She's just walking around.

171
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
 Just totally inebriated.

172
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
 And at rookie's corner.

173
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,940
 This place used to be called the old kick-soddy corner.

174
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
 And then it was the rookie's corner.

175
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,940
 Because there was an old bar called the kick.

176
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
 Which is where the story took place.

177
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,940
 And then it became rookie's corner when a new bar took over.

178
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,940
 But she burst through the doors.

179
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,940
 She's now walking through the cold Alaskan night.

180
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,940
 And right on the corner there is this huge set of bushes.

181
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,940
 That really makes it a blind corner.

182
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,940
 When cars are driving by they can't see what's on the other side of those bushes.

183
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
 And when you're walking by those bushes.

184
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,940
 You can't see a car coming.

185
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,940
 So Maggie walks into the road.

186
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,940
 She's absolutely not thinking about anything.

187
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,940
 She's just trying to get home.

188
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,940
 And I mean even if she was sober.

189
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,940
 This accident may have happened.

190
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,940
 But definitely it happened when she was drunk.

191
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,940
 She stepped out from behind the blind corner.

192
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,940
 A truck slams right into her.

193
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,940
 Killing her instantly.

194
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,940
 And everyone sees this.

195
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,940
 Everyone standing outside the bar sees this pickup truck.

196
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,940
 Hit Maggie, slam into her.

197
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,940
 And she falls to the ground.

198
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,940
 She's a tangled mess of limbs laying there.

199
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,940
 The driver of the pickup truck who was also drunk.

200
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,940
 Jumps out of the truck and is looking at the battered body of Maggie.

201
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,940
 Laying there in the middle of the street.

202
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,940
 Everyone standing out on the corner are looking at her as well.

203
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,940
 And they're like, "Dude, she is done."

204
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,940
 Like that car hit her going so fast.

205
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,940
 Killed her instantly.

206
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,940
 That's what they thought.

207
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,940
 But Maggie, who should have been dead, and really,

208
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,940
 I mean the physicians, I guess a part of them

209
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,940
 about to tell you, is like, "Jason, she wasn't dead."

210
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,940
 She was dead, but she was so drunk and so in shock

211
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,940
 and so out of reality.

212
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
 She had no idea what was going on.

213
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,940
 She stood up.

214
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,940
 She stood up on shattered legs.

215
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,940
 Her broken arms are kind of flailing in each direction

216
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,940
 and she's still trying to walk home.

217
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,940
 She's continuing to make her way across the street,

218
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,940
 screaming out in pain.

219
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,940
 It's a horrifying sight.

220
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,940
 But she doesn't make it home.

221
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,940
 She makes it a couple more feet.

222
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
 She's walking around.

223
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,940
 All of her bones are basically bone meal at this point.

224
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
 And she's walking.

225
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,940
 She walks a couple steps.

226
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
 She's screaming.

227
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
 She's flailing her arms about.

228
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,940
 And then she falls dead on the street.

229
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,940
 Apparently, at least 100 people saw this happen.

230
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,940
 You had people already leaving the bar

231
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,940
 because they were getting ready to go to the after party.

232
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,940
 You had people outside the bar just drinking anyways.

233
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,940
 You had just the traffic in the area.

234
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,940
 And over 100 people saw this horrific event.

235
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,940
 They say to this day, if you go to Rookie's Corner,

236
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,940
 you can hear her screaming from the bushes.

237
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,940
 This phenomenon usually appears before dawn,

238
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,940
 like early pre-dawn hours.

239
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,940
 You can hear her wailing in the bushes,

240
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,940
 screaming for some sort of help,

241
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,940
 help she would never receive.

242
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,940
 And that's terrifying enough.

243
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
 That's scary enough ghost story.

244
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,940
 But then this is an interesting added element to it.

245
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,940
 Not only can you hear her,

246
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,940
 some people see her.

247
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,940
 There have been reports of drivers coming down that road.

248
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,940
 And all of a sudden, a woman jumps out from behind the bushes,

249
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,940
 jumps out from that blind corner.

250
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,940
 And they see her dangling limbs, her shattered knees,

251
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,940
 her broken face, just standing there in the middle of the street,

252
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,940
 staring at them.

253
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,940
 They see her, they see Maggie standing there in the middle of the street,

254
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,940
 just staring at them.

255
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
 The only people who can see her,

256
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,940
 the only people who see this phantasm jump out from behind the bushes,

257
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,940
 are drunk drivers.

258
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,940
 And the story goes that when you see this,

259
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,940
 you're like, "Okay, I'm done. I don't know if that's a real ghost or not."

260
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,940
 I've heard the legends. I'm a little too drunk.

261
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,940
 If it's not a real ghost, I'm definitely too drunk.

262
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,940
 I'm always too drunk to drive a car.

263
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
 I'm just going to pull over and get a cab.

264
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,940
 Or walk and be very safe about it.

265
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,940
 So the legend goes that only the drunk drivers in the area

266
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,940
 can see this ghastly phantom.

267
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,940
 A reenactment of her death,

268
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,940
 or a warning to others.

269
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,940
 This is a super interesting ghost story.

270
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,940
 I loved coming across this one.

271
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,940
 A lot of these ghost stories, really,

272
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,940
 they all have elements of urban legends to them.

273
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,940
 Unless we can verify them, unless we can actually go in...

274
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
 And I'm not saying even verify them with

275
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,940
 seeing if we can pick up EVPs or temperature drops or stuff like that.

276
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,940
 I'm saying even verifying that the story itself exists.

277
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
 And a lot of these do.

278
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,940
 I could not find any proof that this story was real.

279
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,940
 Like I said, there was another source that said this happened in the late 1800s,

280
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,940
 which I don't know when Ford F-150s were driving around back then.

281
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,940
 But this is one of those stories like I couldn't verify that a woman

282
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,940
 was actually killed on the street.

283
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,940
 And there are a lot of ghost stories where we can verify

284
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,940
 that there is a historical event or a particular crime

285
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,940
 that could have caused that ghost.

286
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,940
 We still don't know if the ghost itself exists unless we're there,

287
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,940
 unless we're looking at proof, but this story has that urban legend element.

288
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,940
 Urban legends are all about cautionary tales, right?

289
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,940
 If you're a babysitter,

290
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,940
 be paranoid of everything.

291
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,940
 Don't answer your phone.

292
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,940
 Do half-hour sweeps through the house looking for anyone that is crazy,

293
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,940
 trying to kill you.

294
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,940
 Maybe more than a half hour if you think there might be a maniac

295
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,940
 and you might not want to be like, "I heard a strange noise up there."

296
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,940
 But I was just up there five minutes ago.

297
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
 You know what I mean?

298
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
 A lot of these urban legends are cautionary tales.

299
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,940
 This one is the same thing where we have a ghost,

300
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,940
 but it teaches a good message, right?

301
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,940
 Don't drink and drive.

302
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,940
 It's not smart. You might kill somebody.

303
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,940
 But then if we just look at the ghost story itself,

304
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,940
 the idea of a phantom only appearing to a particular group of people,

305
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,940
 drunk drivers, that's a really, really interesting piece of the puzzle.

306
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,940
 Because then it is, you know, the ghost moaning in the bushes,

307
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,940
 that is what we would call a recording of a ghost,

308
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,940
 like a psychic event happened in an area,

309
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,940
 it scarred the area so much that now it's replaying on a loop.

310
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,940
 But the ghost appearing,

311
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,940
 but the ghost interacting with the real world,

312
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,940
 and the ghost only appearing to the group of people

313
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,940
 that would fall into the class of people that killed her,

314
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,940
 that's extremely rare.

315
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,940
 That's extremely rare.

316
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,940
 It's a fascinating, fascinating look at a story.

317
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
 And who knows? I mean, again, it could have just been an urban legend,

318
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,940
 it could be 100% true,

319
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
 it could be a blend of the two,

320
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,940
 but I'm sure that this legend in particular has saved lives.

321
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,940
 Whether it's told people,

322
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
 "Hey man, you want another drink?"

323
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,940
 They're like, "Nope, I have to drive home,

324
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
 and I might see a bloody ghost."

325
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
 They're like, "What?"

326
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,940
 If it's just a story, then it would hopefully scare people away

327
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,940
 from engaging in such dangerous behavior.

328
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
 They're like, "I'm just going to drive down another road,

329
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,940
 I can be drunk as a skunk!"

330
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,940
 As long as I don't drive down Salmille Creek Road.

331
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,940
 But also if the Phantom is only appearing to drunk drivers

332
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,940
 and getting them to stop and catch a cab,

333
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,940
 that is a direct interference with a horrible decision, right?

334
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,940
 Like, that's the ghost appearing to stop you from continuing drinking and driving.

335
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,940
 Very interesting story that it's having that level of effect on people.

336
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,940
 This is one of those stories though, I would say, if you are a ghost hunter,

337
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,940
 don't reenact that part, you're like,

338
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,940
 "I want to know if there's life after death!"

339
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,940
 And you get drunk and you start driving around Sitka.

340
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,940
 I think it would be better if you just caught an orb on film,

341
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,940
 rather than try to reenact this.

342
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,940
 You're like, "But I really want to see the ghosts."

343
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,940
 Robert Paulson, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

344
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,940
 to the Carbentercopter we are leaving behind Sitka, Alaska.

345
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,940
 Fly us all the way out

346
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,940
 to jolly old England.

347
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:53,940
 First off, I want to give a shout out to

348
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,940
 Patreon member Saint Strand.

349
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,940
 He's the one who introduced this story to me.

350
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
 So I always like to give you guys credit.

351
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
 Thank you so much, Saint Strand.

352
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,940
 And then we always got to give a little tip of the hat,

353
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,940
 a little tip of the hat to friend of the show.

354
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,940
 I'm sure he actually hates us, I'm sure.

355
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
 If you guys don't know, because it's been a while

356
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,940
 since I've done a Hans Worm Hat episode,

357
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,940
 Hans Worm Hat, he's the cutting edge of conspiracy theory.

358
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,940
 Like, as much as this guy is nuts,

359
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,940
 at the very least, if you're going to have to deal with

360
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,940
 nutty conspiracy theories, there at least should be

361
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,940
 some sort of originality to it.

362
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,940
 He's the guy who said, "I will put these episodes

363
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,940
 in the show notes, that monkeys don't exist."

364
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,940
 That was his biggest one.

365
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,940
 This is all kind of in the same episode.

366
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,940
 "Monkeys don't exist. The color orange is satanic.

367
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,940
 Space is fake."

368
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,940
 That was one crazy episode.

369
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,940
 We covered another conspiracy theory of his.

370
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,940
 I don't remember it off the top of my head.

371
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,940
 It was in the episode "Returns of Hans Worm Hat,"

372
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,940
 but I don't remember what it was.

373
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,940
 I do remember him saying, and I remember, I was like,

374
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,940
 "Hans Worm Hat, I can't even cover this one."

375
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,940
 I'm like, "This is insane."

376
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,940
 He said that the slave trade never existed.

377
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,940
 The American slave trade never existed.

378
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,940
 I go, "Do their slaves now, man!"

379
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,940
 "There's slaves today. There's slaves all over the world."

380
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,940
 He doesn't think that the transatlantic slave trade,

381
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,940
 that's the term for it, he said, never existed.

382
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
 Because he showed a picture of a boat,

383
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,940
 and he goes, "They tell you that they pushed

384
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,940
 a bunch of slaves onto the boat as many as they could store."

385
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,940
 That's impossible. You'd have to stack them like wood.

386
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,940
 Yeah, dude, it was a slave boat. It was terrible.

387
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,940
 It's not like they all had their little accommodations

388
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
 in foot room. It was awful.

389
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,940
 And they were treated like property, so it wouldn't matter

390
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,940
 how much, how comfortable they were.

391
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,940
 But anyways, so that was another one of his theories,

392
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,940
 was that the transatlantic slave trade never existed.

393
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,940
 I don't even know how to extrapolate that out.

394
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,940
 He comes up with these crazy things,

395
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
 and most of them are what we call

396
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,940
 observation-based conspiracy theories.

397
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,940
 Flat Earth is one of those.

398
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,940
 If you look at the world in front of you,

399
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
 it appears to be flat.

400
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,940
 So it's an observational-based conspiracy theory.

401
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
 Monkeys aren't real.

402
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
 It's an observation-based conspiracy theory.

403
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,940
 He's looking at monkeys, and he goes,

404
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
 "That's not real."

405
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
 Basically, that's all he does is he licks at stuff,

406
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
 and he just comments on it.

407
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
 His idea with that is he goes,

408
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,940
 "If you look at old art, like if you look at old biology books,

409
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,940
 where they just have drawings,

410
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,940
 those monkeys, those drawings,

411
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,940
 look different than the gorillas that you see today in the zoo."

412
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,940
 Now, it could be because the guy who was walking around

413
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,940
 in the middle of Africa who saw the gorilla

414
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,940
 had to come back and explain it to someone to draw it.

415
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,940
 I mean, that's the most logical answer, and he goes, "No."

416
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
 They were trying to decide what a gorilla looked like.

417
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,940
 They didn't really work it out, and they didn't have all the animatronics.

418
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,940
 And the reason why monkeys aren't real,

419
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
 the reason why we're told monkeys are real,

420
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,940
 and every monkey you've ever seen is a man in a suit or a puppet,

421
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,940
 depending on the size of the gorilla,

422
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,940
 or the chimpanzee, whatever it is,

423
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,940
 is so we don't believe in God.

424
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,940
 If there were no monkeys, then you wouldn't have a theory of evolution.

425
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,940
 I know, I'm sure you guys are pulling your hair out.

426
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,940
 If there was no monkeys for every other species on the planet,

427
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,940
 which he doesn't believe a lot of, those are real either.

428
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,940
 He has a video, I haven't watched it yet,

429
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,940
 because I can only take so much of,

430
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,940
 I can only take so much of Hans and I'm at myself.

431
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,940
 The concepts are far more exciting than him telling them.

432
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,940
 Like, I think I'm having a little more fun telling them,

433
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,940
 and hopefully you're having a little more fun listening to this presentation.

434
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:43,940
 If you go to his videos, he goes, "Honorom hat, monkeys aren't real."

435
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,940
 Here's a photo, that doesn't look real.

436
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,940
 See that?

437
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,940
 No, that's not real.

438
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,940
 Like, it's like 15 minutes of that.

439
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,940
 So I haven't been able to watch this video,

440
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
 I've had the time, I just haven't had the willpower.

441
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,940
 He doesn't believe penguins are real.

442
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,940
 He thinks penguins are fake.

443
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,940
 Is proof?

444
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,940
 The video, again I haven't watched it,

445
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,940
 again I haven't watched it with the video.

446
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,940
 Like the thumbnail is from the behind the scenes of the movie,

447
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,940
 Batman Returns, where Danny DeVito played the penguin.

448
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,940
 He's like, "That guy's obviously not a penguin, he's on, it's always sunny."

449
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,940
 It's a behind the scenes video for Batman Returns,

450
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,940
 and they're talking about the animatronic penguins they made for that movie.

451
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,940
 Why would we fake penguins?

452
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,940
 What does that have to do with denying the existence of gun?

453
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,940
 Penguins aren't real, slave trade's not real,

454
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
 he doesn't believe a bunch of stuff's real.

455
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
 I wonder what he thinks about dogs and cats,

456
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,940
 because then the observation falls apart, right?

457
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,940
 If he has a dog, could you convince him it was a puppet?

458
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,940
 Probably not, because he spins all day long with it.

459
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,940
 But he's just looking at photos, and yes, just to...

460
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
 I'm sure you guys have a bunch of questions, but yes,

461
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,940
 he believes the gorillas you go to see at the zoo are not real,

462
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,940
 they're people in suits.

463
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,940
 He believes that there is a job, which I would love,

464
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,940
 I would love that job, I would love that job,

465
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,940
 to be a man in a suit, in a gorilla suit,

466
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,940
 and you would just walk around eating bananas all day long.

467
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
 He thinks that that's not real when you go to the zoo,

468
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,940
 but I don't know what he thinks about cats and dogs and birds, right?

469
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,940
 Animals that we see on a regular basis that we interact with on a regular basis.

470
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,940
 Bats, right? When's the last time you saw a bat?

471
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,940
 Those might be fake.

472
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,940
 He does all this stuff.

473
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,940
 Most of these are observation-based conspiracy theories that he talks about,

474
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,940
 and this one's...

475
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
 might be one of his laziest ones yet.

476
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,940
 Listen, I get it.

477
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,940
 Putting out content can be difficult over a period of time,

478
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,940
 and when you make your bread and butter on sane stuff,

479
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
 insane stuff like monkeys don't exist,

480
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,940
 and those videos do really, really well,

481
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,940
 you have to start looking for other stuff to not exist,

482
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,940
 to keep your viewers happy.

483
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,940
 His channels aren't monetized.

484
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,940
 I don't know...

485
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,940
 I don't even know if he has a Patreon or a PayPal or anything like that.

486
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,940
 I don't...

487
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,940
 I mean, for all I know, he's independently wealthy.

488
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
 I'm not for sure.

489
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
 Or maybe he just has a day job.

490
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,940
 He works at a zoo. He works at a zoo.

491
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,940
 He's like, "Ah, time to go to work!"

492
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
 But it's on a girl a suit.

493
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,940
 I'm like, "No, I was wrong all along.

494
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,940
 He was the insider."

495
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,940
 But yeah, so, I mean, he just kind of...

496
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,940
 That's where he makes his bread and butter,

497
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
 is saying stuff doesn't exist.

498
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,940
 It clearly does.

499
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,940
 This is an interesting one.

500
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,940
 Now he's trying to convince me something that never existed.

501
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,940
 That doesn't exist, exist.

502
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
 He's switching it up.

503
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
 I mean, I gotta say that.

504
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
 But his videos are just...

505
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
 boring.

506
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,940
 And Hans Wormhat, if you were listening to this,

507
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
 I'm sorry,

508
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,940
 you could put a little more pizzazz in it.

509
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,940
 His newest theory, where he's trying to convince us something that isn't real,

510
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
 was actually real.

511
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,940
 So bizarre. What a twist ending, right?

512
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,940
 Is that steampunk?

513
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,940
 The science fiction genre that basically says during the Victorian era,

514
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,940
 technology both froze in the steam engine phase

515
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,940
 and advanced rapidly at the same time.

516
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,940
 In real life, you know, you have steam engines on your trains,

517
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,940
 and steampunk, you'd have steam jetpacks.

518
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,940
 Incredibly painful.

519
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,940
 The most painful jetpack ever invented.

520
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,940
 Steam jetpacks, steampowered guns that somehow shoot better than a regular gun,

521
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,940
 steam-powered robots, which we actually, you know,

522
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,940
 we were experimenting with a lot of steam-powered stuff,

523
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,940
 but you see this mostly in Victorian era England

524
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,940
 and then the American West, and we saw that in the television show,

525
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
 and it was more exaggerated in the movie,

526
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,940
 "The Wild Wild West," the movie with Will Smith and the other guy, Kevin Klein, yeah.

527
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,940
 I saw it on an opening day first showing.

528
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,940
 I was such a big fan of the old television show, "Wild Wild West."

529
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,940
 I go, "Will Smith?"

530
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,940
 And one of my favorite TV shows growing up, this is gonna be awesome.

531
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,940
 There wasn't, if you know, if you've never seen that movie, it's absolutely atrocious.

532
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,940
 It's so bad.

533
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,940
 But anyways, Steampunk, we have it in Victorian era England

534
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,940
 and the American West.

535
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,940
 Every time I think about Steampunk and the American West,

536
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,940
 I just remember that awful movie.

537
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,940
 Anyways, this is his evidence.

538
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,940
 This is his evidence that Steampunk was real.

539
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,940
 There's not any, but he is looking at a list of inventions from,

540
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,940
 legitimate inventions from the Victorian era.

541
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,940
 He was pointing out inventions like the fax machine.

542
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,940
 The fax machine, they had a rudimentary model back in the 1800s, late 1800s.

543
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,940
 He goes, "That shouldn't exist, so Steampunk was real."

544
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,940
 You're like, "What?"

545
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,940
 And then he goes, "The Eiffel Tower."

546
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,940
 You're like, "What? What does not even any steam in the Eiffel Tower?"

547
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,940
 And he goes, "I don't know. I'm not for sure."

548
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,940
 But it's possible that the Eiffel Tower wasn't built.

549
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,940
 They found it.

550
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,940
 You're like, "What? Wait, what? What's any of that have to do with steam?"

551
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
 He also says this. This was an interesting thing.

552
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,940
 He goes, "Steampunk today is fake."

553
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,940
 But real Steampunk back in history was real.

554
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,940
 The Steampunk we see today is exaggerated on purpose.

555
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,940
 So when we look back in time and see real Steampunk,

556
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,940
 we go, "That's not Steampunk.

557
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,940
 Steampunk is this guy with the costume with all of the gears

558
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,940
 and he has like the cane that has gears on it

559
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,940
 and his coffee has little gears floating around in it."

560
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,940
 That's Steampunk. That old-timey technology is not Steampunk.

561
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,940
 What are you talking about?

562
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,940
 That's the equivalent of saying Star Trek has spaceships in it

563
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,940
 and that's science fiction.

564
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,940
 So a space shuttle that we built is not science fiction,

565
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,940
 which would be true. It's not fiction. It's real.

566
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,940
 They give a fake version of space.

567
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
 Well, he doesn't believe space exists.

568
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,940
 This would just blow his mind anyway.

569
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,940
 They give you a fake version of spaceships.

570
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,940
 So when you see a real spaceship, like a space shuttle or a rocket,

571
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,940
 you go, "That's not a spaceship.

572
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,940
 A spaceship is an X-wing fighter."

573
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,940
 I mean, this doesn't make sense.

574
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,940
 I don't know.

575
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,940
 See, here's the interesting thing about this conspiracy theory.

576
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,940
 I think he came up with the title first

577
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,940
 and realized it was a catchy title.

578
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,940
 People love Steampunk.

579
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,940
 Some people love Steampunk.

580
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,940
 Not people who watch the Wild Wild West,

581
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,940
 but some people love Steampunk

582
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,940
 and he came up with a killer title and then he had to...

583
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,940
 Maybe I'm giving him...

584
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,940
 I mean, he's not monetized, so it's not like he gets any real benefit

585
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,940
 from having a video with a ton of views other than like an ego trip,

586
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,940
 but this one was probably his laziest one he's ever done.

587
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,940
 And it sounded interesting,

588
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,940
 but let's look at a couple of his other claims.

589
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,940
 He said, "First off, real Steampunk today is fake Steampunk.

590
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,940
 It never existed, but old, timey technology that actually did exist is Steampunk."

591
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,940
 Whether or not it used steam, all that was Steampunk.

592
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,940
 Okay, he also says that it's possible.

593
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
 He was a little...

594
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,940
 He wasn't for sure. It's possible that we found the Eiffel Tower,

595
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
 that someone else had built it.

596
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,940
 Then one day a bunch of French people walked into France for the first time

597
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
 and said, "Oh, that looks nice."

598
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,940
 Left it there.

599
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,940
 He also says, you know, the photographs of people?

600
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
 He says, photographs of people, right?

601
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,940
 He has a conspiracy theory about photographs as well.

602
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,940
 For old cameras, you would have to sit there still for a long period of time

603
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,940
 because the way that the technology was, it wasn't so instant.

604
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,940
 It would actually have to burn the image onto the film or soak it in however you want to put it.

605
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,940
 Then he goes, "Look at this chair.

606
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,940
 There's a picture of a chair that actually had like a rod

607
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,940
 and a thing that would clasp onto the back of your neck."

608
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,940
 So you could sit perfectly straight for, say, a half hour,

609
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,940
 however long it takes for this photo to be taken.

610
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,940
 So you wouldn't be all slouching.

611
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,940
 You're all blurry the whole time.

612
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,940
 He goes, "That is not what that chair was used for."

613
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,940
 He said that if you went back in time,

614
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,940
 and let's say you went back to Victorian era London,

615
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,940
 this place of this supreme steam-powered technology,

616
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,940
 it was a wasteland.

617
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,940
 There was nobody there.

618
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,940
 And if you went to Paris,

619
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,940
 birthplace, literal birthplace because it just sprung out of the earth of the Eiffel Tower,

620
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,940
 there's no one there.

621
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,940
 Very, very small populations, maybe one-tenth or less than what history tells us.

622
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:58,940
 And the reason why photographers used corpses to take pictures of people,

623
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,940
 which there are death photos of people,

624
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,940
 but he's saying that when you look at an old-timey photo,

625
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,940
 it's actually a dead person, all of them, all of them apparently,

626
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:16,940
 so they could fake that they had larger populations than they actually did.

627
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,940
 Who is doing this?

628
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,940
 Why? Why not just tell people?

629
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,940
 One, that we don't have a bunch of people here,

630
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,940
 but if everyone had less people than we thought,

631
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,940
 if every city had this, then that would be normal,

632
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,940
 and no one would think it was weird.

633
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,940
 But who's doing this conspiracy theory?

634
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
 Is it a modern-day conspiracy theory?

635
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,940
 Because they're trying to lie about the past?

636
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,940
 Is it something they were doing back then?

637
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,940
 Like, what?

638
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,940
 I just realized what the hell was the point, but I'm asking onto a map.

639
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,940
 Apparently, it was a way to fake a huge population center,

640
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,940
 because you could go, "Hey, I want to invade France.

641
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,940
 There's only like eight people here," and you're like,

642
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:24,940
 "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

643
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:44,940
 "I did a really good episode. It's one of my favorite episodes,

644
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,940
 as far as research goes, and just the topic in general,

645
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,940
 if you want to know more about the mud flood and the science behind that theory,

646
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
 how that worked out.

647
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,940
 It's interesting, because Hans Wormhat goes,

648
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,940
 he'll mention it and he'll be like,

649
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,940
 "But I don't really know if that is true."

650
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,940
 He's not...

651
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
 ...golable in that sense.

652
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,940
 He's not someone who just devours media and goes,

653
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
 "Space is fake, yeah. I mean, that is dumb,

654
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,940
 and it's dumb to think that space is fake."

655
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,940
 But I will give Hans credit.

656
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,940
 I think that he...

657
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,940
 One, I think he believes it.

658
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
 I don't think he's a grifter at all.

659
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
 And then two, he hears all this other stuff

660
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,940
 and he does discard dumb things.

661
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,940
 He doesn't discard all the dumb things,

662
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
 but he does discard some of them.

663
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,940
 In this video, he was like, "Yeah, mud flood, maybe."

664
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,940
 He just thinks there might have been a huge reset.

665
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,940
 Even with the Eiffel Tower thing, he goes,

666
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,940
 "I'm not for sure on this," but it's possible they found the Eiffel Tower,

667
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,940
 that it was built by some previous civilization.

668
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,940
 Interesting.

669
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,940
 He then talks, he kind of wraps it up by revealing

670
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,940
 that one day he went underground in his university,

671
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,940
 he went to the catacombs of his university, he was on a tour.

672
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,940
 He found out his university was powered by steam,

673
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,940
 and that blew his mind, that blew his mind that people use steam power today.

674
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,940
 Okay, I mean, it's a neat fact, I guess, but we still use steam power, bro.

675
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,940
 And we're not steam punk either, we're not steam punk either,

676
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,940
 you can use steam power and not be steam punk.

677
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,940
 He did have, and then we'll wrap it up like this,

678
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,940
 it might sound like I'm kind of bouncing from topic to topic.

679
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,940
 Welcome to Hans Worm Hat, he does...

680
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,940
 This one, I will say, I did find interesting.

681
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,940
 All of it I find interesting, but as far as like a conspiracy theory go,

682
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,940
 I thought this was interesting, and sure there's a simple answer to it.

683
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,940
 He's talking about the reset, right, the possible reset,

684
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,940
 that humanity was moving in one direction, and then it came to a complete stop,

685
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,940
 and then we are living on the remains of that, we're walking around.

686
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,940
 All the world fairs with all these beautiful pieces of architecture,

687
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,940
 that was all from the previous civilization, they go,

688
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,940
 "Oh no, we built this in 1910 for the World's Fair, they're lying."

689
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,940
 That's part of this mudflat thing, this mudflat theory, this great reset theory.

690
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,940
 Do they call it the great reset?

691
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,940
 Because I know there's a new conspiracy thing called the great reset about eating bugs,

692
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,940
 but the great reset when I'm saying that I'm meaning this old great,

693
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,940
 okay this is just going to get confusing, we'll just use mudflat as a descriptor,

694
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,940
 but anyways there was this massive highly advanced civilization,

695
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,940
 that somehow was so advanced they could build these wonders all over the world,

696
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,940
 but wasn't advanced enough to stop mud, and it killed them all,

697
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,940
 and wiped out most of humanity.

698
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,940
 Again, in the 1800s, we've had cataclysms throughout our very short time on planet Earth,

699
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,940
 but this all happened in the late 1800s according to this theory.

700
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,940
 So all of these great monuments that we see, when you walk into a city,

701
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,940
 and you see like this very, very old looking building,

702
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,940
 then everything else is a state-of-the-art skyscraper,

703
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,940
 that old building wasn't built in the 1800s,

704
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,940
 and then was reserved as a historical monument,

705
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,940
 and you're not allowed to tear it down, that's not what happened.

706
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,940
 All the buildings in that area used to look like that, which was true,

707
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,940
 and the mud destroyed all of them, but that one,

708
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,940
 and then all of the sparkling cities are humanity rebuilding after the mud.

709
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,940
 I mean again, it's so interesting.

710
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,940
 I'm surprised they started this conspiracy theory out to say it happened in the 1600s.

711
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,940
 It might be more plausible.

712
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,940
 I'm not saying that walls of mud moved just at different time periods,

713
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,940
 but anyways, late 18th, I feel like I'm losing the plot.

714
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,940
 I actually don't have time to talk about the story that Saint Strand actually recommended to me.

715
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,940
 He didn't recommend this portion of it.

716
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,940
 This was supposed to be a very, this honestly was supposed to be like five minutes long,

717
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,940
 five, ten minutes long before we got into this other story,

718
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
 but it does dovetail into this.

719
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,940
 We'll save that for Monday's episode, but mudflod.

720
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,940
 Grand architecture, like Washington, DC, the obelisk.

721
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,940
 I think those are also pre...

722
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,940
 There's photo, here's the interesting thing, you go by Jason,

723
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,940
 there's photos of these buildings being built.

724
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,940
 Well, those photos are fake, by the way, you didn't know that?

725
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,940
 All those photos were fake.

726
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,940
 But let's get to the part that I thought was interesting.

727
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
 I'm sure there's a reason behind this.

728
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,940
 He goes, "Why is it that we can go back in time

729
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:15,940
 and we can look at a king like Henry VIII or Louis XIV?"

730
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,940
 But...

731
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:28,940
 Today, there's not a Henry XVI or a Louis XIII.

732
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,940
 Mudflod is the answer.

733
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,940
 He didn't know mudflod, that these families were destroyed.

734
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,940
 These families were wiped out, so people were like,

735
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,940
 "Oh, no, Henry VIII, he died in that mud.

736
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,940
 What am I going to name my baby?

737
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,940
 Oh, I guess it's just Henry I, because that Henry died.

738
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
 I wanted him to be Henry IX."

739
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,940
 He says, "What happened to these lineage's?

740
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,940
 What happened to these family names?

741
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,940
 They got wiped out, they got killed.

742
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,940
 And so they had to start over.

743
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,940
 Now, I don't know, I'm broken.

744
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,940
 Here's the thing, I did think that was interesting.

745
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,940
 I go, "Oh, that's interesting."

746
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,940
 And then once I said it out loud, I thought all eight Henry's

747
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
 weren't alive at the same time.

748
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,940
 They would still have named him Henry IX, right?

749
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,940
 But I'm sure...

750
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,940
 Like, it wasn't the problem with Henry VIII

751
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
 that he kept having girls.

752
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,940
 He couldn't have a boy.

753
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,940
 So that would probably be why there's not a Henry IX, right?

754
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,940
 He couldn't have a little boy, he had a bunch of little girls.

755
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,940
 If I remember correctly, or no kids, right?

756
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,940
 He's chopping people's heads off the whole time.

757
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,940
 But that's my version of history.

758
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,940
 Henry VIII was walking around with a battle axe.

759
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,940
 But yeah, I guess that would be the answer to that.

760
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,940
 Once I said it out loud, I thought if you had Louis XIV...

761
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,940
 There might have been a Louis XV for all I know, but...

762
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,940
 I'm American, royalty means nothing.

763
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,940
 You have a Louis XIV, and then he has a son Louis XV.

764
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,940
 Then he has a son Louis XVI, and then no kids, or only little girls.

765
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,940
 And then there are no more Louis.

766
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,940
 So that would explain that, I think, by saying it out loud.

767
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,940
 I kind of figured it out.

768
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,940
 But yeah, that's the theory.

769
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,940
 Like, is it possible that steampunk was real?

770
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,940
 But the steampunk of today is made exaggerated on purpose.

771
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,940
 So if you saw steampunk from the past, you would go...

772
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
 That's not steampunk.

773
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,940
 That's just ordinary technology that's been invented.

774
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,940
 But if there wasn't a steampunk genre today,

775
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,940
 when you looked into the past, you would go, "Wow, they had a fax machine back then?"

776
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,940
 Which, I mean, don't get me wrong, when I read,

777
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,940
 because a long time ago I was doing research for that conspiracy iceberg topic,

778
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
 1800s internet.

779
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,940
 And there's... The 1800s internet is actually a book that was published.

780
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,940
 It's not a super obscure topic.

781
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,940
 I'll put some information in the show notes about it, but...

782
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,940
 It's the idea that technology in the 1800s was more advanced than we give them credit for.

783
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,940
 Not more... I mean, it's readily available in history books.

784
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,940
 We can see articles about stuff and prototypes, drawings of prototypes and stuff like that,

785
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,940
 and we know that they had working models of this stuff.

786
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,940
 But he's looking at that, he discovers that, and he goes,

787
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
 "Oh, this means that steampunk is real."

788
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,940
 But this is... Again, like I said, he believes in what he talks about,

789
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,940
 and he probably doesn't believe that steampunk was real,

790
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,940
 and dead people were propped up in photographs to make it look like England had this massive empire,

791
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,940
 when really it was just like 10 guys in a boat.

792
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,940
 He probably does believe that, but this video... On the HONZO Meter?

793
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,940
 On the HONZO Meter, this might be his laziest video yet.

794
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,940
 Which, I mean, could mean that Hans is ready to hang up the hat.

795
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,940
 He actually did retire last year, I think.

796
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,940
 He said, "I'm done. I can't do this anymore."

797
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,940
 And then he had a dream of a gorilla came to him in a dream, and he goes,

798
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,940
 "You must... You must continue to expose the truth."

799
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,940
 But yeah, on the HONZO Meter, I would give it five gorillas.

800
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,940
 Five gorillas out of 15 out of 15 gorillas.

801
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,940
 One for each Louis. I'd give it a five. Five gorillas.

802
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,940
 It's just nonsense, and I love looking at conspiracy theory nonsense,

803
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,940
 but I feel like he's kind of given up.

804
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,940
 Five out of 15 gorillas is what you've earned for this video.

805
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,940
 You can do better, my friend. I know that you can do better.

806
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,940
 However, I say that, but in the back of my mind, I always remember he has a piece part of...

807
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,940
 This is actually a really popular conspiracy theory that other than a very, very select group of people,

808
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:31,940
 all men are women, and all women are men, and they call it transvestigation.

809
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,940
 This is a very, very popular conspiracy theory that is blowing up.

810
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,940
 There are whole YouTube channels and podcasts and websites dedicated to this.

811
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,940
 It's just a photo of a man, and someone going, "That's a woman!"

812
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:50,940
 And a photo of a woman and someone going, "That's a man." But again, they know they're of the select...

813
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,940
 They're the purebloods. They are what they are.

814
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,940
 Hans Wormhat is a man, but according to Hans Wormhat, I'm a woman because I'm overweight,

815
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:08,940
 and men never get overweight. It's, again, Jason, that's a really bizarre conspiracy theory to tack on at the ending.

816
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,940
 That conspiracy theory is what kept getting his YouTube channels yanked.

817
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,940
 Like, he was just getting deleted off of YouTube. That's really blowing up conspiracy theory,

818
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,940
 and I think it's just kind of... That's the most boring, right?

819
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:26,940
 Obviously, I don't have time to talk about the other story, but it involves what we just talked about.

820
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:41,940
 Steampunk, lost media, and possible proof that there truly was an ancient, powerful empire on the borders of Europe

821
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,940
 that was so powerful, they not only had to be wiped off the earth,

822
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:55,940
 but every mention of their name across any form of media had to be destroyed.

823
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:03,940
 But we'll get to that episode on Monday. DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address.
