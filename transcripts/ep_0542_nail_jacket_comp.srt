1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Today we take a look at the best and worst aspects of humanity.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,320
 First off, we meet a woman who has an encounter with a grey alien who's laying there helpless.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,200
 So what does she do? She takes him home and nurses him back to health.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:24,480
 And then we travel to the United Kingdom to meet a man whose reign of terror lasted almost 20 years.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,680
 A man who would sacrifice animals to Satan, put on a wig and a rubber mask,

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,560
 and then adorn himself in nails so his victims felt pain even if they tried to escape.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,320
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:50,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,320
 Hope you guys are having lots of fun. Hope you guys had fun right before you listen to this episode.

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,240
 Are having fun during it and have even more fun after it.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,160
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our returning Patreons, Elkie.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,320
 Elkie, thank you so much for supporting the show, long time listener.

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you can't support the Patreon,

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,120
 you know what to do. Just help spread the word about the show. That helps the show grow.

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,640
 That helps so, so much.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,360
 So Elkie, let's go ahead and hop in that Jason Jalopy. We're going to take a cross-country journey.

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,520
 We are headed out to Douglas, Georgia. So go ahead, control all those. You know how to drive a car,

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
 stick shift, steering wheel, things like that. There's also a little time travel button, Elkie.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,480
 Go ahead and hit that. We're going back to the year 1992. Elkie's driving us through the time

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,960
 stream. We end up in Douglasville, Georgia. It's 2 a.m. in the morning. Our little car is driving

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,240
 out in the middle of nowhere. We see a trailer kind of sitting on the outskirts of the outskirts

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,320
 of town. It's very isolated out here. Driving nice and slowly. In this trailer is a woman.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,520
 We don't have her name, but we'll call her Nancy. She's sleeping with her husband. They're trying

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:15,600
 to get some rest. But then she realizes there's a bright light outside of her trailer. So she

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,880
 gets out of bed. Her husband's fast asleep and she walks outside. The noise changed because

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,800
 she's closer, I guess, or I just forgot how I did the original noise. She sees out in this clearing.

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,040
 That's where the light is emanating from. So she's like walking through stuff. She's like moving

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,520
 corn stalks away. Apparently she's in the middle of a corn field because it's extra creepy. She gets

30
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,080
 to the clearing and she sees a mushroom-shaped object hovering about 50 feet off the ground.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,640
 And she's like, "I know my mushrooms. They normally don't hover. They definitely don't emit

32
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,840
 bright light." She begins walking towards this flying mushroom. I'm gonna say it doesn't give

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,600
 the size, but I don't think it's the actual size of a little mushroom. I assume it's UFO size. So

34
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,320
 let's say it's about 50 feet around. Pretty big, right? She's walking towards it and as she's getting

35
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:13,360
 closer, she hears a voice telepathically go, "Turn around." There's a real creepy command, right?

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,480
 No one ever tells you to turn around when something good's coming. It's always terrifying.

37
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,160
 Burglars tell you to turn around. Axe murderers tell you to turn around. Just run in those cases.

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,680
 But when an alien voice in your head tells you to turn around, nothing good's gonna happen, right?

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
 You would think you turn around and the next thing you know, you'll get a holographic sack cloth

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,960
 rubbed over your face with holographic, holographic chloroform on ya. She turns around though and

41
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,680
 none of that stuff happens. She turns around and I don't know if she stepped over it the first time,

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,800
 didn't really see it. She was so distracted by this giant UFO, mushroom UFO. Or if it teleported

43
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,360
 there afterwards, I'm not for sure, but she turns around and laying on the ground. This is a little

44
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,400
 great alien. He's just motionless. Just laying there and she's like, "What? I didn't see that.

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,840
 I wouldn't have to turn around if I'd seen that first place." Little gray aliens in there.

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,640
 She says he's about four feet tall, laying down technically. He's four feet long at this point,

47
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,520
 but she also had an interesting observation. His fingertips were like little octopus, not like

48
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:25,280
 what are those octopus arms called? Octopus arms? Tenderles? They were normal fingers, but at the

49
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,240
 end of the finger were little suction cups. She thought that was kind of weird. And also the fact

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,160
 that there's a four foot long gray alien laying in the grass. She's then given instructions from

51
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,600
 the ship. She's looking at this little alien dude and the ship says, or whoever is in the ship says,

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:50,000
 telepathically, "Take care of him. Keep him warm." So she says, "Yeah, okay. Okay, voices in my head.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,200
 I will do this." She picks up this little alien fella, takes the alien into her house, and her

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,720
 first thing is to keep it warm, body heat, which makes sense, right? She tries waking up her husband,

55
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,800
 her husband won't wake up. So this part is actually pretty invasive. This part's pretty messed up.

56
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,120
 She puts the alien in bed next to her husband. Her husband's all spooning this alien. He's like,

57
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,600
 "Oh, baby, you lost so much weight." He's saying in his sleep, "Oh, I love the feel of your skin.

58
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,360
 It feels like plastic and your octopus suckers. He's having a great dream." He's like, "Oh,

59
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,640
 you finally got that surgery I wanted." And she's like, "What are you talking about, weirdo?"

60
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,160
 She puts the gray alien in bed next to her husband, and then she crawls into bed too. So they're like,

61
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,320
 cuddling this alien, trying to keep him warm. Again, against the husband's knowledge,

62
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,480
 she can't wake him up. That's pretty common in alien encounters. Like, only one person can wake up.

63
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,120
 Obviously, a skeptic would go, "She's either dreaming or she's making it up." And she goes,

64
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,640
 "Oh, yeah, my husband was asleep the whole time." But we'll dismiss those two because they poop

65
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,440
 over the whole story. She's snuggling up with this alien, this gray alien, and her husband's

66
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,960
 snuggling up with it too. He's like, "Oh, yeah, I love this little... I love what you've done with

67
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,200
 your hair. I love how your bald and your head has gotten massive." And she's like, "Oh, my God,

68
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,080
 he has some weird fetishes." But she realizes the alien doesn't seem to be getting any better.

69
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,000
 He's just still just laying there, emotionless. So then she goes, "Okay, sandwiching him between

70
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,040
 two homo sapiens didn't work. I know what I'll do." So she takes him out to the couch. Also,

71
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,920
 probably her husband was probably burping and farting the whole time. She's like, "Oh, Gary,

72
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,320
 you're a horrible representative of humanity." She takes him outside. The alien wakes up long

73
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,440
 enough to be like, "Be you." And so she takes him out of the bedroom and puts him down on the couch.

74
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,960
 And then she makes food. She takes some saltine crackers. She's crunching them up. She pours

75
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,720
 in a little bit of warm water, which is gross, right? No one wants to eat that. No one wants to

76
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,960
 eat that. But you figure, this is probably what you give a baby or you give someone. It's the least

77
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,080
 toxic ingredient you could find. You wouldn't want to be like, "Yummy, yummy, yummy, strawberry milk,

78
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,360
 made straight out of a cow's booby." And give it to someone who might be lactose intolerant.

79
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,160
 Might not even seen a cow. Actually, they have. They've been abducting them for 100 years. But

80
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,360
 you can't go wrong with crackers and water, right? So she's making this. And the alien's laying there.

81
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,440
 And then she gets a little spoon and she holds it up to his mouth and he goes, "Mmm."

82
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:28,240
 He eats some of it. So she's like, "Huck rock, goodbye alien. In your spaceship.

83
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:37,120
 Don't know the rest of the words." And she's just feeding the alien this stuff. And then she says she

84
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,240
 loses time. She's feeding the alien the saltine and water. And the next thing she knows,

85
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,360
 she's standing outside in front of this object again. And the alien is now standing up.

86
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
 He's standing underneath the ship and this beam comes down and he goes,

87
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,240
 gets teleported into the ship. She's like, "You didn't say thank you for all those crackers.

88
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,640
 You didn't even pay me the money, man. You know, that was what I'm supposed to put in my soup tomorrow."

89
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,280
 But she doesn't say that. She looks over and she sees five other great aliens. And she said,

90
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,440
 they were lined up in military style. So like shoulder to shoulder, I guess. And they all just

91
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,400
 stood there staring at her. She's looking at them and she's like, "Well, I could go buy more crackers

92
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,880
 if you want." But and she said the aliens would turn and then one by one walk into the beam of light

93
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:31,440
 and get teleported back up into the ship. The next one to walk up. And then after the fifth one had

94
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,040
 been sucked up into the ship, she said the ship disappeared with the sound of a thunder crack.

95
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,160
 C-CRAP!

96
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:45,920
 She's like, "What's up with the thunder crack? What's that? I didn't sound like thunder crack.

97
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,120
 Sounded like some guy like playing NBA Jam or something like that. What was that? Boom shaka

98
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,200
 lock out the ship takes off." And so that's the end of that story. I think it's a interesting story

99
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,400
 because you have, this is one of the stories that you can really put yourself into the place of the

100
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 person. Like some of the stories people get abducted and they're like strapped down and aliens

101
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,080
 putting needles in their brain and they're so extreme. Like you would think what you would do

102
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,120
 in that story but most of them come down to, you really don't have much choice, right? The aliens

103
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,760
 have teleported you aboard their ship. You're in a cage. Oh, let me out. Let me out. The cage next

104
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,120
 to you contains a bear. The cage to the left is some hysterical person. Your options are pretty

105
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,480
 limited. You can stay in the cage or they take you out of the cage and they run experiments on you.

106
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,760
 This is a story where the person has a lot of options and I think it's such a uplifting story.

107
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,360
 I think this is what would happen in most cases. We covered a story a couple weeks back about the

108
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,360
 lumberjacks who came across an alien who was dying in the river and he's like, "Don't touch me. Here's

109
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,320
 my, here's how we do our final rites and stuff like that." The lumberjack was just kind of listening

110
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,520
 to him trying to console him. I think those stories are how a lot of, if we weren't in an

111
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,720
 abduction scenario, I think most, yesterday we even talked about a woman who gave an alien an

112
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,640
 exorcism. I think in the most case, humans are very benevolent. I think that we do tend to do

113
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,080
 terrible things, but in a vacuum, I think humans tend to do the right thing. I think if an alien

114
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,480
 came to you asking for help, I think one, if a normal human came to you asking for help and you

115
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,760
 didn't think it was some sort of scam or setup, you would help them. If you honestly believed

116
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,440
 that they needed help and you didn't think that they were trying to rip you off, you would help them.

117
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,360
 And I think an alien, obviously, he's not like, "Hey, are you going to have some money?"

118
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,760
 You're like, "Are you going to spend it on space drugs?" He's like, "Uhhh." And the next thing you

119
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,840
 know you're abducted, you're being turned into space drugs. If an alien is just laying there and

120
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,880
 he's like, "Uhhh, I'm super cold and I need help. I've been wounded." I think most people would

121
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,680
 take care of it. In a vacuum, obviously, if you're a professional alien hunter or if you need some

122
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,280
 new alien skin boots, you might chop the dude up. But actually, now that I say that, we've covered

123
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,800
 a ton of stories where aliens seem to be able to know who to appear in front of. So if you're

124
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,840
 never seen an alien, it's because they're choosing not to be seen by you. Even if you haven't seen a

125
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,720
 UFO, they're choosing not to be seen by you. It's supposed to a ghost, which simply just manifests

126
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,600
 in an area. Aliens seem to be a little more picky, so they may have been flying around Douglasville

127
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
 and this alien's like, "I'm not going to make it, dude." They're like, "No, no, we're going to fly to

128
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,320
 TaiPet. We know this guy out there. He's totally going to be good at it. He's all, "Blehhhhh." He's

129
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,480
 like, "I'm not going to make it, man. Just pick someone. Just pick someone." Finally, they were able

130
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:36,720
 to psychically select this woman who they knew would mother this alien rather than smother this alien.

131
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,160
 This was the only two choices, right? Elkie, let's go ahead and hob in that carboner copter. We're

132
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,760
 going to wave goodbye to Nancy. I noticed Elkie has a new pair of alien skin boots. I'm like, "Elkie."

133
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,880
 We're getting in that carboner copter. Elkie, take us out of Douglasville, Georgia. We're headed

134
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,760
 out to the United Kingdom. I'm going to warn you guys as he's taking this flight. This is one of

135
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,600
 those stories that's a little dark. It's a little depressing, so if you've been having a great day,

136
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,200
 you might not want to listen to it. It's not uber dark, but it's pretty intense. So if that's not

137
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,680
 your cup of tea, I'll see you tomorrow. If it is, if you're some sort of weirdo who likes reading

138
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,280
 and hearing about this stuff, stay on board the carboner copter. Elkie's like, "I don't have a

139
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:29,520
 choice." I was like, "No." Carboner copter is headed out to Groville. That sounds like a place

140
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,200
 from Sesame Street, but it's a real place, apparently. Groville, that's on the island of Jersey

141
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,480
 in the United Kingdom. It's 1957. Carboner copter is going to land in Groville. And as we're walking

142
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,800
 into town, we see an orphanage. There's a woman. She's waving to all the kids. She's like, "Where

143
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,320
 are we going? We're orphans." She's like, "Oh yeah, come back. Come back." They're like, "Oh."

144
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,200
 I'm sure they go to school. I'm sure eventually the orphanage is like a prison

145
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,080
 where you just have to watch Annie 24/7. You're like, "Oh, this is the real torture." I think,

146
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,400
 you know, you go out to go to school and stuff like that. But anyways, she's like hanging out

147
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,640
 with all these kids and stuff like that. We're walking by the orphanage and we see a bunch of

148
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,960
 kids having fun. We see the woman who runs it and then we see her husband, Edward Paisnell.

149
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,920
 He's 35 years old and he's building a little room on the side of the orphanage. Because he's a

150
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,720
 construction worker. This is the sound of a hammer. Now, both of them are pillars of the community.

151
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,760
 She's super well known. She's a great surrogate mother to all of these children and he is just

152
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,600
 known as being a great guy, all-around great guy. He needed something built. He was there. If you

153
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,120
 provided you had money, he doesn't run a charity. His wife runs a charity. And when he's not out

154
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,000
 doing construction work, he's just someone you kind of want to hang out with. Both of these people

155
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 were examples for how people should act. He actually, every year, played Santa Claus in town.

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,120
 That was his reputation. But it was a false reputation. At the house, he had his own private

157
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,280
 room. There's a place that no one was supposed to go. And that wouldn't re... To me, that would be

158
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,440
 very suspicious. But I guess that's a thing. Sometimes men have like... I get that men have

159
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,680
 like the man cave and they have like stuff in their houses. They'll have their den. But it's

160
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,880
 never like, "Don't go in there!" It's like your wife goes in to like ring you a magazine. What are

161
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,080
 you doing here? Like, I've been in houses with dens. I don't think my family ever had it. My dad

162
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,160
 had like a workspace because again he was a minister. But like, we'd go in there and make

163
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,840
 photocopies and stuff like that. He wouldn't be like, "What are you doing?" He's like,

164
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,560
 crawling on the ceiling. His head spins around. "Get out!" It was just a place that he went to work,

165
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,560
 but it wasn't off limits. This dude, Edward, has a room that was off limits to everybody.

166
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,120
 And he would go into this room sometime just to work. You know, he's a handyman. He's going to

167
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,480
 go in there. He's just going to try out those new nails he's heard so much about. These nails have

168
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 points on both end. So he goes in there and there's this red curtain against the wall.

169
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,560
 But he ignores that for now. It's not time to unveil the red curtain. He opens up a box

170
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:25,040
 and inside it is a rubber mask. He pulls it over his face.

171
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,520
 [gurgling]

172
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,760
 There's a blonde woman's wig that he is now wearing as well. He goes to his closet

173
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:42,880
 and there sits a heavy trench coat. It's studded with nails. He puts on his cuffs

174
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,400
 that have nails sticking out of them as well. Then he turns to the red curtain, throws it back.

175
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,080
 It's his altar to Satan. At that point, I guess this episode's darker than I remember it, at that

176
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:05,280
 point, there's a cage rattling in the corner of his dark private room. An animal he had caught

177
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:15,040
 days before. A rabbit, a cat, a lost puppy. He reaches in to the cage and pulls the animal out

178
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,200
 and sacrifices it on the altar. That's just the beginning of his night.

179
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:29,280
 His reign of terror started back in 1957 and what he would do is late at night when he'd see a

180
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:37,520
 young woman standing at a bus stop waiting for a ride. He'd sneak up behind her and throw a noose

181
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,160
 over her neck and pull it tight. There's no fighting back from that. There really isn't.

182
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:51,840
 He would then lead them like cattle off into the outskirts of town and sexually assault them.

183
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:59,520
 Even if you could somehow struggle against the noose around your neck, I mean that would

184
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:06,240
 cause such a shock to your system. Even if you're somehow able to maintain your sanity

185
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,120
 and fight against the noose around your neck, he was studded with nails. Every time you pushed

186
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,960
 against him, every time he pushed against you, you would be poked, you would be scratched,

187
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:25,760
 you would be pierced. His entire body was a weapon. But like we see with all of these sickos,

188
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:33,600
 he doesn't end there. They can go back and they can always say this peeping Tom, the reason why

189
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,720
 they're so hard on peeping Tom's and people who expose themselves in public, some people go, "Hey,

190
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,960
 I was just peeing and now I'm a registered sex offender." The reason why the law is so harsh on

191
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:54,480
 them is, one, it's gross, but two, a lot of times it leads to other actions. The peeping Tom isn't

192
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,840
 satisfied with just looking in the windows of coeds while he was in college for four years.

193
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,440
 It escalates. He starts off by doing this. He's attacking women at bus stops. And these are women

194
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,480
 who are 19, 20 years old, old enough to be standing outside waiting for a bus late at night, getting

195
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,280
 off work, leaving a friend's house, something like that. This guy's derangement, that's not enough.

196
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:30,320
 He needs to make sure no woman in the city is safe. Anywhere. He would begin to stake out houses

197
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,280
 during the day, which would be very easy for a construction worker. It's one of the few jobs.

198
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,440
 Electrician is one that you can do this. Obviously, like police, you could do this super easily, but

199
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,040
 as far as civilian jobs, construction workers, electricians, plumbers, they give you access to

200
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,720
 houses. But also, if you see a carpenter, if you see a construction worker, if you see an electrician

201
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,240
 working on something for a prolonged period of time, it's not even going to ring a bell. If you

202
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
 saw a garbage man outside your house for five hours, that would be kind of weird. But if you saw

203
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,760
 an electrician poking around your neighbor's house, he gets hired to work in your neighbor's house,

204
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,320
 he'd seem to walk in back and forth between his van. You're not really going to think anything of it.

205
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,320
 He will be able to stake out your house, and you really wouldn't even think about it.

206
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,920
 He begins to watch houses. He begins to keep track of the houses that have young girls.

207
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:25,520
 He begins to keep track of what rooms these young girls sleep in. So in the middle of the night,

208
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,280
 in the place where you should feel the safest, Edward would crawl into these young girls' windows,

209
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:38,080
 wearing a rubber mask, a blonde wig, and an outfit covered with nails.

210
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:46,800
 There was 13 no-one attacks that he committed, combined with the bus stops and the house invasions.

211
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:54,240
 This went on from 1957 was his first attack. It wasn't until July 10th, 1971,

212
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,560
 that he was finally caught. Police were obviously looking for this guy, but they had no description

213
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,120
 of him. You could probably get a height description. His costume, his uniform, served two purposes. One,

214
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,720
 it completely concealed his identity. Secondly, it was terrifying. And I can almost imagine at

215
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,040
 first, when he was first attacking the adult women, I'm sure the first one or two, the police

216
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:24,880
 probably didn't even believe it was true. It's so insane. But it was true. July 10th,

217
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:32,320
 1971, Edward is driving down the road and there's an officer who sees him commit some sort of routine

218
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,480
 traffic violation. Just making a turn without turn signal, not having a tail light. It was

219
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,720
 something super routine that should have just been, "Here, Edward, pillar of the community,

220
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,560
 Santa Claus every year. Here is your ticket. You're free to go." That would have been the end of it,

221
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,120
 but Edward had something in his car that would elicit more questions. So when this cop turns

222
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,320
 on his siren, Edward hits the gas and a high-speed chase ensues. At this point, the police are like,

223
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,560
 "I don't care if it's a bus or tail light or not. You're out running us. We're bringing in everyone

224
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,400
 to get you." So they finally are able to get this guy to pull over and lo and behold, in his car,

225
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,240
 is a trench coat with nails sticking out of it, a rubber mask and a blonde wig. There's actually

226
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,560
 photos of this and it is as terrifying as you would imagine it. You can look in the show notes

227
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:30,160
 and see photos of this. Now the police obviously had been looking for this guy for, again, almost 20

228
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:38,240
 years. They'd attacked 13 different people. Edward, okay, there's routine traffic stop.

229
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,240
 You're speeding away. We thought that was suspicious, but what is that doing in your car?

230
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,960
 Why do you have this outfit now? He goes, "Oh, that? What? That? Oh, sorry, officer. I'm just on my way

231
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,320
 to an orgy." It was his actual excuse. And here's a little tip, not to help out future criminals,

232
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,760
 but if you get busted, don't name something else gross, right, as your alibi. I mean, I guess,

233
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,080
 I always had a rule. Like, if I wanted to call in sick to work, I'd always tell him I had diarrhea,

234
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,080
 because no one wants any follow-up questions to that. You just go, "I have diarrhea," and they just

235
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,360
 totally let you go. I guess that's the equivalent. The difference was that I was calling in to work.

236
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,640
 I wasn't trying to outrun the police. I don't think the cops are going to be like, "Oh, diarrhea.

237
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,160
 You're free to go." So they bust this guy. They take the suit and they search his house,

238
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,920
 and they find the altar. And they're like, "They don't really need any other evidence at this point."

239
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,480
 I think the cops are really just like, "We want to know why he was doing this stuff. We don't really

240
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,480
 buy his orgy theory. We know all the good orgies in town, and there wasn't one that night."

241
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,680
 They find the altar. They find the remains of these animals. They start questioning the wife,

242
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,480
 and they're like, "Why would he be going out and doing this stuff?" And she said, "We never had sex.

243
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,720
 Like, we'd been married, but it was in name only. We have never, ever had sex."

244
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,680
 So the cops are like, "Okay, well then, yeah, he didn't do this because he didn't have sex.

245
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:03,040
 It's not her fault." But it shows that he couldn't be intimate in a way that wasn't ultra violent.

246
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,640
 And if he had done that to his wife, his ruse would have been exposed.

247
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,800
 He gets sentenced to 30 years in prison. So good job. I always complain about the

248
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,160
 justice system in England, in the United Kingdom, because they're constantly letting people go all

249
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,800
 the time. Oh, wait. He only served 10 years. Sorry. And he did serve 10 years, and he moved back to

250
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,640
 that town. He goes, "Hey, everyone, remember me? Edward, pillar of the community. I'm out now."

251
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:37,120
 That's nothing for 13 attacks over the course of 20 years. He serves 10. He got good behavior.

252
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,640
 England's really good about just letting people go because they're nice in prison. They're like,

253
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,800
 "Well, you didn't kill anyone in prison where there's guards everywhere, and everyone's your

254
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,120
 physical equal. You did good here. Let's put you back out in society, dude." So anyways,

255
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,360
 he's walking around. He was eventually, he was very quickly run out of that city. The people

256
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,480
 in town did not want him there. He ended up dying three years later. He lived, they didn't let him

257
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,880
 live there. He moved to the Isle of Wight. So maybe they have a lower, maybe they have a lower

258
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,920
 threshold for sickos, or they just didn't get the newspaper. That's the story of Edward, or it would

259
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:18,720
 be, because those are the 13 known attacks that he had. In 2008, they were doing renovations at the

260
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:26,240
 orphanage where him and his wife lived. And while they were doing renovations, they found a child's

261
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:34,800
 skull buried there. There was actually reports of several missing children in the area, but they

262
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,640
 were never solved. And over a 20-year time span, especially if the children who went missing were

263
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:50,160
 orphans, cases just slowly went cold. This man who got caught for 13 brutal assaults, did 10 years in

264
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,640
 prison and returned home, may have actually also been a murderer. And it wouldn't really surprise

265
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,720
 any of us, right? A man with that much darkness in his heart. He's sacrificing live animals.

266
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,760
 He's breeding fear in a community, snatching women from bus stops, breaking into young girls' homes.

267
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:19,440
 That would all just be a prelude to the act of taking a child's life. Darkness never stops.

268
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:29,840
 It is never satiated. It will always push you to get darker and darker and darker until you exist

269
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:38,240
 in a world that is so black you never knew you could be somewhere so devoid of light. A place

270
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:48,240
 few humans could even imagine. And even when you stand on that precipice, you still want more. Evil

271
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,120
 is never satisfied.
