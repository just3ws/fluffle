 Today we meet a doctor who operates out of an RV and says that he's capable of performing almost any operation
 Because he learned at the best school of all YouTube
 Now we meet a man who believes that vaccines are actually full of tiny UFOs
 Why you ask because he believes that all germs are actually cryptids today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 *Music*
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys have a great weekend
 This is our Friday episode. I hope you guys have a lot of fun this weekend
 We are going to give one more shout out to Veronica the Haunted Doll. She is our co-host for this week
 She's always hanging out around the recording studio, but I got it right next to the mic. Let's hear it listen to her
 *Music*
 See that's Veronica saying what's up?
 That's Veronica's
 Let's give a shout out to one of our legacy patreon supporters right now Sergeant Clowney

 You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you can't support the patreon
 That's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show that really really helps out a lot leave reviews tell your friends talk about it online
 Really really helps the show grow sergeant clowny. Let's go ahead and hop in the dead rabbit dune buggy
 We haven't used that one in a while
 Jumping over sand dunes war pups chasing us the second we put the key in the war pups are right on us go sergeant clowny go go
 They're trying to throw bombs at us, but they suck they can't do it. We're headed out to Nevada
 That's why we want to have this dead rabbit dune buggy. We're headed out to the perpetual desert known as Nevada a lot of this information
 I got from an article on oxygen. It's a website called oxygen. It was written by Ali Vander Hayden
 So appreciate that one to give the journalist a shout out here. We're taking that dead rabbit dune buggy
 We're gonna go through a time travel cave and we're now in the year 2012
 We pull up outside of this broken down RV in the middle of nowhere a k a anywhere in Nevada
 And inside the RV right now is a young man. His name is Randy David Valenzuela, Jr.
 Now Randy has HIV and he'd been taking a bunch of medication for it
 His doctor was like, okay, you know, this is treatable like we can at least keep you alive
 Right, that's no longer the death sentence that it used to be but you're gonna have to take this cocktail of pills
 But Randy wanted a cure Randy wanted things to change
 He was on the medication for seven years
 But he honestly believed that there was a cure out there somewhere and he finds the answer to that cure on Craigslist of all places
 Right on Craigslist. He meets a man named Rick van Thiel and he goes to this dirty old RV which should be your first
 Sign that something's not right. The doctor says hey, yeah, come to my office. It's in the middle of nowhere
 You're gonna have to walk past five dead cats to get to it
 But there you go
 He walks into this RV and there is dr. Rick. It's the name he went by Rick van Thiel
 Rick van Thiel goes I can cure I can cure AIDS
 See the government doesn't want people to know that the cure for AIDS is out there because they make more money from selling the pharmaceuticals
 Then they are for treating it, but I've invented this thing called ozone therapy
 I'm gonna put these needles in your arm and then your blood gets sucked into this machine and it gets processed and it comes back
 And goes into your other arm totally works. It's a hundred and twenty dollars a day
 You have to do it for eight weeks straight and Randy's in Randy is ten toes into this thing
 He's like let's do it. So he actually goes through eight weeks of therapy and he feels better. He feels better afterwards
 He tells his mom about the doctor his mom is Dominguez Valenzuela. She's like oh, this doctor so amazing
 He can see he's curing HIV and the mom's like oh really can I meet him and
 he's like
 Well, yeah, but but don't judge a book by his cover show the mom goes there
 They show up to the trailer and the door opens up and dr. Rick's like hey, what's up? Randy awesome?
 You're here. You're here for your other treatment. Oh, is that your mom? Oh, it's so nice to meet you
 The mom's standing there and she's thinking wait a second. This is a doctor first off
 We're in the middle of nowhere. That's the worrisome thing number one two. He's operating out of an RV three
 Dr. Rick is completely naked
 Dr. Rick's medical office was also where he he made porn in there, which is great
 Right when you want to go get treated for assist
 You want to go have something pulled out of you? It's great to know that people were banging on the operating table right before you got there
 He shot porn there. He actually like when the police so you know where this story is going when the police go into the place
 There's like shelves of medical supplies
 It's just stuff randomly shrewn about and then porn videos on top of the medical supply if you're lucky
 porn videos on top of the medical supplies there are also sex toys everywhere
 So again like going to the doctor's not the most comfortable thing to begin with but imagine if you walked into your doctor's
 Office and you sit down and you're like whoa wait what I sit on and there's like a plug there
 There's like a french tickler. You're like what you're trying different chairs. You're like oh this one this one's kind of comfortable
 It's a porn studio
 Doctors office in the middle of nowhere when the police eventually do show up one of the detectives said it reminded him of a saw movie
 There was so much not like blood on the walls, but he said there was so much like just bloody stuff around bloody tools
 Hopefully again just bloody tools that the cops like hey dude come over here look at this the other cops like nah
 Nah, the dude's like pointing out a box that's labeled sex toys is like no if you thought that was bloody cost like no no no no
 Seriously, I'm about to quit. I don't want to look. I don't want to know what's in that box
 So what happens is well, let's back up a little bit
 Randy takes another HIV test and it comes up negative now apparently one out of every 12 like self-administered tests for HIV
 Comes back negative. It's a pretty high percentage for very very serious illness, right?
 So he thinks he's cured there is no cure for it
 Unfortunately, he thinks he's cured and then he contracts it again or really he just he took another test and it showed that
 He still had it so he begins going back to dr. Ricks and
 He starts doing the treatment again, but the mom's like it was different the second time like he didn't have him come every day
 It was just a totally different setup
 Randy passes away three weeks later after visiting dr. Rick again
 And so the mom alerts authorities to what's going on there now
 He didn't get charged with Randy's death because he didn't do any like Randy died of complications due to I think it was drug abuse
 because he was using meth it was like drug abuse and
 Just HIV it was a bad combination
 So the cops go because you can't practice medicine without a license the cops go to the place they see the mess
 They obviously know that it's not legal the ozone machine that was pumping blood in and out of this dude
 He wouldn't clean so if you had hepatitis C and he's like oh, I know how to cure that ozone
 You weren't getting blood that was HIV infected. You're like oh, I have a serious case of the munchies
 I probably shouldn't smoke all that weed. He's like oh, I have a cure for the munchies ozone therapy
 He used this machine for everything
 Bloody tools would be used on one person that person would leave and then another person would show up
 You get hepatitis C get all sorts of horrible disease HIV all sorts of horrible diseases from this place
 There's a video of him on YouTube. It's disgusting. I watched it. He's naked
 They don't show anything but they show him take his clothes off and he removes a cyst from a guy's back and the guys like ow
 ow ow ow ow ow ow and the doctor's like just hold it he's like
 Pops it out looks like a little chicken nugget popping out of this dude totally on YouTube this guy
 It's a video and he said he goes the way
 I know how to do all these procedures is I watched the procedures on YouTube and then he knows how to do it
 He was performing abortions here
 So basically any possible procedure you could think of you need a tooth pulled there you go
 You need a film you need to film a porn there you go
 It was a one-stop shop for everything now
 He was a believer of the sovereign citizen movement, which is basically this super bizarre movement
 Where your name is actually a corporation name and the government
 I don't even know if I can explain it in less than three minutes
 The when you are born your your name is spelt in all caps
 Which makes you a corporation and then the government then takes a loan out against the corporation of Jason Carpenter
 So if I file it means one of two things one
 There's a secret code that if I file some court paperwork and say the right things in court
 The government goes oh great. He figured it out and I get all the money
 That's been accumulated under my corporation. That's one weird part of it. The second weird part is
 You don't believe that laws really apply to you because you never agreed to become a US citizen
 You were born on US soil, but you never signed a contract or became a US citizen
 So a lot of times you can watch YouTube videos. They don't believe that they're driving through town. They'll be in a car
 They're not in a cloud car. They're not caribabers floating around like they are actually driving through a town
 But when they get stopped by the police they go I'm not driving
 I'm traveling and apparently in the Constitution like you can't be stopped when you're traveling or people have a right to travel
 So they believe the right combination of words will get them out of trouble
 Those videos almost always end with cops busting their windows open and pulling them out of the car
 So it doesn't really work that well, but he was one of these guys
 He was one of these guys who believes in the sovereign citizen movement
 So he didn't believe that he needed a license YouTube was good enough for him
 He'd watch a YouTube video on sister move all and then remove a cyst
 But I'm wondering if there was a weird like cycle where he just started watching his own video of him removing his cyst
 And he's like oh this guy's awesome. He's naked and he knows that oh, that's me
 Then he just goes in and starts popping cysts out of people
 He ends up getting arrested and then he hangs himself in jail before he can serve time
 He wasn't facing murder charges for this guy
 But he was definitely facing a lot of time for practicing without a license and doing it so many times and recording evidence of it
 So it's try obviously. I think that's a tragic ending. I don't like when people kill themselves
 He probably would have done like five or ten years and gotten out, but he was also kind of old at the time
 So still still though he ended up hanging himself in 2017
 So that's the story of dr. Rick. He needed a procedure done. There you go 120 bucks. You couldn't I mean you're probably
 Here's the thing with that sure you get the cyst removed, but then you're like the couple days later
 You're like oh, why are my eyes yellow? They're like oh you come in you got you got jaundice you got jaundice
 I don't know probably totally unrelated to my bloody tools, but here you go come back in we'll fix that
 So then he's pumping out your jaundice blood and you're like oh, I feel so much better now and couple days later
 You're like oh, why do I have the avian flu doctors like oh, I don't know I don't know
 There's a bunch of birds. There's a bunch of birds waiting in the in the waiting room reading magazines
 He's like I don't know but come back. We'll cure as we actually not think about it. It's actually a really good
 That's a really good scheme what you do is you treat the patient for the illness
 They have but give them a new illness and you just keep that cycle going you just keep it going and and
 While you're there you could be like so you like movies and you're like yeah sure
 I mean could you just get this cyst out of my back and cure the ten other diseases
 I've gone recently like yeah, yeah, yeah, but to relax. Let's put on this movie
 So you're like slaying there you can't move you're getting cysts removed and you have to watch one of his porn movies that actually
 It's funny. Let me wrap it up like this
 I forgot to say this detail they found when the cops are investigating this they're getting a bunch of people to come forward
 Women were saying oh, we didn't have to pay
 Sometimes we would just have sex with him and he would perform the procedure for free
 And you're like okay, you know fine, whatever and then they go on on on on no sometimes
 He would have sex with us while performing the procedure
 I don't care if he's a sexy as a woman on the planet if I'm removing cysts from you while we're making love
 If you can't hear that that's just me shaking my head there is no way
 Anyone could do that apparently this guy could but he would have sex with women while performing procedures
 I hope I really hope I actually looked for some of this guy's porn movies and I couldn't find them
 And and I'm very very thankful of that. I was trying to do my due diligence
 I said there must be some of these videos out there because he made a bunch of them
 They showed clips of them on the news
 What medical procedure could you possibly do and at the same time have sex with a woman? I
 I'm not even gonna even gonna think about that. So instead
 Sergeant clowny. He's like he's already in the carbonic after he's trying to get the buddies like cologne work work
 Okay, wait for us wait for us. We're leaving behind this little shack in Nevada. We are headed out to
 Helicopters flying around we are headed out to a little field
 We land it's nothing but grass grass as far as the eye can see we all step out of the carbonic hopter
 We look it's beautiful out here the skies blues couple white clouds in the sky birds flying around we're like, oh great
 They're like, you know where doctor we can go to
 We got cysts. We're like sorry dude birds fly away and as we're sitting in this grass field
 I turn to you. I have a podium and I walk up to it and I go
 New today on digital and Haitian Thomas Jane starring the gripping psychological thriller the vanished
 Directed by Peter Fastinelli a family vacation takes a terrifying turn when two parents discover that the young daughter has vanished without a trace
 Stopping at nothing to find her the search for the truth leads to a shocking revelation
 Where nothing is what it seems in this intense thriller own or rent the vanished on digital today and watch it at home tonight
 Raided are from paramount pictures
 So I step off the podium and now we're standing in this field of grass
 We're sitting in this grass field though because of this post I want to talk about now
 Recently AZ sent me to the reddit for gang stalking and I was like, oh my god
 This is so insane and I did a story about a guy who was being gangstalked by his own family
 It's like this is nuts and then like anyone who ever finds anything on the internet
 They realize that that it's never truly the end Chris founder of the golden rabbit brigade a longtime supporter of the show
 Chris sends me a link. He goes. Oh, yeah gang stalking, right? That's a thing
 But have you heard of gang stalking MK ultra subreddit? And I was like I have not I
 Have not good sir. So I pulled it up and it wouldn't make the people in the gang stalking subreddit blush
 It's so insane
 There is a guy from gang stalking MK ultra who's now posting on
 Gangstalking subreddit and people are like you're crazy. That's how nuts this stuff is
 So, thank you Chris and thank you AZ both you guys for turning me on to this crazy subreddit world on the gang stalking MK ultra subreddit
 There's a username. Don't chill me bro. The last time that this account posted anything was about three years ago
 I believe they're still posting under different a different name, but we'll get into that later
 But right now let's take a look at this. So
 This is from a post labeled a theory germs are cryptids
 You're like that is actually an interesting conspiracy theory
 It's not so far off from monkeys don't exist or that mountains are really trees like you you get a sense of it right from the beginning
 Germs are cryptids. They're too small for us to really see it's one of those things that we take
 Scientist advice on what they are because we don't know they're looking through the microscope and they're like hmm
 It appears that the virus is multiplying at a rapid rate and we're like can we see and he's like no no
 This is my microscope. You can't see you got to bring your own you got to find your own viruses
 We have to take them out their words. So germs are cryptids are actually a very interesting conspiracy theory, but that's not all
 It's not all that would actually be enough. I would be really interested to see just someone explore that not this guy
 Not this guy. So that's promising right? That's very promising conspiracy theory. Let's see what this guy has to say about germs are cryptids
 Quote I had a realization when you wear fur or sleep on the grass and wake up itchy for about 15 minutes
 It's 1500 years while everyone builds swords and chases aliens
 Stand in the middle of the middle of this grassy field
 And you look at me and you go way way way wait what what is any of that have to do with your weight?
 How do you even parse that out at all? Let me read this again now that the shock factor is worn off
 This is a real sentence a human constructed. I had a realization when you wear fur or sleep on the grass and
 Wake up itchy for about 15 minutes. It's 1500 years while everyone builds swords and chases aliens
 And you go Jason. That's obviously taken out of context. You're reading the first sentence of this post
 He must clarify that and so what does that mean? So when you fall asleep on the grass?
 Let's break it down when you wear fur when you're putting on fur or when you fall asleep in the grass
 After about 15 minutes, you'll start itching which we know is caused by chiggers
 It's little bugs in the grass that bite you and make you itch
 but he's saying that if you wear fur or you sleep in the grass what actually happens is
 1500 years passes and
 Society evolves where everyone starts building swords and fighting aliens at least like that's what I'm thinking saying, okay?
 So there's like there's 15 minutes in our world and then 1500 years and in other world where this is going on
 What is this has to do with germs? I'm not for sure, but this is literally his first sentence in this passage
 So then he goes on to say you can test it for yourself
 You can test this theory for yourself
 There's actually a bunch of nonsense in between there. He talks about icillipho pods which aren't real a
 Cellophopod is a mollusk like an octopus but then he has a picture of this weird like monster and
 keeps calling it an icillipho pod and then says I don't know what it is
 So I'm actually skipping I'm skipping some of the nonsense because some of it's just so random
 He starts talking about goat men and deer wear fur and maybe that's why we itch
 It's like some genetic thing. We're not related to gomen or we're the gomen don't exist
 So we're definitely not related to them, but we're not related to deer either
 So I'm actually sparing you some of the insanity. It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense at all. What in the world?
 Dude, where's a goat man coming out in this? I love it too because he goes this is that this is the next sentence
 I'll read you this
 This is the next sentence after he talks about 15 minutes. It's 1500 years
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
 So for example goat man maybe and actual deer are from wearing fur or the genetic memory of such what does that mean?
 What does that mean and it's great that you're even saying I don't know maybe the goman's involved
 I don't know. I don't know you gotta ask the goman. What is a goat man? Is it chupacabra?
 Is it a satyr? Is it who is the goat man? I was wondering I imagine it's some sort of actual cryptid
 But then it's just a deer
 It's just a deer running around but apparently there's some sort of genetic myth. I've never I don't think I've ever worn fur
 I have worn fur actually in plays in costumes and I've worn fur for hours. I've never itched
 But anyways, so let's get back. There's more nonsense, but let's get to
 There's here's the thing there's nonsense and then there's nonsense that kind of makes sense
 And I could just read off nonsensical phrases all day long, but it's just mind-numbing
 It's totally mind-numbing. Let me move to a part where it this part
 Okay, this part at least makes a little bit of sense now
 You know where in the middle of a grass field because he goes you can test it for yourself
 You can test this theory about goat men and deer and grass
 Here you go quote
 sleep on the grass with no shirt and
 When you think about your back think put it here
 Eventually you will get a sand flea
 Which I don't know that is maybe that's another term for a chigger but
 And when you think about your back think put it here
 So you're you're commanding something to get on your back
 When you think about your back think put it here eventually you will get a sand flea or dinosaur
 or something
 There's a huge difference obviously
 Do I have to explain this there's a huge difference between a flea a flea on my back and a triceratops
 So you can get a sand flea or a dinosaur or something or nothing really is what's gonna happen
 But let's continue here. You have itch. I'm not gonna complain about the grammar
 I'm not gonna complain about the grammar in this post because so much of it doesn't make sense anyways
 You're already laying on our backs
 Thinking put it here and then dinosaurs show up. That's mind-boggling enough
 That's mind-boggling enough that someone could write that and go that'll work that that makes sense
 Here's the rest of it
 You think yeah sand flea or dinosaur or something and you have itch for about 15 minutes
 After it stops itching
 Think about what you were thinking about on your back. So I want you okay. So that's perfect
 We'll pause here before we move on to what he says
 You've been laying on your back. You say put it here something is on your back now most likely just grass
 Maybe a dinosaur we're laying all here for 15 minutes. What are you thinking of?
 Here's what he goes after it stops itching think about what you were thinking about on your back
 swords and caves
 So apparently that's where he's getting the 15 minutes to 1500 year time jump where
 When he's on his back 1500 years have passed at some point and I don't know in human history in that time period
 But apparently when he lay wherever he lays down he thinks of swords and caves
 I'll tell you this right now
 I'm not a psychoanalysis dude at any way shape or form. I've never been trained in it. That is sexual, right?
 Like that's just armchair psychology 101 swords and caves whenever he lays down
 He's like oh, yeah, my sword my sword is going in and out of that cave
 I remember once I came across something a long time ago and it said people who fantasize might have mentioned this before on the show
 People who fantasize about hiding underground want to crawl back into their mom's womb
 And then I was thinking oh man. I was thinking about all I was thinking about all the times
 I was like dude if zombies ever attack I'm gonna have like an underground bunker
 So like the zombies can't bust down a door if there's no door
 It's just like an underground bunker or like the cops are surrounding my place. They're like you're way too cool, bro
 We're gonna like blow you up and I'm like no way cops and then I like run
 They're the cool police. I run and I hide in a bunker
 I've always thought about hiding in bunkers, and then I'm like oh great. Thanks psychoanalysis guy
 I gotta figure out another place from zombies actually by the time zombies attack. I'm not gonna care what that guy thinks
 I'm not gonna be like all my let zombies eat me. Just no one thinks I'm a pervert
 At least at least no one thinks that I'm weird is there ripping my limbs one for one. I'm going in that bunker, dude
 I'm going in that bunker, but that's me
 I'm gonna this guy because if every time you lay down you think of swords and caves
 That's definitely sexual and then he says then he says this you can cure this you can cure this what we're curing
 I don't know. I'm assuming we're trying to cure the germ remember when this started off with germs or cryptids
 Then it wasn't that a nice quaint conspiracy theory. Here's here's where we're going quote you can train it
 Practice making the cure faster and faster. What are we?
 What's going faster and faster is the sword in and out of the cave that's okay?
 So I'm not let's not imagining the swords in the caves dude, but what cure are you talking about you can train it
 Practice making the cure faster and faster you can talk to the people all I show my back
 Ankle's is to claws coming out of a cave and they go get it. What are you talking about?
 So he's walking down the street, right? He's no longer laying on his back
 He's walking on the street and he sees people and he's like hey guys look at my look at my calves
 Look at him people on the street like what and the guys like uh-huh. Yeah, they see the claws in the cave
 Then he walks away people like what is going on?
 They're cured. They've been cured. They've been cured of all their diseases all I show is my back or ankles is to claws coming out of a cave
 And they get it some people so here now we're gonna get back into
 The germ stuff we're slowly becoming sane again
 Some people can clear their germ in less than five seconds mine takes about a minute if you don't have swords
 It'll take 1,000 years
 so
 I
 Don't know
 Even me it almost feels like a coded message
 It almost seems like there's some guy in
 Washington DC and some CIA headquarters and he saw this on red and he's like it's a go guys
 We know where was Thomas at?
 Helicopters flying out like it's so random. It seems like it's some sort of code
 Some people can clear their germ in less than five seconds. What germ he still hasn't explained
 Is it the back ankle claw germ? We don't know or is it all germs? We don't know but anyways
 Some people can clear their germ in less than five seconds mine. It takes about a minute if you don't have swords
 It'll take a thousand years
 He does clarify that it's maybe not a thousand years
 He does say that he says you know some people can do it in less than five seconds takes him a minute
 Some people a thousand years and then he goes maybe ten minutes or so
 So you know one of the other thousand years ten minutes either one at this point
 Sand fleas dinosaurs it doesn't matter at least he gives us that option right that's gonna be my new timeline whenever someone says
 Hey, can you wait ten minutes? I'll be like I could wait a thousand years and I'm gonna point at my ankle
 So he ends it like this we started off so strong with germs or cryptids. So we started this off
 Then we get to these last two sentences, but then when you find out it's true
 You realize vaccines are little UFOs and we're screwed
 That is such a good conspiracy theory dude like it's not true obviously
 But that is a conspiracy theory that could catch on germs or cryptids I could see people believing in that
 Vaccines contain UFOs dude. That is so timely right now
 Do you imagine pushing that conspiracy theory that aliens a little microscopic little flying saucers
 Floating around in your bloodstream and when you look at photos the white blood cells of those are actually like
 UFOs that's why they look like little plates little floating around in you and stuff like that
 Oh, dude, there's so much wasted potential because that is a legit
 Really good conspiracy theory someone can build off of germs or cryptids germs are in in this sense
 You would say like they're cryptids. There's something that don't exist that shouldn't exist naturally
 It's an undiscovered creature we refer to all these germs as if it's some sort of biological thing
 But it's still some on the border of paranormal. It has a physical body, but it's it's ghostly in some way
 That's such a good conspiracy theory and then vaccines actually contain miniature UFOs by getting the vaccine
 You're getting an alien invasion in your bloodstream. Come on. That's good stuff
 And it's so wasted because he's talking about goat men and dinosaurs and swords and caves
 And he it's like even he knows even he knows that that's a good conspiracy theory because that's not how he ends off this rant
 He doesn't end off saying oh, you know that vaccines have UFOs in them. That's great
 Do you have anything else to tell us and then he says so how close do you live to the swamp?
 What in the world
 What does that mean
 What is it have to do with anything? There was no buildup to it at all
 He's talking about laying in grass and now he's asking me how close I live to the swamp or pond. He also says, you know ponds as well
 Dude this guy is almost like the Nikola Tesla of conspiracy theories like
 When they ask you a little too much credit, but you see a glimmer of genius in it germs are cryptids
 Oh, I love that
 Vaccines contain UFOs. I love that but everything else is so much nonsense
 I almost feel like this is what it can this is like the in the look inside of someone whose brain has been so fractured by conspiracy theories
 They can't even spout out conspiracy theories anymore. Well, they can but it's mixed it was so much nonsense
 So much white noise that I mean this post was four years ago and it had like zero comments
 Obviously who's gonna comment on this right this guy's gonna hunt you down put you in a vaccine
 Shrinking you down. I guess if he has that technology
 Then he doesn't need to really do it if you're that level of genius, you don't need to be stringing people down other than you just want to but
 fascinating
 Stuff very very fascinating stuff a fractured mind may actually see a bit of the truth
 This is a possible that germs viruses bacteria
 Aren't what we think they are
 There's something darker evil. There's something that evolved over time
 We used to fear werewolf and Dracula, but now the real monsters are hidden
 Everywhere we breathe them in every minute. We pick them up when we touch contaminated surfaces
 We can do our best our bodies are still invaded with a cryptid with a monster with a creature that wants to destroy us
 But nowadays you can't use the crucifix to stop them. No silver bullet can destroy a bacteria
 The only thing we can do is look to our intergalactic neighbors and ask for help
 The aliens are more than willing to help is they shrink a fleet of UFOs
 To fit into a hypodermic needle the close encounter doesn't come with the UFO in the countryside
 it comes as a
 Armada of alien starships flies around your liver slowly blowing up little goat man germs who have built a camp on
