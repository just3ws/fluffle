 A woman opens up her closet one morning and finds something unusual.
 And then we take a look at the creepy world of children, everyone's favorite little goblins.
 We need them to repopulate the earth, but why are they so creepy and weird?
 We don't know.
 And we're going to take a look at a story of a young child who all of a sudden develops
 a new habit.
 But is it possible that this kid is just going through a bit of growing pains or has the
 world of the supernatural taken them over?
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.
 I'm your host Jason Garvenor.
 I'm having a great day.
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.
 I hope you guys are staying warm wherever you're at.
 Having fun, that's secondary as long as you're warm.
 I'd rather be warm and bored than cold and having fun.
 But someone who knows how to do both, I think most people know how to do both.
 But this guy in particular does, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is a long time
 legacy Patreon supporter.
 Everyone give it up for AZ.
 Woohoo!
 Yeah!
 Come on in buddy.
 Look at him.
 He's playing Parcheasy and he has a jacket on.
 AZ, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.
 I do.
 This helps read the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.
 That helps out so, so much.
 And a quick update.
 Pretty soon the end of season 20 is coming.
 That's where I take a two week break.
 And that does coincide with my appearance at the Oregon Ghost Conference in Seaside,
 Oregon.
 It's a three day event.
 It's like $15 and that includes all three days of speakers and vendor tables and all
 sorts of fun stuff.
 I will be giving a lecture speech.
 I don't know what the best term is for it.
 But I've written it.
 I haven't written it yet.
 I'm not going to write it.
 I'm just going to write some notes down like I do with the show.
 We see how well these go all the time.
 I will be giving a presentation.
 That was the term I'm looking for.
 A presentation.
 Why are there no fat ghosts?
 And that will be on opening day, March 24th at 6pm in Seaside, Oregon.
 So I'll leave all the info in the show notes.
 It would be so awesome to have you guys there.
 I'm pretty sure they think I'm trolling them at this point because they asked for a bio
 photo.
 They asked for a bio photo.
 And I think for this episode's art I will include, I will do like a little montage of
 the three pictures I sent them.
 I don't have any photographs of myself.
 I never have photographs of myself.
 Pictures I sent them was a promo for a play I did where I was a king, King Richard or
 Prince Richard I think at the time.
 A photo of me putting on an Easter Bunny outfit so I don't have the head but I'm wearing
 a big white fuzzy suit.
 The giant yellow bow tie.
 And oh the other one was me in the winter wearing an eye patch.
 I'm pretty sure they think I'm trolling them at this point but I'm not.
 Those are the three best photos of me doing stuff that I don't do.
 I'm not a prince.
 I don't normally wear an eye patch.
 I do when it gets cold and I'm definitely not the Easter Bunny or am I.
 But let's go ahead and get started here.
 AZ, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.
 Drive us all the way out to Georgia.
 Nice leisurely ride all the way out to the Peach State.
 The reason why we're headed out to Georgia is we're about to meet a mother.
 We're going to go ahead and call her Nancy.
 That's not her real name.
 We're giving her that name.
 She just recently posted this online.
 February 21st is when it went up and she goes "I can't make any sense of this."
 This is to be fair an incredibly puzzling story and really there's a few options we
 have but let's take a look at the story itself.
 Sounds completely armless but let's take a look at this because it's just so weird.
 Nancy said a few weeks ago she went to her closet to retrieve an article of clothing
 and in her closet is a coat.
 But it's not where she normally puts her coats.
 Okay you're like Jason seriously?
 Seriously?
 I misplace stuff all the time.
 Let me finish.
 Let me finish because it's going to sound like this is super mundane but the deeper I get
 into it you're going to be like that is super weird.
 Nancy found it.
 She opened up her closet.
 She found a coat where she normally doesn't put her coats.
 So she has like a pretty organized closet.
 I don't.
 I don't know if it goes on a hanger it's in there.
 She said that this coat was a heavy winter coat and she lives in Georgia.
 She goes "I would never buy a heavy winter coat because I live in Georgia it's the sweatiest
 state known in the universe.
 It's a heavy winter coat.
 It's a Calvin Klein coat."
 She goes "This coat is way out of my price range."
 And then it's a petite size.
 And she goes "Listen I know I don't have a photo of myself up on the internet but trust
 me I'm not petite."
 She goes "I'm five foot eight.
 I'm 200 pounds.
 She's a veteran."
 She's not a petite.
 Not saying that petite people can't be veterans.
 Maybe they can.
 Probably it's a height requirement to join the military right?
 I think there's a height and a weight requirement.
 Anyway she's five foot eight she's 200 pounds and she goes "I'm looking at this coat and
 I'm thinking there is no way I bought this coat."
 It's the wrong type of coat for Georgia.
 It's too expensive and it would never fit me.
 But yet here is this coat hung up in my closet still wrapped in the plastic to protect it.
 This isn't my coat.
 It was really interesting to read her post because she is basically debunking it as
 she's going by saying all that stuff like I couldn't afford it.
 But she goes "Listen I gotta be honest.
 I did see some stuff when I was a veteran.
 I have PTSD and I don't have the best memory.
 But you know what does have a great memory?
 The computer.
 So she will allow herself.
 Maybe I bought this maybe one time I was a petite she's like "What?
 I woke up one morning and I was five foot eight."
 She went to her computer she began looking at she began going through her emails to see
 if she could find an online order.
 And that was the other thing she also goes in pretty much a hermit.
 I am in the house 90% of the time.
 I don't ever really leave very rarely do shopping in the real world or release clothes shopping.
 She doesn't buy everything online.
 So I went I started looking through my emails for any proof that I had ordered this jacket
 because I'll be honest with you guys.
 Maybe I forgot.
 I didn't mean that I have poor memory and that I suffer from PTSD.
 It's possible that I bought this jacket that was I mean think about it I mean it's possible
 that I bought this jacket that's the wrong size that's too much money I can afford it.
 Had it shipped here opened up the package go huh and then hung it up and forgot all of
 that stuff but the computer never forgets so she's going through her emails to see if
 she can find any record of ordering a Calvin Klein jacket whether from a Calvin Klein
 retailer or eBay or whatever there's nothing.
 But because she's holding this jacket she knows that it's in her house and she didn't
 order it she actually goes to the point where she's like calling up her bank and she's like
 hey this is going to sound super weird.
 Actually I don't think she goes oh this this coat magically appeared in my closet help
 me US bank probably not she probably just said hey were there any transactions and I
 miss anything like that because she has the tags are still on it so she can see the dollar
 amount she can look for transactions in that amount nothing.
 This money never came out of her bank account she never ordered it so even if she had mistakenly
 you know I people will get drunk on eBay and they'll buy a bunch of stuff and the next
 day they're like what why do I own the entire 1988 line of micro machines it wasn't that
 now if all the micro machines just showed up at your door or it wouldn't even be that
 imagine if you walked into your living room one day and there was a micro machines play
 set set up in your living room with all the micro machines you're like oh no what is this
 home alone trap you you would be like wait what where did these micro machines come from
 but that it's not as cool as micro machines it's just the jacket it's a jacket that doesn't
 fit that's even like the funniest part about it right if someone delivered a bunch of micro
 machines to you at least you have someone to play with while you're trying to figure out
 a mystery you're like mystery solved the answer was fun she has a tiny person's jacket it
 won't fit her it will never fit her it will never ever fit her even if she lost weight
 it would basically be like a crop top if she could get her arms through it she's just too
 tall even if she lost weight so she has this petite slash extra small jacket now you go
 obviously I think we're thinking first of your body Jason's really running out of material
 no I find this absolutely fascinating I know this sounds so benign but that's kind of what
 I love about it this and it happens in her house like this is a what I think this is
 is like some sort of dimensional rift but let me keep let me keep going on there's not
 much more left of the story as she's pre bunking it basically but she's saying it could be
 this it could be that it could be this but she's wiping all of those off she goes but
 it's not that because of this she goes listen I do have a daughter I have an adult daughter
 and she comes by my place a couple times a month and you go mystery solved Jason it's
 obviously her daughter her daughter is bigger than she is her daughter is five foot ten her
 daughter is taller than she is she also cannot wear a petite slash extra small and the daughter's
 like I didn't buy that I want such a tiny jacket what is that jacket for an American
 girl doll so it's bizarre and she goes like you know going back to begin at hermit like
 I don't leave the house I didn't pick it up like I couldn't have such bad memory problems
 that I got in my car and drove to the Calvin Klein store or to Nordstrom's or wherever
 and bought it and drove back and hung it up because again even if you would allow that
 right people do have memory problems where'd the money come from how did how did she buy
 it it's funny because now I think about you know I go it could be a dimensional shift
 right in an alternate world there is someone who fits in that jacket in that same place
 which actually kind of hilarious to think about because they just bought an expensive
 jacket and they're like oh hang it up right here and then they went into their closet
 and it was gone like vanished and they would never find it they wouldn't be like well I've
 checked the closet and I've checked my car possibly it's in an alternate dimension let's
 fire up the rift generator no you would just eat the cost you would freak out and be like
 what happened to you probably use people of stealing it all your petite friends who are
 a little bit poorer than you would probably that would be the rift you wouldn't need a
 rift generator you'd lose friends over it the that girl's jacket transported to our universe
 and it's in this woman's house it's funny to think like what if Nancy could fit into
 the jacket I guess that's not the most mysterious thing it's not like she pulled the sword out
 of the stone she's like now I'm queen of England because I fit in with this jacket but you wouldn't
 notice it as much you'd be like that's where where did this jacket come from I do have
 memory problems but it fits really well mystery solved oh well I mean you might investigate
 it a little bit more than that but it doesn't fit her and that's like the sticking point
 it doesn't fit her and she couldn't afford it that was the other thing where to come
 from so it had to come from somewhere did it come from another universe but it was funny
 because that was my original thought but as I was saying this a long time ago I don't
 know what episode it was I talked about on Dead Rabbit Radio what would be scarier if
 you came home and you're like you left a pillow on the couch it's always been on the couch
 you always know that it's a couch pillow it's not a couch cushion but it's like a couch
 pillow you leave you come back an hour later and that pillow is missing what would be scarier
 that or you leave for an hour you come back the original pillow is still there but there
 is a new pillow you've never seen before also on your couch now what's scarier and pretty
 much everyone said it's the extra pillow because then you know somebody was in there you 100%
 know that somebody came in without your knowledge stuff goes missing all the time but finding
 new items in your home it's funny we've covered basically two stories that have a kind of
 a similar been this one where you have a new item not like a ghost materializing a coin
 which it can be I don't want to say common but it does happen we have this one and then
 we covered that story recently it's not really the same but the omnivore trials and that had
 a woman whose blanket was missing her favorite blanket was missing they went to the movies
 they came back and her favorite blanket was folded up neatly sitting on her couch and
 that's when they knew something really really weird that that whole omnivore trials thing
 there was all this nonsense people slamming doors and silhouettes staring at them from
 the backyard and people just like I don't know what it is I don't know what it is it's probably
 just the wind probably just the wind making the shape of a human silhouette but it was
 that blanket being folded up missing and then being folded up on the same place where she
 had left it and looked for it and didn't see it it is creepier everyone said Jason that
 the dumb question of course is creepier to find something so I think there's the I mean
 I would say paranormal rift I would say some sort of dimensional shift but it was only
 big enough for a single jacket to go through but I host a paranormal podcast and I believe
 in the paranormal and it could be that it could be that completely unbelievable thing
 but I believe it or it could be some the beginning of some weirdo stalker what if it is like
 the omnivore trials not to give that episode away but what if there's someone in Nancy's
 bedroom right now being like oh you don't fit that jacket yet but then he's all sharpening
 knives under her bed he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he

 that's how every episode ends
 I don't know but anyways that's the story of Nancy
 and interesting where did this jacket come from
 now you're imagining Zach back and talking about the big boner
 hey don't blame me don't blame me she's the one who said that
 can't sue me either I'm just repeating
 I'm just repeating an unfounded accusation on a show that I don't watch
 AZ let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the world
 famous carbon helicopter we are leaving behind Georgia
 flying us all the way out
 to a house in the suburbs
 da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
 we're flying all the way out there and shhhhhh
 it's late at night we're walking into this house
 luckily I have a key I have a key to every house in the world
 click click click we walk in and we see
 a family sitting in the living room
 you have a mom and a dad and then Sophia
 who's only a year old
 it's late it's like 2 in the morning we're like hiding
 we're all stuffed in one of their closets and we're kinda looking out all creepy and stuff
 I don't know why we are, I don't know why we're so creepy
 I don't know why we just didn't be a third person but anyways we were stalking this family
 little Sophia is sitting there
 and she's eating a snack
 like crackers and we're like this is weird it's like 2 in the morning
 what's she doing up
 eventually she gets done with the crackers and she lets out a big little kid yawn
 wow
 and the parents pick up Sophia
 she's one right I don't think you walk when you're that young
 they pick up Sophia and they go back to bed
 the reason why we're showing up at this house
 we don't have an exact location for this story
 the person who posted it actually deleted their account
 I don't think it's because of the story I think it's just because they found out reddit sucked
 they posted this story
 and it's the story of their daughter Sophia
 so you have mom and dad and Sophia living in this house
 and they said
 we'll say this is stories from the mom's point of view and we'll call her
 Jody
 Jody said
 Sophia is what's known as a unicorn baby
 not that she has like a cool horn
 but it's a term used for a baby who sleeps through the night
 which is what babies are not known to do
 they're known to be really loud poop factories
 at every single minute of every single day
 but she goes Sophia was a unicorn baby from about 2 months
 to her first year slept through the night
 slept like a log it was awesome
 we'd always heard all these horror stories about babies waking parents up in the middle of the night
 marriages just crumbling underneath the weight and the sleep deprivation and the stress
 she said not for us not for Sophia
 she slept all night long
 until she turned 1
 and she said what happened was after she turned 1
 Sophia would wake up in the middle of the night
 which means we would wake up in the middle of the night
 and Sophia would want a snack
 a late night snack
 so they would walk Sophia down to the
 because they don't have a snack available in their bedroom right
 they'd be eating it
 you can't have food in your bedroom otherwise you would eat it
 you're like oh this delicious this delicious
 butternut squash mashed into a baby food jar
 when you're one I don't think you're eating baby food anymore
 you're eating normal stuff
 but if you had a bowl of like animal crackers right next to your bed
 you'd eat them you'd eat them
 you couldn't help it and if you if you didn't the ants sure would
 the ants must have a field day in a house with a baby
 anyways you don't have a snack in your bedroom
 you keep them in the kitchen like a normal human
 so you walk Sophia down
 to the living room and you go you wait there Sophia
 I'll get you a snack
 but as you're walking to the living room you notice
 Sophia looks over at this chair
 it just sits in your living room
 it's been there for a long time it's not a new chair
 but Sophia walks by and she looks at this chair
 and she waves to it and goes hello
 and then sits down and waits for her snack
 and then you come out with a little bowl of crackers
 you set it down and she's eating them
 and you're just kind of just sitting there
 you can't be like hey good luck eating those crackers
 and you know how to swallow
 so you don't want to morning you gotta wait there
 so she doesn't die
 or make a mess or get carried away by ants
 so Jodi or her husband would be sitting there in the living room
 and as Sophia was eating these crackers
 she would carry on a conversation with the chair
 it wouldn't make any sense
 it would be like I mean she can talk
 but how big of a vocabulary do you have at age one
 and she's a kid she's a kid
 she's not asking about like oh did you see whatever in the news yesterday
 nom nom nom nom
 it's just nonsense
 imaginary friend talk
 goofy stuff
 the parent would sit there
 and Sophia would eat the snack
 and when Sophia was done
 bye
 and Sophia and the parent would walk back to the bedrooms
 and Sophia would go back to bed
 the first time it happened you go that was weird
 like she's always slept all the way through the night
 she doesn't normally talk to chairs during the day
 or she has an active imagination
 like all children do but that's weird
 but when it happens again to the next night
 Sophia wakes up
 parent walks down the hallway with him
 they get to the living room
 Sophia goes how wow
 and waves at the empty chair
 and sits down waiting for her snack
 another full on conversation with nothing
 the parents are like okay this is weird
 the first time she woke up in the middle of the night
 and wanted a snack that was weird
 but you know now it's happened twice
 could this be the start of something new
 but this goes on
 and on
 and on
 this lasts four months
 and it's always the exact same thing
 the parents actually start pre-making the snack
 before they go to bed
 so now there's a bowl of crackers
 or cereal whatever it is
 on the table
 when they go to bed
 so when Sophia wakes up
 and they walk down the hallway
 the parent doesn't have to worry about putting it together
 because this goes on for months
 they're like okay this is obviously part of this kids development cycle
 it's weird
 and every single time Sophia would walk in the living room
 and go how wow
 and wave to the chair
 and then sit down
 and carry on a conversation
 and again
 these were two to three word sentences
 that Sophia was using
 so it's not like
 you could gleam any sort of information from it
 it's also one sided right
 it's just your little girl going
 yeah and then Pony
 oh Pony go boom
 you're like what does that mean
 I mean obviously that means she's making up a story about some dumb
 cartoon horse
 but it's not like
 it's not
 well we'll get to it
 because obviously if we knew both sides of the conversation
 this
 the climax probably would have happened much sooner
 I would think
 if the parents had any idea that this wasn't just a weird
 quirk of Sophia's childhood
 they probably would have done what they're about to do
 much much earlier
 because this goes on every single night
 for months and months and months
 until one night
 Sophia wakes up
 they're walking down the hallway
 pre-made snack already sitting on the table
 and Jodi the mom was with her at this point
 they're walking down the hallway
 and all of a sudden
 Sophia stops
 she stops cold
 in her tracks
 and with a frightened finger
 she points at the empty chair
 this chair she's been talking to for months
 she greets with the wave every single night
 ignores it during the day
 I mean it's just a chair
 she probably sat on it from time to time
 but she didn't definitely know wave at it
 she didn't carry on conversations with it
 usually she greets it with a wave and a "Hello!"
 this time
 she freezes dead in her tracks
 she points a finger at the chair
 and lets out
 a terrified scream
 and she's screaming
 and screaming
 and screaming
 it's the middle of the night
 and her cries of terror are filling the home
 Joe at this point
 the other parents up now
 the husbands up now
 they're both like
 what in the world is going on
 and she's screaming at the top of her lungs
 horrible terrified screams
 is how Jodi
 described it
 and she's pointing at that chair
 screaming, screaming, pointing
 frozen in place
 refuses to move
 until Jodi scoops up
 Sophia in her arms
 and takes her to another room
 trying to calm her down
 it takes a while
 because Jodi can't say really what she saw
 she doesn't have the vocabulary for it
 all she can do is scream
 and even then when she's been removed from the living room
 when Sophia's in her mother's arms
 and they're in another room
 and she's being soothed by her mother
 she still can't say what it is
 but the screaming just turns to sobbing
 this poor little girl is terrified out of her mind
 the dad
 you have to wonder like again
 I think they weren't explicitly
 the parents weren't saying
 that there is some sort of paranormal activity going on
 but as the months went by
 and as they saw these conversations take place
 you have to figure they did start to think
 maybe it's something
 maybe this just isn't a imaginary friend type of thing
 because what happens is
 when that goes on
 when Sophia stops and points at the chair and screams
 the dad takes the chair
 and removes it
 from the living room
 like he feels like the chair caused that
 not that she was having a waking nightmare
 not that she had seen something spooky on television that day
 he 100% was like
 "okay, I'm getting rid of this chair"
 which is probably something that he'd been wanting to do for a while
 because it was probably creeping him out
 maybe he didn't specifically say that to his wife
 but I believe at this point they were taking turns
 you don't need both parents to be up in the middle of the night
 to feed the kids
 so there would be some nights where it would just be the dad
 sitting down there with Sophia
 having an imaginary conversation
 or a real conversation
 see, that's the thing
 you could say it's an imaginary friend
 I believe in the father's mind
 no, she's talking to something
 like this is a... she's having real conversations
 I can't see it
 but she can
 and I'm sitting down here in the middle of the night
 in the middle of the night which is already creepy
 with what
 at best is my daughter's
 imagination running wild
 that's sweet, that's cute
 but at worst there's some sort of unseen phantom
 sitting just a few feet away from me
 that my daughter is just carrying on with
 now maybe it's a ghost of an old grandpa
 maybe it's the ghost of an engineer
 who died on this very spot
 but it's so creepy, I don't want him there
 I definitely don't want him talking to my kid
 and the dad took this opportunity
 to remove the chair from the living room
 he's like, nope
 that's kind of what I've been waiting for
 I thought I'd be the one doing the screaming and the pointing
 I imagine that one day I would come down the hallway
 and see something terrifying but Sophia saw it
 so I'm gonna remove this chair and
 the very next day he threw it away
 that night he just moved it out of the living room
 and the very next day he held it off to the dump
 and what's interesting about that story
 the little kid seeing the ghost
 that happens
 that's actually a big part of
 paranormal research
 the belief that babies
 and children can see
 paranormal entities much easier than adults can
 because they've been told they don't exist yet
 they don't understand the rules of the universe
 I don't understand the rules of the universe
 a normal adult brain
 I shouldn't say normal but I'll say it again anyways
 a normal adult brain has filters placed on it
 by society, by belief systems, by experience
 so that creepy half-naked old woman
 who's standing in your kitchen right now
 if you went in there you wouldn't see her
 but if you were three
 you might
 if you were six months old
 you probably definitely would
 there's no signs in the back that I would have a chart or anything like that
 but you know what I mean
 the idea that we go ghost aren't real
 even people who believe in ghosts have so many filters
 it's a big thing with the law of attraction
 a big thing is you have to believe it works
 you can't ever believe it won't work
 if you believe it doesn't work it won't work
 and they say if you're studying the law of attraction
 don't read anything that says it doesn't work
 don't go "well I want to see what the other side has to say about it"
 because they go "it won't work"
 it's a filter
 you place your own filters over things
 so that's interesting in and of itself
 and that's pretty normal in the world of paranormal
 that children can perceive ghosts and spirits
 far easier than adults can
 so it's interesting on that level
 it's interesting on the level again where this account's been deleted
 we can't do any follow-up questioning
 but I do think it's interesting that you have the two parents
 I would say
 that you probably did have a schism
 where the father thought
 this is ghost
 like she's talking to a ghost
 and the mother would be like
 well you know she's just it's imaginary
 it's not real ghost
 it's her imagination
 for whatever reason she's developed this imaginary friend
 that only shows up at the creepiest time
 night time
 but
 he was ready to get rid of that chair
 it wasn't even like
 well you know what I mean like
 when she pointed it
 and started screaming
 it could have been anything
 like I said it could have been a nightmare
 she could have seen something
 a creepy shadow or something like that
 but the second she got upset by that chair
 he got rid of it
 he did not even wait
 she was still sobbing in the other room
 when he's like
 nope you're out of here
 I'm getting rid of you
 I think there probably was that schism
 where one person thought
 it was totally normal
 to talk to an imaginary friend
 and then the other parent was like
 no there's something creepy going on here
 so that's an interesting
 because that happens in real life right
 that they
 on the war trial
 story
 the wife was like
 I think there's an intruder in our house
 I think he's living in our walls
 and the husband kept going
 it's just a wind
 and they almost
 they almost got all of their hands chopped off
 that's a crazy episode
 I'll put it in the show notes
 now I've brought it up twice
 but I really like that story
 but the thing that I
 really the reason why I really wanted to cover this story
 and we got to wrap it up
 I don't want to go on too long
 but I find this absolutely fascinating
 is
 remember how this all started
 it was the late night snack
 this child slept through the night
 from two months old to one year old
 but when
 when Sophia turned one
 I don't know if it was exactly on her birthday
 but you know around there
 she began
 to crave a midnight snack
 it was something that she had never exhibited before
 and
 she would walk in the living room
 she'd go how wow
 and then she would sit down
 and eat her snack
 and my question is
 did whatever was in that chair
 and what I believe
 that what she saw that night
 was its true form
 she probably did see some sort of friendly spirit
 it may not have even looked completely human
 or humanoid
 it may have been like
 something that resembled something that a child
 would want to talk to an imaginary friend
 they dropped dead Fred-esque character
 but that night
 when she came down
 it looked more like
 the demon from Little Monsters
 starring Fred Savage
 she saw a horrific
 she saw it without its mask on
 she saw this terrifying horrific
 entity sitting in the darkness
 waiting for her to come down
 she saw its true form that night
 and what I think is interesting
 is
 did that spirit
 did that entity
 make her
 hungry
 and
 because if she just slept through the night
 she would never see it
 remember this thing didn't show up during the day
 he was sitting in that chair
 and we don't know how long they had the chair
 again there's some cool follow up questions
 I'd like to ask
 but the person deleted their account
 but it didn't sound like they got the chair
 from a garage sale that weekend
 it was a chair that had been there
 so if he has to sleep
 this thing wants to make contact with her
 but it can only manifest at night
 if it simply wakes her up
 then she wakes up and the parents
 swaddle her
 and rock her back and forth
 or whatever you do to a one year old
 and then she goes back to sleep
 the entity is still sitting in the darkness
 in the living room
 what it had to do was
 it had to bring her down
 it had to create
 a habit
 a need
 that she did not have previous
 it had to wake her up
 and make her hungry
 in the middle of the night
 that was the only way that the parents
 would have let her walk down there
 and spend enough time down there
 to talk
 right isn't that so
 that to me
 this story seems kind of just a creepy kid story
 little innocuous
 but that's creepy because you think
 what is really the power level of the paranormal
 sure we talk about demons
 being able to possess people
 turning into a murderer
 rapist
 some sort of hardened criminal
 and that sucks
 that's not good either
 but
 is it possible for a dark spirit
 to simply give you
 a habit
 to make you do a particular thing
 and you start to think
 like I stay up late
 I go to bed
 around
 I lay down around midnight
 I'm asleep by one in the morning
 I'm up at 5.36
 to go to work
 and you think
 I've been doing that my entire life
 I've been doing that my entire life
 but you think
 is it
 like that's
 I've always
 people think I'm crazy for doing that
 and they go it's super unhealthy
 I take naps
 I take naps
 but you know
 people go
 that's unhealthy
 your body's not giving enough time to regenerate
 you lift weights
 you gotta sleep 8 hours to build muscle
 all this stuff
 I've been doing it my entire life
 and it's something that I own
 it's a decision that I make
 but what if that's not the case
 like what if I didn't choose to be
 a late night person
 and oddly enough
 a morning person as well
 but
 how much
 I guess I'm
 kind of getting
 off track here
 but I'm thinking like
 how much of our lives
 are dictated by us
 how much of our lives are dictated by
 environmental factors
 or genetic factors
 but you know the decisions we make
 but then how much
 like a simple
 habit of waking up at the middle of the night
 to get a snack
 did Sophia start doing that
 on her own
 and then
 see this creature
 see this entity one night
 and it just happened that way
 that's possible
 but
 Jodi does add in her narrative
 that after they got rid of the chair
 Sophia
 slept through the night
 she once again
 every night after that
 slept through the night
 and no longer needed
 a midnight snack
 so
 does the world of the paranormal
 have a day to day impact
 on even simple habits
 we have
 because again
 it's not like
 she woke up
 and she saw this thing
 and she goes
 next night I do that again
 we play
 I believe this entity
 was waking her up
 and making her hungry
 both of those things
 needed to be accomplished
 for her to come into the living room
 if she just woke up
 she wouldn't be able to go
 in the living room
 her parents would put her back to sleep
 she had to be woken up
 and be made hungry
 so they would have time to talk
 because she would eat this stuff
 like someone would eat a bowl of crackers
 that's going to give you a good
 10-20 minute conversation
 depending on how many crackers
 this spirit
 this demon whatever it was
 woke her up
 and made her hungry
 that is
 it's weird because you
 you go
 sure a demon possessing a guy
 and turning him into a mass murderer
 that is worse
 that takes a huge amount of power
 it does
 I'm not diminishing
 I'm not diminishing all the
 demonically possessed murderers out there
 I'm just saying that
 this would take a lot of energy as well
 and to what
 end
 what was this spirit's goal
 why was it waking up this one year old girl
 and making her hungry
 so she would be in the living room with it
 and they could have a conversation
 what was the end game there
 fascinating story
 it really at first glance
 it just seems like this is the story of a creepy kid
 but it really has to
 but it really opens up that
 whole question of how powerful is the world of paranormal
 and how much of an effect does it have
 on our daily lives which is funny
 because that's what ancient cultures
 used to believe 100%
 like the paranormal is constantly interfering
 in the daily lives of the humans on the planet
 and over time
 we either say this stuff doesn't exist
 or it's rare
 but what if some of the habits you have
 that I have
 that we think we've developed on our own
 are actually the work of spirits
 and I think there's a case to be made
 when you can look at stuff like porn addiction, gambling addiction, drug addiction
 that there's a demonic element to those things
 I think that there's an art
 we've talked about those on the show
 I think any sort of addiction where you
 forgo your family
 and you forgo your job
 and you forgo your own health
 to pursue something you
 know is destructive
 but you just keep doing
 I think you could definitely argue there's a demonic element to that
 but eating crackers in the middle of the night
 did this spirit just want some company
 and was stuck in the darkness
 and decided to use what little energy
 it had outside of that chair
 to wake up a child so it would have a conversation
 so it wouldn't be so lonely through the eternal nights
 well if that's the case
 what did she see on that last night
 what frightened her so much
 if this was a benign spirit
 what did she see
