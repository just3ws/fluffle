00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
 Today we say goodbye to a dead rabbit radio favorite.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:11,720
 Is it possible that there is a half- this is a weird transition, but is it possible that there's a half-woman?

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:18,560
 Is it possible that there's a half-woman, half-worm hiding out in a castle?

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,800
 And then we travel to the battlefield of the Trojan War.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,960
 Is it possible that the Trojan War actually never happened?

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:36,360
 And more importantly, is it possible that no conspiracies have ever happened either today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,160
 [Music]

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,560
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,560
 I do have bad news though.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,960
 Forest Finn has passed away. Forest Finn for long-time listeners of the show.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,960
 I did a couple episodes on him and his treasure where I said his treasure wasn't real.

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
 That he made the whole thing up to get people to go out and explore.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,160
 I didn't really ascribe any negative things to him in the first episode.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,960
 And then I got attacked by a bunch of his followers that called themselves the Fanatics.

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,160
 It was pretty- they came out to me pretty hard.

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:30,760
 I mean, I have my trick where I just don't read negative stuff, but I got a bunch of half-red things from them.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:37,160
 But listen, here's the thing. All in the second episode I did kind of throw one of the parts of it, but I was wrong.

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:45,160
 The treasure was real, though now people think that he made it all. It's a whole weird thing, but regardless of that, I hate it.

20
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,160
 First off, I didn't hate the guy. I didn't hate the guy. His followers were a bunch of weirdos, but

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,160
 I never wished death on people, and I especially don't wish death on people that I have mild disagreements with.

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:03,160
 Like obviously if something bad happened to Frons or something bad happened to the guy who made the helmets that could cure autism,

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:11,160
 or a couple of the other people we've covered, Vampire Lord Kevin, all these people that I've kind of just gone after.

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,160
 I never want anything bad to happen to him.

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:24,160
 Force Finn lived to be 90 years old. He lived a very long and exciting life, and I honestly, it doesn't make me feel good to give that news.

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,160
 I hope that where he's at, he has peace. And yeah, dude, I mean, it's kind of a bummer.

27
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:39,160
 Because again, sometimes, like, I never want to cut it. I want to get into it, but you know what I mean? Like, it sucks, right? It sucks.

28
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:47,160
 So for the people who were fans of his, the people who now believe that he was faking it, the whole story is incredibly complicated.

29
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 But at the end of the day, I obviously did not wish that this was the conclusion to his story.

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:04,160
 I mean, I guess he fell down or something like that, so I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I feel bad. I mean, obviously he's not...

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:12,160
 He was going to live forever, right? But yeah, that does suck. So to his family, and to his friends, and to his fans, and to his followers,

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:22,160
 and even to those fanatics people, lunatics who were coming after me for a long period of time, I am with you in your period of mourning.

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,160
 That definitely is not fun to make this announcement, and yeah.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:39,160
 Well, I don't have any other way to segue from that, but let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Joe S.

35
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:46,160
 We're clapping Joe S. as he's shaking his head. He's like, "Dude, seriously, man? I'm on the death episode. You know, it's just... Yeah."

36
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:54,160
 Sorry, Joe, put my arm around you. Sorry, sorry, sorry, buddy. He's a fanatic in hiding. He supported my Patreon just to get into the inner circle,

37
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,160
 but that's okay. You can do that. You're going to be, Joe, you are going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

38
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,160
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:16,160
 Joe, I'm going to toss you the keys to the rabbit rowboat. We're going to take a long little sailing trip. We are leaving behind Smokey Smokey Organ.

40
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:26,160
 We are headed out to Spain. Now, I got most of this information from an article by Juan Esalava Galen, so I appreciate it.

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,160
 I always like to give a shout out to the journalists who are doing all of the reporting for me, and then I just take notes.

42
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:43,160
 So we are headed out to Spain. Now, as we're rowing, we're going to row into a whirlpool. We're going back in time to the year 1231 AD.

43
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,160
 We're in a little town called Cazorla, Spain. Now, at this time, the Moors controlled this area. Everything's going fine.

44
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:58,160
 They got their little town set up. Dude's sitting in his castle. He's the king. He's not just a dude. He has me executed for that joke.

45
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,160
 But I'm reincarnated, and I come back as another podcast host, and I'm in disguise now. I'm wearing a big fake mustache.

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:12,160
 The king has his castle on top of this mountain. He looks down at his town, a little like Smoke coming out of the fireplaces and stuff like that.

47
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:25,160
 He has really keen eyesight. He's like, "That fire needs more kindling." But he gets distressing news. Apparently, the Christians are coming, and the Christians have a really, really bad reputation at this point in time.

48
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:35,160
 You normally, if you're sitting in town and someone goes, "Hey, a bunch of Christians are going to show up." You're like, "Uh, okay. I mean, that's fine. Maybe they'll knock on my door. Maybe they'll have a potluck, and I'll be invited."

49
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:47,160
 Back then, the Christians are coming, meant hide everything valuable and leave town. Because the Moors were like, "Dude, these guys are going to just brutally wipe us out."

50
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,160
 And then just take the city over. So the king goes, "Okay, here's the thing, guys. Let's get all the townspeople out first."

51
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:05,160
 So everyone, I know you guys all have a duty to me. I'm your king. But I also have a duty to protect you. The Christians are coming. Everyone starts freaking out. He's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not done talking. Let me finish giving my orders."

52
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:19,160
 Leave in orderly fashion. Walk, walk out of the town. Get all your valuables. Leave town, and I'll give you the order after the Christians are done raising the city to nothing. I'll give the order for everybody to come back.

53
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:31,160
 So all the townspeople leave. Now the king is there with his royal court, and his young daughter is there too. He's looking at things, and he goes, "Okay, now it's our turn to leave. All of the townspeople are gone. Now it's our turn to leave."

54
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:44,160
 But he starts to think about it, and he goes, "We know the Christians' scouting parties are just around the corner, so I don't know if we can all get out safely. I don't know if me and the royal court here are actually going to be able to get out safely."

55
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:56,160
 So what he does, he doesn't, without telling anybody this, he takes his daughter down into the castle, and there is a hidden room under there that only he knows about. His daughter even is like, "What are we doing down here?"

56
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 And he opens up this door, and he goes, "No one else--" Well, I guess if it's a door, it's pretty obvious, right? He's like, "Nobody knows the direction to this door." It's a door. It just opens and closes.

57
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:24,160
 It takes her to a secret passageway. Rolls a boulder out of the way or something like that. And he goes, "Nobody knows that this place is down here. So I'm going to give you a ton of oil for your lantern and a ton of food, and you're going to hang out down here. Now what's going to happen is we're going to leave, and hopefully the Christians don't murder us on the spot.

58
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:35,160
 But we'll come back. If that doesn't happen, if that doesn't happen, don't worry, you have a lot of food and a lot of oil. If that doesn't happen, we'll double back around after the Christians are gone and we'll rescue you."

59
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:53,160
 Okay, I guess that's an okay plan, because the other option is her getting massacred as she's trying to leave with her father. So she gets sealed into this room, and he goes, "Remember, I will be back. But if you hear a bunch of noise in the castle, and I'm not, like, walking around, that means the Christians are here, and they'll probably kill you."

60
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:18,160
 Sleep tight, sleep tight, honey! She's like, "Ahh!" He closes the boulder or whatever. I don't know if it was as dramatic as the boulder. He's not Superman. Otherwise, he'd be like, just destroying the army. But he puts her in a hidden spot. He leaves with his court, and they're like, "Hey, where's your daughter at? Like, I mean, do you think you would want her to come?" And he's like, "It's too dangerous. I have her hidden away. Don't worry about it. We'll come back for her."

61
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:48,160
 So as they're leaving town, they're crossing this bridge out of the city, and all of a sudden, "Woo-swoosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh-woosh

62
00:08:48,160 --> 00:09:10,160
 People are like, "Are you trying to say something?" And he's thinking, obviously, I'm trying to say something. I'm not gargling for my own good. And he's trying to say that his daughter is hidden in the castle. He's trying to explain exactly where it's at. Also, trying to explain he hopes they can move boulders. You guys are from Krypton, right? He dies.

63
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:19,160
 And so the other dudes just bounce out of there, because they don't know where the arrow came from. They're just not going to hang around. So the court takes off. They leave.

64
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:30,160
 Now, the Christians do move into the city, and they come into the city, and normally what they would do is they would ransack it and then blow it up. They'd invent dynamite, use it, blow it up, and then move on to the next town.

65
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,160
 But apparently, this town was so lovely, the Christians showed up, and they're like, "What? We can't pillage this. Look at these pillows. These are great.

66
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:47,160
 I'm not going to take these out of this house. I'm going to use them in this nice comfy bed. I'm going to take a nap." They took over the city. They actually were like, "Oh, we'll just live here now. I guess pillaging is done."

67
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:59,160
 Now, I would be scared if I walked into a town and there was nobody there. But again, now that I think about it, my reputation isn't if I come to the town, everyone dies.

68
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:07,160
 If that was my reputation, I wouldn't be shocked at all. I'd be like, "These are very smart people. Ah, they've read the local newspaper. They knew I was coming."

69
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:17,160
 In a normal time, if a bunch of Christians showed up in town, a bunch of Christians show up to New York and New York's deserted, you would think everyone got abducted.

70
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:26,160
 But that's not what it was. They knew why these people left. So they just settled in the town. And they were like, "Oh, this is a cool castle. Let's go hang out in this castle."

71
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:39,160
 But the legend doesn't stop there. So what they say happened was his daughter was in this castle. And she hears footsteps, "Kling-ling, glang-gling, glang-gling."

72
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:49,160
 That's supposed to be their armored feet hitting the ground. So she believes that the castle has been taken over by rampaging Christians. She's only half right. They're just Christians.

73
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:59,160
 They got board of rampaging at this point. So she stays in the basement. But what happens is, eventually she runs out of oil. So she's in the dark.

74
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:11,160
 She ran out of oil first. And then she's eating food. Obviously she's not trying to light food. She has a foot-long sub lit on fire. She's walking through the catacombs.

75
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:18,160
 She's like, "I should've eaten that." But she invented toasted bread that day. So it was a win for the world. She runs out of food eventually as well.

76
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:34,160
 And then... I don't know what the Lipologic is for this. But this is the equivalent of the boogie man for this area. So I always thought the boogie man was like, either had a jacked up face, all gross looking, or had a hood.

77
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:45,160
 So you couldn't see his face. Maybe because his face was so gross. He bought a hood. Boogie man was a literal man, right? With a grody face, or like a hood, and you never saw his face.

78
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:59,160
 But in this part of Spain, their boogie man is actually a boogie woman. They're very progressive of them. And what it is is that she spent so long in the catacombs of this castle that nobody knew about.

79
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:10,160
 She spent so long in the catacombs of this castle that no one ever rescued her and she never cried out for help. And she ran out of all of her heating oil, so she had no light, and she ran out of all of her food, so she had nothing to eat.

80
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:22,160
 So what do you think happened to her? Well, I guess I gave it away in the beginning. She turned into a worm. So apparently, I don't know how much room was in this secret compartment, but she turned into a worm.

81
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:37,160
 So basically, her legs were pressed together for so long that they just morphed into one giant worm body thing. And now, late at night, she comes out and gets you. There's a nursery rhyme for this.

82
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:50,160
 So I guess I should say this too. What is this nursery rhyme? Her name is La Tragantia. So if you're a little Spanish kid, I'm almost sit down and she'll go,

83
00:12:50,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 "I am the Tragantia." I don't know if she sings at all super spooky. She's moving all jerky like Samara, her head spinning around. Let me try to sing this.

84
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:19,160
 She looks at her son and she goes, "I am the Tragantia, daughter of the Moorish King. The one who hears me sing, won't see the light of day, nor the night of San Juan."

85
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:32,160
 Now, I don't know. I didn't have musical, I didn't have like she music in front of me. One. Two, I'm pretty sure it rhymes in Swedish. I don't think, it sounds like she's just making it up.

86
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:46,160
 She's like, "There's a worm woman. She's outside your house." The kid's like, "Then what happens?" And the mom's like, "Uh, if you hear her sing, don't go to San Juan because she'll get you."

87
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,160
 The kid's like, "What? I don't have a car? I'm supposed to get to San Juan." She's like, "I'll figure it out. I'll rework the rhyme tomorrow."

88
00:13:53,160 --> 00:14:02,160
 So it sounds a little like it was, "What's the night of San Juan?" I get that part, I guess. But like, would you be able to see the night in Casablanca?

89
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,160
 But anyway, so that is the story of Law Tragantia. Because it's a real castle. It's a real castle. It's a real city.

90
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:21,160
 There's a historical part to it where the Christians did just kind of find an empty town and move into it. And they have this castle. You can go visit it. It's actually a tourist trap.

91
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:29,160
 They say it's a lot smaller than you would think. You're like, "What? I thought this place would be way bigger. I thought I'd have way more leg room. We start turning into a worm."

92
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:37,160
 They have like one star on the yelp. They're like, "The food was great, but I'm a worm now. I'm totally turning into a worm." Too small of a castle.

93
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:45,160
 But apparently it is a tiny castle. And there's a door with a big iron ring on it that nobody opens because they're afraid there's a worm woman in it.

94
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:54,160
 Which, that doesn't scare me at all. Like, I would totally be down to hang out with a worm woman. Here's why, because you could hop on her back and she would like, right around town.

95
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:03,160
 I mean, assuming she didn't, you know, kill you. But, you know, if you were nice to it and you were like feeding her, bring her oil and food, and the next thing you know, you got a new mode of transportation.

96
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:24,160
 The worm woman. So that is the story of Loc Trigantia. And a very, very interesting one. Very interesting one. I do have to say this. What's funny about the story is, the other than the fact that a woman turned into a worm, is that if the king was the only one who knew where the daughter was, where did the story come from?

97
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:34,160
 And the Christians wouldn't have known, right? I'm sure that part of it's totally fake. Maybe his daughter just disappeared. Maybe she just evaporated before the Christians showed up. Who knows?

98
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:50,160
 But, or the daughter didn't exist, it's totally fable, we don't know. But people to this day still believe that if you're a stubborn youth, you don't do your chores and you stay up too late, the worm woman will show up outside your house and make it so you will never see the night and San Juan.

99
00:15:50,160 --> 00:16:01,160
 Which again, isn't a problem for, it's only a problem for people who live in San Juan. Everyone else is like, "I can do that." They don't do their homework and there's a worm woman outside and they're like, "Hi," and she just kind of leaves.

100
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 And there you go. That is that story. And as we're riding out of town, we all have our own worm woman, we're riding out of town, and I look over at you and I go, "You know who really likes worms? You really like to eat worms?"

101
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,160
 Birds. More specifically, the birds. The Birds.

102
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:31,160
 The Alfred Hitchcock Classics Collection is available now in a 4K Ultra HD combo pack with a Blu-ray and digital code from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

103
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:38,160
 This collection includes for the very first time the original, never-released, uncut version of Psycho.

104
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:47,160
 Universally recognized as the master of suspense, the legendary Alfred Hitchcock directed some of cinema's most thrilling and unforgettable classics.

105
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:56,160
 This collection includes four iconic films from the acclaimed director's illustrious career, including Rear Window, Vertigo, Psycho, and the Birds.

106
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,160
 That's why I was talking about that in stunning 4K resolution.

 [imitates worm sound]

110
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
 That's the worm women, their name.

111
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,160
 I don't know what sound a worm makes, so they sound like horses.

112
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,160
 We jump off of our worm women and we see them fighting the birds. Don't worry, they'll win.

113
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
 And we are going to hop on the Carbentercopter, super surreal episode.

114
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
 We're hopping on the Carbentercopter.

115
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,160
 Joe S. take us out of this worm woman slash the birds battle.

116
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,160
 We are headed out to ancient Troy.

117
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
 [imitates helicopter sound]

118
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,160
 Helicopter is flying through the time vortex.

119
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,160
 Now we're back in time and it is Greek stuff.

120
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,160
 A bunch of Greek soldiers standing there with their swords and their spears.

121
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,160
 It is year 9 of the 10 year Trojan War.

122
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,160
 They're standing out on a beach and there's like a big old castle or fort or something like that.

123
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,160
 I saw a movie about it when it's starring Brad Pitt.

124
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,160
 They're like, "Yo, we want Helen of Troy."

125
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,160
 And the people in the castle are like, "Never, she's ours."

126
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,160
 And then a bunch of dudes are running up and they're like, "Punch, punch in the gate?"

127
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
 That's what they do.

128
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,160
 And the city of Troy is like, "Oh no, with enough punches eventually the gate will be destroyed."

129
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
 "Five thousand years of this it will just fall apart."

130
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,160
 So a bunch of dudes pour out of the city of Troy and they're like punching a bunch of Greeks.

131
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
 And then Achilles shows up.

132
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,160
 Or apparently his cousin is disguised as Achilles.

133
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,160
 Apparently his cousin dressed up like him or his nephew or something like that.

134
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:58,160
 And he got ganked and then the real Achilles came out and like killed a bunch of people and got stabbed in the ankle.

135
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,160
 Technically the Achilles tendon and he like died.

136
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 And then the Greeks were like, "Oh no dude."

137
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
 Achilles was like our best dude, right?

138
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,160
 There's a bunch of other warriors over there who've been like, "Oh, I thought I was the best."

139
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 And they're like, "Yeah, you'll be the best tomorrow."

140
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
 But he was the best yesterday and he's dead.

141
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:21,160
 So they're like, "The only way we can defeat Troy is we build a giant wooden horse and put a bunch of dudes in it."

142
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:29,160
 And then we like leave it outside their gates and then like you have one guy left and he's like, "Hey, Troy, you win. Here's a present for you."

143
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,160
 It's a present that happens to be big enough to hold all the soldiers that are missing on this beach.

144
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,160
 I know there was a bunch of dudes out here just a couple hours ago and they're not here now.

145
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
 They're all taking a nap.

146
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
 But it's just me and here's this horse. So then Troy's like, "Oh, it's dope."

147
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,160
 So they open their door up and the Trojan horse gets wheeled in and then that night there's no guards.

148
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,160
 Troy goes to sleep. They're like, "Oh, that's weird. Everyone else is napping. We should take a nap too."

149
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,160
 The war is over and then a bunch of Greeks popped out of the horse and begin killing everyone in the city.

150
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,160
 And then I honestly don't know what happened to Helen. I think she got kidnapped back.

151
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
 She got re-kidnapped.

152
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,160
 I don't think she died but the Greeks slaughtered everyone in Troy and that was the end of the Trojan War.

153
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,160
 Or that's what you've been led to think.

154
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,160
 This is a really interesting story on two levels. This was recommended to me by Josh.

155
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
 He sent this to me a while back.

156
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,160
 So the Trojan War has been a Greek rallying point for centuries.

157
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:36,160
 It was one of those things that they're like, "We did that. We destroyed that city. We killed all those sleeping people. Go Greece!"

158
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,160
 The Trojan War is believed to have taken place between 1260 BC and 1180 BC.

159
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,160
 And throughout the years people have kind of said, "Oh, maybe it's a myth. Maybe it didn't happen. Maybe it happened but it's exaggerated."

160
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,160
 But it's been close to 3,000, more than 3,000 years since it happened. So people have those debates now.

161
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,160
 But to question the event in ancient Greece was almost heresy.

162
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:07,160
 This philosopher shows up in ancient Greece named Dio Chrysostom and he said it didn't happen.

163
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,160
 And everyone's like, "What are you talking about?" It absolutely happened. He's like, "Hear me out."

164
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,160
 And he weaves this tale of how it's 100% fake.

165
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,160
 There's some debate over whether or not he actually believed it happened.

166
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,160
 Some people say that he's making this argument just to show that you can make an argument about anything.

167
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,160
 While other people believe that, no, he doesn't believe that the war happened.

168
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,160
 And he's trying to convince people to let go of a false past to accept the future.

169
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,160
 He says that Homer set the Iliad in the ninth year of the Tenure War to confuse you.

170
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,160
 If he'd started it from the beginning he would have to explain a bunch of stuff.

171
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,160
 He started in the ninth year. He started towards the end. He doesn't have to explain a bunch of stuff.

172
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,160
 Stuff that could leave holes in his story. He does believe that the Greeks set sail.

173
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,160
 But it was a bunch of small skirmishes. He said there was never a massive pitched battle.

174
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,160
 You didn't have these one-on-one fights with Achilles doing all this crazy stuff.

175
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:10,160
 That didn't happen. He says for about nine years the Greeks burned down villages all around Troy.

176
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,160
 And then when the Trojan army finally was like, "You know what, dude? We ought to do something."

177
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,160
 He burned down these villages. They went. They fought the Greeks and just stomped them.

178
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,160
 Pushed them back to the beach. Started to slaughter them.

179
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,160
 And the Greeks surrendered. And Troy goes, "Listen, if you surrender you gotta pay us."

180
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,160
 And they go, "Well, we didn't bring any money with us. We were hoping we would plunder it all from you guys."

181
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,160
 "You gotta give us something so they built a horse and left it at the gates."

182
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
 And then sailed home with their tail between their legs.

183
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:44,160
 But by the time they got home they had all agreed to tell a story that they had destroyed Troy.

184
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:51,160
 What's interesting about this is I'm gonna read you the beginning of his discourse on this.

185
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,160
 While I do this, I want you to think of a conspiracy theory that you believe.

186
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,160
 A conspiracy theory that you absolutely believe in.

187
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,160
 And then I want you to think of a conspiracy theory that is super dumb.

188
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,160
 Like, it's one of the ones that you hear and you can't believe other people believe in it.

189
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,160
 You hear and you're like, "Seriously, do you flat earth?" or whatever.

190
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,160
 A conspiracy theory--I want you to think of a conspiracy theory that you believe that you would argue with somebody about.

191
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,160
 And then a conspiracy theory that you think is so dumb that when people say they believe in it,

192
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,160
 it actually--you actually feel like you're talking to a dummy.

193
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,160
 Let me read you this here. This is the 11th discourse. Maintaining that Troy was not captured.

194
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:43,160
 "I am almost certain that while all men are hard to teach, they are easy to deceive.

195
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,160
 They learn with difficulty, if they learn anything, from the few that know,

196
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,160
 but they are deceived only too readily by the many who do not know.

197
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:02,160
 And not only by others, but by themselves as well, for the truth is bitter and unpleasant to the unthinking,

198
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,160
 while falsehood is sweet and pleasant.

199
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:12,160
 They are, I fancy, like men with sore eyes. They find the light painful,

200
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:18,160
 while the darkness, which permits them to see nothing, is restful and agreeable.

201
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,160
 Else how would falsehood often prove mightier than the truth,

202
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,160
 if it did not win its victories through pleasure?

203
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,160
 But though, as I have said, it is hard for men to learn,

204
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,160
 it is immensely more difficult for them to unlearn and learn over again,

205
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,160
 especially when they have been listening to a falsehood for a long time.

206
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,160
 And not only themselves, but their fathers, their grandfathers, and generally speaking,

207
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,160
 all former generations have been deceived.

208
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,160
 For it is no easy matter to disabuse these of their opinion,

209
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,160
 no matter how clearly you show it to be wrong."

210
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,160
 I think you guys are all intelligent, I don't think you guys really need a breakdown of what that means,

211
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,160
 but you may be wondering why I had you think of two completely opposite conspiracy theories,

212
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
 one that you believe in, one you think is stupid.

213
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,160
 When I was first reading this, I was like, "Ah, this totally describes flat earthers, right?

214
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,160
 Like, the lie is more comforting than the truth.

215
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,160
 The truth involves you having to think of things outside of your vision.

216
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
 You got to remember the globe, dude.

217
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,160
 You got to think of this giant ball that we're on.

218
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,160
 That's not a very comfortable thought that's spinning through space

219
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
 using all sorts of magic we call physics.

220
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,160
 They'd rather believe the lie, and as I'm reading this, I'm thinking of all the conspiracy theories

221
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,160
 that I think are total bunk for different reasons.

222
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:45,160
 But then I thought, this applies to every single conspiracy theory that I believe in as well.

223
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,160
 And it caused a little bit of-- I remember reading it and I kind of stopped.

224
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:54,160
 It kind of caused a little bit of-- I don't know if cognitive dissonance is the right term for it,

225
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,160
 but I thought about all the conspiracy theories I do believe in and the ones that I don't.

226
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,160
 And it applies equally to both.

227
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
 So this is your homework.

228
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
 You guys got homework this episode.

229
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,160
 I really want you to think about the two conspiracies you chose

230
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,160
 and think about them in the way that Dio put it.

231
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:23,160
 The lie is more comforting than the truth, and it's easier for a man to learn

232
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,160
 than it is to unlearn something and then learn it again.

233
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,160
 Because we're all pretty entrenched in our conspiracy theories.

234
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,160
 Now, I've been very open with the fact, very open with you guys with the fact

235
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,160
 that I was a 9/11 truth-er for about 10 years.

236
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,160
 It wasn't a brief flirtation. We dated. It was a long-term relationship.

237
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,160
 We were close to getting engaged.

238
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
 10 years, I was a 9/11 truth-er.

239
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,160
 I'd say about that, 8 to 10 years, somewhere around that.

240
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,160
 Again, it was more than a weekend. It was more than a weed-fueled weekend watching YouTube.

241
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
 I really believed 9/11 was an inside jump.

242
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:02,160
 Now, the closest I'll come is that elements of the government may have known it was coming

243
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
 and may have assisted with it.

244
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,160
 You may have had a couple generals paid off or colonels paid off or something like that.

245
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,160
 That's within the realm of possibility, because that type of spy craft happens all the time.

246
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,160
 But the idea of bombs being put in the buildings, I don't believe in that anymore.

247
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
 Well, I did.

248
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:27,160
 First, I saw some unedited footage from 9/11, building 7 collapsing.

249
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,160
 I go, "Whoa, the truth-er community had been showing me edited footage for the past 8 to 10 years."

250
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
 I don't remember the exact timeline, but...

251
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,160
 So that was a wake-up call. I was being lied to by the...

252
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,160
 The ones who don't know are doing most of the teaching, see?

253
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,160
 I was being lied to by the truth-er community as well as the government,

254
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
 because you know the government's gonna lie to you, right?

255
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:54,160
 And then I just kind of really started thinking about the physics behind it all.

256
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,160
 How could you wire three buildings with explosives?

257
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,160
 Nobody find the explosives.

258
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,160
 Fly two planes into two of the buildings.

259
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,160
 Don't disconnect any of the explosives.

260
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
 The explosives don't go off early.

261
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,160
 And still, even though you have these buildings completely wired with bombs,

262
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,160
 they survive the plane crash, they survive the fireball, they survive the physical impact, all of this stuff,

263
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,160
 none of the bombs get disconnected, they still act perfectly.

264
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
 You could take a building, and now this is 9/11.

265
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,160
 9/11 segment, but you could prove this, actually.

266
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,160
 Take a two-three-story building, 'cause you're rich, you can buy one of those.

267
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,160
 A wire with explosives. Don't actually do this, even if you are rich,

268
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,160
 but take a three-story building, wire with the explosives, drive a bulldozer through it,

269
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,160
 and see if the explosives still go off perfectly.

270
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,160
 Because I'm pretty sure a couple cables are gonna get ripped when the bulldozer smashes through the wall.

271
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,160
 But I had to, I was really invested in 9/11 conspiracy theories.

272
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,160
 I really believed it, and I put myself out there by arguing it with people,

273
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,160
 both people I knew, and random people.

274
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,160
 And not online, mind you, in real life, right?

275
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,160
 I wasn't hitting up forums and stuff like that, I'd be talking to people in real life,

276
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,160
 telling them that 9/11 was an inside job, that the buildings were wired with bombs.

277
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,160
 I'm just asking questions, all that stuff.

278
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
 Now, the conspiracy theory that you chose, you may go,

279
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,160
 "Well, J, so 9/11 was an inside job." It was dumb.

280
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,160
 I don't believe that, but my conspiracy theory that I chose is my favorite conspiracy theory, is true.

281
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,160
 I still want you to look at it from the point of view, of deal.

282
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,160
 I think it will open your eyes.

283
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,160
 Now, it may open your eyes to go, "Oh, I've doubled down on my conspiracy theory.

284
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
 I actually believe it's even more true now."

285
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,160
 And it may be true, see, that's the thing. There are conspiracy theories that I still believe in.

286
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,160
 And I've talked about those on past episodes, but it's an interesting experiment.

287
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,160
 I really want you guys to look at conspiracy theory.

288
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,160
 I want you to look at the conspiracy theory you chose as one you really believe in.

289
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,160
 And, yeah, think about it in that sense.

290
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,160
 Who did you learn it from? Are they the learned of us?

291
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,160
 Who did they learn it from? Has it been passed down for generations?

292
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,160
 Is it a recent conspiracy theory?

293
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,160
 Really kind of analyze it and take it apart.

294
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,160
 And if you put it back together and you still believe it, that's totally fine.

295
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,160
 I'm not here to poo poo all over your conspiracy theories.

296
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,160
 Again, I have conspiracy theories that I still believe in.

297
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,160
 And people have said, "Oh, that's probably not true."

298
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,160
 For example, I'll just say this, because not everyone listened to episode 5 of the podcast.

299
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,160
 There was a conspiracy theory going around that the private prison industry needed more inmates.

300
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,160
 So they teamed up. It sounds ridiculous, right? This sounds ridiculous, but it's one of those conspiracy theories that I go, "Yeah, it's probably true."

301
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,160
 Private prison industry was starting to boom in the late 80s, early 90s.

302
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,160
 But when you have for-profit run prisons, you definitely need prisoners.

303
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:56,160
 So this guy tells the story where he was a producer and the record companies of the late 80s met with people from the private prison industry.

304
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:04,160
 And they said, "You guys need to make gangster rap the number one music out there, because we need people to fill our prisons."

305
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:11,160
 Interesting conspiracy theory, it's definitely possible, because I think at the end, I believe conspiracy theories that involve greed

306
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,160
 tend to be more realistic than involve world domination.

307
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,160
 Because even if you took over the world, then what? Right?

308
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:25,160
 You take over the world, you kill off 90% of the world's population. It's down to 500 million. And then what?

309
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:33,160
 Then the strong survive, see. All the rich people who are getting ready to have this utopia where there's only 500 million people.

310
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:39,160
 The second that happens, the physically strongest or the most military astute will rule the planet.

311
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:47,160
 And the Bill Gates and the Jeff Bezos and all these people who put their money into this pot to do this are second-class citizens at best.

312
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:53,160
 And they're smart enough to know that. They're smart enough to know that. Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are smart enough to know.

313
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,160
 I don't think they're a part of this conspiracy theory. I don't think the conspiracy theory is actually true.

314
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:03,160
 But that's a very common one. That there's a ruling class that wants to decimate the world population and they will rule.

315
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:10,160
 They will rule for exactly 72 hours before one of them seizes power from the rest. And they know that.

316
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:18,160
 That's why that's a dumb conspiracy theory. And it's super popular out there. It doesn't work past day three. It really doesn't.

317
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:28,160
 The Illuminati took over the planet, or some people say they already run it, but let's say they enacted their new world order and they begin coaling the population and everything like that.

318
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:39,160
 By sunset day three, it's utter civil chaos in the Illuminati Council. Conspiracy theories always have this weird, they never take it to the next step.

319
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:45,160
 They go, "Reptilians are taking over the planet. Okay, why?" "For food." Okay.

320
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:51,160
 And then what happens when, well, first off, why aren't they just eating us now if they're so powerful?

321
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:59,160
 And then, then what? They rule us we're like cattle. Okay. They could have done that in 1482 way easier than they can do that in 2020.

322
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,160
 So I don't know why they didn't do it back then, but they never really argue them past that step.

323
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,160
 What happens after the Illuminati takes control on day four? They're decimated as well.

324
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:16,160
 Okay, now I'm getting off topic. And I'm doing that thing that's really easy to do when you have a podcast.

325
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:22,160
 I'm setting up strawmen and knocking them down, but I really want you to think of the conspiracy theory you really like.

326
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,160
 That's your homework for today. And think about it from his point of view.

327
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:35,160
 And I'm not saying that this is true, but from his point of view, the reason why you believe that conspiracy theory you like is because it's easy to believe.

328
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,160
 It's easier to believe than the truth. The truth is hard to believe.

329
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:48,160
 The conspiracy will always be easier to swallow because, one, it makes sense of a random chaotic world.

330
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:56,160
 Two, it gives you a sense of comfort because it makes you feel special because you have secret knowledge of the universe.

331
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:03,160
 And three, a lie is always more comfortable to the human mind.

332
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:10,160
 But all that being said, all that being said, Lady Gaga probably did murder all those people.

333
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:18,160
 That's one of the conspiracy theories, I believe, and the one that's potentially probably going to get me sued by the Gaga state.

334
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,160
 But even then, it's so funny I laugh about that one.

335
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,160
 That conspiracy theory I probably think about more than most nowadays.

336
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,160
 Every time I see Lady Gaga, I go, "Did she really?"

337
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,160
 Huh? I don't know. Maybe what?

338
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
 Huh?

339
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:43,160
 Those are the noises I make whenever I see a Lady Gaga article. Really? Do you really think she did that?

340
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,160
 Did I? Do I think? I mean, I think about it almost every day.

341
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,160
 Did a Lady Gaga actually murder two people? I don't know.

342
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,160
 The lie is always more comfortable than the truth, right?

343
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:03,160
 But, but sometimes the lie is the truth.

344
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,160
 Take that ancient Greek philosopher.
