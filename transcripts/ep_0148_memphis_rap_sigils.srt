1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
 A haunted house that almost went out of its way to become extra haunted.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,080
 And then we take a look at Memphis Rap Sigils.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,400
 Off the conspiracy iceberg.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,800
 To some of you, it's just three words put together.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,320
 To longtime followers of the iceberg, one of the most enduring mysteries.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,300
 But whichever group you're a part of.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,800
 Today's episode is going to be absolutely insane.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:43,200
 *Metal music*

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,900
 Hello white stuff mild foe.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,700
 Other people call you snow.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,400
 Why did you have to come to town?

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,400
 You make it hard to walk around.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,400
 And your slickness makes me slip and hit the ground.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
 I'm going down.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
 See my frown.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,400
 It's snowing.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
 Please nature, why do you have to snow?

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 You even made me interrupt my normal joyous greeting.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
 I'm having a great day.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
 I hope you're having a great day too.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
 I hope you're having a snow free day because it has blanketed the city.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,400
 And last night I was wearing flip flops.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
 Try walking home and flip flops in the snow.

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,400
 You can say well Jason, that's what you get for wearing flip flops in January in the Pacific Northwest.

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
 Go away snow.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,400
 Nobody likes you.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
 Just go.

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,400
 Hang out in the mountains, with the yetis and the skiers and the snow bunnies.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
 I will say this.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,400
 On a side note, as much as I hate snow, I love snow bunnies.

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
 There's nothing about an attractive woman and a bunch of puffy clothes.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
 I find that very attractive.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
 They're usually bright colors too.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,400
 Attractive women and puffy clothes, that's a unique fetish.

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,400
 I'm sure I can find some photos of that online.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
 But okay, that's enough of that.

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
 I do love me some snow bunnies though.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
 I've got two great stories to cover today.

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
 Very interesting stuff.

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
 We're going to go ahead and get started.

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,400
 It's funny because the first story, as I was researching it,

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 I'm reading it and I'm like okay, ghost walking on the hallway.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
 There's been this huge amount of ghost sightings at this house.

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,400
 And some interesting ones, but as I was researching it, there's just ghost walking on the hallway, which I don't find interesting.

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,400
 But as I'm researching it, I'm like this house almost went out of its way to become a haunted house.

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
 Its past is absolutely bunkers.

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
 So we're in Coloma, California.

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
 And this is the late 1800s.

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
 These two gold mining friends were like hey, this sucks.

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
 We're not making any money from the gold mining thing.

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
 Let's figure out something else to do.

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
 So you had the two dudes.

56
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,400
 You had Martin Alhoff and Robert Chalmers.

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,400
 And they're like yeah, this just isn't doing it for us.

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
 There's haunted mules in the mine.

59
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
 We're not finding any gold.

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
 This sucks.

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,400
 So they stayed friends, but they stopped gold mining.

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 Martin goes off and starts a vineyard.

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,400
 And it becomes this super successful vineyard in the area.

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,400
 Robert Chalmers goes the opposite route.

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,400
 He opens a hotel in the 1800s where a bunch of prospectors running around.

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 No booze.

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
 That was the rule.

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,400
 It was a total, what's the word, a Tito toddler?

69
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
 Tito toddler.

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,400
 Anyways, so he opens a hotel.

71
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
 No booze allowed.

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
 No one visits it.

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
 It goes out of business.

74
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,400
 But his buddy Martin, who has the vineyard, is doing great.

75
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,400
 Except he doesn't have a liquor license and he's not paying his taxes.

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,400
 Now Martin at this point has a family, has a wife and some kids.

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
 Super successful award-winning wine.

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
 But he's facing these legal troubles.

79
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
 So he kills himself.

80
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,400
 So that's ghost cause number one.

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,400
 Now Robert is like, you know, my buddy just died and my business is failing.

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
 How can I resuscitate a buttercup?

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,400
 How can I combine these two things into one?

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,400
 And he goes, hmm, I know, I got it.

85
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,400
 A little resuscitate a buttercup appears above his head.

86
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,400
 He goes, I will marry my best friend's wife, Widow.

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
 And then I'll get a free vineyard.

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:33,400
 So he goes from being a total non-alcohol dude to banging his best friend's wife and taking over the vineyard.

89
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,400
 Now he's producing this award-winning wine.

90
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
 And everything's good.

91
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
 Everything's happy.

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
 Until he starts going crazy.

93
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
 So Robert, the idea is people think that he had got syphilis at some point.

94
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,400
 But whatever the cause of it, he was going totally bonkers.

95
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,400
 He would start just forgetting stuff in the middle of the day, which is normal, which can happen.

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,400
 But what's not normal is a cross from the house.

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
 I guess there was a graveyard across from the vineyard.

98
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
 There was a graveyard where their house was not in the graveyard, but the house.

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
 Okay, there was a house and a vineyard attached to it.

100
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
 And then across the way there was a graveyard.

101
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,400
 And one day he saw them digging a grave and he's just looking out the window, looking at the grave.

102
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
 And the people in the house, they were already a little suspicious because he was acting weird.

103
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
 He just walks out of the house, crawls under the grave and just lays down, puts his hands over his chest,

104
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
 and they have to force him to get out of the grave.

105
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,400
 And at this point they're like, "Okay, this guy's having some real problems."

106
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
 He starts getting really angry.

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
 He starts lashing out at people.

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,400
 So this could be ghost cause number two, because they just saw this emotional energy.

109
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 So his wife, Martin's Widow, and now Robert's wife,

110
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
 secretly has a jail cell built in the basement.

111
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
 So when he's just up there kind of dawdling around doing crazy people stuff,

112
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,400
 she's like having contractors come in, like bringing metal bars, giant gates, huge thing, a keys,

113
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,400
 and Robert's like too out of it to realize what's going on.

114
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,400
 And then the wife is like, "Hey, Robert, why don't you come downstairs into the wine room

115
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
 and show me what wine is made out of again?"

116
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
 And Robert's like, "Okay, are there any graves down there I can crawl into?"

117
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
 And she's like, "Uh, maybe."

118
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
 So he's like put on his pajamas.

119
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
 He's like, "Yes, a grave."

120
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
 They go downstairs.

121
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
 There's an open jail cell there.

122
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,400
 And she's like, "Uh, why don't you step inside the jail cell real quick?"

123
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
 And he does.

124
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,400
 I mean, that's the, again, I'm learning that the world is basically one giant loony-tune cartoon.

125
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,400
 So he walks out of the jail cell, they lock him in, and he's in there until he dies.

126
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
 They want to try to rehabilitate him.

127
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,400
 But at this point, he's trapped in the jail cell.

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
 He's banging his head against the bars.

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
 He starts to go blind, and that's why they think that it was syphilis,

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
 although it could be from the repeated head banging on metal bars.

131
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
 That's also another theory.

132
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,400
 And eventually he came into the delusion that his wife was trying to poison him,

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 and he stopped eating and he died.

134
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,400
 Now you have this widow in charge of this huge vineyard.

135
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
 She doesn't know anything about wine.

136
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,400
 It's like, "I should have had him show me what wine was made out of before I locked him in that cell."

137
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
 He's trapped, he's dead.

138
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,400
 She is completely, like, she's starting to lose money.

139
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
 So first off, she rents out the house to some boarders.

140
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
 So she rents out a couple rooms.

141
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
 That's not making enough money.

142
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,400
 The local town goes, "Hey, we heard you have a jail cell in your basement, in your wine cell."

143
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
 And she's like, "Yeah, yeah, it was, I kind of built it.

144
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
 It was a one-time thing.

145
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 I thought it would be a better investment."

146
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,400
 The town goes, "Tell you what, we will rent it from you to house criminals in your house in this jail cell."

147
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 So now she's renting out rooms in the house and she has a jail in her basement.

148
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,400
 And then the town's like, "You know what?

149
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
 We really like your jail cell.

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
 We really do.

151
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
 It's going really good."

152
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
 But we're having a bit of a problem because we put people in the jail

153
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,400
 and then we got to bring them all the way back to town to hang them.

154
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
 But you have just this amazing tree in your front yard.

155
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
 I mean, we've had people come out.

156
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
 It is the perfect hanging tree.

157
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
 It was actually an hanging tree monthly.

158
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,400
 She's like, "Oh, I was wondering what that photographer was doing there."

159
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,400
 So then she leases out her tree to the city to hang people.

160
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
 There's just hanging dudes in her front yard.

161
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,400
 Now, at that point, she's not like Bill Gates rich, but she's no longer worried about, you know, being homeless.

162
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
 Nowadays, the place is a hotel.

163
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
 It's called the Vineyard House.

164
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
 It's still around.

165
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
 You can rent a room.

166
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
 You can check it out.

167
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
 Tons of ghost sightings.

168
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
 Obviously, a ton of ghost sightings.

169
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,400
 Ghosts walking on the hallway, ghost standing, you know, in your bedroom, stuff like that.

170
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
 One of the most terrifying ones, though, are actually related.

171
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
 When I read up on this, I'll read about, it'll say,

172
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,400
 "A Sacramento couple stayed in this hotel and experienced this haunting I'm about to talk about.

173
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,400
 I'm pretty sure I know who this couple is."

174
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
 I'm pretty sure.

175
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,400
 I'm not 100%, but just from connections that I have, because I'm from Sacramento.

176
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
 I'm pretty sure I know who this couple is.

177
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,400
 And I haven't talked to them directly about this, but their story is this.

178
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,400
 They're staying the night at this hotel that they knew was going to be haunted.

179
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 And after a couple hours, they just check out.

180
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,400
 They go downstairs and they're like, "Keep our money. We're leaving."

181
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,400
 And when the bellboy or the concierge, whatever the dude is behind the counter and all those movies,

182
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 when he goes, "Well, why?" and they go, "Uh..."

183
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
 I think someone's being murdered in the next room.

184
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
 I'm pretty sure someone's getting murdered over there.

185
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,400
 So at that point, they call the police.

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,400
 They're like, "Well, before you check out, maybe if you think someone's getting murdered there,

187
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
 maybe you should call the police. Okay, we'll call the police."

188
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
 Police show up. They go in the room. There's nothing.

189
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
 Which is kind of what everyone suspected.

190
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
 They figured they knew they were in a haunted hotel.

191
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
 You hear the sound of someone being murdered.

192
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
 It means one of two things.

193
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
 Someone is actually being murdered.

194
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
 Or it's a ghost.

195
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
 Cops come. They check it out. There's nothing in there.

196
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,400
 But the segment of couples like that, that's what we figured.

197
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
 That's why we didn't call the cops at first.

198
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
 But we're still not staying here, because that was terrifying.

199
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,400
 The sound of someone being murdered would be quite scary.

200
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
 I mean, it's more than just like a tussle.

201
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
 Like, "Uh, uh, fight! Come on, push me!

202
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
 Uh, uh, let me back my money!"

203
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,400
 It's straight up like begging and sobbing and like,

204
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
 wet, thwacking noises.

205
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
 As whatever you're hitting with them penetrates flesh.

206
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
 Quite gruesome.

207
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
 And a...

208
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
 another version of that story, well, a...

209
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
 separate version.

210
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
 Later on, another couple was staying in the room.

211
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
 Where...

212
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,400
 So, one couple was in a room, let's call it room one.

213
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 And they heard a murder occurring in room two.

214
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
 A time later, a couple was in room two.

215
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
 And when they woke up in the middle of the night,

216
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,400
 they saw the phantom of a man just beaten the tar out of a little boy.

217
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
 I mean, just straight up going at him.

218
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
 Just, "Woo! Woo!"

219
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
 Again, super brutal.

220
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,400
 Like, we're used to hearing stories about ghosts kind of walking around

221
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
 or turning lights off and stuff like that.

222
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,400
 But to actually see two ghosts fight is super, super rare.

223
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400
 I mean, outside of like a Civil War battlefield.

224
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
 But then to just see one ghost be like,

225
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
 "No, I don't want to fight, I don't want to fight!"

226
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,400
 And just getting pummeled for the implication, eternity!

227
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,400
 This little boy is getting just beat up for the rest of eternity

228
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
 by this old man ghost.

229
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 "Give me your lunch money!"

230
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
 "I don't eat lunch!"

231
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
 "Slimer already took it!"

232
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
 "Grrrrrrrr!"

233
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
 Punching him.

234
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
 Punching out ectoplasm.

235
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,400
 Slimer's eating his guts, eating little kid's guts that come out.

236
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,400
 So yeah, oh dude, actually, did you hear they're making Ghostbusters 3?

237
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 They just dropped a teaser trailer for it.

238
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,400
 It's by Ivan Reitman's son and they're forgetting the stupid Ghostbusters remake.

239
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
 It's a brand new Ghostbusters 3.

240
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,400
 So my slimer jokes are going to be more apt pretty soon.

241
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
 Summer 2020, hopefully it's good.

242
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 But anyway, so old man beating up a kid for eternity.

243
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 Terrifying stuff.

244
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
 Creepy stuff.

245
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,400
 I would probably stay in that hotel though, just because I think if I stayed out of one of those two rooms

246
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
 I would just see like a ghost walking around.

247
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,400
 I'd see a little boy like all laughing, running down the hallway, and I see him going to room 2.

248
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
 I'm like, "No dude, don't, don't!"

249
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
 He's like, "I'm destined to."

250
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
 He walks through the door.

251
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
 Terrifying.

252
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
 I, yeah.

253
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 We're now headed to Memphis, Tennessee.

254
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,400
 Isn't that where Graceland's at?

255
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
 I'm going to Graceland, Graceland, Memphis, Tennessee.

256
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
 I'm going to Graceland.

257
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
 Yeah, so we're not going to Graceland though.

258
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
 I wonder if Elvis' Ghost is around.

259
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
 We're not going to Graceland.

260
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
 We're going to Memphis, Tennessee.

261
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,400
 And what we have in Memphis, Tennessee is one of the most requested topics.

262
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,400
 Now, whenever I go to 4chan and I'm talking about the podcast and looking for ideas,

263
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,400
 the number one thing people ask for is Memphis Rap Sigils.

264
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,400
 It's been on the conspiracy iceberg for a long time back to one of the earlier ones back in 2017.

265
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,400
 August 2017 is when it first appeared.

266
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,400
 Oh, and I got to, this is, I wanted to say that although this has been extremely requested,

267
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,400
 especially every time I go to 4chan, two YouTube users in particular, Holly Co-Arris and Northside,

268
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
 have requested this story as well.

269
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
 And we got a lot to cover.

270
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,400
 So this episode will probably run a little bit long, but first off, let's take a look at the phrase here.

271
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,400
 Now, out of all of them, there are a lot of them that, and this was the same thing where I go,

272
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
 this is probably word soup.

273
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,400
 And there have been a few that I have been able to really, really track down to an origin like Ageless Travel.

274
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:14,400
 So let's take a look at what the phrase means, at least what it purports to mean.

275
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
 Memphis Rap Sigils.

276
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
 It's really two things, Memphis Rap and Sigils.

277
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,400
 Now, Memphis Rap is a very particular form of rap.

278
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,400
 It really exploded in the early 1990s, around 1994.

279
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:34,400
 It was growing, it had a little bit of momentum in this like, super, like '89 to '93,

280
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
 you were starting to see it bubbling up.

281
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 But in '94 is when it exploded in Memphis and began to spill out and become a nationwide thing.

282
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400
 On the West Coast, it was really dominated by gangster rap.

283
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,400
 On the East Coast, it was more of like a hip-hop party vibe.

284
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,400
 And as the years progressed, you started to see that coalesce even more,

285
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,400
 where you'd have a little bit of gangster stuff on the East Coast, but it was more,

286
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
 the big stuff was like Puff Daddy and Notorious B.I.G. and stuff like that.

287
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
 It was all about excess.

288
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,400
 On the West Coast, we started having the gangster rap of NWA and Ice Cube and Ice Tea and all that stuff.

289
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,400
 And you started to see some cross-contamination, but regionally though,

290
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,400
 groups were trying to form their own identity.

291
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:20,400
 And what Memphis Rap really settled into was a genre, a subgenre known as Horror Core.

292
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
 So very, very dark, disturbing lyrics.

293
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 A lot of, not just like shooting people type of lyrics, but like,

294
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,400
 they would use horror movie samples, whereas opposed to the West Coast may use like,

295
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
 samples from 1970s black spoiltation films.

296
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
 You would see horror movie samples in Memphis Rap in Horror Core.

297
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,400
 And that's how you have groups called, one of the biggest groups to come out of Memphis is 3/6 Mafia.

298
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,400
 They really, these groups really kind of embrace the darker energy of hip-hop.

299
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
 It allowed them to establish their own brand.

300
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,400
 If you wanted the most extreme dark rap, you listened to Memphis Rap.

301
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
 It had a different cadence to the rap.

302
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,400
 It had a different beat style, instrumental style.

303
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
 So they were really trying to establish their brand.

304
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,400
 And basically, just like how you had WWE with wrestling back then, WWF.

305
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
 And then you had WCW.

306
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,400
 When the next group jumped up, it was ECW, Extreme Championship Wrestling.

307
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 And they went with the barbed wire in the glass and the fluorescent light bulbs.

308
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,400
 Sometimes to stand out from these established crowds, you have to go extreme.

309
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:32,400
 And that's really, early Memphis Rap was really focused on death and destruction and sacrifice and horror type of music.

310
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:40,400
 So when the idea, a sigil we've talked about before too, is a symbol that you create for magical working.

311
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
 Generally a sigil is written.

312
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
 However, it can also be spoken.

313
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
 It can be acted upon.

314
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,400
 It can be worked into comic books, television, movies, audio recordings, things like that.

315
00:15:51,400 --> 00:16:01,400
 So when these two things were combined, Memphis Rap sigils, it wasn't a huge leap in logic to think that one or more of these groups in Memphis

316
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,400
 was doing some sort of dark magic ritual.

317
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,400
 If it was West Coast Rap sigil or Puff Daddy sigil, it wouldn't be as evocative.

318
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:18,400
 Because we don't see those artists as being particularly infused with horror elements, with dark magical elements.

319
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:26,400
 Now today, Memphis Rap is more likely to be connected to Krunk music, which is a more form of party music.

320
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:33,400
 But when they were trying to establish their identity, they were their own thing, and that was Horror Core.

321
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
 Was every group in Memphis a Horror Core band? No.

322
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,400
 But we saw a lot of them come out of there, more so than we did on either of the coasts.

323
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
 So that's the setup.

324
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
 Memphis Rap sigils.

325
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,400
 Memphis Rap, early Memphis Rap, very dark, very horror infused.

326
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,400
 Sigil is something you use with working with magic.

327
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,400
 So the implication is dark magic was being used at some point in this.

328
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,400
 Now, like I said, this has been around since August 2017.

329
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 There's been a lot of theories throwing out to what Memphis Rap sigils means.

330
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 So we're going to go through them.

331
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,400
 We're going to go through the five established theories that have been popping up on forums about what this is.

332
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
 And we're going to discuss them.

333
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
 This episode is going to run long. I hope you guys don't mind.

334
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,400
 So the first one is, it's related to the Nephilim bases and the Appalachian Mountains.

335
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,400
 Other cities like Pittsburgh and Wheeling, West Virginia have prevalent occult activity pertaining to it.

336
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
 This is a huge red pill.

337
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,400
 So first thing, there's some sort of demon race or half angel race.

338
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
 I really want to describe them, the Nephilim living underground in the Appalachian Mountains.

339
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,400
 And this is related to that.

340
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
 That is most likely 100% not true.

341
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,400
 And the reason why, let me back up, there may be giant demons living under Appalachian Mountains.

342
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
 I don't believe so.

343
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,400
 But the reason why I dismissed that one early on is the Appalachians are nowhere near Memphis, Tennessee.

344
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
 They're on the other side of Tennessee.

345
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
 Memphis is on the west side, the Appalachians are on the east side.

346
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
 So I kind of had to say, "Ah, that's probably not true."

347
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
 So I'm going to be reading these quotes here.

348
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
 So it's not when I say "I'm," it's not me, it's somebody else.

349
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
 But I want to read these theories to you.

350
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:15,400
 "That shit is legit. I'm not sure if the entire genre was consciously aware about occult shit they dropped while talking about extreme violence and spreading chaos."

351
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,400
 "I think subconsciously, Memphis rap embodies the dark underbelly of hip-hop, the underworld, if you will."

352
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 Although Triple Six was openly devilish in their music from the start, I don't think the backwards thing works.

353
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
 I tried it, you know, backmasking, playing the music backwards to see what it says.

354
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
 And it was useless.

355
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 But that's not to take away from their music's ability to conjure dark side energy from the beat alone.

356
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 Then with the lyrics on top, it's icing on the cake.

357
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,400
 I'd say a good 80% of the genre is like that.

358
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 Memphis was an interesting place.

359
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:54,400
 So now we're kind of getting to something, that the music itself, the genre itself, is infused with some sort of dark energy.

360
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
 Just overall. That's a layer.

361
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
 Because I'll tell you this right now.

362
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,400
 There is an answer to the puzzle of Memphis rap sigils.

363
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
 And we'll get to that.

364
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
 But we have to put these layers down.

365
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
 That theory has been floating around for a while.

366
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 Theory number three. The idea is sort of that because the artist producers committed several murders and the location where they took place holds a lot of leftover soul energy from the lives that were taken.

367
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:30,400
 The lingering energy of known tragedies in the area goes back as far as the history of the United States with some big Indian massacres, then onto slavery, then civil war,

368
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:39,400
 then about a hundred years more violence until you get to the 1990s where Memphis was within the top five murder capitals in the country, I believe.

369
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:49,400
 Basically, if you believe the Luciferian idea that it's possible to take a life and manifest that energy into something that becomes real in a sort of ritual,

370
00:19:49,400 --> 00:20:00,400
 there would be some kind of medium between the spirit world and the world we know to be true. The life energy, the death energy, the demon, the magnetic taping in a cassette.

371
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 This was one of the most popular theories that was going around.

372
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,400
 That the sigil itself was the audio recording of the music.

373
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:22,400
 So whatever magical working one of these dark groups did in Memphis, they infused it into the music. Specifically, they recorded their albums where they had committed murders.

374
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:31,400
 So you kill some people and you either kill them in your studio and record the music there, or you kill them at a remote location and take your gear there and record it.

375
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:44,400
 This is a very interesting idea. My pushback to, I'm not going to deny the theoretical esoteric fact that you could somehow trap soul energy in some sort of recording device.

376
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:55,400
 I'm not going to necessarily dispute that. The issue I have with that is it would be extremely impractical to kill people at your place of recording because now basically you are at a crime scene constantly.

377
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:04,400
 And you always got to worry about being found out. You're taking people to a location where people know you are at and then those people don't leave.

378
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
 So it would be very tricky. It's not impossible, but it would be tricky.

379
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:19,400
 The idea of going to a place with your recording gear to a remote location where you have murdered people back in the early 90s would be very, very hard.

380
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,400
 They did not have the portable equipment we have today. It existed, but it's very expensive.

381
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:31,400
 And when you listen to these early versions of Memphis rap, it's very lo-fi. They're still selling cassette tapes out of the back of their car.

382
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:40,400
 Nowadays, I can take a digital recorder, go into the middle of a protest in Portland and get amazing audio and video recording, but back then you couldn't.

383
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,400
 You really couldn't. However, there is a workaround to that, and we'll get to that in a second.

384
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:52,400
 But I think, again, now we're on the right path. The music, the genre itself is very dark. It's in an area that is full of tragedy.

385
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,400
 This theory here that somehow this soul energy was captured onto an audio recording.

386
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
 The next theory here, and this again was one of the more common ones.

387
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:15,400
 Memphis rap sigils refers to the worship of eight tracks that had mysterious properties imbued into them via hardcore Memphis hip-hop, such as my copy of "Blank of Destruction."

388
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,400
 I think you can figure out what "blank" is. I'm not going to say the word because this is a podcast and I like having a YouTube channel and a podcast.

389
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 But it's the N word, and you guys can criticize me for not saying it, but I think you understand that it's not worth it to say it and get my channel flag and all that stuff.

390
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,400
 So, this was the one that popped up first that I saw.

391
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,400
 Was there is this group, we'll just call them "Brothers of Destruction." Brothers of Destruction.

392
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:46,400
 There is this group and they have a self-titled album, and that this album itself, by listening to it, opens some sort of portal.

393
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,400
 Like, this is interesting because the theories get more and more concrete. One is very general.

394
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
 The appellation one is ridiculous, the other one is just the general areas haunted.

395
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:06,400
 The second one is you have this idea of soul, energy, and death being actually transferred to a magnetic tape that's used in the recording process.

396
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,400
 The next one is we actually can name the album apparently.

397
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,400
 "Brothers of Destruction" that has eight tracks that are imbued with some sort of mysterious energy.

398
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:22,400
 It's an interesting theory. The one problem I found, and I could be wrong on this, but the self-titled album I found of there is if I remember there's only six tracks on it.

399
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
 So there might be an eight track version of that album floating around.

400
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
 Maybe they're two missing tracks for the ones that have this energy.

401
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,400
 But you can listen to their music on YouTube.

402
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,400
 And a cassette tape from that band is $100 now. It's a collector's item.

403
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
 But you can actually listen to their music on YouTube. It's just Memphis rap.

404
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,400
 But it's not to say it isn't infused with some sort of dark energy.

405
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
 So Jason, you're still floating around in vague land.

406
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
 You've listened to the music. You're not saying that you've experienced anything.

407
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,400
 You have talked to us about these theories that get increasingly more specific.

408
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,400
 What's the answer? Do you know what Memphis rap sigils are?

409
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,400
 And I do. At least I think I do.

410
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 Let's move on to the last theory I have here.

411
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
 Very brief.

412
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
 And oddly specific.

413
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,400
 Did three bands really summon the God from the fourth corner over the spirits of three sacrificed children?

414
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,400
 Are there really gateways to hell and Memphis?

415
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 And if it is all true, which are the bands who participated and which albums aligned to form the sigil?

416
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,400
 And how is it accessed and utilized?

417
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,400
 That's the theory. That's the sigil.

418
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
 And this is what I mean.

419
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,400
 I'm going to take a couple pieces from the other ones as well, but that is the answer.

420
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,400
 This brief sentence from 4chan is the answer. And here's why.

421
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
 I had to kind of break it apart to get to it.

422
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
 And when I first read it, I just put it in my notes.

423
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,400
 But as a continuity research, I kept coming back to that phrase. That's the answer, guys.

424
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,400
 Let's break it apart. Are there really gateways to hell and Memphis?

425
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
 Not that I could find. It's not listed as one of the seven gateways of hell.

426
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,400
 It's not one of the other gateways of hell.

427
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,400
 Like the seven official ones, there's much further ones. It's not listed in any of them.

428
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
 It doesn't mean there's not one, but it's not listed there.

429
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,400
 Yes, Memphis does have a dark history, but so do a lot of cities on the south and east coast, especially.

430
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,400
 Did three bands really summon the God from the fourth corner over the spirits of three sacrificed children?

431
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 That sentence sounds very nonsensical, and it very well might be.

432
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
 But let's break it apart.

433
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:29,400
 So, Memphis, the name of the city, is named after a city from ancient Egypt.

434
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,400
 Memphis is also the name of a god, a water goddess, to be specific.

435
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
 A god from the fourth corner. Puzzling phrase.

436
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,400
 Now, I'll tell you this right now. What I'm going to say may sound very Hans-like, because I'm making these connections.

437
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,400
 And although I say it may solve this murder and it may do this stuff, I have absolutely no proof of any of this.

438
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
 And I guess I probably should have said this earlier. I have no proof.

439
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,400
 These are all interesting coincidences that add up to something.

440
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,400
 But if you want to say, "Dude, you've gone full Hans," I totally get it.

441
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,400
 Memphis is a city that is named after a god. The fourth corner. I'm puzzled by that.

442
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,400
 What's the fourth corner? Now, this is where I start to stretch it.

443
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,400
 If you take a compass, you can name it North-South-East-West, or North-East-South-West.

444
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,400
 Very rarely do you go North-West-South-East. It normally goes clockwise, or North-South-East-West.

445
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,400
 So the fourth corner we will establish is West. Now, you go Jason. That's a reach, and that's fine.

446
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,400
 And it would be a reach if there wasn't something to grasp.

447
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,400
 West of Memphis.

448
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,400
 Did three bands really summon the god from the fourth corner over the spirits of three sacrificed children?

449
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:51,400
 In 1993, in West Memphis, West of Memphis, 15 miles away,

450
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:59,400
 three boys were brutally murdered in a ritual fashion in the Robin Hood Hills in West Memphis.

451
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:05,400
 These boys, Steve Branch, Christopher Byers, and James Michael Moore,

452
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:13,400
 their deaths led to the arrest of the West Memphis three, three local teenagers who were thrown in prison.

453
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,400
 Eventually, they got released about, what was it like, maybe 19, 20 years later.

454
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,400
 The police believe that they are still guilty. The courts still believe they are guilty.

455
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,400
 But they're released. They deny it. The makers of the documentary's Paradise Lost,

456
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,400
 they were putting out evidence that the kids didn't do it.

457
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,400
 The kids were, the three victims were, in police words, sacrificed in some sort of ritual.

458
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,400
 One of them was castrated. All of them had multiple injuries to their bodies.

459
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,400
 And two of them were stabbed or injured and then drowned.

460
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,400
 The night that they were killed, a black man came into a restaurant called O'Jingles.

461
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,400
 Covered in blood, went to the restroom, left blood everywhere, ran out.

462
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,400
 Police came, got the blood samples, and they lost them.

463
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,400
 There was a single hair from a black man on a blanket at the location of the murders.

464
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:13,400
 Now, I think it probably goes without saying that most of the rappers in the Memphis rap community were black.

465
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:24,400
 You had a group of musicians who were very into dark arts, horror core, mystical energy from a darker place.

466
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,400
 Now, you can be a fan of those things and not be a brutal slayer,

467
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,400
 but if you get too caught up in the illusion of what you are talking about,

468
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:46,400
 it is a very easy descent to go from fantasizing about a dark life full of sacrificial rituals and blood and murder,

469
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,400
 and indulging in those things. Not everyone will, but some people do.

470
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,400
 Three kids killed in West Memphis in a sacrificial way.

471
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:04,400
 If the coincidence is right, the fourth corner, the West of Memphis, to appease a God,

472
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:13,400
 a God that the city of Memphis is inspired by, a God of water, where two of the children are drowned,

473
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:23,400
 a year after the murders, roughly, give or take, in 1994 is when Memphis rap exploded onto the scene,

474
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:31,400
 both regionally and nationally. Is it possible? Again, absolutely no proof.

475
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:40,400
 But is it possible that three bands from Memphis, simply traveled 15 minutes over,

476
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,400
 found the perfect victims just walking, riding their bikes into the woods out of sight?

477
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:53,400
 Is it possible that three bands said, "That's it. That's the sacrifice we've been asked for.

478
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,400
 We've been asked to sacrifice three boys." And there they are.

479
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:06,400
 We will make a pact here, and we will do this to summon this sigil, this magical working.

480
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,400
 Now, you can work the other elements of the theories into this as well,

481
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,400
 like I was talking about moving the recording equipment around.

482
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,400
 A beautiful thing about hip-hop is that you can use a sampler.

483
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:23,400
 So, someone could have simply brought a cassette recorder and recorded the audio of these kids suffering

484
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:29,400
 and dying and drowning and thrashing, and then take it home and plug it into their sampler.

485
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,400
 The recording quality of that stuff is so lo-fi, you wouldn't be able to pick it up.

486
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,400
 But I'm not saying that if you listen to an album, you'll hear a kid go, "Help me, mommy, help me."

487
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:43,400
 But you can chop and screw it. You can take that and you can spin it out and put it as an underlying track on your album.

488
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,400
 So, not only have you performed the ritual, you have immortalized the ritual,

489
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,400
 and everyone who listens to that music is hearing those murders.

490
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,400
 Those murders that you got away with, those murders that have gone unsolved for the general public,

491
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,400
 unsolved for nearly 20 years.

492
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
 What I think is interesting about this theory,

493
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,400
 did three bands really summon the God from the fourth corner over the spirits of three sacrificed children?

494
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:16,400
 That's very specific, and yet whoever wrote that did not specify, I think it's related to the Robin Hood Hill murders.

495
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:23,400
 What are the chances of this person making that up and not connecting it to the Robin Hood Hill murders?

496
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,400
 And that happened only 15 minutes away from where this conspiracy normally started.

497
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,400
 And we can take this out of fantasy land, remove the God, remove the magic,

498
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:41,400
 and just have three groups saying, "We need to do this," and it doesn't work. It's all fake. Magic doesn't work.

499
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,400
 There's no God Memphis running around. She doesn't exist.

500
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:51,400
 But them thinking that she does inspires them to go kill these kids and work this sigil.

501
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,400
 I believe that's what Memphis Rap Sigil refers to.

502
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,400
 If it means anything, again, it could simply be word soup.

503
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:05,400
 I think the conspiracy theory behind Memphis Rap Sigils is that bands from Horror Corps, Memphis Rap Bands,

504
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:13,400
 from Memphis, traveled simply 15 minutes west and murdered three boys to work some sort of dark magic.

505
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,400
 Whether or not the dark magic was real, I don't know.

506
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,400
 I mean, whether or not they did it is real, I don't know.

507
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,400
 And I couldn't even name which band I think it is or anything like that, because I don't know.

508
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,400
 But I think that's what it means. I think it's related to the Robin Hood Hill murders.

509
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,400
 It makes sense. It works within the context.

510
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:42,400
 It's possible the secondary theory that these murders were recorded and then laid onto the tracks of certain albums,

511
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
 that's a side theory, but it would also make sense.

512
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,400
 If you're going to go out there and you're going to do this magical working and sacrifice these kids,

513
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:56,400
 you could also record it and that would add to the plural of Memphis Rap Sigils, because now you have two.

514
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,400
 You have the sacrifice itself as one sigil. You have the recording as a second one.

515
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
 And those beats could be passed around.

516
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:10,400
 If I'm totally off basis, I'm fine with that, because I have absolutely no proof of this at all.

517
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,400
 At all. It's a series of coincidences and, again, it very much borders on Han's territory.

518
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:25,400
 And I think really the takeaway to this is that Memphis Rap Sigils may not only be a clue in the murder of three boys,

519
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,400
 but it may have another very disturbing implication.

520
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,400
 After the murders, Memphis Rap exploded in popularity.

521
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,400
 Again, not just in the city, but nationwide.

522
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:48,400
 If this story is true, if I'm not just reaching for random facts, but if these connections are true,

523
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,400
 the disturbing thing is that Dark Magic Sigils may work.
