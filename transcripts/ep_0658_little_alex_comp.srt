1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
 Have you ever seen something on the ground and wanted to pick it up?

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,120
 Sure, we all have.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,800
 But what happens if that item is cursed?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,280
 First, we travel to Africa to find a man who sees a ring just laying there.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,520
 But when he puts it on, he gets far more than he bargained for.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,800
 And then we travel to Russia to meet an old woman who does the same thing, but she doesn't

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,720
 see it just a ring laying in a ditch.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,840
 She sees an alien baby today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,840
 Do you want to see that?

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,840
 Actually, I'm a walkthrough gal.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
 First off, let's introduce our newest Patreon supporter.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,440
 She is the sun itself.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,160
 Everyone give a round of applause to Eve Jones as her high temperature melts us all.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,320
 Our hands stopped clapping.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,840
 A giant effervescent sun ball comes flowing in.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
 It's Eve.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,080
 It is Eve.

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,720
 These intros are getting more and more abstract.

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,560
 Eve, turn into a human please and I'll toss you the keys to whatever vehicle I don't want

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
 you to melt them.

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,200
 Eve, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,080
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you're not a celestial body, that's fine

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
 too.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
 Just help spread the word about the show.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,680
 Really, really helps out a lot.

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,920
 Eve Jones, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,800
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
 We are headed out to Ghana.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,480
 Specifically, we're headed out to Casso, Ghana.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,680
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is flying on out there.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,160
 Thank you so much Eve Jones for piloting this vehicle.

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,800
 It's March 12th, 2021.

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,320
 Incredibly recent story.

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,640
 And in Casawa, it's pronounced differently every time you say it.

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,760
 It's a weird city.

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,600
 Every time you say it, it has to be pronounced differently.

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
 It's the law.

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,760
 In Casawa, in Ghana, there is a place called Casawa Iron City.

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
 It's not a school.

44
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,840
 But if you're going to have a school name, might as well have it named like it's a Transformers

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
 headquarters.

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,680
 In Casawa, Iron City, there's a young man named Emmanuel O'Tibble.

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
 He's 17 years old.

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,720
 He's playing video games with his friend.

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,880
 And his friend for whatever reason has taken off his ring and set it on the table.

50
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
 Now that's not unusual.

51
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,160
 Maybe they're playing like some Super Smash Bros. thing and you need to get like extra

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,600
 button presses before Star Fox goes to the box level or whatever it is.

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,680
 For whatever reason he took the ring off.

54
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
 That's not important.

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,600
 I can't get lost in the details.

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,720
 Emmanuel is looking at this ring on the table and he's obsessed with it.

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,560
 He's just staring at it.

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,240
 His guy's got kicked off the ledge 100 times.

59
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,200
 He can't beat his buddy because he's staring at this ring.

60
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
 He takes the ring and he puts it on.

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,120
 And his buddy goes, "Bro, that's my ring.

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,000
 Why are you wearing that ring?"

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,320
 And Emmanuel actually has a really interesting point of view, really interesting way of looking

64
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,320
 at life.

65
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,720
 He says, "If you own something and you're my friend, then I can use it too."

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,760
 Which is a super bizarre way of looking at the world.

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,440
 But if you agree with me, if you agree with me and you don't want a friend like that,

68
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,920
 he's walking around in your clothes all the time, driving your car at best.

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,480
 He could also be sleeping with your significant other and doing a bunch of other stuff.

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,920
 He's wearing your skin.

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,160
 If you guys think that's a terrible mindset, don't worry.

72
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,800
 He gets his just desserts.

73
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,400
 But maybe a little too much for this sin.

74
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,200
 He takes the guy's ring and he actually means to give it back, but he kind of forgets.

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,280
 You put a ring on, you go, "Ooh, this is cool looking."

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,520
 And then you completely forget it exists until you either have to wash your hands or someone

77
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,640
 goes, "Hey, nice ring."

78
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,240
 A ring, I'm sure it's the same thing with earrings.

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,760
 I used to have pierced ears in college, but I don't remember them.

80
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,400
 I don't remember waking up and being like, "Oh, dude, I remember that Tuesday back in

81
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,600
 July 1994 when I had my earrings and my ears."

82
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 You don't remember jewelry.

83
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,680
 But anyways, so he takes it home, he goes to sleep.

84
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,800
 When he wakes up the next morning, birds, "Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo."

85
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,080
 You know, like the little music, there's sun coming in.

86
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,280
 If Jones is risen for the day, little bluebirds floating around, Emmanuel is waking up.

87
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,440
 But before he can get through his first yawn, he realizes searing pain, horrible, horrible

88
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,720
 pain is shooting through his hands, specifically his ring finger.

89
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,160
 And he looks down and his finger is starting to swell up.

90
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,440
 He tries to take the ring off.

91
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,200
 Kind of hard when your finger's swelling up.

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,560
 He tries to wash it off with soap.

93
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,400
 He's trying to do all this stuff to get it off.

94
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,520
 His mom is trying to figure out, "Hey, Emmanuel, why are you screaming in pain in the bathroom

95
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
 and where did all of my soap go?"

96
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,880
 And he finally admits to his mom, "Mom, okay, so you know my friend Jeremy, the friend's

97
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,720
 name isn't in the article, but you know my friend Jeremy, I stole, I mean, I borrowed

98
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,720
 his ring because he's my buddy."

99
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,200
 And the mom's like, "Of course, you can have all your friends stuff."

100
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
 He's like, "Yeah, I know.

101
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,080
 I put this ring on and now I can't get it off and my fingers swole."

102
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,960
 The mom's like, "Hmm, okay, well, it's one of two things.

103
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,640
 Either the ring was too small for you and it's cutting off circulation in your finger.

104
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,320
 Oh, you have fallen victim to black magic."

105
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,080
 Now, Emmanuel doesn't want to think of the idea of why no one wants that as an alternative

106
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,680
 while you either have arthritis or witches cursed you.

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,360
 So he goes and he calls up his buddy.

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,000
 His buddy comes over with a hacksaw and a pair of pliers.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,640
 And I'm sure the buddy's laughing about this whole thing.

110
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,200
 Actually, to be, I'm sure the buddy's laughing about the whole thing as he's driving over

111
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,600
 there, but once he gets there, because there's photographs of this kid's finger.

112
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,680
 It's huge.

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,280
 It's so gross and bloated.

114
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,360
 Several photographs of this.

115
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,080
 Once he came over, he probably stopped laughing when he saw his friend's finger is about to

116
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,240
 fall off.

117
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,320
 He hacksaws it.

118
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,040
 He's pulling with the pliers.

119
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,720
 It's already tight on the finger.

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,480
 It's already so swollen.

121
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,200
 He is able to break the ring and they still can't get it off.

122
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,360
 It's actually worse now because now there's two jagged pieces of metal digging into his

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,920
 flesh.

124
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,200
 So most of these photos you'll see online is of the ring already cut and it's bleeding.

125
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,760
 His finger's bleeding.

126
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,880
 The next step, so here now you have a half a ring on your finger, possibly a cursed.

127
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,440
 You've already tried the hacksaw.

128
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,600
 You've already tried the pliers.

129
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,460
 You've tried soap.

130
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,460
 What ever.

131
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,040
 They bring in a welder.

132
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,360
 I don't know what they expected this kind of to, right?

133
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,360
 He's usually putting steel together or cutting steel in half.

134
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,760
 I don't know what they expected him to do with this piece of jewelry wrapped around his kid's

135
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,840
 finger.

136
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,040
 But at this point in the thing, we might have to eventually chop the kid's finger off.

137
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,680
 It's definitely like losing circulation.

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,280
 It's swelling up.

139
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,000
 But eventually the mom says, "Okay, before we let the welder, as he's getting his blow

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,980
 torch ready, okay, okay, okay.

141
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
 Hold on.

142
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,260
 Let's try the whole black magic thing.

143
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,700
 Maybe you just have some sort of ghost on you."

144
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,260
 So they called up a spiritualist.

145
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
 She came over.

146
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,980
 She performed a ritual and the ring came off.

147
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
 Happy ending, right?

148
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,580
 Well, kind of.

149
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,060
 Because while the news articles state that the boy is no longer in danger of losing his

150
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,500
 finger, one news article said, "The boy wanted his friend."

151
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,220
 This whole thing.

152
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,840
 So basically, let's recap this.

153
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,080
 Emmanuel finds a ring, puts it on.

154
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,360
 Magic curse happens.

155
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
 Can't take it off.

156
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,680
 They have to chop it up.

157
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,400
 They have to destroy it.

158
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,680
 The best friend, or maybe just friend, maybe just acquaintance at this point.

159
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
 He wants a new ring.

160
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,440
 That's all he can think about after knowing that in this world, in this real world, this

161
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
 is not fiction.

162
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,400
 This was reported in several newspapers.

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,780
 In this reality, magical rings exist and you just watched your friend almost get his-

164
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,220
 You just watched a welder show up to your friend's house with a blowtorch.

165
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,720
 You want a new ring.

166
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,580
 I would never wear a ring ever again if I knew that was a reality.

167
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
 Apparently it is.

168
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,300
 This was in several newspapers.

169
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,700
 And not only that, not only does he want a ring, he wants his friend.

170
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,000
 He wants his friend, who he magically cursed, to give him a ring.

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,480
 How do you know your friend's not gonna curse you?

172
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,200
 And make your finger almost fall off.

173
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,720
 Anyways, one of the articles said the friend wanted a new ring and I had a good chuckle

174
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
 at that.

175
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,200
 But that gets an idiot.

176
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
 Right?

177
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,920
 I never wear jewelry again.

178
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,400
 Another article, and these aren't- these are like from- let me- these aren't fringe

179
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
 news sites.

180
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,120
 These are from- well, Coast to Coast AM is where I first saw the article.

181
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,100
 And then I went into moderngonna.com, which is a mainstream news site in the country,

182
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,260
 and then announcernewsonline.com, which is a mainstream African newspaper.

183
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,860
 These aren't the Daily Mail or Daily Star.

184
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,500
 Another article said the friend not only wanted a new ring, he wa- I was like, "What is going

185
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 on?

186
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,260
 What is going on with these friends?

187
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,420
 These guys are nuts."

188
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:20,840
 The other friend of the other article- I was- I can't believe this.

189
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,640
 The other friend- I can't believe the journalist wrote it down and was just like, "Mhm, yep.

190
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,600
 I'm gonna go cover a city council meeting after this.

191
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,480
 This is totally normal."

192
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,160
 The friend, in the according to this other article, wanted not only a new ring, but also

193
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,600
 wanted- how would you even get this?

194
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,680
 How would you even get this?

195
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,060
 The other article, just Plain of Day, states that the friend wanted newborn baby blood.

196
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:55,020
 "Hey man, you borrowed my ring and that wasn't cool and I had to break it.

197
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,180
 You have to buy me a new ring and you have to give me a vial of baby blood."

198
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,460
 And the guy goes to turn and he goes, "No, no, no, no, no.

199
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,460
 Newborn baby blood."

200
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,180
 He's like, "Aw man, that's the hardest to get.

201
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,100
 What is he going to do with it?

202
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:15,540
 Why are you gonna be friends with a guy who that's a demand at all in any situation?"

203
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,280
 So that you might think is a one-off story, right?

204
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,560
 You would hope it was a one-off story, someone demanding newborn baby blood.

205
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,840
 And again, the article doesn't say to bless the ring, it just states it.

206
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,640
 That's what he wants.

207
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,720
 No questions, no questions at all.

208
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,520
 But you go, "Jason, maybe it's just a guy with like a swollen finger and they like photoshopped

209
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,240
 his bloody ring on it.

210
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,420
 This isn't the first time this has happened in Ghana.

211
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,980
 In November 2014, Eric Bu-Bang in Ghana was walking home from church, sees a shining gold

212
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,260
 ring in the dirt, compelled to pick it up.

213
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,580
 I pick up stuff all the time.

214
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,940
 I'll pick up little rocks, I'll pick up sticks if I find like little stuffed animals or little

215
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,940
 creepy toys.

216
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,300
 Take them home."

217
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,300
 So I would do this.

218
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,300
 He picks up the ring.

219
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,380
 He's compelled to pick up this ring.

220
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,240
 And once it's in his hand, his hand, you can't hear that.

221
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,200
 You can't hear that sound effect when my hand is shaking next to the mic.

222
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,760
 And he wants to throw it away immediately, but he can't.

223
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,920
 His hand's shaking so much.

224
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
 He actually thinks it'd make it easier to throw.

225
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,560
 It's like you're throwing dice.

226
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
 But he can't.

227
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,680
 He's compelled, he puts it on.

228
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,720
 The next morning he wakes up, his finger's swelling up.

229
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,960
 There's photos of all of that as well.

230
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,320
 They're all being in the show notes.

231
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,140
 There are pictures of people with really, really swollen fingers and rings wrapped around

232
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,860
 them.

233
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,820
 And he has the added thing.

234
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,020
 He says at night he can't sleep because once the sun goes down, he hears voices in his

235
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
 head.

236
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,220
 "Ugh, you shouldn't have put that ring on!

237
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,620
 You should have thrown it away when you had the chance!"

238
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
 All of that stuff.

239
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,860
 They might just also be telling him about events of the world.

240
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,420
 He's like, "The City Council meeting was held today in Ghana.

241
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,500
 They demanded 10 bites of baby blood before they fixed all those potholes."

242
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,320
 Who knows?

243
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,540
 But his article, it doesn't have an ending.

244
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,200
 His article says they couldn't figure out a way to get the ring off and they're hoping

245
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,000
 to get it off soon before his finger comes off.

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 That happened in 2014.

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,400
 I could find no follow-up.

248
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,840
 So there may be a dude named Eric walking around Ghana right now with nine fingers.

249
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:27,600
 To be specific, to be fair, I'm sure there is at least one person named Eric in the entire

250
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,280
 country of Ghana who doesn't have all their fingers.

251
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,700
 But if it's their ring finger, you might want to ask Ashley, "Don't walk up to someone

252
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,780
 who's missing a ring finger and say, 'You didn't have to put on a cursed ring, did you?'

253
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,140
 The reason why I wanted to highlight this is because once we covered this before about

254
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,180
 the guy who picked up the pile of corn and got stuck to his back and they had to bring

255
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,060
 wizards out to help him, magic must exist."

256
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,140
 I'm totally perplexed by these stories that are coming out of Africa.

257
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,380
 Because you could say the corn one, people are like, "Maybe he faked it.

258
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,400
 Maybe it was a public service announcement."

259
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
 Who?

260
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,720
 You know, a public service announcement like the cops are trying to say, "Don't steal.

261
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,880
 You might get cursed."

262
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,840
 What is the public service announcement here?

263
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,720
 Who do they talk to to say, "Hey, man, we got a deal.

264
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,160
 How about we let your finger swell up?

265
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
 Super disgusting and super painful.

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,040
 Take photos of it, send them out online, and then in return, you can all the baby blood

267
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
 you can drink."

268
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,860
 Like what is, what would be the point of having this hoax?

269
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,160
 Does magic exist?

270
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,100
 Have all of the naysayers, myself included?

271
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,460
 I have a limited belief in magic.

272
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,620
 I believe magic exists in a certain point.

273
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,940
 I don't think we've ever really talked about my beliefs on magic on this show.

274
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,340
 I don't think we've ever gone in depth.

275
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,980
 I don't have time to do it now.

276
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,740
 I've got a whole other segment to do.

277
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,880
 But I think at a limited scope, what I call scientific magic, or I think the technical

278
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,520
 term for it is high magic, works where it's very ritualistic, I think can work to a limited

279
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,080
 degree, to a very, very limited degree, and everything needs to be in place.

280
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,980
 You just can't pick up a couple books and learn it.

281
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,280
 It's a whole thing, and I could honestly do an entire segment on it.

282
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,840
 I probably will at some point, but that's always been my thing.

283
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,480
 I didn't think you could just throw cursed rings.

284
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,180
 I didn't think you could just curse a bag of rings and just drive through town, throwing

285
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,540
 them on the ground.

286
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,340
 Magic might exist, and it would be so...

287
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,340
 What if we...

288
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,420
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second.

289
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:35,340
 What if it turns out that magic exists, these type of things exist in Africa?

290
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,940
 Like the continent itself.

291
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,140
 The continent itself is magically charged.

292
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
 What would that...

293
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,380
 A conspiracy cap falling on, what would that do to the world's economy?

294
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,860
 It would basically be like Wakanda, but with magic.

295
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,720
 Like if people are like, "Yeah, we don't know what it is.

296
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,640
 We don't know what it is," but in Ghana, magical curse rings exist.

297
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,840
 They're a real thing.

298
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,880
 And scientists would go out there and they're like, "No, it's not here.

299
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
 Give me your ring."

300
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
 And they put it on.

301
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
 They're like, "Ahh!"

302
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
 They're screaming.

303
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
 Bill Gates has no fingers.

304
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,520
 I was like, "Oh, I kept trying to prove them wrong, but I was the one who was wrong."

305
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,720
 What if it turns out that for some reason, like all the lay lines intersect underneath

306
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,940
 the continent of Africa, and it's magically charged?

307
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,320
 Would that change society?

308
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,040
 Would people just want to move there?

309
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,500
 Or would you be like, "No, I don't want to go there."

310
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,180
 There's a bunch of cursed dolls and there's a bunch of cursed rings and I can't steal

311
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,940
 corn anymore.

312
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,900
 Either all of this stuff is fake, which is very, very in the realm of possibility.

313
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,540
 Or some of it's fake and some of it's misconstrued events.

314
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,580
 Like the same time they put on the ring, a bumblebee landed on their finger and they're

315
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,380
 allergic to bumblebees, but they're only allergic on their fingers.

316
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:48,640
 Or that magic exists worldwide, but for some reason we don't see stories about people putting

317
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,360
 on cursed rings in the Balkans.

318
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,240
 We don't see it in Arizona.

319
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,140
 We don't see it in Paraguay.

320
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,520
 But we just run into these weird stories that come out of Africa and you look at them and

321
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:08,040
 you go, "Magic, if this story is true, then witches and magic and spells and curses 100%

322
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
 exist."

323
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,880
 Witches do exist all over the world and magic is just like a volcano just kind of got sucked

324
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,200
 up under Africa or I don't know, I don't know.

325
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,000
 Now even more hypothesizing that there's a magical volcano ready to erupt.

326
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,100
 But I just think on a conspiracy level, what would that do to society if you could, even

327
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,180
 if it wasn't Africa, you could say it was Australia, you could say it was the middle

328
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,680
 of Peru, what if you found out that one country or one continent magic actually existed?

329
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,240
 What would that do to world society?

330
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
 There you go.

331
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,160
 That's your writing prompt for you guys, for you guys, for you writers out there, for

332
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,480
 your 90 day challenge.

333
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 There's your writing prompt.

334
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,480
 What if one country, only one country, became magical?

335
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,440
 But we won't be able to explore that right now.

336
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,520
 I think I already explored it much longer than I thought it was going to.

337
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,280
 Eve Jones.

338
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,040
 Let's call in that carbonar copter.

339
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,720
 We're waving goodbye to a man who won Eric.

340
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,880
 Hopefully they have all their fingers for the rest of their lives.

341
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,440
 Let's leave behind Ghana.

342
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,080
 We are headed out to Russia.

343
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:16,600
 Eve, I want you to go ahead and land us at Kalinovy.

344
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,600
 Kalinovy, you all know this, you guys are all well up on your Russian geography.

345
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,280
 It's a little village near Kaisnam.

346
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,160
 That's in the Chelyabinsk Oblast region in Russia.

347
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,160
 The story was actually recommended to me by Yuri.

348
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,680
 Yuri, thanks for sending this one over.

349
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,480
 It's May 1996.

350
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,120
 And there's an old woman named Tamara Vasylina of Prosferina.

351
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,440
 I can pronounce that last word.

352
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
 Walking down the street.

353
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,000
 Now it doesn't say how old she is.

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,760
 She does appear to have an adult son who's in prison.

355
00:17:52,760 --> 00:18:01,680
 So 50, 60 years old, but she's definitely considered an odd duck in the village of Kaloinynov.

356
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,680
 Tamara is out for her walk and everyone's down the windows.

357
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,400
 They're like, oh no, here comes that crazy lady.

358
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,520
 She's not necessarily known as a crazy lady.

359
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,720
 She's just known as a little bit odd.

360
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,280
 But that's going to change very quickly.

361
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:22,600
 She's walking down the road and she sees something laying off to the side.

362
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,320
 She looks down.

363
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:34,040
 She sees a tiny little body moving in the grass.

364
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,840
 It's around 10 inches long.

365
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,040
 It's a super tiny guy, right?

366
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,560
 She's laying there.

367
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,320
 No hair on its head, which I mean it's to be expected, right?

368
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
 Really 10 inches tall.

369
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,280
 I don't think you're going to have Samson locks.

370
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
 Totally bald.

371
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,040
 Totally bald little baby.

372
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,720
 He has a big eye.

373
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,880
 But all of that stuff, I mean, coming across the tenet humanoid in the woods is bizarre.

374
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,640
 Coming across the tenet humanoid in an office building is weird.

375
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,160
 Doesn't matter where it's at.

376
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:14,480
 But the most notable feature about this thing is it had ridges along its head.

377
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,960
 It was described and there's lots of quote unquote photographs of this thing.

378
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
 We're going to get into some weird stuff with this story.

379
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,520
 It had ridges on its head that seem to form a central, like all lead to a central ridge.

380
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,120
 It's described as being like a leaf where you have like the main vein and all the little

381
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,600
 offshoots of them.

382
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,680
 And Tamara picks it up.

383
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,200
 She's like, wow, my name's pronounced differently all of a sudden.

384
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,520
 Now that I found this creature, Tamara picks up this little dude and she goes, I will name

385
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,520
 you Alishiozenka, which means tiny Alex.

386
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,920
 I will call you Alexiokshnia.

387
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,120
 And the rest of the story, she just calls him Alex.

388
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:04,400
 That bit of information is all that we know for sure.

389
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,120
 Now you may go, Jason, I know about this story.

390
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,960
 No, no, no, we know all this other stuff.

391
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,760
 I've done a bunch of research on this.

392
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,360
 I'm not saying that you haven't, but every article I've read about it has added and subtracted

393
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,760
 certain details.

394
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:26,040
 The only thing every narrative had in common, Tamara, she's at the village of Kalowniav.

395
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,400
 She finds something, it's this tall, it looks like this, that's what she names it.

396
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,680
 Those are the only details that are all the same.

397
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,720
 Literally, every detail changes from story to story.

398
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,520
 So I had to create this narrative out of different versions of this.

399
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,080
 She takes the creature home and she begins to take care of it.

400
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,120
 Now she would feed it a diet of cottage cheese, which is gross anyways.

401
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,680
 That's the gross of all cheeses.

402
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,120
 The cheese I covered with the maggots on it, I'd rather eat that.

403
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,840
 She gives him cottage cheese, he's forced it, he's like, "Oh, I wish I was dead.

404
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,120
 I wish you'd left me in the wilderness."

405
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,000
 She's feeding him cottage cheese and condensed milk.

406
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,880
 And she's like, "Isn't this the best little baby man?

407
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,080
 This is where it'll help you grow to be 11 inches."

408
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,640
 He's like, "Ah, kill me."

409
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,680
 Her daughter-in-law came over once and tomorrow was like, "Hey, watch this, watch this trick.

410
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,080
 I'm going to shove this cream down this little creature's mouth.

411
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
 Eat it."

412
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,120
 She's watching her feed this creature and the daughter-in-law said, "He looked sad.

413
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,320
 I felt pain while looking at him."

414
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,720
 Couple people in town did stop by to see this take place.

415
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,960
 Did stop by to see her feed this little dude.

416
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,120
 And probably do have a shove.

417
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,360
 She has strings tied to him.

418
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,080
 She's like, "Hey, look at my marionette show."

419
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,960
 He's like, "Kill me, please, kill me."

420
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,880
 It's like that dude and Johnny got his gun.

421
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,600
 He can't communicate, but he really wants to die.

422
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,640
 She's doing, I don't know, she's doing tricks.

423
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,080
 I don't know, she's putting him on a little bicycle and making him run right little daredevil

424
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,400
 loops or something like that.

425
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,320
 She's probably caring for it as if it was a baby.

426
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,920
 To be fair, to be fair, I don't want to turn her into some sort of circus ringmaster.

427
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,600
 That's what I would have done.

428
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,440
 So a couple of people had seen this thing move around.

429
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,560
 They said it made a squeaky noise.

430
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:22,360
 But other people in town just saw old nutbag Tamara walking through the streets with a blanket

431
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
 going, "You want to see my baby?

432
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,160
 You want to see my mutant baby?"

433
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,920
 I found in the bushes.

434
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,200
 She would unwrap the blanket and it would just be like a doll.

435
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,400
 They said it didn't look alive.

436
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
 It looked fake.

437
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,720
 It looked like if it wasn't alive at some point, it wasn't alive now and it probably

438
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,360
 wasn't alive, it's probably a doll.

439
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,480
 So you had different, again, this is what we're talking about.

440
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,520
 There's tons of evidence of this story.

441
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,680
 Air quotes around that.

442
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,800
 It's really fascinating to look at because you'll see a ton of photos of this online

443
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,160
 and video, but nobody can really pin down who took the photos.

444
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,000
 Japan went crazy over this story.

445
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,320
 It's a shocker, right?

446
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,760
 They made a replica of it.

447
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,560
 There was a news station that made a replica of it.

448
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,360
 So a lot of photographs you see are of the replica.

449
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,480
 But how do they get a replica if they haven't seen the original?

450
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,520
 So there must have been some photos going around.

451
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,920
 There is video footage from 1996, which could be faked.

452
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,280
 There is video footage that has the date on it, 1996, and it is a couple months after

453
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,480
 May, which is when the story takes place, of supposedly Russian scientists messing around

454
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
 with it.

455
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,840
 But they put it on Marynep of it.

456
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,720
 At that point, it is clearly dead.

457
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,560
 Whatever it is, it's not alive.

458
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,840
 So first off, we have a question of, what is it?

459
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,800
 Was it ever alive?

460
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,400
 If it was alive, how long was it alive?

461
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,920
 And what happened to it?

462
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,120
 We can answer some of those questions, but you're not going to like the answers.

463
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,760
 She already had an oddball personality.

464
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,840
 She's walking around with this thing.

465
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
 She's saying it's her baby.

466
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,040
 She's showing it to people.

467
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,200
 Eventually, the authorities get involved.

468
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,880
 Tamara is arrested.

469
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 What's the crime, right?

470
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
 What's the crime?

471
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
 Picking up litter.

472
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,760
 She's arrested and she's put in a psychiatric hospital.

473
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,560
 And then the neighbor supposedly goes over to take care of Alex.

474
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,960
 And then after a couple hours, he'll be like, "Oh, this is boring.

475
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
 That's going to be way more funny."

476
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,280
 He had a little evil, conneval outfit built for him.

477
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,800
 He's like, "Oh, it doesn't do any tricks.

478
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,040
 This is lame."

479
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,960
 He then gives Alex to the authorities, where supposedly that's where the video comes from,

480
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,000
 was when the government got hold of Alex, who at that time had passed away.

481
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,520
 But again, was he ever alive?

482
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,520
 Was he alive for a couple weeks, for a couple days, when she first found him?

483
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,560
 These are all interesting questions.

484
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:44,240
 But Tamara is actually locked up in the insane asylum and they don't let her out.

485
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,400
 She wants Alex back.

486
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,880
 It's her baby.

487
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,080
 She saved this guy.

488
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:59,280
 So one night, she breaks out of the insane asylum and while she's escaping, a ambulance

489
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,840
 runs her over.

490
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:07,760
 In the dead of night as she's running down the street to find her child, she's killed.

491
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,600
 Even that's an interesting detail because apparently she was sent to a hospital.

492
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,520
 Whether or not it was psychiatric or regular hospital, we don't know.

493
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
 But she did die in 1999.

494
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,280
 She died in a car accident, was one version.

495
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,760
 Another version was she died in a car accident escaping.

496
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,160
 Because she might have just been like, "You're free, Tamara.

497
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
 You're no longer crazy."

498
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
 She's like, "I have the keys in my car."

499
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,640
 And they're like, "Sure, you haven't driven in three years.

500
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
 Here you go."

501
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,920
 And she just got in a car accident.

502
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,520
 Some people say she got in a car accident escaping.

503
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,440
 And the third one was she ran over by an ambulance while she was escaping.

504
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,040
 Which in that way, you could add malice to the fact.

505
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,080
 If you're escaping from a hospital, you get ran over by an ambulance.

506
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,920
 You can kind of build a conspiracy that they didn't want her to get out.

507
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,040
 So what was this thing?

508
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:00,600
 Like again, we can talk all day long about the details of what happened after the fact.

509
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,040
 But everyone can agree that this woman found something in the woods.

510
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,560
 That's something that all the stories agree on.

511
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,720
 Some people believe it was a hoax.

512
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,120
 So even they believe that the story happened, but they believe that the doll was handmade.

513
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,400
 It was made to be a hoax.

514
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,360
 Which would be totally unfortunate if you come up, if you craft a hoax and you're like,

515
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,240
 "Oh man, everyone in the village is going to love this hoax."

516
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,200
 And it ends with you being arrested and thrown in a psychiatric hospital.

517
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,560
 You're like, "It's just a prank, bro.

518
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,560
 It's just a prank."

519
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,480
 As the ambulance is running you over.

520
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
 That would be the most tragic.

521
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,600
 Well, that would be one of the most tragic because it gets pretty dark.

522
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,040
 Some believe it was an alien.

523
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,000
 It was a little alien ship.

524
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
 Nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem, nyeeem,
