1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
 Two topics from the conspiracy iceberg

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,960
 one the height of

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,240
 human ingenuity

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,120
 The other one the lowest point in human depression today on Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:26,520
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,520
 I hope you're having a great day too

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,120
 I'm having a great day now man after I recorded the ghost of the haunted apartment episode

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,480
 I ended up getting I don't know if I got food poisoning

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,320
 I don't know if I got a touch of the flu, but man

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,760
 I was out of commission for about two or three days. I record most of my episodes on the weekend now

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,760
 So I have more time to research

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,880
 but from Sunday evening to

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,120
 Today's Wednesday from Sunday evening to Tuesday night man

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,920
 I was I was done and it's so funny because

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,200
 Well, it's enough I was super sick

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,760
 But I was just like I had recorded that ghost episode and I had all those creepy experiences and I was like well

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,280
 I need to sleep in my bedroom. I can't really sleep with the light on in my bedroom

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,040
 Because there's only one light bulb and it's right above the bed

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,200
 But I'm sick and I have to like lay down and I ended up grabbing my tablet that I got for Christmas from my mom

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,240
 Watched a couple episodes of Star Trek and then I thought you know what I need something comfy to watch

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,960
 And it's so weird. I've talked to other people about this

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,920
 It's almost like the show the office is

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,280
 Like probably one of the most comfortable shows ever created and never gets super loud

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,680
 Well, Michael yells a lot, but it's just one of those I watched all of season 5 and about two days

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,120
 And it's so funny because I'm watching I've seen it multiple times before

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,520
 But I'm watching it and I'm sick and I'm hearing these familiar voices from you know

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,280
 10 years ago when I was watching the show when it was brand new on NBC and it would help me sleep

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,000
 It's so funny and what's funny is I knew I was starting to get better

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,920
 The office was on and I wasn't watching it like I just had it on and I was on my phone doing research

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,840
 I was like, oh, I must be feeling better. I don't have to be staring at this television screen for hours on end

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,760
 Oh, it was so terrible. Not the show my sickness

32
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,680
 Yeah, I think the office might actually be the most comfy show

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,080
 I've met people who absolutely hate that show though because they hate seeing people being embarrassed

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,040
 Like they can't watch comedy where people are embarrassed. I've met a lot of people like that

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,440
 I think it's hilarious watching other people be embarrassed, but other people are like I can't watch it

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,120
 I can't watch people in awkward situations, but anyway, so yeah, if you're ever sick and you have Netflix

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,480
 Well, I actually tried looking for X files first, but that's not on Netflix anymore, man

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,520
 Whatever man pretty soon everyone's gonna have to have 10 streaming options

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,480
 It'll be just as much as cable in the end. So let's go ahead and get started with the episode here

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,920
 I am feeling better. So I'm happy about that

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,160
 So I have two topics from the conspiracy iceberg today and like I said in the intro one is

42
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,480
 wonderful

43
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,200
 One is a wonderful conspiracy theory

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,680
 It's one of the ones that I like because it's very happy and enlightening to who we are as a species

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,940
 Now on the conspiracy iceberg there is the phrase

46
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,760
 Amazon forest is man-made and I was like, oh, it's just gonna be like

47
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,680
 Mountains are trees like are they gonna say that the trees are holograms or they're all metal and whatever

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,000
 But I was like, you know, it's it's an evocative phrase. So I typed it in a Google and

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,320
 page after page after page pulled up

50
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,440
 showing

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
 from scientists

52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,920
 That the Amazon rainforest is indeed

53
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
 Man-made

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,760
 Let's travel back in time

55
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,120
 Let's go. We're not gonna get in the carbon decopter because I'm still a little nauseous

56
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,940
 I don't think I can take the flight. You know what we're going to the Amazon rainforest

57
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:01,280
 So it's been gone through some rough stuff. Let's go carbon. Let's go. I can't even say that word with a straight face

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,400
 Let's go carbon neutral

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,120
 with

60
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
 the hoppy hang

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,360
 The hoppy hang glider is we each have our own so it's not we're all not hugging on each other was flying over

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,160
 It's basically a hang glider in the shape of a rabbit and somehow it still stays afloat

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,960
 Doesn't just have a picture of a rabbit on it. It's actually the shape of a rabbit. Oh, oh, I wanted to say this too

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,400
 I got some fan art from gray of PTA from on YouTube

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,880
 He sent me a picture. I'll put it in the show notes. He sent me a drawing of Pinko

66
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,640
 The the tolpa slash communist infiltrator. It's amazing. Thank you

67
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,040
 Thank you. Thank you. I'll put that in the show notes, but anyways, so we're in the hoppy hang gliders. We each got our own I

68
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,120
 Played a lot of pilot wings back in the day. So I know how to use these things

69
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,080
 But we're gonna fly not only to the Amazon rainforest, which is in South America. He didn't know

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,400
 But we're also the gentle breeze is going to take us back in time

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,720
 We're going back hundreds of years

72
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
 We're going back to basically

73
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:24,520
 Prehistory well, I guess not prehistory because they're they were right and stuff down, but we don't know the history is modern day doesn't know the history

74
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,160
 We're in South America. We're flying over the rainforest and what's interesting is we look down

75
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,480
 First we think there's some sort of Mandela effect going on. There's there's not a rainforest here

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,980
 It's it's just it's just a bunch of bamboo. This isn't what we expected

77
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,980
 We expected lush green jungles and

78
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,300
 Jaguars and

79
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,540
 Anaconda and anaconda to search for the blood orchid, but none of that stuff is down here

80
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:57,300
 We just see bamboo and this is what so this is what's interesting. This is 100% it's a theory

81
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,320
 It's a theory, but scientists believe that this is true the Amazon rainforest that

82
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,620
 Landscape used to have a ton of bamboo which does grow naturally in South America

83
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,320
 and at some point

84
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,200
 a

85
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:19,680
 Leader or a group of leaders in that area. They had their tribes said, you know what let's build a supermarket here

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,800
 Let's cut down all this bamboo

87
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,640
 Let's burn it

88
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,000
 Let's burn it all and we are going to reshape the landscape and plant trees

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,160
 That we use we don't use all this bamboo

90
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,400
 So they burned it all down

91
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,400
 And the smoke saw coughing us as we're flying in a hang glider. I lose a couple of you. Sorry. No

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,680
 And you don't listeners I can get as you disappear into the dark smoke below

93
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,600
 But anyways, we eventually do catching up drafting get back up to us

94
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,200
 so they burned down the bamboo and they begin planting trees like palm trees and

95
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,760
 trees that provided nuts trees that

96
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,480
 they could use for food and

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,080
 A shelter like they would have the right bark for them

98
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,480
 trees that were actually useful to the indigenous people and because now they no longer had to travel out to find these

99
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,520
 supplies

100
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,480
 The population in and around the Amazon rainforest boomed

101
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,960
 Was massive and I'll get to the proof behind this real quick

102
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,440
 But because you're like chasing just making this stuff up

103
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,960
 But no so the populate now they had all their resources in one single area

104
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,000
 So people started coming to the area. They had tons of food. They had tons of material. They could start trading at other groups

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,560
 What's interesting is that when?

106
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,840
 The conquistadors came to South America and the early reports of the conquistadors

107
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,240
 They said to there's like these massive amounts of people here in the Amazon area

108
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,120
 huge cities full of people and

109
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,560
 As more and more conquistadors showed up. They're like, uh, there's not that many people here anymore

110
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
 And so when modern

111
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,680
 Researchers were looking back when they were looking at the first

112
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,320
 Instances of people like of conquistadors of the West coming to South America. They're like, we think they exaggerated

113
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,120
 We really don't think they came across the a tribe of ten thousand people

114
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,880
 We think there was probably thousand people historical records are usually exaggerated, right?

115
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,320
 but now what they think happened was

116
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,640
 They basically when the conquistadors came the natives left that area

117
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,760
 Either they were killed off the disease got them or they just left because they knew bad stuff was coming down the pipe

118
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,300
 And once they stopped cultivating that land stopped working in that supermarket

119
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,280
 nature took back over and

120
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:53,480
 The rainforest exploded with all sorts of trees all sorts of plants and vegetables and

121
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,800
 Fruits did have fruits down there. Is it a mango fruit or mangoes from South America? Anyways, so

122
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,440
 The and that created the Amazon rainforest we see today where it's just a bunch of foliage and it's not necessarily completely useful

123
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,080
 So this is the proof behind that

124
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,440
 tons of resources on this one when they started burning down the

125
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,760
 Forest recently the Amazon rainforest recently to make room for cattle grazing

126
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,600
 They started to notice these huge geoglyphs in the ground which are basically giant shapes

127
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,540
 Either mounds or trenches and they're absolutely massive

128
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,480
 It's not like just someone drew it, you know, like made a trench in the ground and like rolled around in the dirt

129
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,040
 Like these are geometric designs and stuff like that and they go oh there must have been like a city center here

130
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,400
 Or this was a religious site that got swallowed up by the jungle

131
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,200
 researchers started to notice there was a lot of

132
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,760
 charcoal in

133
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,960
 the soil and they go

134
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,040
 It looks like there were a lot of burns in this area in the past

135
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,240
 Like not just like lightning strike burns. It looks like somebody was burning the forest to make room for something else

136
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:13,800
 But the kicker is this when they look at the Amazon rainforest, which now is completely wild and untamed and it

137
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,200
 I'm gonna do a follow-up episode on this

138
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,360
 But there's a ton of cryptid sightings there and like lost cities and things like that

139
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,640
 but

140
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,880
 When they look at the Amazon rainforest now, it's just just jungle

141
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,560
 But along the Amazon River basin

142
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,080
 There are

143
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,400
 85 different tree species that

144
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,760
 The natives absolutely used and needed to prosper

145
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,640
 And they're like this isn't by chance

146
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:52,240
 If we look along the basin here and the Amazon rainforest, we will see stretches basically a supermarket aisle of

147
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,080
 Trees that would be useful to the indigenous people

148
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,360
 So the theory is this that yes, there were massive populations in the Amazon up to 8 million people

149
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,320
 Who live they basically clear cut all the bamboo

150
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,160
 planted the trees that they needed and

151
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,320
 Basically would say you know what I really need I need a couple papayas and people are like

152
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,800
 I don't think those grown South America

153
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,600
 Well, I'm gonna go down to the old Amazon and check it out you go down there to pick them

154
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,480
 Strip off some bark and grab some coffee beans

155
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,600
 Whatever and then you go to your tribe

156
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,640
 They basically they did to the Amazon rainforest what we're trying to do now

157
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,480
 When they're doing the clear cutting and using it to produce food for other people they did that already

158
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,160
 It's a man and I'm not saying that yeah

159
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,520
 We should clear cut the Amazon so McDonald's can sell cheap beef

160
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,440
 But I'm saying like it's the same idea and I always think it's fascinating when we can look back in history and

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 See people come up with these plans and it makes you think what other natural

162
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,080
 Phenomenon do we see and we thought always thought that the Amazon was this pristine virgin jungle when in fact

163
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,200
 It was basically railies or Bel Air or Safeway or any other grocery store to them

164
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,880
 But once they stopped cultivating it it overgrew back into the jungle and I want to end on this note too

165
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,800
 It's so funny. I heard a conspiracy theory a long time ago

166
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,920
 That in Vietnam this is well

167
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,600
 This is a good segue because we're gonna get dark with the next topic

168
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,640
 But I heard this good

169
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,520
 It's conspiracy theory that in Vietnam the Viet Cong used to grab USG eyes

170
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,560
 They would dig a hole and they would put sharpened bamboo shafts

171
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,720
 At the bottom of the hole like they could grow they're like I don't know how to bulb on the bottom of them

172
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,920
 I don't know how bamboo grows but anyway, and that's why conspiracy works on people like me because I don't have all the facts but

173
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:57,520
 They dug a hole and they put the sharpened bamboo shafts in there and they put the gi and they buried him up to his neck

174
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,200
 And then the bamboo would grow through him because bamboo grows incredibly quickly

175
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,200
 It can grow like a foot every couple hours

176
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,820
 so the idea was was that you would basically be sitting there and the bamboo would grow through you and it would be super painful and you

177
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,480
 would die and

178
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,120
 Other GIs would find a soldier buried up to his neck and a bunch of bamboo coming out of his brain

179
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,880
 Now what's funny is I it's when you get older you meet all sorts of interesting people

180
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,440
 I met a bamboo expert on my vacation

181
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,720
 I met a girl who specializes in all sorts of stuff

182
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,840
 but one of the things that she was an expert on was bamboo and I of course were at the

183
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,720
 Practice dinner for my brother's wedding and I go she tells me

184
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,920
 You know what she's talking about, you know, what are you doing? She goes?

185
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:48,400
 Oh, you know that she starts talking about ecological stuff and I don't remember all of it

186
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,500
 I just remember her saying the word bamboo and I was like, oh

187
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,560
 Have you ever heard the conspiracy theory about and I told you the story I just told you and she said you know

188
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,880
 It's funny because I never heard that before but no, that's not how it works

189
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,720
 She goes plants take the path of least resistance

190
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,440
 So even if you sharpened the bamboo once it started to hit flesh

191
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,120
 It would start to move out of the way the bamboo is actually not going to pierce through flesh

192
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,720
 It's actually if it wants to grow it will move

193
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,600
 It'll start to curve past his leg and then just go straight up

194
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,540
 So you may have found a guy surrounded in bamboo buried up to his neck

195
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,920
 But it wouldn't have killed him bamboo does go quickly

196
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,160
 But it would just touch him and then go it would grow the path of least resistance

197
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,560
 so first off I went home and freed all my prisoners and the bamboo traps I made for them and

198
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:43,280
 Secondly, that's the thing again coming back around at the Amazon rainforest. It's the path of least resistance as far as just the

199
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,720
 Digitation grows these people had totally cultivated the soil

200
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,520
 for

201
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,040
 These tropical trees used to be bamboo

202
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,480
 They totally cultivated the soil and tilled it and made it great for the trees they needed

203
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,780
 But once they left that fertile fertile soil was overtaken by any plant that came by that could survive in there

204
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,440
 So who knows what other mysteries are in there?

205
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,400
 We'll be covering the Amazon rainforest in a future episode

206
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,860
 But again, I just think it's fascinating when we can look at human ingenuity like that and go

207
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:20,560
 They were far smarter than we thought they were so let's go ahead and move on to our second story now

208
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,280
 Second story is a little more. Well, it's a lot more grim and it was a request actually

209
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,040
 It was on the conspiracy iceberg and this this was a request from Wesley on YouTube

210
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,480
 I'm gonna go ahead and read you off a couple incidents here from this chart. These have been verified incidents. They're all gonna be

211
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,620
 I'll tell you when they're separate. So I should actually make you choose a number between 1 and 26, but that's quite grim

212
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,760
 Case number one woke up boyfriend started beating him attempted suicide

213
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,480
 Well jumps case number three punch a stranger to bowling alley

214
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,680
 Case number five irrational and aggressive thoughts melt down at work

215
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,640
 Case number seven nightmares mood swings attacked fiance with knife

216
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,680
 Case number nine threatened mother with shotgun locked self in bathroom

217
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,760
 Case number 10 became aggressive and odd attempted to kill self with shotgun

218
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,480
 But survived

219
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,320
 Case number 11 nightmares anger and depression felt would kill someone

220
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,360
 Case number 12 punched policeman threatened others

221
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,400
 Case number 15 wanted to get key to gun cabinet to shoot husband

222
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,680
 Case number 18 wanted to run off porch and hit neighbors in the face and start killing them case 16 screaming and kicking and sleep

223
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,480
 Suicidal feared might attack boyfriend with axe

224
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,440
 Case number 20 uncontrollable extreme irritation felt could kill someone and have no remorse

225
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,680
 Case number 21 beat her friend broke doors in her own home beat on side of truck

226
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,760
 Case number 24 choked his wife in a fit of rage and hung himself

227
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:08,360
 Case number one woke up boyfriend started beating him attempted suicide case number two agitated angry acts that patient could not control hung

228
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,120
 self in closet

229
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,640
 Case number 13 started hitting daughters came out of room yelled at them shot herself

230
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,960
 So couple suicides a lot of violence. These are 26 cases now. Obviously. I could say

231
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,360
 26 of anything and the read off the worst of them and you go. Oh man, that sounds dangerous

232
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,680
 But it's it's it's quite sad. There was the funny one of

233
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
 There would I think I skipped it

234
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,760
 But where was that funny one that I kept laughing at?

235
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,360
 Confronting colleagues at work overturning furniture. So that kind of reminded me the office

236
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:45,000
 but anyway, so what we're talking about here is chantrix now chantrix is a very successful

237
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,680
 smoking cessation drug and

238
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:55,080
 The topic on the conspiracy iceberg and the topic that Wesley suggested was chantrix psychosis. So this is the theory

239
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
 there's a lot of

240
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,400
 Debate on what's going on with this chantrix is a drug that helps you to stop smoking. It is the most successful

241
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,620
 Thing that you can use to quit stop smoking is chantrix

242
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,240
 FDA did a study on it to see if it was healthy

243
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,440
 They originally said yeah, it's totally fine when they're steady. It was a fairly small sample group and

244
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:29,160
 The only listed side effects that put you in the hospital other people though kept steady in the drug over the years and

245
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,960
 Said depression doesn't that like you can have severe depression and not put you in the hospital

246
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,000
 You can overturn furniture at your workplace and it won't put you in the hospital

247
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,160
 So they didn't think that was a correct

248
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:50,680
 Assessment for the FDA other people looked into it and they've said that out of all of the anti-smoking options

249
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,480
 Chantrix raises your risk of suicide by eight eight times

250
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,120
 it octuples

251
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,040
 Your chances of killing yourself versus the patch or nicotine gum or any other

252
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:12,480
 Stop smoking drug or method. There was a study that was done saying no no no no the risk of killing yourself is

253
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,780
 Actually the same as a placebo that study was sponsored by Pfizer the makers of chantrix

254
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,720
 It also raises the risk of heart attacks and seizures so other than having like this

255
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,320
 Basically psychosis delusions possible suicide killing yourself and stuff like that

256
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:37,440
 People still use it now at a certain point the FDA said you know what we're gonna put a what we call a black box warning on this product

257
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,880
 And it's only on products that have like super severe side effects

258
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,120
 So they're like yes. Yes, this is a really good way to quit

259
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,040
 But we need to put like basically like you know, they have a black box warning on nicotine say and this can cause mouth cancer

260
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,920
 This can cause lung cancer, whatever but in 2016

261
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:05,280
 This is super rare for the FDA to do in 2016. They removed the black box warning from chantrix

262
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:12,400
 And they said listen the risk this is their quote risk of serious side effects on mood behavior and thinking is

263
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,240
 lower than previously suspected

264
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
 5 million people take chantrix

265
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,680
 And I know I'm just reading off a bunch of facts here, but we're gonna get into some interesting

266
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,160
 I think that's all interesting but 5 million people take chantrix and as far as we know

267
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,600
 Reportedly there's been 400 cases of suicidal thoughts and 30 people have killed themselves

268
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,960
 So the FDA has said we it's that the yes

269
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,400
 It can do that

270
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,040
 But if 5 million people take it and we have such a small amount of people just thinking about suicide and even small amount of people

271
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:52,000
 Doing it. We're gonna take off the black box warning. So a couple years ago probably like five or six years ago

272
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,040
 I was depressed. It was funny because I was more of like a mix between anxiety and depression and

273
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,040
 It got to the point where I was like, you know, because I was moved up here. I didn't have any friends

274
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,180
 I was new in town and stuff like that and I'd kind of been battling with

275
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,600
 Depression for a while, but not just I didn't I'm a laze. I guess would it be a big term for it?

276
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,960
 I remember going to the doctor and I was like, yeah, you know, I just get anxiety a lot and stuff like that

277
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,000
 They said if you ever thought about taking anything for it and I go well, I guess it wouldn't hurt

278
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,340
 I had it and I don't remember what they put me on I was either

279
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,400
 Prozac or a smaller version of Prozac

280
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,480
 Because he was like a half version or something like that was like an off something

281
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,280
 Because he's like you're not to pry you're not gonna hurt yourself or anything. I'm like no no

282
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
 I just feel like

283
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
 I just feel like

284
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:51,360
 Empty it's not like a scary depression. I just felt off and a lot of it had to do so funny cuz he was talking and I go

285
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,600
 He goes, what are you depressed a lot about? I'm like, I'm depressed a lot about money

286
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,480
 But you know taking a pills not gonna help, you know, paying my rent

287
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,360
 He kind of laughed but what it was was I was having normal stressors

288
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,160
 But I just was not really dealing with them. Well, I just kind of was ignoring everything

289
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:13,600
 I guess or or I let little things really bug me and it only lasted a couple of months

290
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,160
 But he's like, you know, maybe we should try taking this stuff

291
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,600
 Maybe we'll see what see what you do with this stuff and it's so bizarre. It's super bizarre

292
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:29,440
 I took it and you deaf your brain chemistry definitely changes now some people

293
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,160
 Definitely need to be taking anti depressants

294
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,540
 Absolutely like they have a chemical imbalance. I didn't have a chemical imbalance. I was just having depression through life stressors

295
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,040
 But I could tell that my brain chemistry was changing

296
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:53,120
 I live alone at this point for the majority of my life and one of the benefits of living alone is you're constantly talking to yourself

297
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,480
 You're very introspective as long as you don't have to television on all day long

298
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,000
 You're playing video games all day long. You're constantly

299
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,240
 Dialoguing with yourself your brain is basically working. You're very just introspective

300
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:15,280
 And so I know who I am and I know how my brain works and how my thought processes are and things like that

301
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,560
 So for the first time in my life, I

302
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,560
 Felt something it was so bizarre. I remember talking to the doctor. I told everyone this story

303
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,400
 It was so bizarre because I'm so aware of who I am as a person as an entity

304
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
 That once I could tell

305
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:40,480
 Within a few days that this thing in there was basically changing my brain chemistry felt really weird

306
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,560
 Felt super bizarre

307
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,340
 It would be like if you kept coming home to your house and every day

308
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,560
 Little things were moved and I'm not talking to your car keys

309
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,480
 But you come home and your television is in the corner of your room and you're like watching your room get rearranged

310
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,440
 Over the course of time. That's what it felt like and the dreams were

311
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,160
 insane

312
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,600
 Absolutely insane

313
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,560
 I'm not I hate hearing people's dreams, so I'm not gonna tell you about them

314
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,040
 But I remember one dream I woke up and

315
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,240
 I was a hundred percent sure that my parents had killed my stepsister

316
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,040
 I woke up and I was a hundred percent sure that I helped cover up the murder of my stepsister

317
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,560
 And it took me a half hour wide awake

318
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,520
 To realize that that never happened

319
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,760
 But I was a hundred percent sure that that had happened. It was bizarre

320
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,160
 It was that that would be considered a delusional thought. I remember just waking up and being like, oh my god

321
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,640
 What if I ever get found out?

322
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,160
 And then I had to sit and I had to think no no you saw joy

323
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,480
 You you saw her a couple years ago. She didn't get murdered when she was a teenager

324
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 To step dad and your mom didn't do it

325
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,480
 Super bizarre and here's the thing if you don't have

326
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,920
 a strong sense of self. I think

327
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:10,720
 Drugs that mess with your brain can be absolutely devastating and I think that's why they affect people under 18 even more

328
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,160
 When we look at people who do you know, they say don't take

329
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,720
 Prozac or any of this stuff and that's what chantrix is chantrix. I'm not necessarily isn't necessarily an antidepressant

330
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,520
 But it does change your brain chemistry

331
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,480
 And the benefit is to quit smoking and I'll get into that in a second

332
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,240
 But when you take this and again if you're if you're if you need it absolutely take it

333
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,200
 I am not saying in any way shape or form do not take this stuff

334
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,240
 Because after I got over the two or three weeks and all of those cases that I read to you

335
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,680
 Most of them happened. The longest one that happened

336
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,560
 Was 42 days after starting the chantrix most of them happened within the first week

337
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,800
 To the first month so very very short incubation time

338
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,600
 If you need to take it definitely take it

339
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,000
 Just be prepared for that wacky wacky wild ride in the beginning

340
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,040
 And then you know that I have a good doctor they warned me about all that stuff and dreams are great

341
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,320
 I ended up though eventually saying you know, I don't need this stuff

342
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,680
 I took it for probably like five or six months and I go, you know what?

343
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,200
 I'm just gonna work out and that worked for me. I said, I think the fact is that I moved up here

344
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
 I am not active. I'm not walking everywhere like I used to

345
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:34,800
 Don't have any friends. I you know just I don't have any friends and I'm dealing with money problems and stuff like that

346
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,280
 I'm just gonna work out more and I remember I saw my doctor the grocery store and he goes, how you doing?

347
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,040
 And I was like, well, you know, I quit taking that medicine you gave me is like really I go

348
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,240
 Yeah, I go, you know, I'm just gonna work out and he goes you can do that but

349
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,200
 You have to treat your working out as your medicine. He goes do it every day

350
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,520
 Take a treat it like taking a pill because he knew he was also on the thing that he goes

351
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,240
 I really don't think you need this but we'll try it

352
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,080
 We'll see what happens. So yeah, he was like, yeah, I totally agree. You probably didn't need that stuff

353
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,680
 But you got to work out every day, dude

354
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:13,200
 Because you are you are struggling with with some stuff and I'm sharing that story with you guys in case you guys ever

355
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,920
 You know experience this or our experience in this about, you know, my personal journey with it

356
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,760
 But anyways, it's also more into this chantrix thing. You take this stuff. It changes your brain chemistry

357
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,320
 They say the benefit of stopping smoking outweighs the possibility of you killing yourself

358
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,960
 And when you look at the wrong numbers, that's true

359
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,040
 5 million people taking it 30 people killed themselves now

360
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,440
 They had the four what was it four or 500 people who had suicidal thoughts

361
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,880
 It's I don't see in that with the violent outburst or the yelling at your loved ones and stuff like that

362
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,560
 So it's they're mostly just looking at the suit the FDA and all that's looking at the suicide stuff

363
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,120
 But if you take that out and we start looking at violent outbursts and things like that

364
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,720
 Is it really worth it to quit smoking? The FDA says yes smoking is so terrible

365
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,160
 Nicotine is so terrible, which I think nicotine is fine

366
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,840
 But you know smoking and chewing and all that stuff's unhealthy, but it's so terrible

367
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,840
 It's worth taking this drug that at the very least maybe just stop smoking

368
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,080
 Or you start punching people overturning furniture or you might kill yourself

369
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,880
 Notably absent in all of this stuff. They remove the black box warning

370
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,240
 They have these steadies these dueling steadies that are coming out

371
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,240
 You cannot take it as of tooth that this really should be the end of this argument really

372
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,480
 And they should put that black box back on it and say listen

373
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,520
 Okay, maybe you won't kill yourself, but it can make you a little crazy

374
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,520
 Maybe you should try every they don't give you lap band surgery right away

375
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,400
 They want you to try all sorts of different diets before they cut you open

376
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,920
 And again that works for some people have to have that some people have to have that

377
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,800
 But they should do the same thing with chantrix. I have no problem the drugs out there people can take it

378
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,840
 But there you go. You should exhaust everything possible before you take this

379
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,720
 as of 2008

380
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,120
 This should be the end of it the FAA the federal aviation administration

381
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,680
 Does not allow pilots to use chantrix at all

382
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,880
 If you are flying a plane

383
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,440
 You cannot take this drug that should be the level of how dangerous this can be

384
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,160
 May not make you kill yourself, but it may make you incredibly angry

385
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,920
 Or depressed or sobbing. I don't want to pilot overturning furniture

386
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,680
 It really should just be the end of it, but

387
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,840
 They took the black box warning off the chantrix

388
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,440
 People are taking it every day, and I'm glad that it works for most people

389
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,280
 But before you decide to take any sort of drug that does affect your brain chemistry

390
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,640
 My advice to you would be

391
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
 How well do you know yourself?

392
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,320
 So when those intrusive thoughts those alien thoughts come into your head

393
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,960
 Can you deal with them?

394
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,960
 Or will they sneak in and trick you into thinking they are part of you?

395
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,480
 How well do you know yourself?

396
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:17,360
