1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
 Put down those hush puppies.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,340
 Is it possible that Long John Silver's, the restaurant, not the fictional character, is

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,420
 possible that the fish food restaurant Long John Silver's is actually a front for a nefarious

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,300
 drug smuggling scheme?

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,280
 And then we travel to Ulysses, Kansas, to meet a man who is just having some quality

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,620
 time at home with his family.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,620
 Everything was going A-OK until an alien fugitive broke into his house today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:43,620
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,620
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,620
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,620
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,820
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing, wrestling bears, wrestling

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,180
 bears, trying to get away from those hungry crocodiles.

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,060
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our newest Patreon supporters.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,180
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command, give it up for O'Neal.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,180
 Everyone give a round of applause, salute.

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,180
 Do it at the same time.

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,180
 It is possible.

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,540
 O'Neal, you're going to be our captain or pilot of this episode.

20
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,740
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,780
 Just help get the word out about the show.

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,820
 Tell your friends, tell your family, talk about it online.

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,260
 That also really, really helps to show out a lot.

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,020
 O'Neal, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy and I hope you guys

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,620
 are hungry because we are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:35,420
 We are headed on out to a local Long John Silver's.

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,940
 O'Neal is driving the Jason Jalopy in all, where is the nearest Long John Silver's?

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,140
 How long has it been since you've actually seen one of these restaurants?

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,700
 But I think Long John Silver's is only an American restaurant and this is an international

30
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
 show.

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,300
 If you've been scratching your head ever since the intro, you're like, what in the world

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,940
 is a Long John Silver's?

33
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,340
 Long John Silver's is a semi-delicious restaurant.

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,180
 That's actually how it's described in Zagat's Guide.

35
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,180
 Semi-delicious.

36
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,020
 It is a fast food, seafood restaurant.

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,900
 And you would walk in, the place was very kind of nautical themed.

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,700
 You walk in and there was a bell that you were only supposed to, if you enjoyed your

39
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,140
 service on the way out, you ring a bell.

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,380
 Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling.

41
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:27,020
 You walk into this nautical themed restaurant and it's the seafood and it's known for having

42
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,820
 the driest fish somehow.

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,060
 They're able to take a critter from the ocean, which should be super moist.

44
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,100
 And the scientists are like, how can we extract each layer of water from this thing?

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,260
 We need it to be as dry as a desert.

46
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,660
 Their fish was always really dry, but you went there for their hush puppies.

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,620
 They had these delicious little corn ball rice, I don't even know what they made out

48
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,620
 of, a potato maybe?

49
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,620
 It didn't matter.

50
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,900
 They could have been made out of discarded vaccines.

51
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,020
 I would have eaten them, because they were so delicious.

52
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,500
 Hush puppies.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,380
 You'd go in there and order a number 400, it'd be like two pieces of cod and an octopus,

54
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,500
 or I don't know, the octopus just wandered in that day.

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,700
 They're like, that's not on the menu.

56
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,500
 It was a seafood restaurant, but it was a fast food restaurant.

57
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,700
 You took two things that people mildly enjoy and tolerate and combine them into one.

58
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,420
 I've been to quite a few Long John Silver's in my life, because you can only eat so much

59
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,420
 KFC.

60
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,580
 KFC is always bustling.

61
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,380
 McDonald's is always busy, Dairy Queen, stuff like that.

62
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,340
 They tend to be busy, but the one weird thing, when I say this, you're going to realize this

63
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,340
 is true.

64
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:47,100
 I, and I'm assuming you too, have never been inside a Long John Silver's that's busy.

65
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,340
 When you walk in, it is empty.

66
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,180
 It's like a match shooting.

67
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,740
 Took place the day before, and no one wants to go there, and you forgot to watch the news

68
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,340
 that day, but they're open for business anyways.

69
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,180
 You walk in, the kitchen staff is shocked.

70
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,140
 They're like, this is what we trained for boys.

71
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,020
 We finally got one of these customers in.

72
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,180
 You walk in, there's no one in there.

73
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,540
 Maybe there's another family, but it's never busy, so the bell doesn't ring.

74
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,020
 That actually is the crux of this conspiracy theory.

75
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,820
 It's very, very basic.

76
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,900
 How come Long John Silver's is never busy?

77
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,020
 I got to say this too.

78
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,540
 This story was recommended to me maybe about two months into doing the podcast, two or

79
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,140
 three months really early on, but I lost the name of the person who recommended it to me.

80
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,700
 If you are out there, young, if you're out there, you young Long John Silver's employee,

81
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,180
 thank you so much for recommending this.

82
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,700
 If you can shoot me the email or the YouTube comment or whatever showing me that you did

83
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,580
 it all, give you credit, but I don't remember who it was because it was so long ago I wasn't

84
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,620
 really keeping track that well.

85
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,540
 This is the crux of the conspiracy theory.

86
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,540
 We talk about this a lot.

87
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,060
 We talk about conspiracy theories that are observational.

88
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,500
 Someone goes, well, I can look the Earth.

89
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,140
 Earth is flat as far as I can see.

90
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,140
 Or the Earth is flat.

91
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,380
 That's an observational conspiracy theory.

92
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,380
 This one is the same thing.

93
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,860
 How come Long John Silver's, there's never anyone in them?

94
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,500
 It sounds inconsequential, but the conspiracy theory is, and I've actually seen this a couple

95
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,580
 places around the internet, and it's lasted a long time.

96
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,020
 Like I said, this was recommended to me like two years ago, and it's still around three

97
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,900
 years ago at this point.

98
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,980
 Long John Silver's is not really a fast food restaurant.

99
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,820
 I mean, that's what it appears to be, but it's actually a drug smuggling front.

100
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,180
 Specifically, it's a money laundering front.

101
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,180
 Allegedly.

102
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,940
 Right now, Captain Hook is banging on my door.

103
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,940
 They use pirates instead of lawyers.

104
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,620
 Allegedly, this is all alleged conspiracy caps fully on.

105
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,140
 Here's the idea.

106
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,900
 Back in 1969 is when Long John Silver's officially started.

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,180
 There was a couple different versions of it beforehand.

108
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,220
 Originally it was a roast beef shop, and then it was, sorry if you guys are really hungry

109
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,220
 this episode.

110
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,220
 People are like, you know what?

111
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,220
 I've learned not to eat.

112
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,460
 I've learned not to eat food during Dead Rabbit episodes.

113
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,180
 And then this one I'm just going to talk about, delicious hush puppies and crispy, crispy

114
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,180
 dry food.

115
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,700
 It started off as a roast beef restaurant, became a burger restaurant, became a seafood

116
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,820
 restaurant, but then it officially became Long John Silver's in 1969.

117
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,380
 This went on for a while, mostly franchises.

118
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,540
 Mostly franchises, so they sell the right to use the name and use the recipes and the

119
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,700
 ingredients and all that stuff.

120
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,020
 But it never really caught on in the American consciousness.

121
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,740
 It is a weird thing.

122
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,260
 Like seafood is something that I think most people enjoy occasionally.

123
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,220
 Is it something you can eat all the time?

124
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,060
 And McDonald's blew them out of the water with the Filet-O-Fish, because the McDonald's

125
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,220
 started selling the Filet-O-Fish, which is honestly pretty delicious.

126
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,660
 Like most of the fish caught on that show, The Deadliest Catch, you know the fishing

127
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,540
 show where these people are constantly dying, falling off the boat.

128
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,180
 A good amount of that fish is sold to McDonald's.

129
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,420
 It's high quality fish in their fish filet sandwiches.

130
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,660
 Long John Silver could not compete with McDonald's even in the fish market.

131
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,340
 And there was a study done.

132
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,140
 There was this study done about what's the worst food out there.

133
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,620
 What is the most dangerous food you could possibly eat at a fast food restaurant.

134
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,220
 And this was probably the first time a lot of people even remembered Long John Silver

135
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,220
 has existed.

136
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,060
 And you probably remember going there once or twice as a kid, because that weird kid had

137
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,580
 their birthday party there.

138
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,940
 He wanted to be a Navy captain.

139
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,860
 You're like, "I guess I'll go and eat a bunch of hush puppies."

140
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,300
 They were named in this article as the worst meal in America.

141
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,740
 It was called The Big Catch, The Big Catch Meal.

142
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,900
 And not because it wasn't delicious, but because it was the least healthy meal you

143
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,340
 could buy in America.

144
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,340
 This was how it worked.

145
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,420
 It had 33 grams of trans fats in the meal.

146
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,900
 When I read that, I go, "That's not too bad, right?

147
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,060
 I don't know anything about how many...

148
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,060
 Right now, a bunch of people are throwing up.

149
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,660
 Really, Jason, you really didn't know that 33 grams was bad?

150
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,860
 Well, I don't think 33 grams of anything could be that harmful.

151
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,060
 A gram is super tiny.

152
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:16,180
 But 33 grams of trans fats in this one meal, it was called, quote, "The Mount Everest of

153
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,980
 trans fat."

154
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,220
 And here's why.

155
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:29,500
 A Big Mac, an entire Big Mac, so a Big Mac, by comparison, has 1.3 grams of trans fats.

156
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:38,900
 The Big Catch Meal had two weeks of the daily maximum of trans fats in one meal.

157
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,660
 Which I would say is very efficient.

158
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,740
 You'd get two weeks worth of trans fats.

159
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,740
 You should really have any.

160
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,860
 This way you could get two weeks if you wanted them.

161
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,180
 So they were starting to fall apart because now I'm just talking about dietary stuff in

162
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,740
 the history of Long John Silver's.

163
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,860
 Let me get back to the thing.

164
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,540
 This is a conspiracy theory.

165
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,660
 Long John Silver's, it's such a bizarre restaurant.

166
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,540
 It's never busy.

167
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,500
 And around the same time in 1969, there was this guy.

168
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,540
 He was a moonshiner in the late 60s, decided to switch to marijuana.

169
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,100
 His name was Johnny Boone.

170
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,700
 And he started this thing called the Cornbread Mafia.

171
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
 This part's true.

172
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,700
 We know this part is true.

173
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,220
 There was this moonshiner who started to really move a lot of marijuana through the south,

174
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,260
 through like the Midwest area.

175
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,780
 They did go by the name of the Cornbread Mafia.

176
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:35,220
 The idea is that he, because he started off near the location of the original Long John

177
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,660
 Silver's, he got with the owner of Long John Silver's and said, "Listen, you have a really

178
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,340
 bad business idea.

179
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,220
 This isn't going to take off, but I need a way to launder my money.

180
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,300
 Let's work together.

181
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,980
 Let's make your dream happen and let's turn my dirty money into clean money by running

182
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,540
 it through these restaurants."

183
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,940
 And that is what kept them going for so long.

184
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,260
 Even though no one ever ate there, even though every time you walked into a Long John Silver's,

185
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,420
 and I've been into a lot of them, at most there's one other family.

186
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,180
 At most a family of four.

187
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,980
 Sometimes it was just me walking into the Long John Silver's.

188
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,980
 Very, very rare.

189
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,900
 It's crowded as any other fast food restaurant.

190
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:23,860
 The idea was they were able to do that because they had drug money propping them up.

191
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,740
 Allegedly, allegedly, as Blackbeard is getting ready to fire cannons onto my house.

192
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,500
 Allegedly, that is how they were able to prop up for so long.

193
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,260
 So the question is why now are they starting to fail?

194
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,780
 Because it is really hard to find them.

195
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,340
 The closest one to me is like an hour drive.

196
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,420
 And it's in Portland.

197
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,300
 It's in a big city.

198
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,940
 Because marijuana is becoming illegal.

199
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,500
 Or it's just stuff that cops are like, "Ah, shouldn't have this marijuana on you.

200
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,980
 We will arrest you for all this cocaine and these drugs and this body in the trunk."

201
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,900
 But we'll just dismiss the marijuana charges.

202
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,060
 It's not such a big deal anymore.

203
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,820
 And so because the marijuana money is not propping up Long John Silver's, that they're

204
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,860
 starting to shut down because they can't rely on their own business.

205
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,940
 It's an interesting conspiracy theory.

206
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,740
 And one part of it is true.

207
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,580
 The Cornbread Mafia did actually exist.

208
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,460
 They were broken apart.

209
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,660
 And they are known in crime circles.

210
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,660
 I had never heard of the Cornbread Mafia before reading about the Long John Silver conspiracy

211
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,660
 theory.

212
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,660
 But they are pretty well known in criminal circles.

213
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,020
 Because they were just a bunch of dudes who were moonshiders who switched to marijuana.

214
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:38,220
 In 1987, there was one bust that netted the feds 47 tons of marijuana.

215
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,500
 And they arrested a bunch of people, including Johnny, a ton of his lieutenants, a ton of

216
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,380
 his street level dealers.

217
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,460
 They all get caught.

218
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,180
 And the police are talking to them from the top to the bottom and say, "Listen, this

219
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,900
 is very, very common in drug cases.

220
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,460
 Listen, what you did was relatively minor.

221
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,620
 If you rat out the person above you, we'll give you an easy deal."

222
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,900
 Not a single, not a single member of the Cornbread Mafia talked.

223
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
 None of them.

224
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,220
 They arrested dozens of people and the prosecutors are leaning on them and they're facing anything

225
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,700
 from five years to 10 years, whatever.

226
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,300
 They arrested a total of 70 people, spread out across several states.

227
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,500
 70 people.

228
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,020
 They were all offered this, "Rat on the person above you, we'll give you a lesser deal."

229
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,380
 Not a single person out of that 70 ratted someone else out.

230
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,300
 Interesting story, is it true?

231
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
 Probably not.

232
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,900
 That's the thing with businesses.

233
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,660
 That's the thing with capitalism.

234
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
 You give it your best.

235
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,740
 You shoot your shot and sometimes it catches on and it becomes McDonald's and sometimes

236
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,740
 it doesn't.

237
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,060
 It's mildly successful.

238
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,140
 It becomes something like a Quiznos.

239
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,060
 I don't know if they're still around.

240
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,900
 That might not be an idea of success or Long John Silver's.

241
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,660
 I mean, they're still around.

242
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,900
 His dream, the people who have found this, their dream is still there to have a fast

243
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,980
 food seafood restaurant, but it's definitely not an A-list tier restaurant.

244
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,900
 Arby's is more popular than Long John Silver's.

245
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,420
 And if you ever have a business and Arby's is more popular than your business, then I

246
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,740
 think it's easy to say you took the L in that business.

247
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,500
 But again, an interesting conspiracy theory.

248
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,420
 People do prop up businesses like this.

249
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,820
 This type of thing does happen.

250
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,180
 Did it happen with Long John Silver's?

251
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,660
 That's what some weirdo on the internet said and that is what I just repeated.

252
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,940
 So as I am slowly getting encircled by pirates, they're getting ready to kill me with their

253
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
 cannons.

254
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,940
 I either cease and desist lawsuits, O'Neill, call in that carpenter and rescue your dear

255
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,180
 podcaster.

256
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,100
 We are leaving behind this Long John Silver's.

257
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,220
 Some kids are getting ready to kill me.

258
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,660
 They're getting ready to stab me with the swords.

259
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
 I'm like, "Guys, hold on.

260
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,020
 I'm waiting for my order of hush puppies.

261
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,300
 Um, num, num, num, num.

262
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,500
 Get us out of here, O'Neill.

263
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,140
 We are leaving behind Long John Silver's.

264
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,980
 We are headed all the way out to Ulysses, Kansas.

265
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,580
 Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,

314
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:44,420
 The leader makes a motion, a simple motion with his hand, and two of the goons walk over, pick up the stranger's body, and disappear back into the yellow circle of light on the wall.

315
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:57,420
 The leader then walks up to Tony and stares at him. He actually has to reach up and grab Tony's face and manipulate it so they can look eye to eye.

316
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:06,420
 The analysis is removed when the leader is moving him, but Tony can still not move himself.

317
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:20,420
 Something is said telepathically between the leader and Tony, and to this day Tony can't remember what was said, but he knows there was some sort of communication.

318
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:38,420
 Tony could sense just hatred, anger coming from this alien. The gray-skinned leader walks towards the bathroom door, and then turns around and stares at Tony for another 20 seconds.

319
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:50,420
 Then he also disappears into the yellow circle of light on the wall, as does his tall alien bodyguard.

320
00:26:50,420 --> 00:27:03,420
 Tony stands there paralyzed for another hour, even after all of the alien activity is left. He stands there in his bedroom, unable to move.

321
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:15,420
 Finally, when he regains his ability to not be paralyzed when he's able to walk around, he discovers that his entire family slept through the whole encounter.

322
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:25,420
 I got that story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com. They got it, which is one of my favorite websites. I reference them all the time, and you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't go there at least once.

323
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:41,420
 There's just so much good stuff on there. They got it from Joyce Murphy from a book she wrote called Beyond Boundaries, which I'm-- if this is the level of stuff in that book, I definitely want to check that out.

324
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,420
 It's an interesting story. I wish we had a little more information like dates and times. We just have vague stuff like night.

325
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:58,420
 I don't know if he was married and someone else was in the bed, and there's this corpse falling on the bed and didn't wake them up. I don't know. We don't know. A lot of factors. How many people were there?

326
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:07,420
 We actually don't know if there's anyone else in the house until the very ending when the story goes, no one else woke up. But first I thought it was just him in the house.

327
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:18,420
 There's some more details I would like to know about the story, but overall just the essence of it. It's something we haven't really come across in UFO lore. It's definitely not something we've covered on this show.

328
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:35,420
 This is-- this sounds like a sci-fi movie or horror movie. The Alien Fugitive. I mean, there have been movies about this. Critters-- Critters 2, Critters 3. I think there's five of them now. I've watched them all.

329
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:50,420
 Movies with the Alien Fugitive. Earth Girls are easy. I think they were on the run. I'm just going to list Alien Fugitive movies that man who fell to Earth. The point is, is that this sounds very sci-fi-ish, and it's one of those stories that I'm actually surprised we don't hear more of.

330
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:58,420
 It would be easy to fake, right? A lot of these UFO stories, including this one, could be fake. It could be a dream. It could be a mistaken thing, and we always got to accept that's a possibility.

331
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:14,420
 But I'm surprised we-- this is so cool. You know what I mean? You're sitting there at home, and all of a sudden, He-Man and Tila and Grim Lore show up and they're running through your house and they're like, "Hey, we need your help. Skeletor's Army is going to invade. Can you help us?"

332
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:25,420
 Yeah, sure. Let me get this little magical flute down to the synthesizer store, and you go on a crazy adventure with these awesome dudes, and then you make out with Tila, and then they all go back to Eternia.

333
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:33,420
 Isn't that everyone's dream, right? To be sucked into these whirlwind cosmic events?

334
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:41,420
 It'd be pretty dope. I'm surprised there's not more stories like this, even made up ones.

335
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:51,420
 Fascinating stuff. If I'm going to be in an alien encounter, aliens coming down being like, "We have the cure to all your diseases. Here's a way so wheat can feed all humans."

336
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:59,420
 I'm like, "Oh, boy. I'm dying from deadly diseases, and I'm super hungry." I'm like, "Oh, do you have hush puppies?" Then, beat it. Aliens.

337
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:08,420
 Aliens coming down and doing stuff like that are like-- I'm more of an action-based alien guy. I'm always talking about wanting to fight reptilians in some gladiator combat or something like that.

338
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:14,420
 This would be dope. It sucks that this Tony guy was paralyzed, because maybe he could have fought.

339
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:23,420
 But I guess I'm really focusing on the story of the outsider, because that's who we are.

340
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:29,420
 But the story just really is just so-- I could talk about this story forever. I think it's super, super fascinating.

341
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,420
 One, we have the idea of an alien fugitive outrunning these guys. What's the backstory to that?

342
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:40,420
 Was he a human who was captured? Because he was the most human. Everyone else was gray. Everyone else was aliens.

343
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:47,420
 They had no noses and slits for mouths. The leader had a symbol of a-- like a military symbol on his uniform.

344
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:55,420
 It was described as a chevron-- the chevron symbol with a snake with wings on it as well.

345
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:02,420
 So, like, did he escape from some sort? Was he abducted? And was he escaping? Was he an alien clone?

346
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:09,420
 I mean, we could just start coming up with stuff. There's so many questions like, "Why was he escaping? Was he a human that was abducted trying to escape?"

347
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:16,420
 Why was he wearing those clothes that were kind of similar to the clothes they were wearing? Was he some sort of spy trying to break free?

348
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:27,420
 Was he a prisoner? Was he a shapeshifter? Were them killing him a mercy? Like, was this guy going to be-- was this guy basically going to be a he-man or a critter?

349
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:37,420
 Was he here to have their fun adventures on Earth and fight against the aliens? Or was he going to kill humans in the guise of humans, and these aliens had to come and protect us?

350
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:48,420
 They may have told Tony telepathically, "Hey, listen, I know this is disgusting, and we'll buy you new bed linens," because his face got blown up on it, but here's why we did that.

351
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:57,420
 So we have that whole thing. Why was this happening, these aliens coming down into this guy's room? We have the scare-- like, you have the horror aspect of it.

352
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:07,420
 Just being frozen and seeing something outside and then hearing something come into your house. If that alone, if that was the end of the encounter, that alone would be a really cool story.

353
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:18,420
 Even if they never were able to find the source of the noise, the guy's paralyzed and he hears someone walking through his house very clearly room to room, and then he hears it, "Leave out the back door," and the paralysis ends.

354
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:25,420
 That alone would have been a really unsettling story, because you would have thought we would have covered that. That would have been cool and weird enough for this podcast alone.

355
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:35,420
 What was in his house? What was it looking for? There's a lot of that. That alone is cool, but we also have the element of the guy coming in, "Help me, help me," and then getting shot.

356
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:50,420
 It's just very, very really cool sci-fi story, which we don't-- it's odd we don't see a lot of in UFOology. A lot of it is really basic stuff.

357
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:59,420
 So it's neat when we can get not only an action-packed story, but an action-packed story that hits on science fiction tropes.

358
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:05,420
 Now yesterday's episode was so funny because I was talking about how we need to pay attention to the boring UFO stuff as well, and we do.

359
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:15,420
 I'm not saying stuff has to be exciting. I'm just saying it is fun when we get these stories, and when you get them, you realize how rare they are, because if people make stories up--

360
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:25,420
 I'm surprised more people-- and people do make stories up. I'm surprised we don't find more stories where they're like, "Yeah, and then I got two grays and headlocks, and I bonked their heads together like coconuts,"

361
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:33,420
 and then I was like, "Bang in some hot space reptilian," and she's like, "Call me later," and you're like, "Sure," and then you're like, "Grip an ever space number as you're flying back to Earth."

362
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,420
 I'm surprised more people don't do that.

363
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:48,420
 So it's a great story, and it's a story that gives me hope, even though this dude got shot in the face. I don't want to be that guy, right? I don't want to be that guy.

364
00:33:48,420 --> 00:34:01,420
 I want to be the guy who gets wrapped up in the whirlwind adventure. I wish if aliens are going to come to my house and they go, "Jason, we need your help. We need all your personal information.

365
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:09,420
 We're going to attach this device to your chest, and then we're going to take you somewhere," and I go, "Where?" And they go, "Don't ask questions."

366
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:15,420
 They paralyze me. They're like, "Shh." They're going to take you somewhere. You're going to go on an awesome adventure, Jason."

367
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:22,420
 That's when I realize these aliens. They have zippers. They have zippers on their skin, but I'm still like, "Oh, no, it's totally awesome.

368
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:27,420
 Aliens are taking me on an adventure," and they're like, "Get in our shuttle."

369
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:33,420
 And it's like a Subaru outside. I'm like, "Huh? This is kind of weird." They're like, "Yeah, we call it a shuttle." They drive me to the woods.

370
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:42,420
 The next thing I know, I'm in some shack, and they're like, "This is hologram. You're actually on a really advanced spaceship, but if we showed you that, you would reveal our secrets."

371
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:54,420
 I don't want to go on that adventure. That's probably what's going to happen. I'm probably going to get abducted by a bunch of weirdos, and I'm going to thank their aliens just because apparently I suffered a head injury before they showed up.

372
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:11,420
 But it would be cool for this to happen. It would be cool to get wrapped up in a story of interdimensional, intergalactic intrigue, and you go on this adventure, and then you are able to help the aliens fight against even more evil aliens.

373
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:27,420
 You're able to stop an earth invasion, and maybe meet some hot--it always has to be some sort of sex when I'm involved with aliens. You're meeting some hot, sexy, really curvy, gray alien, and she's like, "Ooh, Jason."

374
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:37,420
 And then you're like, "I've done it. I've saved the earth and your planet as well, and maybe we can come to some understanding." And they're like, "You're right. Maybe we're not so different all along."

375
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:45,420
 Plus, you have all these alien babies. You banged half our population. We don't know why you did that. You have to pay child support.

376
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:56,420
 And then I go, "Uh..." Then I escape. I escape because I'm a deadbeat dad. And as I'm flying away in my spaceship, I'm like, "Whoo!"

 Those kids will learn to love. Those kids will be just fine without their humanoid dad. As I'm flying away in my spaceship, I noticed the authorities are chasing me, and I was like, "Oh, man, I better wear disguise."

378
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:14,420
 They know these clothes, and then I go, "That's weird. There's a jumpsuit in the back of this space shuttle." And it's bluish gray, but you know, it's not really my colors.

379
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:21,420
 I'm more of a winter, but I put on the bluish gray, and I put on some black boots, and I'm flying back to earth, and the aliens are getting closer and closer.

380
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:29,420
 And I start to think, "Uh-oh, if they catch me, I'm going to be liable. I don't have that many space credits." And I have like a hundred little alien babies out there.

381
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:48,420
 I didn't know that they laid eggs by the dozens. And so I'm getting closer and closer to earth, and I think, "Well, at least when I get to earth, maybe I'll find sanctuary there. Maybe someone can help me. Maybe, just maybe, I can get away with being the first interplanetary absentee father."

382
00:36:48,420 --> 00:37:02,420
 But we all know this story ends with a man getting shot in the face, and you're like, "That guy's space family. That guy's space family is going to listen to this episode."

383
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:09,420
 And they're like, "He wasn't a deadbeat dad? But this story's totally true that happened to our uncle Jimmy. That guy was like the best dad."

384
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:17,420
 And they're going to sue me for space libel, because I am assuming that anyone who gets shot in the face by aliens owes child support.

385
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,420
 Maybe. In the world of the paranormal, you can never tell.
